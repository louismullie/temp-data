## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the work involved when a gas in a 2.0-liter container at 2.4 atmospheres pressure is allowed to expand against a constant external pressure of 0.80 atmosphere. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct thermodynamic formula for expansion work against a constant external pressure. Then, I should verify the sign convention for work done by the system versus work done on the system. Next, I will plug in the given values and compute the result. Finally, I should double-check the units and match the answer to the provided choices, explaining why the alternatives are incorrect.

> Let me first confirm the formula. For expansion against a constant external pressure, the work done by the gas is given by W = −Pexternal × ΔV, where ΔV is the change in volume and the negative sign reflects that the system does work on the surroundings, so energy leaves the system. This is a standard expression for irreversible expansion work and is consistent with the pressure–volume work framework used in physics and engineering contexts, including descriptions of energy and work in compressible systems and ventilation mechanics that model pressure–volume relationships.

> Wait, let me verify the sign convention so I don't misstate the result. In thermodynamics, when the gas expands, it pushes against the external pressure and therefore does positive work on the surroundings, which means the work done by the system is positive, and consequently the work done on the system (the thermodynamic work) is negative. Thus, the correct expression to report the work "involved" from the system's perspective is W = −Pexternal × ΔV, which will yield a negative value for expansion, indicating energy leaving the system.

> I need to check the change in volume. The gas starts at 2.0 L and expands until its internal pressure matches the external pressure of 0.80 atm. Assuming ideal behavior and isothermal conditions, the final volume will be proportional to the inverse of the pressure ratio, so Vfinal ≈ Vinitial × (Pinitial/Pfinal) = 2.0 L × (2.4 atm/0.80 atm) = 6.0 L. Therefore, ΔV = Vfinal − Vinitial = 6.0 L − 2.0 L = 4.0 L. Hold on, I should verify that assumption: the problem does not specify temperature or heat exchange, but for a simple work calculation against a constant external pressure, the key is the volume change; if we were asked for internal energy or heat, we would need more information, but here the work formula depends only on Pexternal and ΔV, so the isothermal assumption is acceptable for computing ΔV and does not change the work result.

> Now I will plug in the numbers. W = −Pexternal × ΔV = −0.80 atm × 4.0 L = −3.2 L·atm. I should confirm the units: pressure in atmospheres times volume in liters gives liter-atmospheres, which is a valid unit of energy, and the negative sign correctly indicates work done by the system during expansion. This matches option A, −3.2 L·atm.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the distractors to ensure I'm not missing a nuance. Option B, −9.62 L·atm, looks like someone might have multiplied the initial pressure by the initial volume (2.4 atm × 2.0 L = 4.8 L·atm) and then added the external pressure contribution incorrectly, which is a mistake. Option C, −4.8 L·atm, is simply the product of the initial pressure and the initial volume and does not represent the work of expansion against a constant external pressure. Option D, +14.4 L·atm, is positive and far too large, suggesting a fundamental error in sign or in calculating the volume change. None of these alternatives correctly apply W = −Pexternal × ΔV, so they should be excluded.

> Final answer: The work involved is −3.2 L·atm, which corresponds to choice A. This reflects that the gas does 3.2 L·atm of work on the surroundings, so the system's energy decreases by that amount during the expansion.

---

The work done by the gas during expansion is **−3.2 L·atm** (Option A). This is calculated using the formula for work against a constant external pressure: W = −Pexternal × ΔV, where Pexternal = 0.80 atm and ΔV = 4.0 L (from 2.0 L to 6.0 L). The negative sign indicates work done by the system, and the result matches Option A.

---

## Calculation of work done

The work done by a gas expanding against a constant external pressure is given by:

W = −Pexternal × ΔV

Where:

- (W) is the work done by the gas.
- Pexternal is the constant external pressure against which the gas expands.
- ΔV is the change in volume of the gas.

Given:

- Initial volume, (Vᵢ = 2.0 L)
- Initial pressure, (Pᵢ = 2.4 atm)
- External pressure, (Pexternal = 0.80 atm)

Assuming the gas expands until its internal pressure equals the external pressure, the final volume (V_f) can be calculated using Boyle's Law (assuming constant temperature and ideal gas behavior):

Pᵢ Vᵢ = P_f V_f

2.4 atm × 2.0 L = 0.80 atm × V_f

V_f = [2.4 × 2.0/0.80] = 6.0 L

Thus, the change in volume is:

ΔV = V_f − Vᵢ = 6.0 L − 2.0 L = 4.0 L

Now, substituting the values into the work formula:

W = −Pexternal × ΔV = −0.80 atm × 4.0 L = −3.2 L·atm

---

## Interpretation of the result

The negative sign indicates that the gas is doing work on the surroundings (i.e. energy is leaving the system). The magnitude of the work done is **3.2 L·atm**, which corresponds to Option A.

---

## Verification of assumptions

- **Constant temperature**: The problem does not specify temperature changes, so we assumed isothermal expansion, which is reasonable for a general chemistry context.
- **Ideal gas behavior**: We assumed ideal gas behavior, which is acceptable for typical conditions unless stated otherwise.
- **Reversible vs. irreversible process**: The calculation assumes irreversible expansion against a constant external pressure, which is the standard approach for this type of problem.

---

## Conclusion

The work involved in the expansion of the gas is **−3.2 L·atm**, which corresponds to Option A. This result is derived from the formula for work done against a constant external pressure, considering the change in volume of the gas.

### Bench experiments comparing simulated inspiratory effort when breathing helium-oxygen mixtures to that during positive pressure support with air [^ee56fabb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Positive pressure support was supplied to the breathing chamber using an ICU ventilator operated in NIV mode. While leaks at patient interfaces clearly influence ventilator performance during NIV, these particular experiments were performed under the ideal condition of no leak, in order to eliminate effects of ventilator-specific leak compensation algorithms and patient-ventilator asynchrony to focus instead on the more fundamental influence of gas properties on lung mechanics.

The mechanical work spent during inhalation consists of an elastic component required to expand the lung and chest wall, and a resistive component required to move gas through the airways. Additional components of work resulting from non-elastic deformation of tissues are comparably small. In the present experiments, elastic work was performed as the breathing chamber of the test lung expanded against the force of its spring, the position of which was adjusted in order to simulate varying levels of compliance. Resistive work was associated with the passage of gas through the airway resistors. Such resistors are used to represent pressure losses at varying flow rates through the complex network of airways making up the respiratory tract. The pressure loss across the parabolic resistors predominantly used in this study is dominated by inertial effects, so that it varies with gas density and with the square of gas velocity. In contrast, the nearly linear resistance presented by the breathing filters (Figure 2a) arises mainly due to effects of gas viscosity during passage through the porous filter medium, with gas density playing only a minor role due to the persistence of small inertial effects. In general, parabolic resistors may be thought to represent pressure losses that arise from obstructions occurring in upper airways and the larger airways of the lung, where pressure losses are also inertial in nature, whereas linear resistors are representative of the smaller, peripheral airways, in which flow is sufficiently slow that viscous pressure losses dominate. The density-dependence of inertial pressure losses has been widely attributed to the presence of turbulence in the upper airways and bronchi; however, several authors have noted that even under laminar flow conditions pressure losses may maintain an inertial dependence due to convective acceleration occurring as flow changes direction, for example, at airway bifurcations. The latter point is important in understanding the manner in which breathing He/O 2 influences airway resistance and work of breathing, given that the magnitude of inertial pressure losses decreases with decreasing gas density. Indeed, a recent numerical analysis demonstrated that at elevated inspiratory flow rates He/O 2 is expected to reduce pressure losses (i.e. airway resistance) down to approximately the 10 th lung generation, where flow is laminar.

Amplifiers of damaging energy and power

By the thermodynamic principle of energy conservation, energy accounted for in its noninjuring forms (stored potential or dissipated frictional heat) cannot simultaneously have been spent in deforming tissue or inflicting damage. Very small amounts of mechanical energy are delivered during inflation, and even smaller amounts remain unrecovered or unaccounted at the end of the breathing cycle. Arguably, however, it is this unaccounted fraction of input energy, which likely rises disproportionately with Vand driving pressure, that relates most directly to damage. With these determinants and thermodynamic principles in mind, one might wonder how such small amounts of unaccounted (absorbed) energy could initiate tissue damage.

The answer likely lies within the following four considerations of micromechanics. First, the baby lung of ARDS has much less capacity to accept gas than its healthy counterpart, so that given amounts of ventilating energy and power concentrate within a "container" with innately smaller capacity to accept it. This spatial concentration amplifies both the magnitude and velocity of the stretching forces of the tidal breath. Thus, the same amount of externally measured power that severely injures the baby lung would have negligible biologic impact when applied to the lungs of a healthy adult; the SP of the former (power/capacity) far exceeds the latter.

Second, the mechanically heterogeneous environment of acutely injured tissue amplifies stresses at the junctions of mechanically dissimilar tissues (e.g. closed and open units), and, in that process, initiates strong forces at the boundary between pliable and nonpliable parenchymal elements.

Third, as already noted, not all parenchymal structures expand at the same rate in response to an applied stress. These viscoelastic "drag" properties of acutely injured tissues impede effective stress distribution, further augmenting the local forces and strain incurred during expansion at junctional interfaces in rough proportion to the rate of volume change and strain. The observation of pendelluft, though quite detectable in acute lung injury, may simply be an expression of differential rates of regional expansion, with associated inflation patterns otherwise bearing an unclear relationship to VILI. In this context, it should be borne in mind that the baby lung expands faster than its healthy counterpart, simply because there are fewer air channels and lung units to accept the incoming gas charge. For the same V, the applied flow waveform conditions the velocity of expansion and the lung volume at which parenchymal pressure change is maximized.

### Vacuum phenomenon [^8e32a9a4]. Emergency Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

This article describes the theory of the formation of the vacuum phenomenon (VP), the detection of the VP, the different medical causes, the different locations of the presentation of the VP, and the differential diagnoses. In the human body, the cavitation effect is recognized on radiological studies; it is called the VP. The mechanism responsible for the formation of the VP is as follows: if an enclosed tissue space is allowed to expand as a rebound phenomenon after an external impact, the volume within the enclosed space will increase. In the setting of expanding volume, the pressure within the space will decrease. The solubility of the gas in the enclosed space will decrease as the pressure of the space decreases. Decreased solubility allows a gas to leave a solution. Clinically, the pathologies associated with the VP have been reported to mainly include the normal joint motion, degeneration of the intervertebral discs or joints, and trauma. The frequent use of CT for trauma patients and the high spatial resolution of CT images might produce the greatest number of chances to detect the VP in trauma patients. The VP is observed at locations that experience a traumatic impact; thus, an analysis of the VP may be useful for elucidating the mechanism of an injury. When the VP is located in the abdomen, it is important to include perforation of the digestive tract in the differential diagnosis. The presence of the VP in trauma patients does not itself influence the final outcome.

### A metafluid with multistable density and internal energy States [^258b70e0]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The gas energy per-unit-mass of the suspension is defined asand thus the total energy of the system for an adiabatic process is given by U tot = U gas + U el + U ex, where the last RHS term is the external work energy U ex and p is the dictated pressure in the external fluid. For an isothermal process the first RHS term is replaced with.

Equilibrium of the system occurs when the elastic force in all bi-stable elements is balanced by the difference between the external pressure, and the pressure of the internal gas. In the current analysis, all bi-stable elements are identical, and can be in one of three possible states (phase I, spinodal, and phase II). Thus, the equilibrium values in each of the three possible states can be calculated from the following relations, Equation (8) describes an adiabatic process, and for an isothermal process the first RHS term is replaced with.

Solving Eq. (8) for the equilibrium values v I, v s and v II, and substituting these into the energy equation (7) allows to calculate the energy of the suspension per given permutationand external pressure p. Each permutation is only valid in a specific range of external pressures, as defined in Eq. (4). In Fig. 2 we present all of the available energy equilibria states, for multistable capsules composed of 18 bi-stable elements, with 190 possible permutations. Both isothermal (orange lines) and adiabatic (blue lines) processes are presented. The lines are determined by changing the external pressure, for different permutations of the phases of the bi-stable elements. The results show that the multi-stability extends the possible state of an ideal gas from a single line to a region containing multitude of possible energies. Different permutations provide different energy-pressure curves, corresponding to a fluid with different properties. Changing the properties of the fluid can be achieved by increasing/reducing the pressure beyond the range of a specific permutation. In addition to changing fluid properties, such transitions between different equilibrium states allow the fluid to store and release energy, as discussed below.

### Bench experiments comparing simulated inspiratory effort when breathing helium-oxygen mixtures to that during positive pressure support with air [^9517cc28]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

k is defined in the relationship, where ΔP is the pressure loss across the resistor, ρ is the gas density, and Ū is the mean gas velocity entering the resistor.

Determination of inspiratory effort

For each experiment, pressure versus time and flow versus time data were recorded from the driving ventilator. The total work done by the driving ventilator on the system was then calculated by numerically integrating the product of pressure and flow with respect to time. In order to estimate the simulated inspiratory effort from the total calculated work, two corrections were applied to subtract work done on the driving side of the test lung. First, the work done to lift the driving chamber itself, as determined from preliminary experiments performed at equivalent breathing patterns, but without the lifting bar in place (that is, without the additional load of the breathing chamber), was subtracted from the total work. Second, flow rates recorded from the driving ventilator were scaled by the ratio between the tidal volume measured by the support ventilator and that reported by the driving ventilator. For experiments performed with room air, flow rates were instead scaled according to the tidal volume observed for the breathing chamber according to the graduated volume scale provided on the test lung. This correction was made to account for additional work done on the driving side of the test lung at high pressures, owing to the compliance of tubing connecting the driving ventilator to the driving chamber, and to horizontal expansion of the driving chamber bellows (i.e. where the intended expansion is in the vertical direction to lift the top plates of the test lung). If ever these two corrections resulted in a negative estimated inspiratory effort, the negative value was deemed physiologically unrealistic, and a value of zero was instead assigned. Clearly, this assignment neglects patient effort required to trigger the support ventilator; however, it will be argued below that over the range of parameters studied, this effort was small. All experiments were repeated a minimum of two times in order to estimate the measurement precision.

### A metafluid with multistable density and internal energy States [^a1462652]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Internal energy

We now calculate the internal energy for all of the possible permutations { n I, n s, n II } of the suspension. For the current analysis, we neglect the compressibility of the external fluid and assume that all capsules are identical. Thus, the internal energy of the suspension is composed of the total energy of the ideal gas, denoted by U gas, and the energy of the multistable elastic capsules, denoted by U el.

The elastic energy U el of a bi-stable element i for the three possible phases is given by integration of (2) over v i, yieldingand the total elastic potential energy per-unit-mass is thus

To calculate U gas we assume an ideal gas model, p gas = ρ gas R T. For isothermal processes, we thus obtain the relation, where R is the specific gas constant, T is the constant temperature, m g is the mass of the gas within the capsule. For adiabatic processes, assuming ideal gas and isentropic compression/expansion, the gas pressure is given by, where p atm is atmospheric pressure, and v atm is the volume taken by the gas contained within a single capsule at atmospheric pressure. In the adiabatic case, the temperature of the gas within the capsules will change during pressure variations according to, but not the temperature of the external incompressible fluid. These spatial temperature variations may yield heat transfer between the gas, solid and liquid, and more complex dynamics. To allow simple treatment of this case, we assume in the current analysis that an adiabatic process corresponds to the more strict requirement of no heat transfer from the encapsulated gas.

### The future of mechanical ventilation: lessons from the present and the past [^01c7d7a3]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Ventilator-related causes of VILI: the mechanical power

All of these mechanical factors discussed separately (volume, pressure, rate, and flow) can be considered parts of a single physical entity: the mechanical power. The equation describing power (Fig. 3) may be easily derived by multiplying the classical equation of motion by the tidal volume and respiratory rate. Indeed, the energy cost per cycle is computed as the product of pressure times the change of volume, which, when multiplied by the respiratory rate, gives the power value (energy/unit of time). Total pressure is spent in performing elastic work (elastance times tidal volume), in moving gas (flow times resistance), and in maintaining end-expiratory lung volume (by PEEP). If each of these elements is multiplied by the tidal volume, the energy per breath is obtained, and by multiplying this by the respiratory rate we obtain the mechanical power. This equation is presented in this extended form, instead of other possible simplified versions, to illustrate item by item the determinants of power. A comparison of exponents indicates that tidal volume (and its associated driving pressure) and inspiratory flow are quantitatively potent determinants (and), followed by the respiratory rate, and then by PEEP, elastance, and resistance (all three linearly correlated with the mechanical power). Clearly, reduction of ventilatory demand to reduce tidal volume, flow, and/or respiratory rate should be prioritized if applying damaging power is to be avoided.

Fig. 3
Upper box: simplified equation of motion, showing that, at any given moment, the pressure in the respiratory system (P) above the relaxed volume equals the sum of the elastic pressure (elastance of the respiratory system E rs times change in lung volume), plus the pressure needed to move the gases (flow F times airway resistance), plus the pressure (if any) to keep the lung pressure above the atmospheric pressure at end expiration (PEEP). If each of these three components is multiplied by the tidal change in lung volume ∆ V, the energy per breath is obtained. If multiplied by the respiratory rate, the corresponding power equation is obtained. 0.098 is the conversion factor from liters/cmH₂O to Joules (J).

### Distributed direct air capture of carbon dioxide by synergistic water harvesting [^7e1bcb07]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

By contrast, the DAC without using in situ vapor purge, lost 40% of its working capacity at cycle 8, starting from 0.97 mmol g −1 at cycle 1 (Fig. 3 c and e). This low stability can be attributed to the significantly higher temperatures required, ranging from 130 to 150 °C, to achieve a similar product volume compared with VPD (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Fig. 11). These observations highlight the importance of in situ vapor purge in reducing the required regeneration temperatures for CO 2 desorption.

In the above setup using a resin volume fraction of 0.5, the amount of CO 2 desorbed was barely influenced by the feed air humidity, as shown in the shaded area of Fig. 3f. This suggests the amount of in situ vapor could be far more than sufficient for purge. To analyze the necessary amount of co-adsorbed water or silica gel for in situ vapor purge, VPD was investigated under various relative humidities (Fig. 4), and in the meantime, the resin volume fraction was increased to 0.8 (320 mL CO 2 capture resin and 80 mL silica gel). Figure 4a and Supplementary Fig. 12 demonstrated stable CO 2 working capacities ranging from 0.85 to 1.00 mmol g −1 which is similar to the CO 2 working capacity in our earlier tests using a resin volume fraction of 0.5 (Fig. 3b). At elevated temperatures, the desorbed water first served as the vapors with high partial pressures over 95 kPa for in situ purge of CO 2 within the column (Fig. 4b). Then the vapor was condensed in the subsequent air-cooled condenser as fresh liquid water verified by the 1 H NMR results (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Movie 1). This gas/liquid separation allowed for the recovery of high concentration CO 2 products ranging from 4.5 to 5.0 g per cycle. Meanwhile, water productivity ranged from 5.0 to 6.5 g per cycle depending on the atmospheric humidity (Fig. 4a). It should be noted that only a small fraction of water (~22%) was desorbed, involved as vapors for performing in situ purge, and collected as a liquid product (Fig. 4d). Whereas the increased vapor pressure could substantially reduce the CO 2 partial pressure, releasing over 90% of the adsorbed CO 2 at temperatures below 110 °C (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 12).

### Which component of mechanical power is most important in causing VILI? [^4c98d178]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Estimating components of inflation energy

In theory, with resistance and compliance known and a threshold assumed, relatively simple algebraic formulae could estimate energy components ("blocks") of research or clinical interest that are defined by pressure-volume areas during passive inflation with constant flow. These formulae use reasonable simplifying assumptions and a geometric approach to analysis (Fig. 1 b). The theoretical impact of a proposed change in ventilation on the components of this energy/power complex could then be numerically estimated before they are actually made. Using similar principles when only already measured pressures, flow, volume, and frequency and are at hand, a comparable rationale and method produce condensed formulae that estimate these same energy components, so as to characterize the pattern already in use or to serially track the evolution and resolution of the ergo-trauma determinants of greatest interest (Fig. 1 b).

### Individualized flow-controlled ventilation compared to best clinical practice pressure-controlled ventilation: a prospective randomized porcine study [^c90b925a]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The results of a trial in healthy piglets suggest that the energy delivered by the ventilator to the lung tissue contributes to VILI. However, established calculations for mechanical power applied to the lung tissue consider only the inspiratory effort since expiration is presumed to be a passively occurring process. In earlier work on the concept of FCV, we already hypothesized that energy dissipated in the lung tissue during both inspiration and expiration is an important contributor to VILI. In mechanical ventilation, energy is necessarily dissipated because of resistive work that needs to be performed in order to overcome airway and tissue resistance during inspiration as well as expiration. Part of the applied energy is stored during inspiration (by expanding the (visco)elastic lung tissue and chest), can be partly recovered during expiration (by elastic recoil), and leaves the lung tissue again (during the egress of respiratory gas). By contrast, the dissipated energy (which represents the unavoidable "loss" of energy of any working mechanical system) remains in the lung tissue. In order to minimize dissipated energy, a constant flow of respiratory gas at the lowest level is most favorable. Decelerating flow in PCV during inspiration and expiration results in two spikes where energy is dissipated. Contrarily, constant flow in FCV lacks any energy spikes delivered to and dissipated in the lung tissue. Therefore, individualized FCV is performed not only with the greatest efficiency with respect to lung mechanics at the lowest flow guaranteeing normoventilation, but also with the lowest possible energy input to lung tissue.

### Positive pressure ventilation: what is the real cost? [^f3dfe248]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Positive pressure ventilation is a radical departure from the physiology of breathing spontaneously. The immediate physiological consequences of positive pressure ventilation such as haemodynamic changes are recognized, studied, and understood. There are other significant physiological interactions which are less obvious, more insidious, and may only produce complications if ventilation is prolonged. The interaction of positive pressure with airway resistance and alveolar compliance affects distribution of gas flow within the lung. The result is a wide range of ventilation efficacy throughout different areas of the lung, but the pressure differentials between alveolus and interstitium also influence capillary perfusion. The hydrostatic forces across the capillaries associated with the effects of raised venous pressures compound these changes resulting in interstitial fluid sequestration. This is increased by impaired lymphatic drainage which is secondary to raised intrathoracic pressure but also influenced by raised central venous pressure. Ventilation and PEEP promulgate further physiological derangement. In theory, avoiding these physiological disturbances in a rested lung may be better for the lung and other organs. An alternative to positive pressure ventilation might be to investigate oxygen supplementation of a physiologically neutral and rested lung. Abandoning heroic ventilation would be a massive departure from current practice but might be a more rationale approach to future practice.

Nature of explosions — Explosions arise from sudden chemical conversion of a solid or liquid into a gas with energy release, and explosive devices are categorized as high-order explosives (HE) or low-order explosives (LE). High-order explosive detonation produces supersonic, instantaneous gas transformation under extremely high pressure and generates an overpressure blast wave that expands outward in all directions. The extent and pattern of injuries depend on the amount and composition of explosive material, delivery method, distance between the victim and the blast, setting (open vs. closed space, structural collapse, intervening barriers), and other accompanying environmental hazards.

Mechanical circulatory support — commercial air travel considerations and preparation: Most commercial flights cruise at the altitude between 7,000 and 13,000 m above sea level, and cabin pressurization should keep arterial blood oxygen saturation > 90% in healthy individuals; cabin air has low humidity (< 1%), and a gas trapped in a closed space will expand by approximately 35% when going from sea level to cabin altitude. Reports indicate air travel for stable DMCS patients is usually considered to be safe. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) regularly releases updated recommendations, and patients should fill out a medical clearance form issued by IATA (MEDIF, FREEMC forms) before travel to provide airlines with DMCS device/battery information and any special assistance; the patients should also notify security personnel.

Respiratory — airway management, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) use: PEEP "improves oxygenation or decreases risk of developing hypoxemia" by "decreasing intrapulmonary shunting of blood and better matching perfused lung to ventilated lung tissue, thus improving arterial oxygenation". It "does not open fully collapsed alveoli but re-expands partially collapsed ones" and "does not decrease extravascular lung water but redistributes it". "Higher levels of PEEP are particularly useful in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)". PEEP "should be increased slowly by 2–3 cmH₂O from 5 cmH2O to a max of 15 cmH2O" with close monitoring. "Excessive PEEP over distends alveoli, increases dead space and work of breathing, reduces lung compliance, and compresses alveolar capillaries, reducing oxygenation and risking pulmonary barotrauma". "Increased intrathoracic pressure can progressively decrease cardiac output and is most notable when PEEP is greater than 15 cmH2O. The higher the level of PEEP (over 5 cmH2O), the more likely the patient will experience a variety of adverse consequences, both ventilatory and hemodynamic".

### Practical assessment of risk of VILI from ventilating power: a conceptual model [^0411699d]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The pace at which the energy of the single inflation is delivered (intracycle power), as well as the duration of potentially damaging stress per cycle spent above, is determined by the flow profile. However, as we have previously shown, the same total amount of elastic energy or work (W) is required by all flow waveforms to deliver the tidal volume (V T) into a lung with an unchanging compliance. That amount of elastic energy is:

In theory, (referenced to zero cmH 2 O) partitions the elastic energy of inflation — either the total elastic energy that includes the PEEP component or the driving elastic energy component that excludes it, which we term drive energy:

A geometrical approach indicates that once such a threshold is specified, 'hazardous' (> threshold pressure) and 'safe' (< threshold pressure) intracycle energy 'blocks' can be assigned to the relevant pressure x volume areas that determine intracycle elastic energy (with or w/o PEEP). These relationships are illustrated in Fig. 2 for constant flow but are applicable to any flow waveform. We define the hazard ratio (HR) as the proportion of the energy–driveor elastic–that occurs when the elastic pressure in the lung is above a threshold pressure. These ratios we designate as, respectively. In either case, it is the energy fraction delivered in the "hazardous" portion of inspiration. Hence.

Using the area analogues mentioned above, one can showandHeredefines the driving pressure. We note thatdepends explicitly on only the driving pressure, plateau pressure, and threshold pressure, whiledepends explicitly on plateau pressure, threshold pressure, and PEEP. If the HR of the current pattern is greater than thought prudent, adjustments can then be made to V T and/or PEEP (and thereby toand DP) to achieve the desired proportions of 'hazardous' and 'safe' energy per cycle.

For given values of, and, we can determine a value of driving pressurethat achieves the desired hazard ratio:

Alternatively, given values of, andwe can find a target value for the plateau pressure:

Once these target values for DP andare known, the necessary adjustment to V T for acceptably safe tidal energy delivery can then be easily computed as

### Forces required for isolated malleus shaft fractures [^d02513e0]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Calculation of Negative Pressure Force

Using the ideal gas law PV = nRT and assuming that the external auditory meatus is completely sealed during the event makes PV a constant.

We can further derive to the formula:

P = standard normal air pressure defined as 101,000 Pascal

A = area of the tympanic membrane, average at 64.3 mm 2 according to Pannu et al.

X = the length of the external auditory meatus filled with a finger

L 1 = the distance from tympanic membrane to the fingertip

L 2 = the total length of the ear canal, measured on our test persons to calculate L 1 by subtracting X. (Fig. 4 B).

FIG. 4
A, A schematic illustration of the force generating trauma when a finger is withdrawn the length of X out of the ear canal. L 1 marks the distance between the tympanic membrane and the fingertip. The tensor tympani muscle and its tendon are in red. B, Schematic illustration of our scale model of the trauma with an artificial tympanic membrane (blue) with a cast in metallic malleus replica that attaches to the force measuring dynamometer via a hook marked H. V marks a screw valve for normalization of pressure before the piston that acts as the withdrawn finger is extracted the length X (drawn here as a hollow arrow to the right). C, A similar construct as in (B), but when the first piston is drawn the length of X (marked by the hollow arrow to the right), the dynamometer attached to the second piston marked P measures the force required to withdraw P. The friction force needed to withdraw P is separately measured and then subtracted from the result to give the force applied by the negative pressure of withdrawing the first piston.

With this formula, the force applied via the tympanic membrane due to air expansion can be calculated. It is also possible to account for several variabilities such as the likely scenario that the ear canal is not sealed during the entire extraction of the finger (by subtraction from X). Moreover, the amount of air between the finger and the tympanic membrane could be lessened due to the presence of water (by subtraction from L 1). Since water expansion can be considered negligible, it was not accounted for in the equation. Hydraulic mechanisms work on the effectiveness of energy transfer in liquid.

### The future of mechanical ventilation: lessons from the present and the past [^a7241e2a]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Positive pleural pressure

For passive inflation by a given airway pressure, the pleural pressure will increase far more in the presence of elevated chest wall elastance (i.e. elevated E W / E tot), as in some cases of extreme obesity, whereas it will increase far less in the presence of elevated lung elastance (i.e. low E W / E tot; see Eq. (1)). All equations to which we refer only approximate what is actually happening in the pleural space, because in reality the pleural pressure is not uniform along the thoracic cage, but rather depends on several factors, such as gravitational gradients and local pressure distortions arising from anatomical differences in the shapes of the lung and its chest wall enclosure. Despite the limitations in accurately determining pleural pressure, its changing value influences central vascular pressures and venous return. A large experimental and clinical literature describes all of the possible complications related to ventilation-caused decreases of effective circulating volume. These are particularly likely to occur when pleural pressure remains positive throughout the entire respiratory cycle, as during ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The kidney, liver, and bowel may all be impaired or damaged by the resulting venous congestion and reduced perfusion.

Negative pleural pressure

Excessively negative pleural pressure may arise during spontaneous breathing, especially when vigorous respiratory effort is applied to a 'stiff lung' (see Eq. (3)). In ARDS, for example, negative swings in esophageal pressure may exceed 20–25 cmH 2 O, due to profoundly dysregulated respiratory drive. Apart from increasing the work of breathing and oxygen consumption, such excessively negative intrathoracic and interstitial pressures promote venous return and increase edema formation. Such phenomena, well described by Barach et al. in 1938, have deservedly been reemphasized for the current era of positive pressure ventilation. Recent work has demonstrated that pedelluft phenomena which occur during vigorous breathing efforts in injured lungs have the potential to amplify local strains and could conceivably contribute to tissue damage. In concept, certain asynchronies between the patient and ventilator (e.g. double triggering and breath stacking) may also be injurious when they occur frequently and/or in groups.

### Comprehensive guidance for human embryology, andrology, and endocrinology laboratories: management and operations: a committee opinion [^a57a6eb6]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). High credibility.

Instrumentation for embryology laboratories — Embryology laboratories require a wide array of specialized equipment, and at a minimum these include incubators, warming ovens, and heated stages and warm blocks. Incubators can be either benchtop style (humidified or nonhumidified) or traditional big-box water or air jacketed units, and in addition to supplying CO2 for embryo culture, incubators should provide low O2 concentration through a premixed gas or nitrogen gas input; a sufficient number of incubators should be available to limit door openings and provide enough space during downtime or maintenance. Warming ovens are typically required to warm media or materials that do not require equilibration with CO2, and heated stages should be available for any surface that would hold embryo culture dishes and/or micromanipulation dishes, including microscope stages, stages inside workstations, or stand-alone warming stages; warm blocks should be available to hold media or tubes containing fluid and oocytes from oocyte retrieval procedures.

### Adsorbate-induced lattice deformation in IRMOF-74 series [^870373f0]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous crystals that hold promise for adsorption-based applications, such as carbon capture, hydrogenand methane storageand noble gas separations. MOFs can be tailored for a given application by tuning the size, shape and chemistry of their constituent building blocks. Effective optimization of MOFs for adsorption-based applications depends on our ability to engineer their chemistry to modulate their selectivity and capacity for different gas molecules. A fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of adsorption in MOFs and their response to gas adsorption is therefore crucial.

Several MOFs whose crystal structures respond to adsorbing gas molecules by undergoing reversible, structural transitions have been reported in the literatureand studied theoretically. Adsorbate-induced deformations of MOFs can cause dramatic changes in unit cell parameters, as in the cases of breathing or swelling MOFs. Swelling mechanisms that allow MOFs to expand as pores fill with adsorbates have been identified. More complex breathing mechanisms have also been observed where, upon insertion of some adsorbates at low gas phase pressures, the MOF exhibits a transition from an expanded, porous state to a more collapsed state, before expanding yet again to the porous state at higher gas phase pressures. The structural transitions can also be more subtle, as in the case of MOFs whose ligands undergo a rotation upon gas adsorption to accommodate more molecules yet maintain an approximately rigid unit cell. Recently, a rare negative gas adsorption phenomenon was observed in a MOF and directly connected to the cooperative motion of many atoms across a large unit cell. The crystal structure of a MOF at a given set of conditions is determined by trade-offs between intrahost, host-adsorbate, and adsorbate–adsorbate energies, as well as the mechanical stress induced by the pressure of the gas. Deformation of the framework raises its energy in the absence of gas, but is often compensated for by more favourable host–adsorbate and/or adsorbate–adsorbate interactions.

### How to set positive end-expiratory pressure [^93a48a03]. Respiratory Care (2002). Low credibility.

Application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in acute lung injury patients under mechanical ventilation improves oxygenation and increases lung volume. The effect of PEEP is to recruit lung tissue in patients with diffuse lung edema. This effect is particularly important in patients ventilated with low tidal volumes. Measurement of respiratory system mechanics in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome is important to assess the status of the disease and to choose appropriate ventilator settings that provide maximum alveolar recruitment while avoiding overdistention. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome in whom the lungs have been near-optimally recruited by PEEP and tidal volume, the use of recruitment maneuvers as adjuncts to mechanical ventilation remains controversial. The application of PEEP in patients with unilateral lung disease may be detrimental if PEEP hyperinflates normal lung regions, thus directing blood flow to diseased lung regions. In patients with air flow limitation and lung hyperinflation, the application of additional external PEEP to compensate for intrinsic PEEP and flow limitation frequently decreases the inspiratory effort to initiate an assisted breath, thus decreasing breathing work load.

### High positive end-expiratory pressure: only a dam against oedema formation? [^9c12a3ad]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Mechanical ventilation is a pivotal therapy for respiratory failure, although overinflation may injure the lung.

We have recently shown that healthy piglets ventilated with no positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and with tidal volume (V T) close to inspiratory capacity (IC) die with inflammatory pulmonary oedema within 36 h. In contrast, those ventilated with high PEEP (≥ 18 cmH 2 O; volume of gas around 75% of IC) and low V T (25% of IC) survive with normal lungs for 54 h.

Inflammatory pulmonary oedema develops when lung capillary transmural (internal minus external) pressure drives excessive fluid filtration through a disrupted, highly permeable, blood-gas barrier. As a result, exudates accumulate in the extravascular space and lung weight increases. If overinflation per se is the real threat to the blood-gas barrier, then ventilation with large V T alone (100% of IC) will be as harmful as ventilation with high PEEP (75% of IC) and low V T (25% of IC). In fact, in both cases, the volume of gas globally inflated will be equal to IC. However, high PEEP (and low V T) will possibly impede extravasation by lowering venous return, cardiac output and pulmonary capillary inflow (and pressure) while increasing extravascular pressure. Oedema will then not develop even if the blood-gas barrier loses its integrity.

To test this hypothesis, we ventilated healthy piglets with high PEEP (and low V T) (as above) and then suddenly removed PEEP to allow free extravasation through a possibly disrupted blood-gas barrier. Lung weight was expected to increase as oedema formation was no longer impeded.

### Assessment of recruitment from CT to the bedside: challenges and future directions [^4e4fe78d]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Gas methods

The gas methods are based on the comparison of expected changes in volume/pressure when inflating the lung with the volume/pressure actually measured. As an example, for a given respiratory system compliance we expect a certain volume change when applied pressure is increased (as an example from 5 to 15 cmH 2 O), this expected volume is the product of compliance at low pressure and the applied variation of pressure (in this case 10 cmH 2 O). If the volume measured at 15 cmH 2 O is greater than the one expected, the volume difference is attributed to recruitment. All the gas methods rely on two assumptions: first that the compliance of the newly opened units is equal to the compliance of the already opened units; and second that the pressure/volume curve is substantially linear in the range of pressures applied. Here below we summarize the gas methods.
The first to use the P/V curves method was Ranieri et al. in 1991, based on the construction of two P/V curves obtained at two different pressure levels, (PEEP and zero end expiratory pressure [ZEEP]). These were obtained performing inflation volumes and plotting them with the corresponding pressures, measured by performing static end-expiratory airway occlusion. The difference of lung volume between PEEP and ZEEP at the same static pressure was assumed to be the gas volume recruited.
In 1998 Gattinoni et al. estimated lung recruitment by measuring the lung gas volume at two different levels, PEEP and zero PEEP (ZEEP). The End Expiratory Lung Volume (EELV) at ZEEP (namely the functional residual capacity, FRC) was measured using a closed-circuit helium dilution method. The lung volume at PEEP was computed by measuring the exhaled volume during the transition from PEEP to ZEEP, during an expiratory period long enough to reach an end-expiratory flow of zero. Consequently, EELV was calculated as the sum of the FRC (helium) and the difference between the exhaled volume and the tidal volume. The difference between EELV and FRC was assumed to be the recruited volume. To estimate the lung recruitment by PEEP, these methods differentiate the component caused by the inflation of pulmonary units already open and the component caused by the recruitment of previously collapsed pulmonary units, calculating the predicted volume adding the EELV at ZEEP, considering the compliance measured at ZEEP.
In 1999 Jonson et al. analyzed the P/V curve focusing on the elastic pressure of the system, eliminating the resistive part. Measuring the elastic pressure–volume (Pel–V) curves of the respiratory system and the lung volume recruited by applying PEEP gives some clarification into the pressure range over which recruitment occurs in cases of ARDS. This approach also helps to explain how recruitment influences lung compliance. High compliance during insufflation from ZEEP suggests that lung recruitment occurs well above the lower inflection point on the Pel–V curve. This difference in volume and compliance became negligible at pressures exceeding 30 cmH₂O, indicating that continuous lung recruitment occurred as the pressure was increased from ZEEP up to 30 cmH₂O. Reaching pressures of 30 cmH₂O or higher was necessary to achieve full lung recruitment, a finding consistent with the results reported by Gattinoni et al.
In 2020, Lu Chen et al. proposed the recruitment-to-inflation ratio (R/I ratio) which compared the compliance of the recruited volume (C rec), obtained with two different levels of PEEP (i.e. at 5 and 15 cmH 2 O), and the compliance of the respiratory system at the lower PEEP. C rec was calculated doing the ratio between the recruited volume (V rec) and the difference between PEEP high and PEEP low. A de-recruitment manouevre with a single breath, without disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, was performed to calculate the recruited volume; V rec was obtained by the difference between ΔEELV measured and ΔEELV ideal. The first one was obtained with a single breath dropping from PEEP high to PEEP low and computing the difference between the exhaled volume after the drop and the expired tidal volume with high PEEP. The second one was calculated as the product of compliance at PEEP low and the difference between PEEP high and PEEP low.

### A metafluid with multistable density and internal energy States [^21422202]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Results

We study the thermodynamic pressure-density relations and their stability for a fluidic suspension composed of multistable elastic capsules, enclosing a compressible gas and immersed in a liquid, as seen in Fig. 1. Each capsule is composed of n identical bi-stable elastic elements creating a single encapsulated volume, filled in with a compressible gas. For the sake of simplicity, body forces are hereafter neglected (see detailed analysis in Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Movie 3). We examine a control volume which includes a large number of capsules, so that homogenization may be applied, while keeping all physical properties spatially uniform. The density of the external liquid is denoted by ρ l. The number of capsules per-unit-mass is denoted by Φ. The total mass of the capsules per suspension mass m can be calculated via Φ, as m = Φ m c, where m c is the mass of a single capsule. We define Ψ as the external fluid mass ratio. Thus, the mass of the external liquid is m l = Ψ m and the total mass of the capsules is m (1 − Ψ). Thus we obtain a Φ-Ψ relation of Φ = (1 − Ψ)/ m c.

Since the external fluid is assumed to be incompressible and thus its volume is constant, the equivalent density ρ of the suspension can be expressed bywhere v i is the gas-filled volume contained within bi-stable element i, and v a is all the additional gas and solid volume of the capsule.

The volume v i is a multi-valued function of the difference between the pressure of the internal gas, denoted as p gas and the pressure in the external fluid, denoted simply as p. We thus define this pressure difference by p el = p gas − p. We approximate v i by the tri-linear model (see Fig. 1 b) which is a common and useful approximation that enables a simplified analytic treatment of bi-stability. More specifically, according to this model, when considering the energy relation to the pressure p el and element volume v i, the energy function may be approximated by three quadratic functionals,– leading to piece-wise linear pressure-volume relation.

### Eruption of a deep-sea mud volcano triggers rapid sediment movement [^7f4baf87]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Over the entire period four very rapid uplift events were recorded, totalling 1.3 m, accompanied by release of gas from the sediment and each followed by seafloor subsidence. It should be noted that the active central HMMV area may have experienced even more uplift than recorded at the location of the LOOME observatory frame situated on the hummocky terrain at the Northern edge of the HMMV. For example, Fig. 4 shows that areas 175–350 m south of the frame became more elevated than the hummocky area, where the frame was positioned and where the vertical dynamics were registered. With the assumption that these events were mostly gas driven, we can estimate a gas expansion of 1.3 m 3 m −2 of seafloor. Most of this gas was likely supplied through upward fluid advection from the deep subsurface, but in part it may also have originated from destabilization of gas hydrates located within the upper sediment layers. Applying this unit volume of gas expansion and extrapolating it to cover the whole of the displaced/elevated mud area (165 × 200 m), would imply a release of 43,000 m 3 of methane at 120 atm (the in situ pressure at the seafloor at the HMMV), which is equivalent to 2 × 10 8 mol of methane gas. In earlier work it was estimated that 8–35 × 10 6 mol of methane escape from HMMV per year in the form of gas bubbles released from single streams, an estimate that does not include recurrent eruptions of the kind documented here. For example, if eruptions were to occur at a frequency of one eruptive event per year with the same magnitude that we describe here, the total annual methane release from the HMMV mud volcano would be an order of magnitude higher than all previous estimates. In comparison, the sum of the biological removal rates for methane released at HMMV, by aerobic and anaerobic oxidation, is only 5–15 × 10 6 mol per year. Thus, from our new calculations, we would predict that < 3% of the total methane released from the HMMV might be oxidized at or beneath the seafloor. Thus the vast majority of the methane released escapes into the overlying water column and, potentially, the atmosphere.

Carbon filters were partially saturated stepwise, each step followed the same protocol: fresh gas flow (FGF) was set to 10 L min −1 at a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.4. The vaporiser was adjusted to achieve a concentration of sevoflurane 6 vol% in the mainstream measurement site. Sevoflurane-enriched gas was then heated and humidified by passing it through the humidifier to reach body temperature pressure saturated (BTPS) conditions (37 o C, ambient pressure, air saturated with water vapour) before entering the filter. Each filter was streamed for 14 min at each saturation step. With respect to otherwise constant conditions, the volume of vaporised sevoflurane during a single saturation step was calculated as 10 L min −1 ×6 vol%×14 min = 8400 ml. Under standard temperature and pressure, dry (STPD) conditions (i.e. dry air, 20°C room temperature, and atmospheric pressure), gaseous sevoflurane 184 mL translates into liquid sevoflurane 1 ml. Accordingly, the volume of liquid sevoflurane applied during a single saturation step was 8400 ml/184 mL = 45.7 ml. After each saturation step the filter was weighed. The difference between the gain in filter weight during the saturation step and the amount of sevoflurane was calculated as the amount of water adsorbed by the filter material.

After each step, filter containers were connected to an anaesthesia machine in order to perform measurements under simulated ventilation of an anaesthetised patient (see below), and the next saturation step followed. Saturation steps were repeated until the concentration of sevoflurane at the outlet of the container exceeded 10 ppm, at which the filter was considered fully saturated. This limit was chosen as it represents the threshold value for sevoflurane concentration in the workplace.

Ethylene oxide (ETO) gas supply options — mixture compositions, pressure, and alternatives — include an ETO–carbon dioxide mixture consisting of 8.5% ETO and 91.5% CO2, which requires pressure vessels rated for steam sterilization because higher pressures (28–51 psig) are required. Hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) drop‑in CFC replacements are approximately 50-fold less damaging to the earth's ozone layer than CFCs; the EPA will begin regulation of HCFC in 2015 and eliminate production in 2030, and available formulations include 8.6% ETO and 91.4% HCFC or 10% ETO and 90% HCFC. An alternative is 100% ETO using unit‑dose cartridges that eliminate the need for external tanks.

### Practical assessment of risk of VILI from ventilating power: a conceptual model [^a054cf49]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Threshold pressure for damage

The actual threshold pressure, that determines the damaging potential for elastic energy per cycle is unknown and likely varies–both between patients and within the various regions of the mechanically heterogenous lung. As already noted, two numbers that serve currently as lung protection guidelines for clinical practitioners are the end-inspiratory pressure in the absence of flow, the 'plateau pressure', and the 'driving pressure'. When the entire breath is considered using observable bedside data during passive ventilation, the numerical upper limits commonly considered 'safe' for these parameters in everyday practice are: = 30 cmH 2 O and DP = 15 cmH 2 O. Fundamentally, however, pressure alone cannot injure — to do that the expenditure of sufficient and potentially damaging energy (a product of pressure and volume) is required. One plausible approach to approximate the latter may be to use theas a boundary marker.

Onceis assigned, the proportion of the total intracycle elastic energy that does not exceed that threshold value can be estimated as a 'safety ratio' (SR), which we designate to be the quotient of infra-thresholdelastic inflation energy to that of the entire inflation cycle. The complementary hazardous energy fraction (HR) bears a simple relationship to SR:). Some authors and clinicians consider the only elastic energy component of VILI interest to be the purely dynamic piece (the 'driving energy') expended in reaching the potentially hazardous end-tidal DP. Alternatively, the elastic energy of concern might also include the PEEP-related static component of pressure, as well as the DP. Here, theis the relevant pressure associated with maximum risk, as it helps define the total of ventilation-delivered elastic energy and parallels strain. Therefore, one might set two elastic SRs for each breath: one purely dynamicand one that is all-inclusive. Using these SR indicators with a safety threshold for total elastic inflation pressure in mind, the delivered breath can be characterized by the proportion of its elastic energy that is, on average, 'safe' or 'hazardous'.

If the SR for either driving energy or total elastic energy of the PEEP andcombination exceeds the desired SR value, new targets for maximally safe DP, andcan be calculated. In clinical practice, adjusting PEEP may have consequences for hemodynamics and gas exchange. Therefore, again in principle, the linked variables adjusted by the clinician to improve the energetics of VILI risk would likely be tidal volume and DP (with frequency fine-tuned as needed to maintain ventilation stable).

### Focused ultrasound: noninvasive image-guided therapy [^01b45548]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

ENHANCEMENT OF FUS BY MICROBUBBLES: WHEN HIFU IS NOT SUFFICIENT

Transient formation of gas bodies during the action of HIFU within the biological tissues greatly improves energy deposition and efficacy of bioeffects. In this case, bubbles in the tissue are formed due to the action of US itself, during the passage of the rarefaction phase of the US pressure wave, from the air originally dissolved in blood and tissues, via inertial cavitation and rectified diffusion into the newly forming gas bodies. Newly formed gas bubbles rapidly compress and expand in the high-intensity US field, leading to localized energy deposition, both thermal and mechanical. When acoustic pressure is lower than the cavitation threshold, the passage of the US wave through the tissue occurs with minimal attenuation and energy loss, traditionally assumed as 0.3 dB/cm/MHz by FDA. Externally added "seed" gas bubbles are even more efficient at enhancing US energy deposition, as they do not require higher acoustic pressure values. Bioeffects of the combined action of medical US and administered gas-filled bubbles had been investigated initially in the context of safety of use of intravascular microbubble materials for contrast US imaging, about a quarter century ago. Skyba et alinvestigated US action on intravascular microbubbles in vivo, in a spinotrapezius muscle vasculature rat model. They varied energy transmitted by the US clinical imaging system transducer, within the range of peak negative acoustic pressures of 0.61 MPa and 1.53 MPa, also presented as Mechanical Index (MI) between 0.4 and 1.0, displayed on the system screen. MI is defined as peak negative acoustic pressure in MPa, divided by the square root of US frequency in MHz. It was found that, in response to the increase of acoustic pressure, more blood capillaries were broken, leading to higher level of RBC extravasation. We must note that the MI range investigated was within the approved MI limits for diagnostic imaging medical US systems in general. As the US contrast agent dose in rodents exceeded the human dose by 3 orders of magnitude, and only 0.015% of the microvessels were ruptured for each imaging frame, contrast agent safety was assured, and microbubble materials made their way into widespread clinical practice, with millions of injections administered to patients annually. The same group, Price et alalso reported that the action of US on intravascular microbubbles (US+MB) in the rat muscle microscopy animal model can lead to extravascular delivery of not only RBCs but also submicron colloid particles, with the eventual goal of particle delivery outside of the vasculature, specifically in the insonated tissue. This publication opened up the field of US-assisted drug delivery across the endothelial barrier (see below).

### Approaches to incubator humidification at… [^887f2511]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

As neonatal care has advanced and more immature infants are admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, we must reevaluate fundamental management practices originally developed for infants born at later gestational ages. Studies have investigated the use of various incubator humidification levels in the care of preterm infants of older gestational ages, but evidence regarding management of ambient humidity for infants born at < 25 weeks' gestation using contemporary technology is limited. Uncertainty about the best approach to incubator humidification is reflected in major variation in practice around the world. This article summarizes existing evidence about the use of humidity in incubators and its relationship with neonatal skin maturation, fluid management, temperature regulation, and morbidities. It also describes approaches to starting humidification, duration of humidification, and reducing humidification over time. It concludes with a list of important questions requiring future research.

### Clinical and biochemical footprints of inherited metabolic diseases. XIII. respiratory manifestations [^2ebf0b8a]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

3 The respiratory system

Respiration is a vital process for the normal function at every level of organization from a cell to an organism. In humans, inhaled oxygen (O 2) enables substrate oxidation in the mitochondria allowing for energy production. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) generated by this process returns to the lung and eventually dissolves in the exhaled air. Two types of respiration are recognized: 1) cellular respiration (or oxidation); and 2) external respiration (or ventilation). External respiration requires integrity of upper and lower airways as well as, respiratory muscle force and cardiac function. It is also accurately regulated by central and peripheral nervous system. Dysfunction in any of these factors can result in respiratory signs and symptoms. Hence, it is not surprising that respiratory manifestations are highly prevalent in patients with IMDs, in whom a multisystem involvement is commonly observed. Ventilation, perfusion and diffusion allow O 2 supply and CO 2 removal. During ventilation (V) intrathoracic airways expand in inspiration as intrapleural pressure becomes more negative and narrow in expiration as they return to baseline. Ventilation is achieved by the action of the respiratory muscles, which causes a change in the volume of the thoracic cage. Inspiration involves contraction of the diaphragm and of the intercostal muscles, which expand the rib cage and may be supported by additional accessory muscles in case of respiratory distress. During normal expiration, a passive process takes place due to the elastic recoil of the lungs and surface tension, the diaphragm relaxes and goes up, while intercostal muscles relax and the rib cage collapses. Abdominal and external intercostal muscles are recruited in forceful expiration. Perfusion (Q) refers to the flow of blood to alveolar capillaries. The V/Q ratio evaluates the matching of alveolar V to Q. Changes in the V/Q ratio can contribute to hypoxemia. Gas exchange occurs in the alveoli by diffusion at the level of the alveolar capillary barrier. In diseases with abnormally increased alveolar capillary barrier e.g. interstitial lung disease (ILD) and lung fibrosis, gas diffusion gets impaired. As CO 2 is much more diffusible than O 2, in diseases characterized by diffusion defects significant increase of CO 2 does not develop even in the presence of hypoxemia until hypoventilation also occurs.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^5c69e0c1]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Position- and volume-related lung mechanics — implications for quantitative imaging — indicate that regional ventilation and measured volumes vary with posture and lung volume, complicating comparisons. The report states, "Variation in alveolar size also creates gradients in regional alveolar ventilation (V A) and fresh gas delivery to the alveolar space because alveoli in nondependent regions expand less for a given change in pressure and are less well ventilated". It further notes, "The wedge shape of the lung means that more lung volume lies in the dependent third in supine posture than prone posture (13, 14), thus affecting gravitational deformation", and "The lung matches shape with the thorax, resulting in greater expansion of nondependent lung while supine, compared with dependent lung (14)". Moreover, "Lung volumes measured by spirometry also vary with posture (15, 16), thereby complicating comparisons of imaging data obtained supine with those obtained prone or on upright pulmonary function tests". To minimize misinterpretation, the authors emphasize, "Overcoming these challenges is critical to ensuring that 1) imaging metric derivation is accurate and reproducible and 2) measurements accurately represent (patho)physiology to guard against misinterpretation of results in all QI applications irrespective of modalities or disease entities".

### Practical assessment of risk of VILI from ventilating power: a conceptual model [^bce86e26]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Because damage cannot occur without its application, energy is central to understanding the VILI mechanism. Following current clinical practice and using clinical nomenclature, we previously elaborated the concept of 'damaging energy per cycle' by partitioning the inflation stress at a hypothetical value for conserved (termed 'elastic') airway pressure. In this paper we describe how — if only in concept–the bedside clinician might gauge under passive conditions the relative hazard of delivered energy per inflation cycle using easily observed static circuit pressures (and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP)) and an estimate of a threshold value of elastic airway pressure that might logically serve to partition total intracycle energy into its conserved and dissipated components. Energy that is truly conserved (elastic) cannot itself have been spent in directly damaging tissue, but it does correlate strongly with the stretch and strain that have the potential to do so under dynamic conditions. (Please see Additional file 1: Part A for further explanation.) In the current extension of that earlier simplified model presented here, inflation energy delivered before thisis reached we designate to be, on average, the 'safe' fraction of the total (Fig. 1). Understanding that local (regional) airway pressure thresholds vary from site-to-site, we use the average and region-relevant threshold pressures to compute the 'safe' and 'hazardous' proportions of total intracycle energy. Our intent is to help caregivers understand the underlying energetic factors in play when Ps, PEEP and DP are adjusted.

Introduction

In our daily life, we constantly deal with problems, ranging from the most mundane (e.g. what to cook for dinner given the ingredients at our disposal), to professional activities (e.g. how to reorganize our current plans to meet a new deadline), up to major societal challenges (e.g. how to find innovative solutions against global warming). How do we find new solutions to problems? While the ability to solve problems is a critical skill for adapting to new situations and innovating, the mechanisms underlying the problem-solving process remain largely unknown.

Among the new problems we face each day, some are well-defined (e.g. playing a jigsaw puzzle). The initial state (i.e. the number of independent pieces) and goal state (i.e. assembling the pieces so it looks like the picture model) are clear, and the solver can apply a set of operations (i.e. interlocking the pieces as a function of their shape) to reach the goal. However, for many of our problems (e.g. organizing work activities during the COVID-19 pandemic), the problem space is ambiguous. No heuristics or existing rules could be applied to transform the initial state into the goal state. Such "ill-defined" problemsthus require additional mental processes, which have been tightly linked to creative thinking –. Ill-defined problem-solving (or creative problem-solving) is often referred to as insight solving, where the solution comes to mind suddenly and effortlessly, with a "Eureka" phenomenon –. According to the Representational Change Theory, solving such problems involves restructuring the initial problem mental representational space, which presumably entails combining elements related to the problem in a new way. In theory, restructuring allows one to change perspective, reframe the problem, or escape its implicitly imposed constraints, leading to creative associations. For instance, consider the following problem: "A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender points a shotgun at the man. The man says, 'Thank you', and walks out". The problem is ill-defined because the path to finding the solution is to be discovered, and the goal state is vague. Solving this problem first requires asking the right question: in which context would a shotgun and a glass of water help somebody? Rather than relying on obvious associations (e.g. a glass of water is related to thirst), solvers must fill the missing link between the relevant elements of the problem (a shotgun induces fear, and fear can be a remedy for hiccups, as can drinking a glass of water). Hence, restructuring the initial representation of a given problem would allow one to see this link and find its solution.

### Assessment of the alveolar volume when sampling exhaled gas at different expired volumes in the single breath diffusion test [^61eab3dd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Some explanations for the remarkable differences in the values of the alveolar volume when measured at the different intervals of exhalation are well reported in the paper by Yuh T Huang et al. These authors provided strong evidence in the evaluation of the volume-dependent distribution of DLCO in normals at rest and during exercise; they showed that the intrabreath DLCO during single exhalation in the healthy subjects was non linear and could be described by a polynomial model. The two explanations for such behaviour seem to be in accordance with the results found in our study: one explanation entails the sequential emptying profile of the lung (i.e. the " first in-last out phenomenon") which accounts for the difference in the contribution of alveolar gas concentration. Indeed, it is well known that the gas sampled at higher lung volume generally reflects the contribution from the lower part of the lung and of the faster units, which empty earlier and probably have a different regional concentration of tracer gas. The other explanation may reside in the time-constants of the lung units, which are increased in diseased lungs. As a matter of fact, by looking at the methane profile during exhalation of a COPD patient (Figure 1, right side) its steeper decreasing slope from TLC to RV is evident. This increase may primarily suggest that the recovery of the concentration of the inhaled inert gas is progressively diminishing towards residual volume, which may result in an increased time constant of lung units. The heterogeneous profile of inert gas methane during exhalation, amplified in COPD, is ultimately responsible for the differences in the calculations of the alveolar volume and it allowed us to derive the index named DeltaVA/VE (changes in percentage of the alveolar volume for each litre of expired volume exhaled), which seems to reflect the effect of the phenomena described above. In fact, this index DeltaVA/VE, as direct expression of the non-uniform distribution of ventilation, resulted significantly higher – in quantitative terms – in COPD than in healthy individuals (Figure 5). As a matter of fact, we propose this index as a very rapid, non invasive and simple tool that can be obtained routinely in patients to help the pulmonologists evaluate the effect of inhomogeneity of ventilation in the course of the single breath-hold test. Finally, the changes of the alveolar volume from TLC to RV measured by quintiles were 0.110 litres in the healthy individuals, 1.332 litres in COPD patients (Figures 2 and 3). Instead, when we use the ATS-ERS method to compare the alveolar volume with that derived from the average of the alveolar volume measured in each quintile we find similarity in healthy individuals (VAst 5.10 ± 1.33 litres vs VAq 5.15 ± 1.34 litres, p = ns) but significant differences, as expected, in COPD patients (VAst 4.98 ± 1.04 vs VAq 5.36 ± 1.57 litres, p < 0.0001).

### Assessment of gas exchange in lung disease: balancing accuracy against feasibility [^2e11de8d]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

While the principles underlying alveolar gas exchange have been well-known for over 50 years, we still struggle to assess gas exchange in hypoxemic patients. Unfortunately, simple measurements lack discrimination while complex measurements are infeasible in clinical care. The paper by Karbing et al. in this issue seeks a middle ground based on the arterial PO2 (PaO2)/inspired O2 fraction (FIO2) ratio measured at different FIO2s with the outcomes fed into proprietary software to account for both shunting and ventilation/perfusion inequality. Whether this is the optimal compromise between measurement difficulty and information available will have to be answered by those willing to test the approach in their own patients.

### Defining hyperinflation as' dynamic': moving toward the slope [^e5857618]. Respiratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Measuring the severity of dynamic hyperinflation is a useful clinical approach to assess the effect of therapeutic interventions and explain their impact on exercise tolerance. Dynamic hyperinflation is typically quantified by the change in end expiratory lung volume from rest to the end of exercise. The result may be inconsistent with disease severity and does not clearly explain how exercise tolerance improves with therapy. Using a re-examination of selected studies, we suggest an operational definition of dynamic hyperinflation using the slope derived from serial measures of inspiratory capacity expressed as a linear function of ventilation that clearly differentiates whether therapies affect static or dynamic hyperinflation or affect lung volume only as a consequence of reducing ventilation. With this approach, the magnitude of the result is consistent with disease severity and is a more reliable outcome as it uses serial measures rather than a single time point estimate. The therapies re-evaluated are breathing helium or hyperoxic gas mixtures, bronchodilation and exercise training. A clear definition of dynamic hyperinflation will assist clinicians in assessing the impact of therapeutic interventions.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: patient-ventilator assessment [^77bd48a3]. Respiratory Care (2024). High credibility.

Patient–ventilator assessment for lung-protective ventilation — definition and evidence — includes targeting physiologic tidal volume (VT) based on predicted body weight, limiting end-inspiratory plateau pressure (Pplat) to ≤ 30 cmH₂O, appropriate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and limiting driving pressure; physiologic VT in humans is 4–8 mL/kg/predicted body weight. In adults with ARDS, the ARDS Network reported a significant reduction in mortality (9% absolute reduction) when targeting 6 mL/kg/predicted body weight (Pplat ≤ 30 cm H2O) compared to 12 mL/kg/predicted body weight (Pplat ≤ 50 cm H2O); appropriate PEEP should be set to avoid the opening and closing of alveoli during the respiratory cycle (atelectrauma) without contributing to alveolar overdistention. In adults without ARDS, a meta-analysis of 20 RCTs (n = 2,822) found lower VT reduced mortality (6.5% vs 10.7%; relative risk 0.64 [95% CI 0.46–0.86]), reduced development of lung injury (relative risk 0.33 [95% CI 0.23–0.47]), and did not shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation (standardized mean difference 0.48 [95% CI −0.53 to 1.27]); there were no differences in gas exchange or oxygenation as measured by the PaO2/FIO2. In emergency departments, a systematic review and meta-analysis including 11 studies of 12,912 adults found lower VT associated with decreased mortality (odds ratio 0.80 [95% CI 0.72–0.88]), decreased hospital length of stay (mean difference −1.0 [95% CI −2.3 to −0.1] d), and increased ventilator-free days (1.4 [95% CI 0.4–2.4] d).

The open circle symbols represent the results of virtual wall simulations. The solid black lines denote the theoretical predictions of our proposed model. The insets illustrate the channel schematic.

For gas flow through channels with finite length, the end effect must be taken into account. Pressure loss at the inlet and outlet of a finite channel can be identified in numerical solutions of Boltzmann kinetic equationas well as our MD simulations (Supplementary Figure 4). The concept of effective channel length was proposed to assess influence of end effects on rarefied gas flows –. Under the diffuse reflection assumption, the evaluation of gas flow in the framework of Knudsen theory can be reduced to calculating, which is independent on gas pressure. The Clausing-type integral equations and its series expansions can givewhich is capable to describe gas flow rate for either long or short channels, indicating that the end effect has been integrated into. The derivation of Smoluchowski model neglects the fact that the channel has a finite length. In this work, the suppressed dissipation flow rate due to the presence of specular reflections is evaluated under the complete diffuse-scattering boundary condition, as seen in Eq. (3). In this sense, the proposed model has taken account of the end effect.

### Improving lung compliance by external compression of the chest wall [^5d149082]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Paradoxical responses to chest wall compression

From the preceding discussion it is should be clear that external compression of the chest wall reduces chest wall compliance, so that the expected response to sustaining such maneuvers with tidal volume and PEEP unchanged would be to increase tidal plateau and driving pressures, indicating reduced tidal compliance of the respiratory system. That expectation rests, however, on the assumption that lungs' compliance is not simultaneously improved by the imposed change in chest wall stiffness. Indeed, such assumptions do usually apply. However, extensive recent experience with one specialized form of ARDS, COVID-19 pneumonia (CARDS), has demonstrated that violations of that expectation do occur under some conditions, with important implications for ventilator management.

COVID-19 has challenged the clinician's understanding of certain aspects of ARDS and in the process has broadened perspectives regarding the underlying physiology that should guide its ventilation. For example, despite severely impaired oxygenation, the gas volume and respiratory system compliance of patients with C-ARDS initially may be quite well preserved. However, unresolving late phase C-ARDS may be characterized by impressive loss of aeratable lung units, in part due to fibroblastic proliferation and organization within the parenchyma. In this latter setting, recent reports indicate that late phase patients unexpectedly experienced improved respiratory system compliance and gas exchange in response to compressive sternal or abdominal pressures that were applied steadily (Fig. 1). In a report by Kummer and colleagues, lung protective tidal volumes and modest PEEP were applied using volume control ventilation during both phases of multiple tidal cycles for about ten seconds. No end-expiratory gas trapping (auto-PEEP) was detected with or without loading, even though compression during loading increased resistance detectably in some patients (Fig. 2). Several possibilities, alone or in combination, might account for this apparently paradoxical improvement of tidal compliance by local chest wall compression. Conceivably, an induced differential of regional pleural pressures might open otherwise closed lung sectors (expanding the capacity of the 'baby lung') and/or redistribute transpulmonary pressures to favor more compliant lung zones with higher volumetric reserve capacity.

### A molecularly impermeable polymer from two-dimensional polyaramids [^3489f5f7]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance of the rim seal in forming persistent bulges

Eliminating interfacial leakage is essential to measure the intrinsic permeability of a suspended film; hence, various efforts such as ultrahigh pressure sealing with a diamond AFM tipand the fabrication of graphitic microwells, have been pursued to improve the rim seal for suspended graphene. The effects of eliminating interfacial leakage can be substantial. By suspending graphene monolayers on graphitic rather than Si/SiO 2 microwells, gas efflux was eliminated entirely. To control the internal gas environment of a persistent bulge without interfacial leakage, the following must occur: the interfacial rim seal must open on external gas exposure, sufficient time must be given for pressure equilibration on both sides of the film, and the rim seal must close after removing the external gas.

Non-deflected films suspended over microwells often indicate a poorly sealed interface, leading to the quick deflation of bulges formed after pressurizing. By contrast, the existence of negatively deflected films (that is, downwards dimples) necessitates an adequate rim seal to prevent atmospheric air from equilibrating the negatively pressurized microwell. We therefore put emphasis on starting with downwards dimples to minimize effects from defective rim seals and maximize the success rate of pressurizing bulges with desired gases.

The ideal gas law dictates that ambient gas trapped in the microwell at an elevated temperature when the rim seal is formed will have a lower pressure than the atmosphere on cooling. We targeted the formation of negatively deflected films by annealing our sample overnight at 50 °C immediately after transferring the film to the Si/SiO 2 substrate. Pressurizing negatively deflected films led to a near-perfect rate of forming persistent bulges when using N 2.

### Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation in acute exacerbations of COPD patients with mild respiratory acidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^c45d383d]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation

The IPV device was developed by Forrest M. Bird in 1979 (Fig. 1). IPV is a ventilatory technique that delivers small bursts of high flow respiratory gas into the lung at high rates. This causes airway pressures to oscillate between 5 and 35 cmH 2 O and the airway walls vibrate in synchrony with these oscillations. A unique sliding venturi called a phasitron (Fig. 2) is powered by compressed gas at 25 to 40 pounds per square inch and generates these oscillations in the range of 80 to 650 cycles per minute. During inspiration the high frequency gas pulse expands the lungs and vibrates and enlarges the airways. This technique may be associated with nebulization and has the potential to improve secretion clearance. During the percussive bursts of air into the lungs, a continued pressure is maintained, while a high velocity percussive inflow opens airways and enhances intra-bronchial secretion mobilization.

Patients assigned to the IPV group received the same medication as the patients in the standard-treatment group with the addition of two sessions of IPV per day. No patient in either group received externally applied treatments designed to clear mucus. IPV sessions were performed by the specialized and trained respiratory therapist and delivered to the patient through a full face mask (La Cigogne, Pessac, France). The mask was adjusted and connected to the intrapulmonary percussive ventilator (IPV1 device, Percussionaire Corp. Sandpoint, ID, USA). After the mask had been secured, the percussions were delivered into the lungs of the patient. The frequency of the percussion was initially set at 250/minute and the peak pressure was initially set at 20 cmH 2 O. Frequency and peak pressure were adjusted for each patient to improve comfort and to be certain that the entire thorax was being percussed; this was done on the basis of visualization of external thoracic movements and perception of thrill on the patient's thorax. The inspiration-to-expiration ratio was adjusted to 1/2.5. During IPV sessions, the nebulizer delivered only NaCl 0.9%. Oxygen was fed into the mask to maintain oxygen saturation between 88% and 92%. The duration of each IPV session was 30 minutes. Between periods of IPV, patients breathed oxygen spontaneously while arterial oxygen saturation was continuously monitored. IPV sessions were stopped when the patients reached a RR of < 25/min and a pH > 7.38 in spontaneous breathing without worsening for 24 h.

### Dynamic hyperinflation and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure in ARDS patients [^c635c3d0]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with acute respiratory failure, changes in respiratory mechanical properties (compliance and resistance) can cause incomplete deflation of the respiratory system at end-expiration, promoting dynamic hyperinflation. When this happens, the alveolar pressure at end-expiration can exceed atmospheric pressure or the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) applied during mechanical ventilation, generating an occult or intrinsic PEEP. Thus, in mechanically ventilated patients, the total PEEP is the sum of the external PEEP provided by the ventilator and the intrinsic PEEP when present. Hyperinflation and intrinsic PEEP have been reported in up to 90% of the patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This is due to dynamic airway compression with an increase in lung compliance that can limit expiratory flow. This limitation is seen when, at a given lung volume, expiratory flow cannot be increased by raising the expiratory driving pressure, which is the difference between the plateau and expiratory pressures at the Y-piece.

In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intrinsic PEEP has been mainly reported only in the first days of mechanical ventilation with lower levels than in COPD patients. In one of the first descriptions, Rossi et al. reported intrinsic PEEP in 10 of 14 patients, with values from 0.5 to 7.5 cmH 2 O. Furthermore, when intrinsic PEEP is not taken into consideration, respiratory compliance can be significantly underestimated by about 48%. Expiratory flow limitation is the main cause of intrinsic PEEP in 80–90% of ARDS patients. The severity of the limitation closely relates with intrinsic PEEP and diminishes with the application of an external PEEP.

In addition to the expiratory flow limitation, which mainly occurs during active breathing, in sedated ARDS patients, other mechanisms can be involved in the generation of intrinsic PEEP, such as mechanical ventilation per se or the ventilatory setting. In ARDS patients, lung-protective ventilation with a low tidal volume and moderate/high respiratory rate to avoid or limit respiratory acidosis has been reported to promote the development of intrinsic PEEP and dynamic hyperinflation.

In up to 20% of ARDS patients, an airway closure (defined as the lack of communication between the proximal airways and alveoli) can be another factor responsible for the development of intrinsic PEEP.

The aim of this study was to evaluate, in a large population of mechanically ventilated ARDS patients, the presence and amount of intrinsic PEEP, any associated factors (patients' characteristics and ventilator settings), and the effects of two different levels of external PEEP on intrinsic PEEP.

### ACR-ACNM-SNMMI-SPR-STR practice parameter for the performance of pulmonary scintigraphy [^535b0f09]. SPR/ACNM/STR/ACR/SNMMI (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary ventilation imaging — xenon-133 dosing and facility requirements — notes that Xenon-133, a radioactive gas, is administered by mask and requires a delivery and trapping system or external exhaust system. Administered activity is Adults: 370–1,110 MBq (10–30 mCi); Pediatrics: 11.1 MBq/kg (0.3 mCi/kg), with Minimum: 111 MBq (3.0 mCi). A room with negative pressure ventilation is desirable and is also dependent on the individual state regulatory requirements, and care should be exercised to prevent leakage of the radiopharmaceutical into the environment; a xenon trap should be used. Patients who are severely dyspneic or who are on ventilator support may not be able to undergo xenon-133 ventilation imaging; special adapters may be available to administer xenon-133 through an endotracheal tube, and if available, aerosol ventilation imaging may be an alternative for these patients.

### Untethered soft actuators for soft standalone robotics [^a4b76506]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Yet, the most problematic hurdle, which even affects the overall performance and potential applications of soft robots, arises from the external wiring. Here, wires or wiring mean the external tether that connects the soft robot and the power source for the power supply: they do not refer to the electric wires inside the soft robot. A great number of the existing soft robots often rely on bulky pneumatic pumps or complex electrical wiring to supply the driving force for soft actuators via external power sources. Prior works on soft robots usually utilize the pump to create pressure or fluid flow, which drives the mechanical motion of the actuator, and electric motors can also generate mechanical motion with the electrical input. However, the incorporation of wires for the power source circumscribes the functionality and movement of soft robots despite the favorable characteristics of soft robots. For instance, when navigating through a tortuous path or reaching a site to which human beings do not access, the pneumatic tubes or wires exert a tension force on the robots and hinder their physical movements. In this regard, recent studies reported new types of soft actuators that do not accompany pneumatic pumps or electrical wirings to enhance the mobility of the soft robots and also to endow the robots with versatile functionalities.

For pneumatic actuators, the pneumatic pumps serve an essential role in generating a mechanical force by using compressed gas or moving the liquid for the rapid fluid pressure increase. Yet, the incorporation of the pneumatic pump into the soft robotics would impair the mobility and the core functionalities of the soft robots because the pumps are usually relatively bulky and heavy when compared to the soft robots themselves. To address this issue, several recent studies demonstrated pump-less pneumatic actuation by employing the phase change materials that generate the volume change as the materials switch between liquid and gaseous states, thus resulting in the inflation and deflation of actuators. Here, the pump-less pneumatic actuators can be defined as the soft actuators that do not use the actual pump but generate a pneumatic force by the phase change of material just as if utilizing the pneumatic pump. In other words, the pump-less pneumatic actuators just reproduce the end effect of the pump by a different working mechanism without using the actual pump. The absence of the pneumatic pump in the robotic design also eliminates the need for pneumatic tubes to infuse/extract air into/from the actuator, thereby making the design completely untethered.

### ACR / SNMMI / SPR practice guideline for the performance of pulmonary scintigraphy in adults and children [^ecac3aad]. SNMMI (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary ventilation imaging — xenon-133 protocol and dosing are outlined: Xenon-133, a radioactive gas, is administered by mask with a delivery and trapping system or external exhaust system; the usual administered activity for adults is 10 to 30 millicuries (370 to 1,110 MBq), and the administered activity for children is 0.3 millicuries/kg with a minimum of 3.0 millicuries (111 MBq). A special room with negative pressure ventilation is desirable, and patients who are severely dyspneic or on ventilator support may not be able to undergo xenon-133 ventilation imaging. The ventilation phase is usually, but not always, performed before the perfusion images, and three sets of images are usually obtained in the posterior projection: an inhalation view; an equilibration phase during which the patient rebreathes xenon-133 and oxygen, usually for 2 to 3 minutes, with 1 or 2 images acquired; and a wash-out phase with serial images at 15 to 60 second intervals for 5 minutes or until wash-out is complete; right and left posterior oblique equilibrium images may also be obtained early in the equilibrium phase and/or during wash-out (typically during the third and fourth minutes of wash-out).

Back-extrapolated volume (BEV) on the volume–time curve — Time 0 is found by drawing a line with a slope equal to peak flow through the point of peak flow on the volume–time curve and setting Time 0 to the point where this line intersects the time axis. The BEV is equal to the volume of gas exhaled before Time 0, which, in these two examples from the same patient, is 0.136 L for the left panel (acceptable) and 0.248 L for the right panel (unacceptable). For this patient, the BEV limit is 5% FVC = 0.225 L.

### A membrane-free electrochemical reactor for efficient oxygen removal via gravity-assisted product self-separation [^d270db80]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The internal O 2 is reduced to OH −, which remains dissolved in the electrolyte. Because the buoyancy mechanism spontaneously separates O 2 from the liquid phase, no ion-exchange membrane or forced circulation is required, with the electrolyte serving as both the ion conduction medium and the gravitational separation medium. The cathode, being at the bottom of the module, must withstand substantial hydrostatic pressure, so we implemented an integrative GDE with enhanced mechanical strength and a stable pore structure, which will be discussed in the following content. This design establishes a self-organizing "O 2 ladder", allowing bubbles to naturally ascend. By eliminating the need for costly membrane components or external pumping, we significantly reduce system complexity and operational costs while maintaining high O 2 removal efficiency. Furthermore, the minimized contact between O 2 bubbles and the low-O 2 zone at the cathode reduces unwanted reoxidation or backflow, enhancing the longevity and performance consistency of the reactor. In summary, our reactor utilizes bubble buoyancy to enable efficient, membrane-free O 2 removal.

### Rationale of dead space measurement by volumetric capnography [^e2baa1ef]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2012). Low credibility.

Dead space is the portion of a tidal volume that does not participate in gas exchange because it does not get in contact with blood flowing through the pulmonary capillaries. It is commonly calculated using volumetric capnography, the plot of expired carbon dioxide (CO(2)) versus tidal volume, which is an easy bedside assessment of the inefficiency of a particular ventilatory setting. Today, Bohr's original dead space can be calculated in an entirely noninvasive and breath-by-breath manner as the mean alveolar partial pressure of CO(2) (Paco(2)) which can now be determined directly from the capnogram. The value derived from Enghoff's modification of Bohr's formula (using Paco(2) instead of PACO(2)) is a global index of the inefficiency of gas exchange rather than a true "dead space" because it is influenced by all causes of ventilation/perfusion mismatching, from real dead space to shunt. Therefore, the results obtained by Bohr's and Enghoff's formulas have different physiological meanings and clinicians must be conscious of such differences when interpreting patient data. In this article, we describe the rationale of dead space measurements by volumetric capnography and discuss its main clinical implications and the misconceptions surrounding it.

### Preschool multiple-breath washout testing. An official American Thoracic Society technical statement [^3e266b87]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Preschool multiple-breath washout (MBW) — equipment-related dead space (Vd): Manufacturers of commercial devices must consider equipment-related Vd carefully to reduce effects on breathing pattern and end-expiratory lung volume (EELV). Increasing equipment-related Vd leads to increased Vd/Vt, decreasing effective ventilation, and may trigger compensatory changes in breathing pattern and/or EELV; this is particularly relevant to preschool-age subjects. Adult data show an increasing detrimental effect of Vd on LCI across the Vd range of 0–5 ml/kg with no clear threshold, so Vd should be minimized wherever possible within an MBW system; in healthy preschool subjects, no direct effect on breathing pattern was detectable at a Vd range of 1.49–2.55 ml/kg, and the threshold remains unclear. In 10 healthy adult subjects tested across five Vd values (standard, +50 ml, +100 ml, +150 ml, and +200 ml), the magnitude of effect observed on LCI suggests a 10% increase in LCI for each 1-ml/kg increase in equipment-related Vd. Correction algorithms for LCI have been proposed, but further work is required before any firm recommendations can be made; recommendations to correct FRC for Vd exist and are routinely applied in practice, yet the impact of increased Vd on EELV and therefore FRC is currently unclear. For facemask testing, the Vd of a facemask is difficult to measure; estimates of facemask Vd should not be incorporated into corrections applied to the pre–gas sampling point Vd for cumulative expired volume or FRC calculation, and introduced facemask Vd must be minimized by selection of the smallest appropriate size.

### Precipitation induced by explosive volcanism on mars and its implications for unexpected equatorial ice [^dc3fc6e3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Eruption parameters

The MER describes the intensity of an explosive eruption. Total (i.e. ash+gas) MERs for explosive terrestrial silicic and andesitic eruptions typically range from 10 6 to 10 8 kg s −1, whereas explosive basaltic eruptions typically range from 10 3 to 10 6 kg s −1, although rates of up to 10 8 kg s −1 have been estimated for basalts. Silicic and andesitic magmas result in higher MERs, not only because they tend to have higher total volatile contents, but also because the high silica content of the magma results in high viscosity magmas that entrap volcanic gases and promote high-explosivity eruptions. Basaltic magmas, however, tend to have lower volatile concentrations and have lower silica contents and thus, have lower viscosities, which may allow for more effective passive gas escape, the combined effect resulting in lower MERs. Martian volcanic materials consist predominantly of low-silica basalts, reflecting a general scarcity of more evolved lava compositions. While basaltic magmas typically erupt effusively or with low explosivity on Earth, theoretical studies suggest that early Martian eruptions may have been more explosive due to the planet's lower gravity (3.7 m s −2 on Mars versus 9.8 m s −2 on Earth). Lower gravity on Mars reduces lithostatic pressure at depth, facilitating volatile exsolution, bubble nucleation, and magma disruption deeper within the subsurface. Consequently, microlite nucleation may also happen earlier, significantly increasing magma viscosity. Early bubble nucleation provides more time for gas expansion during ascent, increasing gas volume and buoyancy, which accelerates magma rise. As the magma ascends rapidly, gas expands violently when near-surface pressure drops, leading to fragmentation and potentially higher MERs. Additionally, lower gravity promotes taller eruption columns that carry particles to greater vertical and lateral distances, creating the potential for ash and ice to cover greater areas. The presence of abundant surface water on early Mars could further enhance explosivity when magma interacts with external water. As a result, explosive basaltic eruptions on early Mars may have resembled terrestrial Plinian eruptions, reaching heights of tens of kilometers. As Mars transitioned into the Hesperian and atmospheric pressure declined, the thinning atmosphere — combined with the planet's low gravity — may have further amplified the explosivity of volcanic eruptions, potentially driving plumes into an inertial regime, behaving more like jets in which pyroclasts travel ballistically, governed primarily by inertia and gravity.

### Practical assessment of risk of VILI from ventilating power: a conceptual model [^89dec3d7]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

At the bedside, assessing the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) requires parameters readily measured by the clinician. For this purpose, driving pressure (DP) and end-inspiratory static 'plateau' pressure ([Formula: see text]) of the tidal cycle are unquestionably useful but lack key information relating to associated volume changes and cumulative strain. 'Mechanical power', a clinical term which incorporates all dissipated ('non-elastic') and conserved ('elastic') energy components of inflation, has drawn considerable interest as a comprehensive 'umbrella' variable that accounts for the influence of ventilating frequency per minute as well as the energy cost per tidal cycle. Yet, like the raw values of DP and [Formula: see text], the absolute levels of energy and power by themselves may not carry sufficiently precise information to guide safe ventilatory practice. In previous work we introduced the concept of 'damaging energy per cycle'. Here we describe how-if only in concept-the bedside clinician might gauge the theoretical hazard of delivered energy using easily observed static circuit pressures ([Formula: see text] and positive end expiratory pressure) and an estimate of the maximally tolerated (threshold) non-dissipated ('elastic') airway pressure that reflects the pressure component applied to the alveolar tissues. Because its core inputs are already in use and familiar in daily practice, the simplified mathematical model we propose here for damaging energy and power may promote deeper comprehension of the key factors in play to improve lung protective ventilation.

### Tuning porosity in macroscopic monolithic metal-organic frameworks for exceptional natural gas storage [^ee09bca0]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

We have reported the synthesis of high density, centimetre-scale monoliths of UiO-66 without the use of high pressures or chemical binders. The obtained monoliths show high thermal, mechanical and chemical stability, characteristic of industrially viable Zr-MOFs. Crucially, we have developed a synthetic procedure that enables modulation of the extrinsic pore-size distribution within the monolithic macrostructures. Via the controlled variation of synthetic parameters, we have demonstrated that precise volumes of meso- and macroporosity, external to the MOFs crystalline structure, can be built into the material. Through the subsequent optimisation of both PSD and density, we have achieved benchmark results for gas storage. We studied CH 4 and CO 2 uptake capacity in a selection of mono UiO-66 samples with high microporosity and varied mesoporosity/density, demonstrating Type II isotherms, which yield improvements in working capacity compared with previous work on UiO-66. We used GCMC simulations to demonstrate that the physical origin of this enhanced uptake capacity lies in substantial gas condensation in the mesopores at high pressure.

The use of UiO-66, which demonstrates a relatively poor interaction with CH 4 at low pressure, combined with optimisation of its PSD to include finely tuned volumes of narrow mesoporosity, resulted in a volumetric CH 4 working capacity of 172 cm 3 (STP) cm −3 at 65 bar and 261 cm 3 (STP) cm −3 at 100 bar, an 11% improvement over the benchmark of mono HKUST-1. Although a higher, yet still industrially reasonable, maximum working pressure is required, this result represents a step further in the design of materials for maximised CH 4 working capacity, making it unique among air-stable MOFs. This result not only expands our understanding of the experimental capabilities of porous MOFs but has major implications for real-world applications of MOFs in the crucial field of environmental fuel distribution.

### Gas transport mechanisms during high-frequency ventilation [^e80a0f87]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The studies detailed in investigated higher frequencies up to 19 Hz and 40 Hz, whereas the study of Wanigasekara and co-workers, although the upper limit is not currently clinically practical, reported frequencies up to sixteen times greater than those currently used in clinical practice. The studies report that gas transport can be maintained with increased frequencies, and proportionally smaller tidal volumes, and therefore subsequent reduction in the fluctuation of cyclic tissue strain.

In Fig. 4 we show the results from in the same parameters used for the physiological measurement data displayed in Fig. 2. Again, the flow cost of achieving ventilation is plotted as a function of the square of the Womersley parameter in the very high frequency domain. Here we consider ventilation as the strength of the nonlinear mean streaming. An important finding from the work of Venegas et al. and Venegas and Fredberg was the observation of a transition point, discussed here in the section titled: Outcomes from RLC-type models. This transition point between the conventional and high-frequency domains indicated that the flow cost of achieving ventilation in the high-frequency domain scaled differently to that of the conventional domain, with respect to the frequency, suggesting a change in the mechanisms of gas transport. The work of explored significantly higher frequency protocols than that of contemporary modelling and clinical practice and Figs. 2 and 4 suggest that there is a second transition at much higher Womersley parameters.

Fig. 4
The flow cost of achieving ventilation, plotted as a function of the square of the Womersley parameter, from the data in the study from Wanigasekara and co-workers. The length scale for the Womersley parameter is based on a trachea diameter of 3 mm

The modelling detailed in doesn't explicitly consider the contributions from individual gas transport mechanisms, but rather considers a global contribution to the overall gas transport. Figure 4, reproduced from the work in, considers explicitly one alternative gas transport mechanism operating in the airway, namely nonlinear mean streaming. The first data point in Fig. 4 corresponds to values close to the current clinical protocol for the treatment of infants. Figure 4 shows that when the square of the Womersley parameter is doubled there is a significant increase in the efficiency of ventilation. These results from displayed using the flow cost of achieving ventilation framework proposed in support the observation, detailed in Fig. 2, that there is potentially another optimum that is significantly removed from the current implementation of clinical HFV when the viscous time scale is targeted.

### Distributed direct air capture of carbon dioxide by synergistic water harvesting [^c467f84a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To address the harsh conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1), we introduce in situ vapor promoted desorption to achieve efficient adsorbent regeneration with an R value exceeding 0.9. This VPD process promotes CO 2 adsorbent regeneration via in situ vapor purge using water harvested from the atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 1b, compared with conventional TVSA with a desorption pressure of 10 kPa, our VPD process can significantly reduce CO 2 partial pressure by vapor purge, providing a tremendous driving force for CO 2 desorption, leading to an increased working capacity and regeneration efficiency.

The entire process is composed of four stages (Fig. 1c) namely, adsorption, preheating, desorption, and cooling. In the adsorption stage, two adsorbents sequentially packed in the column adsorb CO 2 and H 2 O from the air. Subsequently, the temperature of the adsorbent bed is elevated through solar or electrical heating. The CO 2 and vapors with increased partial pressures displace air inside the column, thereby preventing oxidative degradation of the adsorbent at high temperatures. During the desorption stage, the increased vapor partial pressure reduces the carbon dioxide partial pressure and promotes the regeneration of solid amine sorbents. This desorption approach only requires thermal energy, which can be obtained from diverse sources like waste heat or sunlight, to raise the adsorbent temperatures and perform regeneration (Fig. 1d), eliminating the need for an external purge supply or vacuum pumps. The water in the product stream is easily condensed and separated, leaving high-purity CO 2. After collecting the products, fresh air is introduced to lower the adsorbent temperature and initiate the next adsorption cycle.

### Barotrauma [^ac242bf1]. Injury (2004). Low credibility.

Barotrauma is pressure-induced injury. The application of direct pressure to the body may cause trauma, including positive pressure from artificial ventilation. Trauma may also be caused by the effects of pressure changes on gas-containing body spaces, not in communication with the environment. This can include the external ear, the middle ear (and, indirectly, the inner ear), the para-nasal sinuses, the lungs, the gut, and abscess cavities (for example, in the teeth). Gas may penetrate tissues adjoining the affected space (such as the anterior cranial fossa, via the ethmoid sinus), or may embolise via the blood stream. The most severe expression of this is cerebral arterial gas embolism, which may present as a stroke. The management of these problems includes prevention, the use of pressure-equalizing techniques, vasoconstrictor drugs, surgery, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

### Measurement of air trapping, intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure, and dynamic hyperinflation in mechanically ventilated patients [^a1ac6a5d]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

Severe airflow obstruction is a common cause of acute respiratory failure. Dynamic hyperinflation affects tidal ventilation, increases airways resistance, and causes intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP). Most patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have dynamic hyperinflation and auto-PEEP during mechanical ventilation, which can cause hemodynamic compromise and barotrauma. Auto-PEEP can be identified in passively breathing patients by observation of real-time ventilator flow and pressure graphics. In spontaneously breathing patients, auto-PEEP is measured by simultaneous recordings of esophageal and flow waveforms. The ventilatory pattern should be directed toward minimizing dynamic hyperinflation and auto-PEEP by using small tidal volume and preserving expiratory time. With a spontaneously breathing patient, to reduce the work of breathing and improve patient-ventilator interaction, it is crucial to set an adequate inspiratory flow, inspiratory time, trigger sensitivity, and ventilator-applied PEEP. Ventilator graphics are invaluable for monitoring and treatment decisions at the bedside.

### Force-driven reversible liquid-gas phase transition mediated by elastic nanosponges [^ac6ec6f1]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Nano-confined spaces in nanoporous materials enable anomalous physicochemical phenomena. While most nanoporous materials including metal-organic frameworks are mechanically hard, graphene-based nanoporous materials possess significant elasticity and behave as nanosponges that enable the force-driven liquid-gas phase transition of guest molecules. In this work, we demonstrate force-driven liquid-gas phase transition mediated by nanosponges, which may be suitable in high-efficiency heat management. Compression and free-expansion of the nanosponge afford cooling upon evaporation and heating upon condensation, respectively, which are opposite to the force-driven solid-solid phase transition in shape-memory metals. The present mechanism can be applied to green refrigerants such as H 2 O and alcohols, and the available latent heat is at least as high as 192kJkg -1. Cooling systems using such nanosponges can potentially achieve high coefficients of performance by decreasing the Young's modulus of the nanosponge.

Ventilation metrics and inhaled gas distribution define alveolar ventilation, V A, as the rate of fresh gas delivery to the alveolar space, and in MRI and nitrogen washout studies specific ventilation (SV) is defined as the fraction of the original regional lung gas volume at end-expiration that is replaced by a volume of fresh air or tracer gas with each breath; SV is used to describe overall ventilation heterogeneity in multiple-breath washout studies, and fractional ventilation, a related volume measure, is sometimes used to measure the fraction of end-inspiratory lung volume that is made up of fresh air (or tracer gas).

Numerator definition — the PM numerator is the number of instances that LTVV was achieved, defined by a tidal volume range of 4–8 ml/kg predicted body weight (PBW) and an inspiratory pressure less than 30 cm H2O; although a stricter goal of 6 ml/kg PBW was considered and the guideline recommends starting at 6 ml/kg PBW and increasing tidal volume to no more than 8 ml/kg PBW only when certain circumstances, to simplify reporting and mirror the recommendation language the PM tidal volume was kept at 4–8 ml/kg PBW.

Assessing ventilation and inhaled gas distribution — alveolar ventilation, "V̇A, is the rate of fresh gas delivery to the alveolar space (the dot denotes a rate)". In MRI and nitrogen washout studies, specific ventilation (SV) "is defined as the fraction of the original regional lung gas volume at end-expiration (Vr) that is replaced by a volume of fresh air or tracer gas (Ve) with each breath: SV = Ve / Vr (1)", and "is used to describe overall ventilation heterogeneity… in multiple-breath washout studies". Alternatively, "fractional ventilation… is sometimes used to measure the fraction of end-inspiratory lung volume that is made up of fresh air (or tracer gas)…: Fractional ventilation = Ve / (Ve + Vr) = SV / (1 + SV) (2)". "V̇A is a metric of primary importance for gas exchange".

### Estimation of dead space fraction can be simplified in the acute respiratory distress syndrome [^93a89647]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome are characterized by a non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema responsible for a significant impairment of gas exchange. The pulmonary dead space increase, which is due primarily to an alteration in pulmonary blood flow distribution, is largely responsible for carbon dioxide retention. Previous studies, computing the pulmonary dead space by measuring the expired carbon dioxide and the Enghoff equation, found that the dead space fraction was significantly higher in the non-survivors; it was even an independent risk of death. The computation of the dead space not by measuring the expired carbon dioxide but by applying a rearranged alveolar gas equation that takes into account only the weight, age, height, and temperature of the patient could lead to widespread clinical diffusion of this measurement at the bedside.

### Best clinical practices for the sleep center adjustment of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in stable chronic alveolar hypoventilation syndromes [^008791dd]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2010). Medium credibility.

NPPV titration — leak measurement and interpretation: "The NPPV device measurement of leak using an internal flow sensor is an acceptable method to estimate leak. A signal reflecting leak should be monitored and recorded if possible" (LEVEL A - CONSENSUS). The document specifies that "The total flow is partitioned into a bias portion (leak) and a variable portion (patient flow). The leak is composed of the intentional leak + unintentional leak (mask or mouth leak)", that "As delivered pressure increases during the titration, the total leak will increase", and therefore "what constitutes an inappropriately high leak will depend on interface and pressure delivered".

### Tailoring the separation properties of flexible metal-organic frameworks using mechanical pressure [^6ad4bfc6]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Metal-organic frameworks are widely considered for the separation of chemical mixtures due to their adjustable physical and chemical properties. However, while much effort is currently devoted to developing new adsorbents for a given separation, an ideal scenario would involve a single adsorbent for multiple separations. Porous materials exhibiting framework flexibility offer unique opportunities to tune these properties since the pore size and shape can be controlled by the application of external stimuli. Here, we establish a proof-of-concept for the molecular sieving separation of species with similar sizes (CO 2 /N 2 and CO 2 /CH 4), via precise mechanical control of the pore size aperture in a flexible metal-organic framework. Besides its infinite selectivity for the considered gas mixtures, this material shows excellent regeneration capability when releasing the external mechanical constraint. This strategy, combining an external stimulus applied to a structurally compliant adsorbent, offers a promising avenue for addressing some of the most challenging gas separations.

### Bedside calculation of mechanical power during volume-and pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation [^c0257a18]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Volume-controlled ventilation

For volume-controlled ventilation, Gattinoni et al. originally proposed an equation that was complicated to compute at the bedside because it included all the respiratory physiological variables. The same authors proposed also a simpler equation that, starting from the measured values of peak, plateau and end-expiratory pressure was mathematically identical to the original one, allowing to calculate MP with the data displayed by the ventilator, provided that an end-inspiratory hold was performed. We called this "comprehensive formula". Recently, Giosa and colleagues proposed a surrogate formula that allowed to calculate MP without the inspiratory hold. In their original paper, however, the equation was not tested against the reference geometrical method. The present study indicates that for volume-controlled ventilation, the MP measured by the comprehensive and the surrogate equations were highly correlated with the reference-standard geometric method, with limits of agreement mostly within 2 J/min. This advocates that the simpler surrogate formula is of high clinical utility, allowing to quickly calculate MP even in settings where performing an inspiratory hold is either not possible (operating theater, patient transport) or not feasible (elevated number of patients and/or staff shortage). Of note, the fixed value for resistances assumed by the surrogate equation quite likely underestimates the "real" MP at high inspiratory flow rates, as the calculated resistances tend to increase because of the turbulent motion component. However, Giosa et al. found that even doubling the resistance up to 20 cmH 2 O s/L, the underestimation bias remained quite low — in the order of 1.3 J/min. In the current study, to assess this surrogate method at two different resistances (high and low) directly against the geometric method, we applied high and low inspiratory flows (30 and 60 L/min). At both levels, the error between the geometric and the surrogate methods remained clinically negligible.

### Enhanced carbon dioxide conversion at ambient conditions via a pore enrichment effect [^6d9eb635]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Besides the influence on the uptake amount, we further study the pore enrichment effect on the catalytic reaction. The external and internal pressures of the gas-filled Zn 113 and Zn 321 were compared. In Zn 113, there is obvious CO 2 enrichment, but the captured CO 2 in Zn 321 is evenly distributed around the framework. Figure 3b shows that the internal pressure increases with the external pressure. When the external pressure is 1 bar, the internal pressure for Zn 113 and Zn 321 is 25.3 and 4.97 bar, respectively. As the external pressure increases to 10 bar, the internal pressure reaches 57.2 and 36.4 bar, respectively. The gap between Zn 113 and Zn 321 indicates that the pore enrichment effect favours an increase in the gas pressure in the pore. We further studied the pore enrichment effect on the reaction rate (k PC) of the coupling reaction of CO 2 and propylene oxide (PO) into propylene carbonate (PC), based on the rate Eq. (1) as follow, where, A is the pre-exponential factor, E a is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, [CO 2] and [PO] is the concentration of reactants, and m and n is the reaction order. Here, they both equal to 1. Additionally, because the central metal elements of the catalysts are both zinc and the species of reactants are the same, we assumed that E a and A in the catalytic processes using Zn 113 and Zn 321 are the same, thus the reaction rate can be approximately only proportional to [CO 2] inside the pore. We compared the increment values (Ik) of k Zn113 and k Zn321 under internal pressure to the ones under external pressure, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3c, d. As a whole, when the external pressure increases gradually, the pore enrichment effect will weaken. However, at 1 bar external pressure, Ik Zn113 is the highest (29.3 times) and Ik Zn321 is only 5.07. As the external pressure increases, Ik Zn113 and Ik Zn321 fall to 9.13 and 4.39, respectively. This result shows that the increment change of k Zn113 is more obvious, especially at low pressure. But for Zn 321, the increment changes a little from 1 to 10 bar. It reflects that the pore enrichment effect in Zn 113 is much stronger than Zn 321 as shown in the analysis results of CO 2 average densities. Due to the obvious pore enrichment effect, it is easy for Zn 113 to implement catalytic reactions requiring high-pressure conditions under atmospheric pressure.

9.3. CALIBRATION

The calibration stability of the BreathID®System is ensured by the Meridian proprietary 12CO2 and 13CO2 Isotope Specific Infrared (ISIR) lamps. The physical process underlying gas discharge emissions supports this stability. The emissions are caused by molecular rotation-vibration transitions, each generating a spectral line at a specific wavelength, uniquely defined to an accuracy of better than 0.01 Å (Angstrom). Five gas samples of known concentration and isotope ratio are used to adjust the absorption cell calibration curves, aiming to attain identical isotope ratios over the collection range of CO2 concentrations. This will ensure accurate readings in both negative and positive samples. In addition, quality checks as described below in section 9.4 are performed automatically by the BreathID®device every 60 days in order to ensure the system performs within established limits, and calibration is performed if required.
