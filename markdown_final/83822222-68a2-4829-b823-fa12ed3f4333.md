## Question

can you give hyddroxizine with risperal and lithium…

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether combining hydroxyzine with risperidone and lithium is appropriate, what the key interaction risks are, and how to monitor and dose safely in clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the evidence base and labeled information for risperidone plus lithium. Then, I should verify hydroxyzine's pharmacodynamic burdens, especially CNS depression and QT prolongation. Next, I will check for pharmacokinetic interactions and phenoconversion risks. After that, I need to stratify patient risk and outline monitoring. Finally, I will consider dosing adjustments and synthesize a practical, cautious plan.

> Let me first confirm the core duo. Risperidone plus lithium is an evidence-based, guideline-supported regimen for acute mania and maintenance, and the risperidone label states repeated doses do not meaningfully change lithium exposure, so dose adjustment for lithium is not recommended; this combination is widely used in practice and supported by guidelines for bipolar I, including first-line positioning for antimanic therapy and maintenance options with long-acting risperidone formulations as adjuncts to mood stabilizers [^1122kRKf] [^1147PKec] [^111i2q4o] [^1145zQsf] [^114iztbf].

> Now, I need to check hydroxyzine's main liabilities. Hydroxyzine is a sedating first-generation antihistamine; its label cautions about additive CNS depression with other centrally acting drugs and advises reducing the dose of concomitant CNS depressants, with explicit warnings about drowsiness, psychomotor impairment, and avoiding driving or machinery while taking it, which clearly overlaps with risperidone's own CNS effects and cautions when combined with centrally acting drugs [^113NsSyY] [^1122kRKf] [^114si9UN].

> Hold on, I should verify cardiac risk because that is often underestimated. Hydroxyzine carries postmarketing reports of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, particularly in the presence of additional risk factors or other QT-prolonging drugs; risperidone has documented associations with arrhythmias and QTc prolongation across class data, so the combination can produce additive risk in susceptible patients, warranting baseline and follow-up ECGs and electrolyte assessment when cardiac risk factors are present or when other QT-prolonging agents are onboard [^113NsSyY] [^115q4rEg].

> I will now examine the lithium–antipsychotic neurotoxicity signal. Although risperidone itself does not alter lithium exposure, rare encephalopathic or NMS-like syndromes have been reported with lithium plus antipsychotics in general; the prochlorperazine label is a classic source warning to monitor for early signs such as fever, rigidity, confusion, and laboratory abnormalities and to discontinue if they emerge, and this should be kept in mind while also respecting lithium's narrow therapeutic index and overdose risk [^1141B9w2] [^116SffNV].

> Next, I should review pharmacokinetics and phenoconversion issues. Wait, let me verify the main interaction vectors for risperidone: coadministration with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (for example, fluoxetine or paroxetine) substantially increases risperidone exposure and can shift the active moiety balance; enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine decrease active moiety concentrations, and real-world polypharmacy can effectively phenoconvert a patient's CYP2D6 status, altering exposure and tolerability, so I need to ensure the full medication list is reviewed before adding hydroxyzine and after any psychotropic changes [^112kFoaX] [^111YvpQq] [^112WFCB7].

> Let me consider patient-level risk stratification before deciding. Elderly patients, those with renal impairment, cardiac disease, hepatic dysfunction, or on multiple sedatives and QT-prolonging agents are at higher risk of oversedation, falls, arrhythmias, and lithium accumulation; in renal impairment with creatinine clearance under 50 mL/min, hydroxyzine dose should be reduced by 50%, whereas no renal adjustment is needed above 50 mL/min, and in any setting with increased vulnerability to respiratory depression, conservative dosing and close monitoring are prudent [^116nC3Bh] [^1151HPxR] [^116RU2Tj].

> I should confirm an appropriate monitoring framework. For lithium, maintain guideline-informed serum targets and monitor levels and renal function at regular intervals, with readiness to intensify checks if clinical status or interacting drugs change; for hydroxyzine and risperidone, monitor for sedation, orthostasis, extrapyramidal symptoms, and perform baseline and follow-up ECG and electrolytes in patients with QT risk or when dose changes occur, while reinforcing no alcohol, no driving when sedated, and fall precautions [^115wWXEL] [^116SffNV] [^113NsSyY] [^1122kRKf].

> Now to dosing decisions, and I need to be careful. Initially, I was going to say "reduce hydroxyzine by 50% when combined with CNS depressants", because a 50% reduction sounded like a clean rule of thumb; but wait, let me verify the label language and not jump to conclusions. The hydroxyzine label actually says the dose of concomitant CNS depressants should be reduced when used with hydroxyzine, and the explicit 50% dose reduction pertains to hydroxyzine in patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min, not to routine coadministration with other sedatives; correction: there is no fixed 50% rule for hydroxyzine solely due to combination with risperidone, so I should start low, go slow, and titrate based on sedation and clinical need, for example considering a low single bedtime dose with reassessment rather than a predetermined percentage reduction [^113NsSyY] [^116nC3Bh].

> Let me reconsider the evidentiary context for adding hydroxyzine at all. While risperidone plus lithium is evidence-based for mania and maintenance, I should confirm that guidelines for bipolar disorder do not endorse hydroxyzine for core mood stabilization; hydroxyzine is typically an off-label symptomatic adjunct for anxiety or insomnia, and standard bipolar guidelines emphasize optimizing mood stabilizers and antipsychotics rather than adding sedating antihistamines, so the indication must be explicit, benefits must outweigh additive sedation and QT risk, and alternatives should be considered if risk is high or benefit marginal [^111i2q4o] [^114iztbf].

> Pulling this together, my synthesis is that risperidone plus lithium is appropriate with established efficacy and no meaningful pharmacokinetic interaction, and adding hydroxyzine is clinically permissible but requires caution due to additive CNS depression, orthostasis, and QT risk; therefore, I need to ensure clear indication, assess QT and fall risk, review all interacting drugs including CYP2D6 modifiers, obtain baseline ECG and electrolytes in at-risk patients, start hydroxyzine conservatively at bedtime with careful reassessment, educate the patient about sedation and driving risks, and maintain close lithium and renal monitoring, with a low threshold to discontinue hydroxyzine if sedation or cardiac concerns arise [^1122kRKf] [^113NsSyY] [^1141B9w2] [^115wWXEL].

---

Yes, hydroxyzine can be coadministered with risperidone and lithium, but requires cautious monitoring for additive sedation [^113NsSyY], QT prolongation [^114si9UN], and neurotoxicity. Although there are no direct pharmacokinetic interactions [^1122kRKf], the combination increases the risk of CNS depression, cardiac arrhythmias [^115q4rEg], and rare lithium–antipsychotic neurotoxicity [^1141B9w2]. Use the lowest effective doses, monitor ECG and electrolytes, and watch for neurologic symptoms.

## Pharmacological considerations

### Pharmacokinetic interactions

- **Hydroxyzine and risperidone**: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction; hydroxyzine is not a CYP inhibitor/inducer, and risperidone is a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor.

- **Hydroxyzine and lithium**: No known pharmacokinetic interaction; hydroxyzine does not affect lithium clearance.

- **Risperidone and lithium**: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction [^1147PKec]; risperidone does not alter lithium exposure or peak levels [^1122kRKf].

---

### Pharmacodynamic interactions

- **CNS depression**: Hydroxyzine and risperidone both cause sedation [^113NsSyY]; combined use increases CNS depression and impairment risk [^114si9UN].

- **QT prolongation**: Hydroxyzine and risperidone can prolong QT [^113NsSyY]; combined use increases arrhythmia risk, especially with other risk factors [^115q4rEg].

- **Neurotoxicity**: Lithium plus antipsychotics can cause rare encephalopathic syndromes (weakness, lethargy, tremor, confusion, EPS, leukocytosis, elevated enzymes) that may be irreversible [^1141B9w2]; monitor closely and stop if signs appear [^113K229s].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Evidence and guidelines indicate that risperidone plus lithium is effective for acute mania [^111uiN1P] [^113CYxbC] and maintenance in bipolar disorder [^1145zQsf]. Hydroxyzine is used for anxiety, pruritus, and sedation [^113NsSyY]; use caution when it is combined with CNS depressants or other QT-prolonging drugs [^114si9UN]. Guidelines support risperidone with lithium for acute mania, whereas hydroxyzine is not specifically addressed and should be used cautiously because of sedation and QT risk [^111i2q4o] [^114iztbf] [^114quTJt].

## Potential risks and adverse effects

| **Adverse effect** | **Hydroxyzine** | **Risperidone** | **Lithium** | **Combined risk** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Sedation | Yes | Yes | No | Increased |
| QT prolongation | Yes | Yes | No | Increased |
| Neurotoxicity | No | Rare | Yes | Increased |
| Extrapyramidal symptoms | No | Yes | No | Increased |
| Hyperprolactinemia | No | Yes | No | Increased |
| Metabolic syndrome | No | Yes | No | Increased |
| Lithium toxicity | No | No | Yes | Increased |

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

- **Baseline assessment**: Obtain ECG, electrolytes, renal and thyroid function, and lithium level before starting combination therapy [^116SffNV].

- **Dose adjustments**: Use the lowest effective doses; reduce hydroxyzine if sedation occurs [^113NsSyY].

- **Regular monitoring**: Check lithium levels [^116SffNV], renal and thyroid function, and ECG periodically [^114si9UN]; monitor for neurotoxicity and QT prolongation.

- **Patient education**: Counsel on sedation, arrhythmia, and neurotoxicity symptoms; advise against alcohol and other CNS depressants [^113NsSyY].

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient populations

In clinical practice, **Appropriate use** includes considering this approach for severe anxiety or pruritus requiring sedation, with careful monitoring [^113NsSyY]. Caution or avoidance is advised for patients with **QT risk factors** [^114si9UN], **renal impairment** [^116nC3Bh], or a history of **neuroleptic malignant syndrome** [^113K229s].

---

Hydroxyzine may be combined with risperidone and lithium when clinically indicated, but requires careful monitoring for sedation [^113NsSyY], QT prolongation [^114si9UN], and neurotoxicity [^1141B9w2]. Use the lowest effective doses, monitor ECG and electrolytes, and educate patients about warning symptoms.

## References

### Risperdal [^1122kRKf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Pharmacokinetic-related interactions**: The dose of Risperdal should be adjusted when used in combination with CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine and paroxetine) and enzyme inducers (e.g. carbamazepine) [see Table 18 and Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Dose adjustment is not recommended for Risperdal when co-administered with ranitidine, cimetidine, amitriptyline, or erythromycin [see Table 18].

- **Effect of risperidone on other drugs**:
	- **Lithium**: Repeated oral doses of Risperdal (3 mg twice daily) did not affect the exposure (AUC) or peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of lithium (n = 13). Dose adjustment for lithium is not recommended.
	- **Valproate**: Repeated oral doses of Risperdal (4 mg once daily) did not affect the pre-dose or average plasma concentrations and exposure (AUC) of valproate (1000 mg/day in three divided doses) compared to placebo (n = 21). However, there was a 20% increase in valproate peak plasma concentration (Cmax) after concomitant administration of Risperdal. Dose adjustment for valproate is not recommended.
	- **Digoxin**: Risperdal (0.25 mg twice daily) did not show a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. Dose adjustment for digoxin is not recommended.

- **Pharmacodynamic-related interactions**:
	- **Centrally acting drugs and alcohol**: Given the primary CNS effects of risperidone, caution should be used when Risperdal is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol.
	- **Drugs with hypotensive effects**: Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, Risperdal may enhance the hypotensive effects of other therapies.

### Hydroxyzine pamoate [^113NsSyY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Precautions**: The potentiating action of hydroxyzine must be considered when the drug is used in conjunction with central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as narcotics, non-narcotic analgesics, and barbiturates. Therefore, when CNS depressants are administered concomitantly with hydroxyzine, their dosage should be reduced. Since drowsiness may occur with the use of the drug, patients should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery while taking hydroxyzine pamoate. Patients should be advised against the simultaneous use of other CNS depressant drugs and cautioned that the effect of alcohol may be increased.

- **QT prolongation/torsade de pointes (TdP)**: Cases of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes have been reported during postmarketing use of hydroxyzine. The majority of reports occurred in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation/TdP (e.g. pre-existing heart disease, electrolyte imbalances, or concomitant arrhythmogenic drug use). Therefore, hydroxyzine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, congenital long QT syndrome, a family history of long QT syndrome, other conditions that predispose to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, as well as recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, and bradyarrhythmias.

Caution is recommended during the concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval. These include Class 1A (e.g. quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmics, and certain antipsychotics.

### Prochlorperazine edisylate [^1141B9w2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

An encephalopathic syndrome characterized by weakness, lethargy, fever, tremulousness, confusion, extrapyramidal symptoms, leukocytosis, elevated serum enzymes, BUN, and FBS, has been observed in a few patients treated with lithium plus an antipsychotic. In some cases, this syndrome was followed by irreversible brain damage. Due to a possible causal relationship between these events and the concomitant administration of lithium and antipsychotics, patients receiving such combined therapy should be closely monitored for early signs of neurologic toxicity. If such signs appear, treatment should be discontinued promptly. This encephalopathic syndrome may be similar to or the same as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).

Patients with bone marrow depression or who have previously demonstrated a hypersensitivity reaction, such as blood dyscrasias or jaundice, with a phenothiazine should not receive any phenothiazine, including prochlorperazine, unless in the judgment of the physician, the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the possible hazards.

Prochlorperazine may impair mental and/or physical abilities, especially during the first few days of therapy. Therefore, patients should be cautioned about engaging in activities requiring alertness, such as operating vehicles or machinery.

Phenothiazines may intensify or prolong the action of central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, anesthetics, and narcotics.

- **Pregnancy**: Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following birth.

### Acute treatment of mania: an update on new medications [^111bWgC1]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Acute mania is frequently a medical emergency requiring hospitalization for behavioral control, rapid resolution of irritability, agitation, de-escalation of mood, and reduction in risk-taking behavior. The efficacy of lithium in managing acute mania was reported in 1949, and it was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1970. Chlorpromazine, from the class of typical antipsychotics, was approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder in 1973. Typical antipsychotics were frequently used alone and as adjuncts for the treatment of bipolar mania over the next two decades. Divalproex was approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute mania in 1994.

Since the approval of olanzapine in 2000, all five atypical antipsychotics, namely risperidone (2003), quetiapine (2004), ziprasidone (2004), and aripiprazole (2004), have been approved by the FDA for the management of acute mania. Clozapine remains the only atypical antipsychotic not approved by the FDA for any phase of bipolar disorder. This article systematically reviews some of the major published studies, randomized controlled monotherapies, and adjunct therapy trials involving five atypical antipsychotics and newer anticonvulsants for the treatment of acute bipolar mania.

### Variability and efficacy in treatment effects on manic symptoms with lithium, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics in acute bipolar mania: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116ZYv6F]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

Acute mania is a psychiatric emergency requiring rapid management. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown considerable individual differences in treatment effects on manic symptoms with antimanic drugs.

- **Methods**: We searched the MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify RCTs without language restrictions from inception to April 19, 2022. We included double-blind RCTs of oral antimanic monotherapy versus placebo in adult patients. The primary outcome was variability in improvement of manic symptoms (assessed using the coefficient of variation ratio [CVR]). The secondary outcomes were overall improvement of manic symptoms and acceptability (i.e. discontinuation for any reason). The pooled effects of outcomes were calculated by random-effects meta-analyses using restricted maximum likelihood methods. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB) Assessment Tool. This study was registered with OSF (DOI:10.17605/OSF. IO/G4JNY).

- **Findings**: We included 39 RCTs (N = 12,150; mean age = 39.9 years, interquartile range [IQR] = 38.7–41.1; mean proportion of female = 48.6%, IQR = 42.3%-52.3%) and investigated 14 antimanic drugs. We found that eight antimanic drugs compared to placebo were associated with lower CVRs (95% confidence interval [CI]; I²), including risperidone (0.51; 0.37–0.70; 0%), haloperidol (0.54; 0.44–0.67; 4%), olanzapine (0.59; 0.44–0.79; 47%), ziprasidone (0.61; 0.53–0.71; 0%), lithium (0.63; 0.52–0.76; 0%), quetiapine (0.65; 0.48–0.87; 2%), aripiprazole (0.68; 0.56–0.84; 25%).

- **Step 3: Add on or switch therapy (alternate first-line agents)**: If therapy with one or a combination of the first-line agents (lithium, divalproex, and/or an atypical antipsychotic) at optimal doses is inadequate or not tolerated, the next step is to switch to or add on an alternate first-line agent. An exception is that, despite level 1 evidence for monotherapy with paliperidone and ziprasidone, we do not recommend combination therapy with these agents due to a lack of evidence for additional efficacy (see "No specific recommendation/agents that require further study" below). Because there are multiple first-line agents with substantial efficacy data and relative safety and tolerability, the use of second- and third-line agents is only recommended after unsuccessful trials of multiple first-line strategies.

- **Step 4: Add on or switch therapy (second-line agents)**: In patients who are inadequately responsive to first-line agents, second-line choices include monotherapy with olanzapine (level 1), carbamazepine (level 1), ziprasidone (level 1), and haloperidol (level 1), or combination therapy with olanzapine plus lithium or divalproex (level 1). While each of these strategies has strong support for their efficacy, as indicated above, safety and tolerability concerns relegate them to second-line options. Although widely used in clinical practice, the combination of lithium and divalproex is also recommended as a second-line choice, as evidence supporting its efficacy is limited to uncontrolled trials (level 3). ECT is also recommended.

### Combination therapy versus monotherapy in bipolar disorder [^114vSSs2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Patients experiencing breakthrough manic or mixed episodes during maintenance therapy for bipolar disorder should first be assessed to ensure they are receiving an optimal dose of the first-line medication. If further intervention is needed, one option is to combine an atypical antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer. The decision to use a particular combination should be made based on the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of each medication for individual patients. Psychosocial therapy as an adjunct to medication is also useful in delaying relapse.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^112ufPqE]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

For several decades, lithium has been and remains the "gold standard" first-line treatment for patients living with BP-I, followed by other oral medications such as olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone orally disintegrating tablets. Despite declining prescription rates during the past decade due to the adverse-event and toxicity burden, lithium is used because of its effectiveness in both BP-I and BP-II, including for the prevention of suicidal behavior. In recent years, long-acting injectables (LAIs) such as aripiprazole and risperidone have emerged as potential maintenance treatment options for patients living with BP-I, including early in the course of the illness. At present, aripiprazole and risperidone are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, the use of LAIs for bipolar disorder is currently off-label in Europe according to European Medicines Agency recommendations. Compared to oral antipsychotics, which are shorter acting and must be taken more frequently, LAIs are designed to provide relief of symptoms by slowly releasing the drug over an extended period (weeks to months). Studies in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder suggest that LAIs may provide additional benefits over oral antipsychotics by reducing the rates of re-hospitalization and risk of relapse, improving overall quality of life, and improving adherence to treatment. However, LAIs are not routinely offered to patients living with BP-I, for reasons that will be explored in this expert consensus report.

The main objectives of this article are to highlight the potential benefits of LAIs in the management of BP-I.

### Rykindo extended-release microspheres [^1145zQsf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The effectiveness of RYKINDO as an adjunct to treatment with lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder is based on an adequate and well-controlled study of risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular). The results of the adequate and well-controlled study are presented below.

The efficacy of risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) was established in a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adult patients who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar Disorder Type I and who experienced at least 4 episodes of mood disorder requiring psychiatric/clinical intervention in the previous 12 months, including at least 2 episodes in the 6 months prior to the start of the study.

A total of 240 patients were treated during a 16-week open-label period with risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) (starting dose of 25 mg, and titrated, if deemed clinically desirable, to 37.5 mg or 50 mg), as adjunctive therapy in addition to continuing their usual treatment for bipolar disorder, which consisted of mood stabilizers (primarily lithium and valproate), antidepressants, and/or anxiolytics. All oral antipsychotics were discontinued after the first three weeks after the initial injection of risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular). In the open-label phase, 124 (51.7%) were judged to be stable for at least the last 4 weeks and were randomized to double-blind treatment with either the same dose of risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) or placebo.

### SPL drug information for hydroxyzine pamoate [^114si9UN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of hydroxyzine pamoate PO (also known as Vistaril):

- **Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as hydroxyzine has rarely been associated with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis.

- **CNS depression**: Use extreme caution when using concurrently with CNS depressants, such as narcotics, non-narcotic analgesics, and barbiturates.

- **Somnolence**: Use extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.

- **Torsade de pointes**: Use caution in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, congenital long QT syndrome, a family history of long QT syndrome, other conditions predisposing to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia or taking other QT-prolonging drugs, as well as recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, and bradyarrhythmias.

### Perseris [^1147PKec]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Effects of oral risperidone on pharmacokinetics of other drugs:

- **Lithium**: Repeated doses of oral risperidone (3 mg twice daily) did not affect the exposure (AUC) or peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of lithium (n = 13).

- **Valproate**: Repeated doses of oral risperidone (4 mg once daily) did not affect the pre-dose or average plasma concentrations and exposure (AUC) of valproate (1000 mg/day in three divided doses) compared to placebo (n = 21). However, there was a 20% increase in valproate peak plasma concentration (Cmax) after concomitant administration of oral risperidone.

- **Topiramate**: Oral risperidone administered at doses from 1 to 6 mg/day concomitantly with topiramate 400 mg/day resulted in a 23% decrease in risperidone Cmax and a 33% decrease in risperidone AUC0–12hour at steady state. Minimal reductions in the exposure to risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone combined, and no change for 9-hydroxyrisperidone were observed. This interaction is unlikely to be of clinical significance. There was no clinically relevant effect of oral risperidone on the pharmacokinetics of topiramate.

- **Digoxin**: Oral risperidone (0.25 mg twice daily) did not show a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.

- **CYP2D6 substrates (donepezil and galantamine)**: In vitro studies indicate that risperidone is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Therefore, Perseris is not expected to substantially inhibit the clearance of drugs that are metabolized by this enzymatic pathway. In drug interaction studies, oral risperidone did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of donepezil.

### Benefits and harms of risperidone and paliperidone for treatment of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: a meta-analysis involving individual participant data and clinical study reports [^117Y47TH]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are highly prevalent and debilitating severe mental illnesses worldwide. Patients often experience both simultaneously because they share a similar causative process of diagnoses.

Risperidone is a leading second-generation antipsychotic drug approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and adolescents and for the short-term treatment of manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder. It is indexed on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines as one of the most effective and safe medicines. However, the manufacturers, Johnson & Johnson, have been involved in over 13,500 legal cases due to their failure to disclose that risperidone may cause hormonal imbalances, potentially leading to breast tissue development (gynecomastia) and increased blood prolactin levels (galactorrhea hyperprolactinemia) in boys and girls. Additionally, there have been black box warnings regarding the misleading marketing of the drug for off-label uses in children and adolescents with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and in elderly patients with dementia. Moreover, the clinical benefit of risperidone is questionable when compared to other antipsychotics and was recently found to be only the sixth best treatment option for overall change in symptoms of schizophrenia.

Paliperidone is another second-generation antipsychotic drug also manufactured by Johnson & Johnson and used to treat schizophrenia. As both risperidone and paliperidone act via the same pathways in the body, research suggests strong links to drug-induced hormonal changes.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) collaborative update of CANMAT guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder: Update 2013 [^111p1MiM]. Bipolar Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments published guidelines for the management of bipolar disorder in 2005, with updates in 2007 and 2009. This third update, in conjunction with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders, reviews new evidence and is designed to be used in conjunction with the previous publications. The recommendations for the management of acute mania remain largely unchanged. Lithium, valproate, and several atypical antipsychotic agents continue to be first-line treatments for acute mania. Monotherapy with asenapine, paliperidone extended release (ER), and divalproex ER, as well as adjunctive asenapine, have been added as first-line options.

For the management of bipolar depression, lithium, lamotrigine, and quetiapine monotherapy, as well as olanzapine plus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and lithium or divalproex plus SSRI/bupropion remain first-line options. Lurasidone monotherapy and the combination of lurasidone or lamotrigine plus lithium or divalproex have been added as second-line options. Ziprasidone alone or as adjunctive therapy, and adjunctive levetiracetam have been added as not-recommended options for the treatment of bipolar depression.

Lithium, lamotrigine, valproate, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, risperidone long-acting injection, and adjunctive ziprasidone continue to be first-line options for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Asenapine alone or as adjunctive therapy have been added as third-line options.

### Monotherapy versus combined treatment with second-generation antipsychotics in bipolar disorder [^1174gqH7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The American Psychiatric Association guidelines for treating bipolar disorder recommend combination therapies to treat patients experiencing severe acute manic or mixed episodes and breakthrough manic or mixed episodes during maintenance therapy. Combination therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acute manic states include the use of second-generation antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and aripiprazole in combination with lithium or divalproex; for the treatment of acute bipolar depression, the olanzapine plus fluoxetine combination; and for maintenance treatment, quetiapine combined with lithium or valproate.

When combining medications for the management of patients with bipolar disorders, physicians face a potentially complex treatment strategy. Available agents have different mechanisms of action, routes of metabolism and excretion, therapeutic effects, and side effects. Combining treatments can be advantageous owing to therapeutic synergy; however, there is a liability in the increased possibility of adverse effects. The decision to use a combination therapy should be made on the basis of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of each medication and their specific combination for individual patients.

### Drug interactions in the treatment of Parkinson's disease [^111Fj9Mv]. Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

In recent years, the antiparkinsonian drug regime has become increasingly complicated. A wide range of antiparkinson agents is now available. Combination therapies may unfortunately induce interactions, potentially leading to life-threatening events. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered before starting a patient on combination treatments. Moreover, the frequent multimorbidity of patients with Parkinson's disease necessitates the application of additional drugs. A general overview is challenging to maintain due to the countless possible interactions. Cautious proceeding is certainly indicated in particular cases. The most common interactions will be discussed below; however, we should bear in mind that many interactions related to drug combinations are still unknown.

### Clinical pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of antimanic and mood-stabilizing medications [^113LYopB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

A number of medications are now available or are in development as antimanic and/or mood-stabilizing agents. We reviewed the clinical pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of these agents to provide a summary of these properties relevant to clinical practice.

- **Method**: We conducted a MEDLINE search, augmented by a manual search of bibliographies and a review of textbooks, to identify articles regarding the clinical pharmacology of lithium, valproate, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, quetiapine, lamotrigine, and topiramate.

- **Results**: Not surprisingly, there are a number of clinically relevant pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences among these medications, and these differences are discussed.

- **Conclusion**: Knowledge of the clinical pharmacology of established and putative antimanic and mood-stabilizing medications is important in administering these agents safely and effectively.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^1124XbHA]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of bipolar disorder, specifically in the context of maintenance therapy, the DoD/VA 2023 guidelines suggest offering oral olanzapine, oral paliperidone, or risperidone long-acting injectables for the prevention of mania recurrence. This is suggested if lithium and quetiapine are not used, based on patient preference and characteristics.

### Redefining mood stabilization [^1159nZMw]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

This review considers the definition of the term 'mood-stabilizer' in the context of new pharmacological agents for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Three definitions of a mood-stabilizer are described, and the available data from randomized, double-blind, controlled trials for putative mood-stabilizers studied in the treatment of different aspects of bipolar disorder — mania, mixed states, depression, and maintenance — are reviewed. No available agent meets the criteria for a comprehensive mood-stabilizer, although lithium comes the closest.

### Caplyta [^1144jQ5a]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Caplyta is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and for depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or II disorder (bipolar depression) in adults. It can be used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate [see Clinical Studies (14.1) and (14.2)].

### Drug interactions of lithium and other antimanic/mood-stabilizing medications [^112bVaCU]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Treatments for bipolar disorder often consist of a combination of two or more medications with mood-stabilizing properties. Lithium is the only agent that has shown efficacy for the treatment of acute mania and acute depression, as well as for the prevention of the recurrence of mania and depression in patients with bipolar disorder. Other agents frequently used as mood stabilizers, in monotherapy and in combination with lithium, are valproate and carbamazepine.

Several other drugs with mood-stabilizing properties are used in many combinations to effectively manage the spectrum of symptoms of bipolar disorder throughout the acute and maintenance phases. However, side effects and drug-interaction precautions accompany all agents used to treat bipolar disorder. It can often be difficult to determine whether a patient is suffering from side effects of treatment or symptoms of the illness itself.

It is important to use the lowest effective dose of any treatment medication, monitor laboratory values closely, and be familiar with the side effects and interaction precautions of each medication a patient is taking. Successful management of medications for patients with bipolar disorder is a challenge, but increased effort and vigilance by clinicians can lead to a reduced risk of hospitalization and fewer office visits for patients.

### Variability and efficacy in treatment effects on manic symptoms with lithium, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics in acute bipolar mania: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116SSFdq]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

Acute mania is a psychiatric emergency requiring rapid management. However, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown considerable individual differences in treatment effects on manic symptoms with antimanic drugs.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify RCTs without language restrictions from inception to April 19, 2022. We included double-blind RCTs of oral antimanic monotherapy versus placebo in adult patients. The primary outcome was variability in improvement of manic symptoms, assessed using the coefficient of variation ratio (CVR). The secondary outcomes were overall improvement of manic symptoms and acceptability (i.e. discontinuation for any reason). The pooled effects of outcomes were calculated by random-effects meta-analyses using restricted maximum likelihood methods. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB) Assessment Tool. This study was registered with OSF (DOI:10.17605/OSF. IO/G4JNY).

- **Findings**: We included 39 RCTs (N = 12150; mean age = 39.9 years, interquartile range [IQR] = 38.7–41.1; mean proportion of female = 48.6%, IQR = 42.3%-52.3%) and investigated 14 antimanic drugs. We found that eight antimanic drugs compared to placebo were associated with lower CVRs (95% confidence interval [CI]; I²). This includes risperidone (0.51; 0.37–0.70; 0%), haloperidol (0.54; 0.44–0.67; 4%), olanzapine (0.59; 0.44–0.79; 47%), ziprasidone (0.61; 0.53–0.71; 0%), lithium (0.63; 0.52–0.76; 0%), quetiapine (0.65; 0.48–0.87; 2%), and aripiprazole (0.68; 0.56–0.84).

### Treatment moderators and predictors of outcome in the treatment of early age mania (TEAM) study [^1154g7nz]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder in youth remain the subject of debate. In the Treatment of Early Age Mania (TEAM) study, risperidone was more effective than lithium or divalproex in children diagnosed with bipolar mania and highly comorbid with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We searched for treatment moderators and predictors of outcome.

TEAM was a multi-site, 8-week, randomized clinical trial of risperidone, lithium, or divalproex in 279 medication-naïve patients, aged 6 through 15 years, with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder currently in manic or mixed phase. Outcome measures included binary end-of-treatment responder status and change in the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) Mania Rating Scale (KMRS). Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were tested as modifiers of treatment effect and as overall predictors of outcome.

Moderator effects were detected for site, ADHD, and obesity. Across sites, the response ratio (RR) for risperidone versus lithium ranged from 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.8–1.7) to 8.3 (95% CI = 1.1–60.8), and for risperidone versus divalproex from 1.3 (95% CI = 0.8–2.2) to 10.5 (95% CI = 1.4–77.7). The RR for risperidone versus lithium was 2.1 for patients with ADHD, but 1.0 for those without ADHD, and 2.3 (95% CI = 1.6–3.3) for nonobese patients, but 1.1 (95% CI = 0.6–2.0) for obese ones. Older age and less severe ADHD symptoms were associated with greater improvement on the KMRS.

Risperidone was more effective.

### Bipolar disorder: Assessment and management [^115wWXEL]. NICE (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for lithium toxicity, specifically in the context of laboratory monitoring for patients taking lithium, the NICE 2014 guidelines provide detailed recommendations. These guidelines suggest maintaining serum lithium levels at 0.8–1.0 mEq/L (0.8–1.0 mmol/L) for a trial period of at least 6 months in patients with bipolar disorder who:

- **Experienced a relapse while taking lithium in the past**: Regular monitoring of serum lithium levels is crucial to prevent potential toxicity and ensure effective management.

- **Are taking lithium and experiencing subthreshold symptoms with functional impairment**: This indicates a need for careful evaluation to optimize treatment outcomes.

### Risperidone versus typical antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia [^112Thj2z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). High credibility.

Risperidone is one of the 'new generation' antipsychotics. In addition to its reputed tendency to cause fewer movement disorders than older drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, it is claimed that risperidone may improve negative symptoms.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of risperidone for schizophrenia in comparison to 'conventional' neuroleptic drugs.

- **Search strategy**: The original electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1980–1997), Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (1997), The Cochrane Library (1997, Issue 1), EMBASE (1980–1997), MEDLINE (1966–1997), PsycLIT (1974–1997), and SCISEARCH (1997) were updated with a new electronic search of the same databases in 2002. The search term used in the update was identical to that used in 1997. Any new studies or relevant references were added to the review. In addition, references of all identified studies were searched for further trial citations. Pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials were also contacted.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized trials comparing risperidone to any 'conventional' neuroleptic treatment for people with schizophrenia or other similar serious mental illnesses.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Citations and, where possible, abstracts were independently inspected by reviewers, papers ordered, re-inspected, and quality assessed. Data were also independently extracted. Where possible, sensitivity analyses on the dose of risperidone, haloperidol, and duration of illness were undertaken for the primary outcomes of clinical improvement and side effects (movement disorders).

### What is a mood stabilizer [^1177veiK]. Psychological Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The concept of mood stability is attractive to both patients and clinicians alike, and hence the term "mood stabilizer" has widespread currency. However, its worldwide acceptance and use in clinical practice is at odds with the absence of official recognition by regulatory authorities.

The ideal mood stabilizer is said to have efficacy in the treatment of acute manic and depressive episodes and also be effective in the prevention of recurrences. However, in reality, few drugs, with perhaps the exception of lithium, come close to this gold standard; yet many agents aspire to the title, and some have arguably achieved it prematurely.

It is, therefore, important to reconsider the definition of a mood stabilizer and critically review which agents, if any, satisfy the necessary eligibility requirements by reference to reasonable criteria and comparator data. The term "mood stabilizer" is an important label. It needs to be applied judiciously because it confers clinical credibility and qualifies long-term use in maintenance and prophylaxis.

It is also important with respect to developing guidelines for treatment and the further development of novel agents. Most importantly, however, it is a term that is innately appealing because of what it promises; for this reason alone, it should encompass only those agents that can deliver.

### Safety of psychotropic medications in people with COVID-19: Evidence review and practical recommendations [^116RU2Tj]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Based on the considerations reported above and after collegial discussion, and taking into consideration values, feasibility, resource use, and certainty of the evidence according to the Evidence-to-Decision framework (see Additional File 1: Table S9), the following practical recommendations were formulated:

- **Risk and severity of drug interactions**: The risk and severity of drug–drug pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between COVID-19 medical treatments and psychotropic medications should always be assessed, taking into account the additional vulnerability related to the underlying medical condition (e.g. cardiovascular conditions increasing the risk of QTc prolongation). In cases of high-risk interactions, the combination should be avoided if possible. For moderate-risk interactions, dose adjustments, psychotropic medication withdrawal, or a switch to a safer medication should be considered. In low-risk interactions, regular monitoring should be provided, with dose adjustments as clinically appropriate. In very low-risk interactions, regular monitoring is suggested (see Table 2 and Additional File 1: Table S8).

- **Psychotropic-related risk of respiratory depression**: An estimation of psychotropic-related risk of respiratory depression should systematically take into account the following: (a) the intrinsic sedative properties of psychotropic medications, their half-life (higher risk for longer half-life), and the dose; and (b) the occurrence of other aspects possibly impairing respiration (e.g. reduced motility, sialorrhea), along with pharmacokinetic interactions raising plasma levels of sedative medication.

### Employing pharmacologic treatment of bipolar disorder to greatest effect [^114RZZv3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Mechanisms of action, onset and duration of action, and interactions with other medications — these pharmacokinetic properties of pharmacologic agents affect the efficacy and safety of therapeutic regimens for bipolar disorder. For example, antiglutamatergic agents such as lamotrigine may relieve depression but have no impact on mania. Atypical antipsychotics, with the dual effect of blocking dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain, decrease psychosis and mania, and, according to some preliminary indications, possibly depression. The impact of these properties has been borne out in clinical studies. Mood stabilizers such as lithium and valproate stabilize mood by significantly decreasing the manic and hypomanic symptoms of bipolar disorder, although they can have effects on depressive symptoms too. Lamotrigine stabilizes mood by reducing depression. The atypical antipsychotics have been shown to be effective either as monotherapy or in combination with mood stabilizers.

### High dose antipsychotic polypharmacy and dopamine partial agonists - time to rethink guidelines [^117FpApx]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

The combination of two antipsychotic agents in this manner may exceed the high dose threshold. Such cumulative doses are perceived as high risk and understandably may require explicit justification for their prescription. The British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines indicate that antipsychotic augmentation to address inadequate symptom response should only be considered after other treatment options have been exhausted, including "several, adequate, sequential trials of antipsychotic monotherapy". This reflects and guides UK practice, where switching is generally preferred to augmentation with another antipsychotic drug, despite the acknowledged paucity of supportive evidence. This often means that drug combinations are avoided with alternative, but perhaps sub-optimal, strategies being employed.

As mentioned above, the pharmacological basis for this high dose risk is clear. Additional blockade of D2 receptors above what is necessary for an antipsychotic response will increase the liability for dopaminergic side effects, such as EPS and prolactin secretion, without increasing efficacy. Furthermore, depending on the particular drugs being combined, other receptor-mediated side effects are likely to increase, some of which, such as metabolic effects and QT prolongation, may contribute to increased mortality. However, this pharmacological argument does not consistently hold up for the combination of partial agonists with antagonists. In terms of the main antipsychotic mechanism, drug action at the dopamine D2 receptor, the dopamine D2 partial agonists should be considered.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^114aDL74]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Combination therapy with the atypical antipsychotics quetiapine (level 1), aripiprazole (level 2), risperidone (level 1), or asenapine (level 2) and lithium or divalproex is recommended as first-line treatment options with greater efficacy than monotherapy with lithium or divalproex alone, especially in those with higher index severity.

In general, combination therapy is preferred to mood stabilizer monotherapy because clinical trials suggest that on average about 20% more patients will respond to combination therapy. There is also some evidence to suggest the benefit of combination therapy compared to atypical antipsychotic monotherapy, although there are fewer trials. Specifically, lithium plus quetiapine showed superiority to quetiapine alone. While there is also level 1 evidence for olanzapine combination therapy over olanzapine monotherapy, this is downgraded to second-line due to tolerability and safety concerns with olanzapine.

The decision to treat with one or a combination of available first-line agents should be informed by prior medication use, with treatment previously shown to be successful in managing symptoms being preferred. Safety and tolerability factors for each medication and clinical features predictive of better response (see "Clinical features that help direct treatment choices") should also be considered. In general, combination therapy is associated with more adverse events than monotherapy. Whenever possible, options should be discussed with the patient and/or their caregiver.

### Commentary on a recent review of lithium toxicity: What are its implications for clinical practice [^114zpfHe]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Below, we discuss several specific issues that need to be considered critically.

- **Practicing clinicians' interests**: Practicing clinicians are primarily interested in the potential adverse effects (AEs) experienced by properly treated patients. This refers to patients who are correctly selected for long-term lithium treatment, maintained on a minimal effective dosage, and regularly monitored and managed. In this context, lithium treatment generates AEs in a relatively small proportion of patients. However, the reports included in the meta-analysis unavoidably considered numerous patients with bipolar spectrum disorders for whom lithium treatment was not the optimal choice and who were treated by physicians with insufficient experience in lithium treatment. Hence, an important aspect of future work would be to compare the rates of side effects in specialized programs as opposed to general psychiatric practice.

- **Dosage and serum levels**: Sufficient information about dosage and serum levels of lithium could not be analyzed, although the authors made efforts to exclude patients with pre-existing lithium intoxication. Many side effects, including endocrine and metabolic effects, are dose-dependent and can often be controlled by proper dose titration. Details on patient compliance and the time intervals between lithium plasma levels and AEs would have been important background information, and their absence raises questions about the validity of the data and the statistical processing. This criticism was also raised by Malhi and Berk in the same issue of the journal. As clinicians, we often encounter referred patients who…

### Combination of a mood stabilizer with risperidone or haloperidol for treatment of acute mania: A double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of efficacy and safety [^113CYxbC]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The study assessed the efficacy and safety of risperidone as an adjunctive agent to mood stabilizers in the treatment of acute mania. This 3-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 156 bipolar disorder patients with a manic or mixed episode who received a mood stabilizer (lithium or divalproex) and placebo, risperidone, or haloperidol. The primary efficacy measure was the Young Mania Rating Scale. Other assessments included the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Clinical Global Impression scale, and safety measures.

The trial was discontinued by 25 (49%) of the 51 placebo group patients, 18 (35%) of the 52 risperidone group patients, and 28 (53%) of the 53 haloperidol group patients. Mean modal doses were 3.8 mg/day (SD = 1.8) of risperidone and 6.2 mg/day (SD = 2.9) of haloperidol. Significantly greater reductions in Young Mania Rating Scale scores at endpoint and over time were seen in the risperidone group and in the haloperidol group compared with the placebo group. Young Mania Rating Scale total scores improved with risperidone and haloperidol both in patients with psychotic features and in those without psychotic features at baseline. Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale total scores at endpoint were significantly higher in the haloperidol patients than in the placebo patients. Antiparkinsonian medications were received by 8%, 17%, and 38% of patients in the placebo, risperidone, and haloperidol groups, respectively.

Risperidone plus a mood stabilizer was more efficacious than a mood stabilizer alone.

### Perseris [^112kFoaX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Effects of other drugs on risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and total active moiety pharmacokinetics:

- **Strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine and paroxetine)**: Fluoxetine (20 mg once daily) and paroxetine (20 mg once daily), potent CYP2D6 inhibitors, have been shown to increase the plasma concentration of risperidone by 2.5 to 2.8 folds and 3 to 9 folds, respectively. Fluoxetine did not affect the plasma concentration of 9-hydroxyrisperidone. Paroxetine lowered the concentration of 9-hydroxyrisperidone by about 10%. The effects of discontinuation of concomitant fluoxetine or paroxetine therapy on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone have not been studied.

- **Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (erythromycin)**: There were no significant interactions between oral risperidone and erythromycin, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor.

- **Strong CYP3A4 inducer (carbamazepine)**: Carbamazepine co-administration with oral risperidone decreased the steady-state plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone by about 50%. Plasma concentrations of carbamazepine did not appear to be affected. Co-administration of other known CYP3A4 enzyme inducers (e.g. phenytoin, rifampin, and phenobarbital) with risperidone may cause similar decreases in the combined plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone, which could lead to decreased efficacy of Perseris.

- **Amitriptyline, cimetidine, ranitidine, clozapine, topiramate**: A clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic interaction between Perseris and other drugs, such as amitriptyline, cimetidine, ranitidine, and clozapine, has not been established.

### Clinical effects of CYP2D6 phenoconversion in patients with psychosis [^112WFCB7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). High credibility.

Our findings may have several implications for clinical practice. The GROUP cohort is a well-characterized real-world sample of patients with a psychotic disorder, unconstrained by the inclusion criteria often specified for randomized clinical trials. This provides a more generalizable sample for clinical practice. It should be noted, however, that these patients do not represent severely ill and uncooperative patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

The study also demonstrates another important part of clinical reality that is often ignored in pharmacogenetic studies: the potential impact of polypharmacy and phenoconversion. This information is commonly ignored or included only as a confounding variable. Yet, in our sample and practice, a large proportion of psychiatric patients are prescribed multiple medications. We have also demonstrated that polypharmacy leads to phenoconversion in a significant number of patients, which may affect treatment outcomes under certain conditions.

The results also indicate, however, a limited role of CYP2D6 activity in treatment outcome. Although CYP2D6 genotyping is not yet standardized in clinical practice, we suggest that consideration of drug–drug interactions should be integral for patient treatment when pharmacogenetic information is available. Genotyping patients for relevant pharmacogenes should be supplemented by an indexation of concomitant medications possibly interfering with enzyme activity. Polypharmacy itself should be carefully considered, especially when new medications are added to the treatment regime.

### Risperidone-induced leukopenia: A case report and brief review of literature [^112JzF1N]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

A Caucasian male young adult with agitated depression and suicidal ideation received lithium and oral olanzapine. His white blood cell count was normal at that time. However, due to an unsatisfactory response, he was administered 4 mg/day of risperidone. While his symptoms improved, leukopenia emerged, specifically affecting neutrophils. Upon the discontinuation of risperidone, his white blood cell count returned to reference values within one week. As symptom control was satisfactory, no risperidone rechallenge was attempted. Accurate blood testing must accompany atypical antipsychotic drug administration since blood dyscrasias are always possible with these drugs.

### Mental health gap action programme (mhGAP) guideline for mental, neurological and substance use disorders [Internet] [^114quTJt]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of bipolar disorder, specifically for the management of acute mania, the WHO 2023 guidelines recommend offering oral antipsychotics (aripiprazole, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone, or quetiapine) or mood stabilizers (carbamazepine, lithium, or valproic acid) to adult patients experiencing an episode of mania. It is important to carefully balance the effectiveness, side effects, and individual preferences when selecting treatment options.

### Efficacy and tolerability of combination treatments for major depression: Antidepressants plus second-generation antipsychotics vs. esketamine vs. lithium [^114QrHg2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

NNT values for response among individual drugs or types did not differ significantly, as indicated by overlapping confidence intervals. However, they tended to be lower (more favorable) with lithium (NNT = 5 [4–10]) than with esketamine (NNT = 7 [5–10]) or second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) overall (NNT = 11 [9–15]).

- **Ranking of SGAs**: Risperidone (NNT = 6 [3–13]) was comparable to olanzapine/fluoxetine (which includes an antidepressant; NNT = 6 [4–19]). This was followed by ziprasidone (NNT = 7 [3–∞]), aripiprazole (NNT = 9 [5–24]), and cariprazine and brexpiprazole (both NNT = 16 with ranges of [8–52] and [10–34], respectively).

Based on responder rates, lithium was significantly superior to SGAs (χ² = 19.6, p < 0.0001), and esketamine also showed superiority over SGAs (χ² = 30.9, p < 0.0001). However, there was no significant difference between lithium and esketamine (χ² = 0.340, p = 0.561).

### Prozac [^11698vag]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Contraindications**: When using Prozac and olanzapine in combination, refer to the contraindications section of the package insert for Symbyax.

- **Serotonin syndrome and MAOIs**: Do not use MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with Prozac or within 5 weeks of stopping treatment with Prozac. Additionally, do not use Prozac within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders. Do not start Prozac in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue (4.1).

- **Pimozide**: Do not use due to the risk of QT prolongation and drug interaction (4.2, 5.11, 7.7, 7.8).

- **Thioridazine**: Do not use due to the risk of QT interval prolongation and elevated thioridazine plasma levels. Thioridazine should not be used within 5 weeks of discontinuing Prozac (4.2, 5.11, 7.7, 7.8).

When using Prozac and olanzapine in combination, refer to the contraindications section of the package insert for Symbyax (4).

- **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)**: The use of MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with Prozac or within 5 weeks of stopping treatment with Prozac is contraindicated due to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. The use of Prozac within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders is also contraindicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Starting Prozac in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs, such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, is also contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.

### Variability and efficacy in treatment effects on manic symptoms with lithium, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics in acute bipolar mania: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112eYC8j]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

The study assessed the variability and efficacy in the improvement of manic symptoms to oral antimanic monotherapy options for individuals presenting with acute bipolar mania across RCTs. The main findings of this study are as follows:

- **Variability in improvement**: Eight antimanic drugs compared to placebo were associated with significantly lower variability in the improvement of manic symptoms, namely (ordered from lower to higher CVR) risperidone, haloperidol, olanzapine, ziprasidone, lithium, quetiapine, aripiprazole, and cariprazine.

- **Efficacy in improvement**: Nine antimanic drugs compared to placebo were associated with better efficacy in the improvement of manic symptoms (ordered from larger to smaller SMD): risperidone, haloperidol, cariprazine, olanzapine, lithium, ziprasidone, quetiapine, asenapine, and aripiprazole.

- **Acceptability**: Most of the investigated antimanic drugs were not associated with worse acceptability than placebo. Ziprasidone and olanzapine were associated with better acceptability than placebo.

Our study suggests that antimanic drugs with lower variability and greater efficacy in the improvement of manic symptoms may show promising outcomes in patients with acute mania. Among the 14 antimanic drugs, eight were associated with both lower variability and better efficacy than placebo in antimanic outcomes. Patients with acute mania may respond more homogeneously to these eight antimanic drugs irrespective of individual baseline differences in clinical or biological factors. The most recent CANMAT guidelines recommend risperidone, lithium, quetiapine, and aripiprazole.

There are insufficient data to make a recommendation regarding the use of aspirin (adjunctive) (level 3 negative), celecoxib (adjunctive) (level 3 negative), gabapentin (monotherapy) (level 3 negative), levetiracetam (adjunctive) (level 3 negative), lisdexamfetamine (adjunctive) (level 3 negative), memantine (adjunctive) (level 3), pioglitazone (adjunctive) (level 3), riluzole (level 4 negative), and risperidone (adjunctive) (level 3). Although adjunctive therapy with pregnenolone separated from placebo at week 6, the change in depressive symptoms was not significantly different from week 8 to week 12 between the two groups (level 2).

- **Clinical features that help direct treatment choices**: There are limited data on predictors of treatment response in bipolar depression. However, clinical features of a depressive episode, including DSM‐5 specifiers, may assist clinicians in choosing among recommended treatment options.

- **Need for rapid response**: Among the first‐line options recommended, quetiapine and lurasidone have separated from placebo in clinical trials as early as week 1. Thus, these medications may be preferable when a rapid response is required, for example in patients who are at increased risk of suicide or who have medical complications, including dehydration. While ECT is recommended as a second‐line option, it may also be used earlier when a rapid response is imperative. Second‐line options such as cariprazine and olanzapine-fluoxetine demonstrate similar efficacy.

### Risperidone alone or in combination for acute mania [^111vprtX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic, is used to treat mania both alone and in combination with other medicines.

- **Objectives**: To review the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone as a treatment for mania.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies December 2004), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched in December 2004. Reference lists and English language textbooks were searched; researchers in the field and Janssen-Cilag were contacted.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing risperidone with placebo or other drugs in acute manic or mixed episodes.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently extracted data from trial reports. Janssen-Cilag was asked to provide missing information.

- **Quality assessment**: As in other trials of treatment for mania, the high proportion of imputed efficacy data resulting from rates of failure to complete treatment of between 12% and 62% may have biased the results.

- **Main results**: Six trials (1343 participants) of risperidone as monotherapy or as adjunctive treatment to lithium or an anticonvulsant were identified. Permitted doses were consistent with those recommended by the manufacturers of Haldol (haloperidol) and Risperdal (risperidone) for treatment of mania, and trials involving haloperidol allowed antiparkinsonian treatment. Risperidone monotherapy was more effective than placebo in reducing manic symptoms, using the Young Mania Rating Scale.

### Efficacy and tolerability of combination treatments for major depression: Antidepressants plus second-generation antipsychotics vs. esketamine vs. lithium [^112jjp4b]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). High credibility.

Methods

- **Aims and eligibility criteria**: We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis and prepared this report adhering to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). We limited inclusion to peer-reviewed reports of randomized, nominally double-blinded, short-term (≤ 12 weeks), placebo-controlled trials of selected agents of interest. These included SGAs such as aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, olanzapine+fluoxetine, risperidone, quetiapine, or ziprasidone; all inhibitors of serotonin 5-HT 2 and dopamine D 2 receptors, or intranasal esketamine for comparison with lithium (usually as the carbonate), all combined with standard antidepressants to treat mainly unipolar major depressive episodes in adults diagnosed by modern criteria. We excluded reports involving special populations, such as juveniles, the elderly, or persons with major general medical or neurological illnesses.

- **Information sources and search**: We systematically searched research literature in three electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, and Medline) through October 2020 with combinations of the search terms: "major depression", "controlled", "randomized", "clinical trial", and "efficacy" (Appendix 1). We also examined previously published, partially relevant, systematic reviews and references identified in them.

Of 4631 initially identified potential studies based on the review of titles and abstracts, 124 required more detailed examination by two coauthors (GHV and RJB), resulting in 43 trials (with 49 drug-placebo pairs) meeting study criteria.

- **Haematological effects**: Carbamazepine may be a risk factor for leucopenia, although this finding is not robust. This side effect is generally reversible with dose reduction or discontinuation. There is also some concern about rapidly developing bone marrow suppression resulting from hypersensitivity, particularly in older patients. Clozapine carries the greatest risk for drug‐induced changes in white blood cell counts, with approximately 0.18% of patients experiencing changes rated as probably or definitely drug induced. All patients started on clozapine should have a baseline haematological profile established and be enrolled in the clozapine monitoring programme, which requires regular monitoring of haematological parameters: weekly at first and then every 2‐4 weeks later in the course of treatment.

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Lithium can increase the risk of abnormal QT prolongation or T‐wave abnormalities, an impact more pronounced with age, as almost 60% of older patients on lithium maintenance therapy have ECG abnormalities. Several antipsychotics, including risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, and asenapine, are also associated with arrhythmias, QTc prolongation, and other cardiovascular adverse events. Clozapine may increase the risk of several rare but serious events such as dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Of the antipsychotics, lurasidone and aripiprazole are considered safe from a cardiac perspective, although aripiprazole may increase the risk for hypotension.

### Pharmacological interventions for acute bipolar mania: A systematic review of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^116UV5AK]. Bipolar Disorders (2007). High credibility.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials in acute bipolar mania to summarize available data on the drug treatment of mania.

- **Methods**: We included trials of medications licensed in the United States or UK for the treatment of any phase of bipolar disorder. Outcomes investigated were changes in mania scores, attrition, extrapyramidal effects, and weight change. Data were combined through meta-analyses.

- **Results**: We included 13 studies (involving 3,089 subjects) and identified 2 studies for each of the following medications: carbamazepine, haloperidol, lithium, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, valproate semisodium, and aripiprazole. All drugs showed significant benefits compared with placebo for the reduction in mania scores. Compared with placebo, for all antipsychotics pooled, response to treatment (≥ 50% reduction in Young Mania Rating Scale scores) was increased more than 1.7 times [relative risk (RR) = 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.54, 1.96]; for all mood stabilizers pooled, response to treatment was doubled (RR 2.01, 95% CI = 1.66, 2.43). Overall withdrawals were 34% fewer (24–43%) with antipsychotics and 26% fewer (10–39%) with mood stabilizers. However, for carbamazepine, aripiprazole, and lithium, an increase in the risk of withdrawal could not be excluded. Small but significant increases in extrapyramidal side effects occurred with risperidone and aripiprazole.

Antipsychotics and mood stabilizers are significantly more effective than placebo for the treatment of acute mania.

Regarding the medical management of catatonia, specifically in relation to antipsychotics, the BAP 2023 guidelines recommend prescribing antipsychotic medications with caution, if indicated, after evaluating the potential benefits and risks, including the risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, in patients with an underlying psychotic disorder. Additional caution should be exercised if there is low serum iron or a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Second-generation antipsychotics should be initiated with gradual titration, and co-administration of a benzodiazepine may be considered.

### Evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of women with schizophrenia spectrum disorders [^114PPDwg]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Finally, many antipsychotics cause a sustained increase in prolactin secretion. Hyperprolactinemia is more common in women, with prevalence rates ranging from 42% to 93%, compared to 18% to 72% in men. High prolactin levels inhibit estrogen production, which can lead to adverse sexual, somatic, and mental health effects, such as menstrual cycle irregularities, sexual dysfunction, osteoporosis, menopausal complaints, depressed mood, and increased risks for cardiovascular diseases and breast cancer. For example, 48% of women receiving antipsychotic treatment report menstrual irregularities, and 32% of women treated with prolactin-raising antipsychotics for more than 10 years have reduced bone mineral density. Women who use prolactin-raising antipsychotics for more than 5 years have a 150% increased risk for breast cancer, which is especially worrisome since female SSD patients are already at increased genetic risk for this disease. Lowering the dose of prolactin-enhancing agents increases relapse risk and is not consistently demonstrated to be effective, as prolactin levels can already be raised when using a low dose of certain antipsychotics. Preventing or correcting antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia is, therefore, an important goal in the pharmacotherapy of women with SSD. Several strategies have been described, such as switching to a prolactin-sparing antipsychotic or the addition of a component like aripiprazole or vitamin B6.

In sum, pharmacological treatment for women with SSD may benefit from a sex-sensitive perspective, which can only be constructed if we know how to adjust to their unique needs.

### Rykindo extended-release microspheres [^111YvpQq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The effects of other drugs on risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and total active moiety pharmacokinetics are notable.

- **Strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine and paroxetine)**: Fluoxetine (20 mg once daily) and paroxetine (20 mg once daily), both potent CYP2D6 inhibitors, have been shown to increase the plasma concentration of risperidone by 2.5- to 2.8-fold and 3- to 9-fold, respectively. Fluoxetine did not affect the plasma concentration of 9-hydroxyrisperidone, whereas paroxetine lowered it by about 10%. The effects of discontinuing concomitant fluoxetine or paroxetine therapy on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone have not been studied [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (erythromycin)**: There was no significant interaction between oral risperidone and erythromycin, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor.

- **Strong CYP3A4 inducer (carbamazepine)**: Carbamazepine co-administration with oral risperidone decreased the steady-state plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone by about 50%. Plasma concentrations of carbamazepine were not affected. Co-administration of other known CYP3A4 enzyme inducers (e.g. phenytoin, rifampin, and phenobarbital) with risperidone may cause similar decreases in the combined plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone, leading to decreased efficacy of RYKINDO treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Amitriptyline, cimetidine, ranitidine, and clozapine were also evaluated; however, the data remains truncated and incomplete for these drugs.

### Safety and tolerability of atypical antipsychotics in patients with bipolar disorder: Prevalence, monitoring and management [^112yUEVY]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics are associated with fewer movement disorders and a lower risk of tardive dyskinesia than conventional antipsychotics but are not without side effects. Metabolic side effects associated with some of the atypical antipsychotics are a concern for both clinicians and patients. Adverse events related to central nervous system effects, weight gain, and alterations in glucose, lipid, and prolactin levels have been reported in patients with depression, bipolar, and anxiety disorders. Balancing the significant benefits of treatment with these agents against the potential risks of metabolic disturbances and other adverse effects is crucial.

Emerging data are making it possible to determine the risk-benefit analysis for specific atypical antipsychotics in individual patients and allow for targeted selection of treatment. A new concept of effectiveness is emerging, attempting to balance adverse effects of treatment with patient quality of life. Patients treated with atypical antipsychotics should have their weight, waist circumference, glucose, and lipids monitored on a regular basis. Monitoring of prolactin levels is not suggested; however, a baseline measurement before initiating treatment can be useful, with subsequent assessment only if a patient demonstrates symptoms.

Prevention of weight gain is essential. Diet and exercise should be considered for prevention and management, with pharmacologic strategies approached with caution in patients with mood disorders. If a patient is at high risk of developing diabetes, certain pharmacologic agents should be used judiciously.

### Risperdal [^111uiN1P]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Risperdal, when used as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate, in treating acute manic or mixed episodes has been established in one controlled trial. The trial involved adult patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder, encompassing individuals with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course.

In this three-week placebo-controlled combination trial, 148 inpatients or outpatients undergoing lithium or valproate therapy, with inadequately controlled manic or mixed symptoms, were randomized to receive Risperdal, placebo, or an active comparator alongside their original therapy. Risperdal, administered at a dose range of 1–6 mg/day, once daily, beginning at 2 mg/day (with a mean modal dose of 3.8 mg/day), combined with lithium or valproate (maintained within a therapeutic range of 0.6 mEq/L to 1.4 mEq/L for lithium or 50 mcg/mL to 120 mcg/mL for valproate) was demonstrated to be superior to lithium or valproate alone in reducing the YMRS total score.

In a second three-week placebo-controlled combination trial, 142 inpatients or outpatients on lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine therapy, experiencing inadequately controlled manic or mixed symptoms, were randomized to receive Risperdal or placebo in combination with their original therapy. Risperdal, in a dose range of 1–6 mg/day, once daily, starting at 2 mg/day (with a mean modal dose of 3.7 mg/day), combined with lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine (within therapeutic ranges of 0.6 mEq/L to 1.4 mEq/L for lithium, 50 mcg/mL to 125 mcg/mL for valproate, or 4–12 mcg/mL for carbamazepine, respectively) was not found to be superior to these treatments alone.

### Chlorpromazine versus penfluridol for schizophrenia [^113N2YfU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

The efficacy of chlorpromazine, a benchmark antipsychotic, has not been fully assessed in direct comparison with different individual antipsychotics. Penfluridol is another old antipsychotic with a long half-life, so one oral dose may last up to one week. This could confer an advantage.

- **Objectives**: To assess the clinical effects of chlorpromazine compared with penfluridol for adults with schizophrenia.

- **Search methods**: On 31 March 2017, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials, which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized clinical trials focusing on chlorpromazine versus penfluridol for adults with schizophrenia or related disorders. Outcomes of interest were death, service utilization, global state, mental state, adverse effects, and leaving the study early. We included trials meeting our selection criteria and reporting usable data.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we planned to estimate the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We assessed the risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.

### Effect of antipsychotics and mood stabilisers on metabolism in bipolar disorder: A network meta-analysis of randomised-controlled trials [^115nojPs]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

As for the between-subgroup difference of age, quetiapine, divalproex, and lithium ranked differently among adults and youth, possibly due to differences in metabolism and hormone levels. Irritability and hyperactivity occur more frequently in adolescent bipolar mania, and adolescent patients with BD show a higher rate of comorbid psychiatric disorders than adult patients, which might explain the difference. In addition, it was estimated that children and adolescents receiving antipsychotics had a higher risk of developing extrapyramidal symptoms, hyperprolactinemia, and metabolic syndrome, which raises concerns about pharmacotherapy safety among the youth. According to existing policies, quetiapine is recommended by the Food and Drug Administration of the US for patients aged 10 years or older with acute bipolar mania or mixed state, while valproic acid has not been approved for adolescent BD pharmacotherapy. Second-generation antipsychotics including risperidone and olanzapine have been approved for adolescent acute bipolar mania, although evidence suggests that they are more likely to cause metabolic disturbance among the youth than in adults. Moreover, previous studies showed that children might be more sensitive to drug-induced weight gain (or increase of BMI and waist circumference), rather than a disturbance of glucose and lipid metabolism, which might be due to differences in the gut microbiome. Moreover, little evidence was found among senior patients, which might be due to the relatively low prevalence rate. However, such information is also noteworthy since it can inform future research directions.

### Pharmacological agents to reduce readmissions in bipolar disorder [^113nrnD8]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

It is well recognized that medications play an important role in preventing relapse in bipolar disorder. However, their impact on hospital admission rates has been less extensively studied. We combined data from 11 randomized controlled trials in a network meta-analysis. The results demonstrated significant reductions in admission rates compared to placebo: lithium (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32–0.59), valproate (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28–0.90), a combination of lithium and valproate (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28–0.90), carbamazepine (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29–0.73), and olanzapine (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.16–0.43). The evidence base contributing to these estimates remains small, leading to broad confidence intervals. More precise estimates could be obtained if unpublished outcomes data from other trials in this area became available. Several pharmacological treatments appear to effectively reduce the need for hospital admission in people with bipolar disorder.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^111i2q4o]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). High credibility.

The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments previously published treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder in 2005, along with international commentaries and subsequent updates in 2007, 2009, and 2013. The last two updates were published in collaboration with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders. These 2018 Bipolar Treatment Guidelines represent significant advances in the field since the last full edition was published in 2005, including updates to diagnosis and management as well as new research into pharmacological and psychological treatments.

These advances have been translated into clear and easy-to-use recommendations for first, second, and third-line treatments, considering levels of evidence for efficacy, clinical support based on experience, and consensus ratings of safety, tolerability, and treatment-emergent switch risk. New to these guidelines, hierarchical rankings were created for first and second-line treatments recommended for acute mania, acute depression, and maintenance treatment in bipolar I disorder. Created by considering the impact of each treatment across all phases of illness, this hierarchy will further assist clinicians in making evidence-based treatment decisions.

- **First-line treatments for acute mania**: Lithium, quetiapine, divalproex, asenapine, aripiprazole, paliperidone, risperidone, and cariprazine, alone or in combination.
- **First-line options for bipolar I depression**: Quetiapine, lurasidone plus lithium or divalproex, lithium, lamotrigine, lurasidone, or adjunctive lamotrigine.
