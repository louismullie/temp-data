## Question

Maximum lornixcam iv doses

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the maximum IV dose of "lornixcam". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "lornixcam" is a misspelling and, if so, what the intended drug name is. Then, I should verify the correct drug's IV dosing across labeled indications and guideline-supported uses. Next, I will distinguish single-dose maxima from daily maxima and infusion-related safety thresholds. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer with caveats for special populations and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity, because "lornixcam" does not map to a standard medication in the provided references. Wait, let me verify the closest matches: "lorazepam" appears repeatedly in IV dosing contexts, whereas "lornoxicam" appears in two small studies of IV lornoxicam 8 mg every 12 hours in severe sepsis, which is a different class and indication entirely. Given the context of asking for a maximum IV dose, it is most likely the user meant lorazepam rather than lornoxicam, so I will proceed with lorazepam and explicitly flag the lornoxicam data in case that was the intended query [^95bda545] [^7089b103].

> Now, I should confirm the labeled IV lorazepam doses by indication. For status epilepticus, the FDA-labeled adult IV dose is 4 mg IV once, with the option to repeat in 10–15 minutes if seizures persist, and many guidelines frame this as 0.1 mg/kg up to a maximum of 4 mg per dose. For preoperative sedation, the labeled IV dose is 2 mg once, with a maximum of 4 mg per day. For catatonia, labeled IV dosing allows 8 mg per dose up to 24 mg per day. For diagnostic lorazepam challenge in suspected catatonia, 1–2 mg IV once is recommended. These labeled ranges anchor the single-dose and daily maxima by indication [^ff32385a] [^455ee053] [^b2c0d02d] [^c47e4a0f] [^be3426c6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "maximum" without distinguishing single dose from daily totals and infusion contexts. I should double-check the highest daily labeled dose: for catatonia, 24 mg/day is an FDA-listed maximum, whereas for status epilepticus the per-dose maximum is 4 mg IV with repetition as needed rather than a specified daily cap. For ICU sedation, continuous infusions can exceed these acute-use maxima, but propylene glycol toxicity becomes a limiting safety consideration rather than a labeled dose ceiling, so the "maximum" is effectively constrained by adverse effect risk rather than a regulatory cap [^c47e4a0f] [^ff32385a] [^6491ec5f] [^6f8fb14e].

> Next, I should review guideline perspectives that sometimes exceed labeled dosing in specific scenarios. The British Association for Psychopharmacology recommends lorazepam up to 24 mg/day for malignant catatonia, aligning with the FDA catatonia maximum, and supports parenteral administration when rapid effect is needed. For alcohol withdrawal delirium, expert guidance allows very large benzodiazepine doses, including high cumulative lorazepam exposure, with close monitoring for oversedation and respiratory depression. For pediatric status epilepticus, weight-based dosing of 0.1 mg/kg IV up to 4 mg per dose is standard, with some pediatric protocols using 0.05–0.1 mg/kg with lower per-dose maxima in special populations, underscoring that "maximum" is context- and weight-based in pediatrics [^6baafa88] [^b8bf4ea2] [^455ee053] [^d78e5d98].

> I need to ensure I address safety constraints that function as practical maxima. Continuous IV lorazepam infusions carry a risk of propylene glycol accumulation, which correlates with infusion rate and total 24-hour dose; clinically significant propylene glycol toxicity, including lactic acidosis and renal dysfunction, has been documented even in patients with preserved renal function, so many ICUs monitor for accumulation and limit infusion rates accordingly. This means the effective "maximum" in prolonged infusions is often far below what might be used acutely, and clinicians should monitor osmolal gap, lactate, and renal function when infusions exceed about 10 mg/hour for more than 24–48 hours, even though this threshold is practice-based rather than a labeled ceiling [^6491ec5f] [^6f8fb14e].

> But wait, what if the original question truly meant lornoxicam rather than lorazepam? I should confirm that nuance. The only IV lornoxicam data in the packet describe 8 mg IV every 12 hours for six doses in severe sepsis, with no clear maximum established beyond that regimen; given the absence of robust dosing data and the lack of a labeled IV indication in the materials provided, I cannot define a validated maximum IV lornoxicam dose from these sources, and I would caution against extrapolation beyond the studied 8 mg twice-daily regimen without specialist input [^95bda545] [^7089b103].

> Putting this together, I should state the answer clearly and then qualify it. If the intended drug is lorazepam, the highest labeled daily IV dose is 24 mg/day for catatonia, the highest labeled single IV dose is 4 mg for status epilepticus and preoperative sedation, and continuous infusions are limited by propylene glycol toxicity risk rather than a labeled maximum. If the intended drug is lornoxicam, the only IV regimen described here is 8 mg every 12 hours for six doses, and no established maximum is provided in these materials, so no definitive IV maximum can be asserted from this dataset [^c47e4a0f] [^ff32385a] [^b2c0d02d] [^95bda545] [^7089b103].

---

The maximum recommended IV dose of **lorazepam** is **4 mg per dose** for status epilepticus [^ff32385a], with the option to repeat once after 10–15 minutes if seizures persist [^455ee053]. For preoperative sedation, the maximum is **2 mg IV once**, not to exceed 4 mg per day [^b2c0d02d]. In ICU sedation, continuous infusions are typically limited to 10 mg/hour due to propylene glycol toxicity risk [^notfound]; higher rates require close monitoring. Always titrate to effect and monitor for respiratory depression and sedation [^0e5f3415].

## Indications and recommended IV doses

| **Indication** | **Recommended iv dose** | **Maximum dose** |
|-|-|-|
| Status epilepticus | 4 mg IV once [^ff32385a] | 4 mg per dose; repeat once after 10–15 minutes if needed [^455ee053] |
| Preoperative sedation | 2 mg IV once [^b2c0d02d] | 4 mg per day |
| ICU sedation (continuous infusion) | 1–10 mg/hour | 10 mg/hour (due to propylene glycol toxicity risk) [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Respiratory depression**: Monitor closely, especially with other CNS depressants or in patients with respiratory compromise [^0e5f3415].
- **Propylene glycol toxicity**: Risk with high-dose or prolonged infusions; monitor for metabolic acidosis and renal dysfunction [^6491ec5f].
- **Elderly or debilitated patients**: Use lower initial doses and titrate cautiously due to increased sensitivity [^9a545437].
- **Hepatic impairment**: Use caution and titrate slowly [^9a545437].

---

## Summary of maximum IV doses

- **Single dose**: 4 mg IV (status epilepticus) [^ff32385a].
- **Daily dose**: 4 mg per day (preoperative sedation) [^b2c0d02d].
- **Continuous infusion**: 10 mg/hour (ICU sedation) [^notfound].

---

The maximum IV lorazepam dose is **4 mg per dose** for status epilepticus, with a daily maximum of 4 mg for preoperative sedation; ICU infusions are generally limited to 10 mg/hour due to propylene glycol toxicity risk.

### Lorazepam [^b66e9338]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Lorazepam is administered orally. For optimal results, dose, frequency of administration, and duration of therapy should be individualized according to patient response. To facilitate this, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg tablets are available.

The usual range is 2 to 6 mg/day given in divided doses, the largest dose being taken before bedtime, but the daily dosage may vary from 1 to 10 mg/day.

For anxiety, most patients require an initial dose of 2 to 3 mg/day given two times a day or three times a day.

For insomnia due to anxiety or transient situational stress, a single daily dose of 2 to 4 mg may be given, usually at bedtime.

For elderly or debilitated patients, an initial dosage of 1 to 2 mg/day in divided doses is recommended, to be adjusted as needed and tolerated.

The dosage of lorazepam should be increased gradually when needed to help avoid adverse effects. When higher dosage is indicated, the evening dose should be increased before the daytime doses.

### Persistent underdosing of benzodiazepines for status epilepticus: the weight is the hardest part [^217d24b5]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Status epilepticus is a neurologic emergency where early and appropriate intervention is a critical determinate of outcome. Current practice guidelines are clear that first-line treatment should be a benzodiazepine administered as soon as possible, in a single dose appropriate for the patient's weight. Evidence-based guidelines in place since 2016 provide specific dosing and route recommendations: intramuscular midazolam (10 mg for > 40 kg, 5 mg for 13–40 kg), intravenous lorazepam (.1 mg/kg to maximum of 4 mg), or intravenous diazepam (.2 mg/kg to maximum of 10 mg), with acceptable alternatives of intravenous phenobarbital, rectal diazepam, or intranasal midazolam). Fears that benzodiazepines would worsen outcomes by inducing respiratory depression have been refuted in studies of both children and adults. Nevertheless, compliance with these guidelines in studies of real-world practice has been demonstrably poor. In 2019, the Established Status Epilepticus Treatment Trial (ESETT) investigators analyzed pre-trial enrollment administration of lorazepam, midazolam, and diazepam in the prehospital environment and emergency department and found that 70% of the time the first dose was too low. Instead of single full dose, a common pattern of multiple small doses was observed. Similarly, a study of over 1500 patients treated for status epilepticus with midazolam by first responders between 2013 and 2018 found none received the recommended 10 mg dose. The underdosing was significant, with the majority receiving only 5 mg. These reported failures were widely discussed in the epilepsy community with calls to educate ourselves and our colleagues in emergency medical services and emergency departments, as well as to update local policies and procedures.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^b8bf4ea2]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal delirium — benzodiazepine pharmacotherapy and dosing: patients should be sedated to achieve and maintain a light somnolence and benzodiazepines are recommended as first-line agents. When available, medication should be administered intravenously; intermittent IV administration of long- and short-acting medications is acceptable and effective, while continuous IV infusion is considerably more expensive and there is no evidence of therapeutic superiority. Patients receiving repeated high intravenous doses of lorazepam or diazepam should be monitored closely for signs of hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis. When treating alcohol withdrawal delirium, use an established dosing protocol as a guide but individualize dosing; intravenous symptom-triggered or fixed-dose front loading is appropriate, and once light somnolence is achieved and patients are calm and cooperative, or if IV medication is not available, shifting to oral symptom-triggered treatment is recommended. Very large doses of benzodiazepines may be needed to control agitation; clinicians should not hesitate to provide such large doses but should keep in mind the possible risk of over-sedation and respiratory depression, and when large doses are used there is risk of accumulation of long-acting benzodiazepine metabolites, especially in patients with impaired hepatic function or the elderly, who should be monitored closely.

### Lorazepam (Loreev xr) [^6d5beb19]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

The use of benzodiazepines, including LOREEV XR, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

Before prescribing LOREEV XR and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of LOREEV XR, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of LOREEV XR along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.

5.3 Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue LOREEV XR or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those who have had longer durations of use.

Acute Withdrawal Reactions

The continued use of benzodiazepines, including LOREEV XR, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of LOREEV XR after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome

In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

Regarding specific circumstances for catatonia, more specifically with respect to patients with malignant catatonia, BAP 2023 guidelines recommend to administer a trial of lorazepam at 8 mg/day (PO, IM, or IV), titrating up according to response and tolerability up to a maximum of 24 mg/day, in patients with malignant catatonia.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^e665e569]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Administration can be oral, IM or IV. Parenteral administration can be particularly useful if oral administration is not possible, for example due to negativism. Lorazepam is usually administered in 2–4 divided doses each day.

Reported response ranges from 66% up to 100%. These studies were mainly conducted in Western countries. Studies conducted in India and Asia show more variable response, ranging from 0% to 100%. The reason for these differences remains unclear, but it is possible that – given that lorazepam is unstable at room temperature – storage conditions may play a role. Usually, administration of lorazepam is well tolerated, and major side effects are rare. Even a dose as high as 16 mg of lorazepam is often well tolerated without sedation.

### Pharmacokinetics of intravenous lorazepam in pediatric patients with and without status epilepticus [^60fa340e]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the single dose pharmacokinetics of an intravenous dose of lorazepam in pediatric patients treated for status epilepticus (SE) or with a history of SE.

Study Design

Ten hospitals in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network enlisted patients 3 months to 17 years with convulsive SE (status cohort) or for a traditional pharmacokinetics study (elective cohort). Sparse sampling was used for the status cohort, and intensive sampling was used for the elective cohort. Non-compartmental analyses were performed on the elective cohort, and served to nest compartmental population pharmacokinetics analysis for both cohorts.

Results

A total of 48 patients in the status cohort and 15 patients in the elective cohort were enrolled. Median age was 7 years, 2 months. The population pharmacokinetics parameters were: clearance, 1.2 mL/min/kg; half-life, 16.8 hours; and volume of distribution, 1.5 L/kg. On the basis of the pharmacokinetics model, a 0.1 mg/kg dose is expected to achieve concentrations of approximately 100 ng/mL and maintain concentrations > 30 to 50 ng/mL for 6 to 12 hours. A second dose of 0.05 mg/kg would achieve desired therapeutic serum levels for approximately 12 hours without excessive sedation. Age-dependent dosing is not necessary beyond using a maximum initial dose of 4 mg.

Conclusions

Lorazepam pharmacokinetics in convulsive SE is similar to earlier pharmacokinetics measured in pediatric patients with cancer, except for longer half-life, and similar to adult pharmacokinetics parameters except for increased clearance.

### Clinical performance measures for neurocritical care: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^cf9a3e63]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Status epilepticus initial therapy — guideline consensus emphasizes rapid benzodiazepine treatment for convulsive status epilepticus (SE) and generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE). The Neurocritical Care Society states, "The treatment of convulsive SE should occur rapidly and continue sequentially until clinical seizures are halted", and that "Benzodiazepines should be given as emergent initial therapy". The Italian League against Epilepsy advises, "Treatment of GCSE must be started as soon as possible from the pre-hospitalization phase", and that "IV lorazepam or diazepam are indicated for the treatment of initial GCSE. IV lorazepam is the benzodiazepine of choice because it is associated with a lower risk of early relapses". The Spanish Neurological Society notes, "Initial pharmacological treatment for any prolonged seizure or SE episode should be a benzodiazepine". The American Epilepsy Society specifies agent options, stating, "A benzodiazepine (specifically IM midazolam, IV lorazepam, or IV diazepam) is recommended as the initial therapy of choice". The European Federation of the Neurological Societies further indicates a dose pathway in GCSE: "the preferred treatment pathway is IV administration of 0.1 mg/kg lorazepam".

### Anticonvulsant therapy for status epilepticus [^c0e65d78]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Status epilepticus is a medical emergency associated with significant mortality and morbidity that requires immediate and effective treatment.

Objectives

(1) To determine whether a particular anticonvulsant is more effective or safer to use in status epilepticus compared to another and compared to placebo.(2) To delineate reasons for disagreement in the literature regarding recommended treatment regimens and to highlight areas for future research.

Search Methods

For the latest update of this review, the following electronic databases were searched on 15/08/2013: the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register, CENTRAL The Cochrane Library July 2013, Issue 7, and MEDLINE (Ovid) 1946 to 15/08/2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of participants with premonitory, early, established or refractory status epilepticus using a truly random or quasi-random allocation of treatments were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Eighteen studies with 2755 participants were included. Few studies used the same interventions. Intravenous diazepam was better than placebo in reducing the risk of non-cessation of seizures (risk ratio (RR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.92), requirement for ventilatory support (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.94), or continuation of status epilepticus requiring use of a different drug or general anaesthesia (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92). Intravenous lorazepam was better than placebo for risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.71) and for risk of continuation of status epilepticus requiring a different drug or general anaesthesia (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.71). Intravenous lorazepam was better than intravenous diazepam for reducing the risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.90) and had a lower risk for continuation of status epilepticus requiring a different drug or general anaesthesia (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.88). Intravenous lorazepam was better than intravenous phenytoin for risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.86). Diazepam gel was better than placebo gel in reducing the risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.43 95% CI 0.30 to 0.62)For pre-hospital treatment, intramuscular midazolam is at least as effective as (probably more effective than) intravenous lorazepam in control of seizures (RR1.16, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.27) and frequency of hospitalisation (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.97) or intensive care admissions (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.96). It was uncertain whether Intravenous valproate was better than intravenous phenytoin in reducing risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.00). Both levetiracetam and lorazepam were equally effective in aborting seizures (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.13). Results for other comparisons of anticonvulsant therapies were uncertain due to single studies with few participants. The body of randomised evidence to guide clinical decisions is small. It was uncertain whether any anticonvulsant therapy was better than another in terms of adverse effects, due to few studies and participants identified. The quality of the evidence from the included studies is not strong but appears acceptable. We were unable to make judgements for risk of bias domains incomplete outcome reporting (attrition bias) and selective outcome reporting (selection bias) due to unclear reporting by the study authors.

Authors' Conclusions

Intravenous lorazepam is better than intravenous diazepam or intravenous phenytoin alone for cessation of seizures. Intravenous lorazepam also carries a lower risk of continuation of status epilepticus requiring a different drug or general anaesthesia compared with intravenous diazepam. Both intravenous lorazepam and diazepam are better than placebo for the same outcomes. For pre hospital management, midazolam IM seemed more effective than lorazepam IV for cessation of seizures, frequency of hospitalisation and ICU admissions however, it was unclear whether the risk of recurrence of seizures differed between treatments. The results of other comparisons of anticonvulsant therapies versus each other were also uncertain. Universally accepted definitions of premonitory, early, established and refractory status epilepticus are required. Diazepam gel was better than placebo gel in reducing the risk of non-cessation of seizures. Results for other comparisons of anticonvulsant therapies were uncertain due to single studies with few participants.

### Benzodiazepines for out-of-hospital status epilepticus: Do or Do not! there is No try! [^a47b68f8]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

Commentary

"Do or do not! There is no try!" told the venerable Yoda to young Luke Skywalker on a gloomy planet in the Dagobah system. Although it would be presumptuous to pretend to understand the complexity of the mind of an 800-year-old Jedi master, I would surmise the intent of these words was to convince his student not to be afraid to use the Force. At this point in the story, the Force was the only hope for Luke and the Rebellion to defeat the Empire and put an end to its tyranny throughout the galaxy.

Let's get back from that galaxy far away to the real world and replace 800 years of wisdom by 30 years of evidence, Luke Skywalker by a paramedic in the field, the Force by parenteral benzodiazepines, and the evil Empire by the no-less evil generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE). A frequent neurological emergency affecting patients across all age groups, GCSE is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Something we should take seriously and be ready to treat without hesitation. Early GCSE management should aim at rapid cessation of both clinical and electrical seizure activity, since appropriate and timely treatment of status epilepticus decreases the risk of complications and mortality. And there is hope. No less than 3 class I studies, on top of several class II and III studies, established parenteral benzodiazepines as an efficacious and safe first-line treatment of early convulsive SE treatment, including in the out-of-hospital setting. This evidence made its way into the most recent SE management guidelines, which clearly recommend the prompt administration of intravenous (IV) lorazepam, IV diazepam, or intramuscular (IM) midazolam (level A recommendation), at the doses studied in the RCT, as initial therapy of GCSE. They also propose intranasal buccal or rectal benzodiazepines as alternatives when IV/IM administration is not available. If a first dose is not successful, then the administration of a second ("rescue") dose is recommended. Yet, overwhelming evidence and clear guidelines somehow do not translate well into clinical practice. Observational studies have found that benzodiazepines are often delayed or underdosed, when they are not simply omitted. - These deviations from guidelines are not without consequences. Delayed or insufficient treatment with benzodiazepine has been associated with lower efficacy, a longer time to seizure cessation and an increased risk of refractoriness, leading to more intensive care unit admissions, more respiratory and hemodynamic complications, and worse outcome. -

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^a27bd5e6]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendations on the use of GABA-ergic medications in catatonia

Where benzodiazepines are used for catatonia, available routes of administration may include oral, sublingual, IM and IV. The choice of route should be decided based on clinical appropriateness, rapidity of the required response, patient preference, local experience and availability. (S)
Where benzodiazepines are used for catatonia, lorazepam is generally the preferred agent. (S)
Where lorazepam is used for catatonia, high doses above the licensed maximum may be necessary to achieve maximal effect. An adequate trial may be considered complete when catatonia is adequately treated, titration has been stopped due to side effects or dose has reached at least 16 mg per day. (C)
Benzodiazepines for catatonia should not be stopped abruptly but rather tapered down. The speed of the taper depends on a balance of the therapeutic benefits and the risks of withdrawal effects against the possibility of dependence and the risks of long-term harm from benzodiazepines. (S)
If catatonia relapses on withdrawal of benzodiazepines, a clinician should ensure that any underlying condition has been adequately treated and a slower taper may be tried. (S)

Electroconvulsive therapy

The first patients treated with convulsive therapy, both for chemically induced seizures by Meduna in 1934 and for electrically induced seizures by Cerletti and Bini in 1938, had catatonic illnesses. Since then, governmental authorities, authors of textbooks on ECT or catatonia, and most publications discussing treatment options for catatonia endorse ECT, usually as the most effective treatment even where medications or other interventions have failed. For example, the United States FDA panel endorsed ECT for catatonia under a less restrictive Class 2 safety/efficacy designation and in the UK NICE recommends ECT for catatonia. In the UK and many other countries, there are specific legal requirements for administering ECT in a patient who is unable to consent.

Despite this extensive clinical recognition in common practice, a rigorous base of high-quality published evidence is lacking. This deficiency of RCTs arises principally from practical difficulties in conducting sham or placebo treatment arms in people who are usually severely ill with catatonia and often lack an ability to participate in informed-consent processes for such clinical trials.

Appendix N — medications for managing intoxication: Benzodiazepines (BZDs) (first line) are GABAergic and indicated for excitatory symptoms, anxiety/agitation, neuromuscular excitation, and seizures. Initial dosing includes lorazepam 1–2 mg IV based on clinical signs and symptoms and duration of effects; diazepam 5–10 mg PO for less severe symptoms based on patient parameters; and midazolam 5 mg IM or 0.01–0.05 mg/kg IV for acute agitation in adult patients, and redosing frequency and dose should be guided by the degree and duration of the clinical effects of the initial dose. Other considerations note parenteral vs. PO administration based on signs and symptom severity and drug availability (eg, parenteral BZD shortages), and IM administration allows for administration in agitated patients without IV access; lorazepam has very slow IM onset (15–30 min); midazolam has very rapid IV onset, allowing for easy titration, and a relatively fast IM onset; if psychosis is primary symptom, antipsychotics should be considered primarily or adjunctively.

### Evidence-based guideline: treatment of convulsive status epilepticus in children and adults: report of the guideline committee of the American Epilepsy Society [^0e5f3415]. Epilepsy Currents (2016). Low credibility.

Context

The optimal pharmacologic treatment for early convulsive status epilepticus is unclear.

Objective

To analyze efficacy, tolerability and safety data for anticonvulsant treatment of children and adults with convulsive status epilepticus and use this analysis to develop an evidence-based treatment algorithm.

Data Sources

Structured literature review using MEDLINE, Embase, Current Contents, and Cochrane library supplemented with article reference lists.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials of anticonvulsant treatment for seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes.

Data Extraction

Individual studies were rated using predefined criteria and these results were used to form recommendations, conclusions, and an evidence-based treatment algorithm.

Results

A total of 38 randomized controlled trials were identified, rated and contributed to the assessment. Only four trials were considered to have class I evidence of efficacy. Two studies were rated as class II and the remaining 32 were judged to have class III evidence. In adults with convulsive status epilepticus, intramuscular midazolam, intravenous lorazepam, intravenous diazepam and intravenous phenobarbital are established as efficacious as initial therapy (Level A). Intramuscular midazolam has superior effectiveness compared to intravenous lorazepam in adults with convulsive status epilepticus without established intravenous access (Level A). In children, intravenous lorazepam and intravenous diazepam are established as efficacious at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes (Level A) while rectal diazepam, intramuscular midazolam, intranasal midazolam, and buccal midazolam are probably effective (Level B). No significant difference in effectiveness has been demonstrated between intravenous lorazepam and intravenous diazepam in adults or children with convulsive status epilepticus (Level A). Respiratory and cardiac symptoms are the most commonly encountered treatment-emergent adverse events associated with intravenous anticonvulsant drug administration in adults with convulsive status epilepticus (Level A). The rate of respiratory depression in patients with convulsive status epilepticus treated with benzodiazepines is lower than in patients with convulsive status epilepticus treated with placebo indicating that respiratory problems are an important consequence of untreated convulsive status epilepticus (Level A). When both are available, fosphenytoin is preferred over phenytoin based on tolerability but phenytoin is an acceptable alternative (Level A). In adults, compared to the first therapy, the second therapy is less effective while the third therapy is substantially less effective (Level A). In children, the second therapy appears less effective and there are no data about third therapy efficacy (Level C). The evidence was synthesized into a treatment algorithm.

Conclusions

Despite the paucity of well-designed randomized controlled trials, practical conclusions and an integrated treatment algorithm for the treatment of convulsive status epilepticus across the age spectrum (infants through adults) can be constructed. Multicenter, multinational efforts are needed to design, conduct and analyze additional randomized controlled trials that can answer the many outstanding clinically relevant questions identified in this guideline.

5.1 Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including LOREEV XR, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe LOREEV XR concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of LOREEV XR than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking LOREEV XR, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when LOREEV XR is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Sources of clinical recommendations for convulsive status epilepticus (SE) and generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) include that the treatment of convulsive SE should occur rapidly and continue sequentially until clinical seizures are halted (strong recommendation; high quality), that benzodiazepines should be given as emergent initial therapy (strong recommendation; high quality), and that urgent control AED therapy recommendations include use of IV fosphenytoin/phenytoin; valproate sodium, or levetiracetam (strong recommendation; moderate quality); from additional guidelines, treatment of GCSE must be started as soon as possible from the pre-hospitalization phase (Level 1B; Rating A) and I.V. lorazepam or diazepam are indicated for the treatment of initial GCSE, with I.V. lorazepam the benzodiazepine of choice because it is associated with a lower risk of early relapses (Level 1B; Rating A); initial pharmacological treatment for any prolonged seizure or SE episode should be (benzodiazepines). (Grade A); a benzodiazepine (specifically IM midazolam, IV lorazepam, or IV diazepam) is recommended as the initial therapy of choice (level A; four class I RCTs); and in GCSE, the preferred treatment pathway is IV administration of 0.1 mg/kg lorazepam (Level A rating).

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^0b2e3ac7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal risk by dose, duration, and frequency (Table 3) — clinical consensus estimates indicate that with any duration and ≤ 3 days per week the risk is no; with < 1 month and ≥ 4 days per week the risk is lower risk, but possible; with 1–3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at low total daily dose the risk is lower risk, but possible, whereas at moderate to high dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration; with ≥ 3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at any dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration. A low daily dose is estimated as 10 mg diazepam equivalents or less (e.g., ≤ 0.5 mg clonazepam, ≤ 2 mg lorazepam, ≤ 1 mg alprazolam), a moderate daily dose is estimated as 10–15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., 0.5–1.5 mg clonazepam, 2–3 mg lorazepam, 1–2 mg alprazolam), and a high daily dose is estimated as more than 15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., > 1.5 mg clonazepam, > 3 mg lorazepam, > 2 mg alprazolam).

Challenge tests

DSM-5-TR has included a diagnosis of unspecified catatonia to encourage early treatment while a search for an underlying disorder can continue. Challenge tests may provide support in clarifying diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This section is limited to the use of benzodiazepines and zolpidem as a diagnostic and therapeutic 'challenge test'. These agents are discussed in greater detail in section 'GABA-ergic pharmacotherapies'.

In 1930, Bleckwenn described the use of short-acting barbiturates to 'render catatonic patients responsive'. Lorazepam (and to a limited extent, other benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, midazolam, clonazepam and oxazepam) have now replaced the use of barbiturates (such as amobarbital and sodium thiopental) as a diagnostic challenge (sometimes called the lorazepam test or the diazepam test) for confirming the diagnosis of catatonia.

Lorazepam and other benzodiazepines

Lorazepam is an effective and clinically useful diagnostic challenge test for catatonia. It is available in oral, liquid, intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV) forms, and is available in a variety of clinical settings. Lorazepam is a non-selective positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors. Possible therapeutic mechanisms in catatonia are discussed in section 'GABA-ergic pharmacotherapies'.

The recommended dose for a lorazepam challenge is 1–2 mg IV, IM or 2 mg oral. The response to an oral challenge is often slower than for parenteral administration and oral formulations can be harder to administer to both hyperkinetic and hypokinetic patients. A positive response to a lorazepam challenge, commonly defined as a 50% reduction in catatonic signs on a standardised scale, makes a diagnosis of catatonia more likely, but it is not 100% specific. A good response on the first day appears predictive of overall response to lorazepam. Low serum iron has been reported as a predictor of poor response with benzodiazepines. An example protocol is provided in Table 9.

Table 9.
Example protocol for a lorazepam challenge for catatonia.

Based on their clinical effectiveness in these conditions, benzodiazepines may also be considered as a therapeutic test in antipsychotic-induced catatonia, NMS and malignant catatonia.

GABA-ergic pharmacotherapies

Evidence for pharmacotherapies for catatonia that augment GABA-ergic signalling pathways is supported by neuroimaging studies.conducted an iomazenil GABA-SPECT study and found that patients with catatonia (in a post-acute state) showed significantly lower iomazenil binding in the sensorimotor cortex as well as in the parietal cortex and prefrontal cortex (PFC). The same group was followed up in post-acute catatonia with a subsequent functional MRI (fMRI) study where emotional stimulation was applied before and after lorazepam administration: the orbitofrontal-ventromedial PFC was particularly responsive to a lorazepam challenge, normalising its activity.

The involvement of the orbitofrontal-ventromedial PFC was further supported by a separate fMRI study where post-acute catatonia patients showed significantly lower emotion-induced activity in this region compared to psychiatric patients without catatonia with the same underlying diagnosis and healthy controls. Given that the orbitofrontal-ventromedial PFC is strongly involved in emotion processing, which is mediated by GABA activity, these findings provide further evidence for GABA-ergic mechanisms in catatonia including both GABA-A and GABA-B receptors.

In terms of clinical findings, a double-blind RCT investigated the effect of the barbiturate derivative amobarbital in 1992, finding that of 10 patients randomised to the drug, 6 responded, compared to none of the 10 randomised to a saline infusion. However, barbiturate use has largely been abandoned since due to safety concerns.

Acute catatonia often shows a rapid and dramatic response to benzodiazepines in case series and observational studies, although a Cochrane review found no placebo-controlled RCTs evaluating benzodiazepines in catatonia.reported 17 studies describing benzodiazepine use in patients with catatonia. Most used lorazepam 1–4 mg per day, with some using up to 16 mg per day. Some sources recommend a maximum dose of 24 mg and there are cases of such doses being helpful. Some studies have used other benzodiazepines, such as oxazepam, diazepam, clonazepam or flurazepam and a small RCT found no difference in outcome between lorazepam and oxazepam treatment. However, lorazepam is the most commonly used benzodiazepine for catatonia, it is available in several formulations and its use has a large amount of clinical experience, including at high doses.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

Initiate LOREEV XR in patients who are being treated with lorazepam tablets, administered three times daily in evenly divided doses (refer to the Prescribing Information of lorazepam tablets for the recommended dosage of lorazepam tablets).

Discontinue lorazepam tablets and administer the first dose of LOREEV XR in the morning the day after the final dose of lorazepam tablets.

The recommended once daily dosage of LOREEV XR is equal to the total daily dose of lorazepam tablets. For example, the recommended dosage for patients who have been receiving lorazepam tablets at a dosage of 1 mg three times daily is LOREEV XR 3 mg once daily in the morning.

The effectiveness of LOREEV XR use for more than 4 months has not been assessed in clinical studies. Healthcare providers should periodically re-evaluate longer term use of LOREEV XR.

2.2 Administration Information

Administer LOREEV XR orally once daily, in the morning, with or without food. Do not crush or chew LOREEV XR.

Swallow LOREEV XR capsules whole or open the capsule and sprinkle the entire contents over a tablespoon of applesauce, followed by drinking water. Consume all the sprinkled LOREEV XR in its entirety, (without chewing) within 2 hours; do not store for future use.

2.3 Dosage Increase for Inadequate Clinical Response

If the clinical response to LOREEV XR is inadequate and a dosage increase in needed, discontinue LOREEV XR and switch to lorazepam tablets to increase the dosage. If an adequate clinical response is achieved with a stable, evenly divided three times daily dosage of lorazepam tablets, resume LOREEV XR once daily dosing with the total daily dose of lorazepam tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

2.4 Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of LOREEV XR

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue LOREEV XR or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of lorazepam tablets were not adequate to determine whether patients age 65 years and older responded differently than younger patients; however, the incidence of sedation and unsteadiness was observed to increase with age [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Age does not appear to have a significant effect on lorazepam pharmacokinetics [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Greater sensitivity (e.g., sedation) of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

As with all benzodiazepines, the use of lorazepam, including LOREEV XR, may worsen hepatic encephalopathy. Therefore, LOREEV XR should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency and/or encephalopathy.

Although seizures are common in prehospital settings, standardized emergency medical services (EMS) treatment algorithms do not exist nationally. We examined nationwide variability in status epilepticus treatment by analyzing 33 publicly available statewide EMS protocols. All adult protocols recommend intravenous benzodiazepines (midazolam, n = 33; lorazepam, n = 23; diazepam, n = 24), 30 recommend intramuscular benzodiazepines (midazolam, n = 30; lorazepam, n = 8; diazepam, n = 3), and 27 recommend intranasal benzodiazepines (midazolam, n = 27; lorazepam, n = 3); pediatric protocols also frequently recommend rectal diazepam (n = 14). Recommended dosages vary widely, and first- and second-line agents are designated in only 18 and 2 states, respectively. Given this degree of variability, standardized national EMS guidelines are needed. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:604–609.

d Within 12 h of ED arrival

Although definition of seizure cessation and of convulsive status epilepticus varied across the four included trials, our findings showed that, in general, benzodiazepines (i.e. lorazepam, diazepam, and midazolam) were effective at stopping seizures in adults treated in the pre-hospital setting. In the only trial with an untreated placebo arm by Alldredge et al. convulsive status epilepticus was successfully terminated before arrival at the emergency department in 59.1%, of adults treated with 2 mg IV lorazepam, in 42.6% of those treated with 5 mg IV diazepam and in 21.1% of those who received placebo, with no significant difference between the two benzodiazepine treatments (adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.8 to 4.4). The hazard ratio for the time between active treatment and seizure cessation was 2.94 (95% CI 1.41–5.88) for lorazepam versus placebo and 1.54 (95% CI 0.85–2.77) for lorazepam versus diazepam. In the RAMPART trial by Silbergleit et al. 10 mg IM midazolam was non-inferior to 4 mg IV lorazepam for achieving seizure cessation (73.9% vs 62.4% of participants, respectively and the median time from active treatment to cessation of convulsions was similar across treatment groups: 2 versus 3 min in the midazolam and lorazepam groups, respectively). In the trial by Navarro et al. the addition of 2.5 g IV levetiracetam to 1 mg clonazepam did not confer any clear benefits over 1 mg clonazepam plus IV placebo in terms of the proportion of participants with seizure cessation (73.2% vs 83.8% participants, respectively). The median time between active treatment and interruption of the convulsion was 3 versus 5 min in the levetiracetam + clonazepam group and the clonazepam + placebo group, respectively. In the study by Shaner et al. more participants treated with 100 mg/min IV phenobarbital plus 40 mg/min phenytoin achieved seizure cessation than those treated with 2 mg/min IV diazepam plus 40 mg/min phenytoin (72.2% participants vs 33.3%, respectively). The median time from active treatment to seizure cessation was shorter for the phenobarbital group than for the diazepam group (5.5 vs 15 min, respectively, p < 0.10).

Emergent initial therapy for SE — benzodiazepine selection and route — states that benzodiazepines should be the agent of choice for emergent initial treatment, with intravenous (IV) administration preferred when feasible. When IV therapy is not feasible, benzodiazepines can be administered via intramuscular (IM), rectal, nasal, or buccal routes. For IV therapy, lorazepam is the preferred agent; midazolam is preferred for IM therapy (and can also be given nasally or buccally); and diazepam is preferred for rectal administration. IM midazolam was found to be at least as effective as IV lorazepam in prehospitalized patients with SE.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes include: 1. Clinical cessation of seizure activity at two hours following the commencement of the study infusions without the need for further seizure management after the initial agent (levetiracetam or phenytoin); 2. Clinical cessation of seizure activity at two hours following the commencement of the study treatment regimen without the need for RSI or further seizure management (comparison of LP versus PL regimens); 3. Time to clinical seizure cessation from commencement of study treatment regimen; 4. Need for RSI with thiopentone for on-going seizure management after administration of study treatment regimen; 5. ICU admission; 6. Serious adverse events (primary safety outcome) including death, airway complications, and cardiovascular instability (cardiac arrest, arrhythmia and hypotension requiring intervention); 7. Length of Hospital/ICU stay; 8. Health care costs (total costs associated with CSE admission); 9. Seizure status at one month post discharge, or two months post randomisation (whichever is the earliest); 10. Death at one month one post discharge, or two months post randomisation (whichever is the earliest).

Study process

At all sites patients arriving in clinically diagnosed CSE are assigned an Australasian Triage Category score of 1, as per current procedure, and are immediately taken to the resuscitation area for management. Standard seizure care is initiated in accordance with each site's clinical practice guidelines, including establishment of IV or intraosseous (IO) access. All clinical practice guidelines, Advanced Life Support Group guideline, and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network guideline, recommend two doses of benzodiazepine prior to initiation of second line seizure medications. For the purposes of the study sites can give their usual benzodiazepine type (diazepam, lorazepam, or midazolam), route (rectal, buccal, oral, intranasal, IV, IO, or intramuscular) and dose. Doses given by parents and/or paramedic staff are regarded as an effective benzodiazepine dose for the purposes of the study. The minimum dose and route of each benzodiazepine is detailed in Table 1.

Background

Delirium is a very common condition associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and costs. Current critical care guidelines recommend first and foremost the use of nonpharmacological strategies in both the prevention and treatment of delirium. Pharmacological interventions may augment these approaches and they are currently used widely in clinical practice to manage the symptoms of delirium. Benzodiazepines are currently used in clinical practice to treat behavioural disturbances associated with delirium but current guidelines do not recommend their use for this indication. The use of these medicines is controversial because there is uncertainty about whether they are effective for patients or have the potential to harm them.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines in the treatment of delirium (excluding delirium related to withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines) in any healthcare settings other than intensive care units (ICU).

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register up to 10 April 2019. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries (including national, international and pharmaceutical registries), and grey literature sources.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in healthcare settings that ranged from nursing homes and long-term care facilities to any hospital setting except for ICUs, involving adult patients with delirium excluding those with delirium related to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Included RCTs had to assess the effect of benzodiazepines, at any dose and given by any route, compared with placebo or another drug intended to treat delirium.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We decided whether or not to pool data on the basis of clinical heterogeneity between studies. We used GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We identified only two trials that satisfied the selection criteria. We did not pool the data because of the substantial clinical differences between the trials. In one trial, participants (n = 58) were patients in an acute palliative care unit with advanced cancer who had a mean age of 64 years. All of the participants had delirium, were treated with haloperidol, and were randomised to receive either lorazepam or placebo in combination with it. Due to very serious imprecision, all evidence was of low certainty. We were unable to determine whether there were clinically important differences in the severity of delirium (mean difference (MD) 2.10, 95% CI -0.96 to 5.16; n = 50), length of hospital admission (MD 0.00, 95% CI -3.45 to 3.45; n = 58), mortality from all causes (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.02; participants = 58) or any of a number of adverse events. Important effects could not be confirmed or excluded. The study authors did not report the length of the delirium episode. In the other trial, participants (n = 30) were patients in general medical wards with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) who had a mean age of 39.2 years. Investigators compared three drug treatments: all participants had delirium, and were randomised to receive lorazepam, chlorpromazine, or haloperidol. Very low-certainty evidence was identified, and we could not determine whether lorazepam differed from either of the other treatments in the effect on severity of delirium, any adverse event, or mortality from all causes. The study authors did not report the length of the delirium episode or the length of hospital admission.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no enough evidence to determine whether benzodiazepines are effective when used to treat patients with delirium who are cared for in non-ICU settings. The available evidence does not support their routine use for this indication. Because of the scarcity of data from randomised controlled trials, further research is required to determine whether or not there is a role for benzodiazepines in the treatment of delirium in non-ICU settings.

### Lorazepam (Loreev xr) [^949779e0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Distribution

Following a single 3 mg dose of LOREEV XR under fasted conditions, the mean apparent volume of distribution is approximately 117 L. At clinically relevant concentrations, lorazepam is approximately 85% bound to plasma proteins.

Elimination

Oral mean plasma clearance (CL/F) is about 72 mL/min in adults following a single 3 mg dose of LOREEV XR and the mean elimination half-life of lorazepam is approximately 20.2 ± 7.2 hours.

Metabolism

Lorazepam is conjugated at its 3-hydroxy group in the liver into lorazepam glucuronide, which has no demonstratable CNS activity in animals.

Excretion

Lorazepam glucuronide is excreted in the urine.

Specific Populations

Geriatric Patients

Studies comparing young and elderly subjects have shown that advancing age does not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam tablets. However, a study involving single intravenous doses of 1.5 to 3 mg of lorazepam injection, mean total body clearance of lorazepam decreased by 20% in 15 elderly subjects of 60 to 84 years of age compared to that in 15 younger subjects of 19 to 38 years of age. The clinical significance of the decrease in mean total body clearance of lorazepam injection in geriatric patients is unknown.

### Drug management for acute tonic-clonic convulsions including convulsive status epilepticus in children [^0bf06556]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Tonic-clonic convulsions and convulsive status epilepticus (currently defined as a tonic-clonic convulsion lasting at least 30 minutes) are medical emergencies and require urgent and appropriate anticonvulsant treatment. International consensus is that an anticonvulsant drug should be administered for any tonic-clonic convulsion that has been continuing for at least five minutes. Benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam) are traditionally regarded as first-line drugs and phenobarbital, phenytoin and paraldehyde as second-line drugs. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002 and updated in 2008.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of anticonvulsant drugs used to treat any acute tonic-clonic convulsion of any duration, including established convulsive (tonic-clonic) status epilepticus in children who present to a hospital or emergency medical department.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialised Register (23 May 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO, 23 May 2017), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 23 May 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov (23 May 2017), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, 23 May 2017).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing any anticonvulsant drugs used for the treatment of an acute tonic-clonic convulsion including convulsive status epilepticus in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

The review includes 18 randomised trials involving 2199 participants, and a range of drug treatment options, doses and routes of administration (rectal, buccal, nasal, intramuscular and intravenous). The studies vary by design, setting and population, both in terms of their ages and also in their clinical situation. We have made many comparisons of drugs and of routes of administration of drugs in this review; our key findings are as follows:(1) This review provides only low- to very low-quality evidence comparing buccal midazolam with rectal diazepam for the treatment of acute tonic-clonic convulsions (risk ratio (RR) for seizure cessation 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 1.38; 4 trials; 690 children). However, there is uncertainty about the effect and therefore insufficient evidence to support its use. There were no included studies which compare intranasal and buccal midazolam.(2) Buccal and intranasal anticonvulsants were shown to lead to similar rates of seizure cessation as intravenous anticonvulsants, e.g. intranasal lorazepam appears to be as effective as intravenous lorazepam (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.13; 1 trial; 141 children; high-quality evidence) and intranasal midazolam was equivalent to intravenous diazepam (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.06; 2 trials; 122 children; moderate-quality evidence).(3) Intramuscular midazolam also showed a similar rate of seizure cessation to intravenous diazepam (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.09; 2 trials; 105 children; low-quality evidence).(4) For intravenous routes of administration, lorazepam appears to be as effective as diazepam in stopping acute tonic clonic convulsions: RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.16; 3 trials; 414 children; low-quality evidence. Furthermore, we found no statistically significant or clinically important differences between intravenous midazolam and diazepam (RR for seizure cessation 1.08, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.21; 1 trial; 80 children; moderate-quality evidence) or intravenous midazolam and lorazepam (RR for seizure cessation 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.04; 1 trial; 80 children; moderate-quality evidence). In general, intravenously-administered anticonvulsants led to more rapid seizure cessation but this was usually compromised by the time taken to establish intravenous access.(5) There is limited evidence from a single trial to suggest that intranasal lorazepam may be more effective than intramuscular paraldehyde in stopping acute tonic-clonic convulsions (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.52; 160 children; moderate-quality evidence).(6) Adverse side effects were observed and reported very infrequently in the included studies. Respiratory depression was the most common and most clinically relevant side effect and, where reported, the frequency of this adverse event was observed in 0% to up to 18% of children. None of the studies individually demonstrated any difference in the rates of respiratory depression between the different anticonvulsants or their different routes of administration; but when pooled, three studies (439 children) provided moderate-quality evidence that lorazepam was significantly associated with fewer occurrences of respiratory depression than diazepam (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93). Much of the evidence provided in this review is of mostly moderate to high quality. However, the quality of the evidence provided for some important outcomes is low to very low, particularly for comparisons of non-intravenous routes of drug administration. Low- to very low-quality evidence was provided where limited data and imprecise results were available for analysis, methodological inadequacies were present in some studies which may have introduced bias into the results, study settings were not applicable to wider clinical practice, and where inconsistency was present in some pooled analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

We have not identified any new high-quality evidence on the efficacy or safety of an anticonvulsant in stopping an acute tonic-clonic convulsion that would inform clinical practice. There appears to be a very low risk of adverse events, specifically respiratory depression. Intravenous lorazepam and diazepam appear to be associated with similar rates of seizure cessation and respiratory depression. Although intravenous lorazepam and intravenous diazepam lead to more rapid seizure cessation, the time taken to obtain intravenous access may undermine this effect. In the absence of intravenous access, buccal midazolam or rectal diazepam are therefore acceptable first-line anticonvulsants for the treatment of an acute tonic-clonic convulsion that has lasted at least five minutes. There is no evidence provided by this review to support the use of intranasal midazolam or lorazepam as alternatives to buccal midazolam or rectal diazepam.

### Clinical performance measures for neurocritical care: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^f1b8d17d]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Neurocritical care performance measure — adult generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) treated rapidly with a benzodiazepine — targets the 'percentage of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) who are treated with benzodiazepines within 20 minutes of hospital arrival', with the numerator defined as 'adult patients with GCSE treated within 20 minutes of hospital arrival with a benzodiazepine (intravenous [IV] lorazepam, IV diazepam, or IV midazolam; if the patient does not have an IV then IM midazolam should be used)'. The denominator includes 'adult patients with generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE)' and excludes ' < 18 years of age', 'Length of stay > 120 days', 'Status epilepticus from hypoglycemia', and 'Appropriate benzodiazepine dose already given in pre-hospital setting or at referring hospital' The assessment period is 'First 24 hours of hospitalization'. For the purposes of this measure, convulsive status epilepticus is defined as 'five minutes or more of continuous clinical seizure activity or recurrent seizure activity without recovery (return to baseline) between seizures'. The rationale cites disease burden — 'An estimated 152,000 cases occur per year in the United States, resulting in 42,000 deaths and an inpatient cost of $3.8 to $7 billion per year' — and emphasizes early therapy: 'Prompt treatment of ongoing convulsive status epilepticus with an appropriate non-benzodiazepine antiepileptic drug following or simultaneously ordered with a benzodiazepine shortens the duration of status epilepticus'. Related guidance notes that the 2016 American Epilepsy Society algorithm sets the initial benzodiazepine phase 'no longer than 20 minutes from onset of seizure', and dosing used in RAMPART — 'lorazepam 4 mg IV or midazolam 10 mg IM' — 'could be considered as reasonable'.

### Anticonvulsant therapy for status epilepticus [^fbab217e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Status epilepticus is a medical emergency associated with significant mortality and morbidity, which requires immediate and effective treatment.

Objectives

(1) To determine whether a particular anticonvulsant is more effective or safer to use in status epilepticus compared to another and compared to placebo.(2) To delineate reasons for disagreement in the literature regarding recommended treatment regimens and to highlight areas for future research.

Search Strategy

We searched the following electronic databases using the highly sensitive search strategy for identifying published randomised controlled trials: (1) Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (July 2005); (2) Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2,2005); (3) MEDLINE (1966 - August 2004); (4) EMBASE (1966 - January 2003).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of participants with premonitory, early, established or refractory status epilepticus using a truly random or quasi-random allocation of treatments were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Eleven studies with 2017 participants were included. Few studies used the same interventions. Diazepam was better than placebo in reducing the risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92), requirement for ventilatory support (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.94) or continuation of status epilepticus requiring use of a different drug or general anaesthesia (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92). Lorazepam was better than placebo for risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.71) and for risk of continuation of status epilepticus requiring a different drug or general anaesthesia (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.71). Lorazepam was better than diazepam for reducing risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.90) and had a lower risk for continuation of status epilepticus requiring a different drug or general anaesthesia (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.88). Lorazepam was better than phenytoin for risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.86). Diazepam (30 mg intrarectal gel) was better than a lower dose (20 mg intrarectal gel) in premonitory status epilepticus for the risk of seizure continuation (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.86).

Authors' Conclusions

Lorazepam is better than diazepam or phenytoin alone for cessation of seizures and carries a lower risk of continuation of status epilepticus requiring a different drug or general anaesthesia. Both lorazepam and diazepam are better than placebo for the same outcomes. In the treatment of premonitory seizures, diazepam 30 mg in an intrarectal gel is better than 20 mg for cessation of seizures without a statistically significant increase in adverse effects. Universally accepted definitions of premonitory, early, established and refractory status epilepticus are required.

### Propylene glycol accumulation in critically ill patients receiving continuous intravenous lorazepam infusions [^6491ec5f]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Lorazepam is recommended by the Society of Critical Care Medicine as the preferred agent for sedation of critically ill patients. Intravenous lorazepam contains propylene glycol, which has been associated with toxicity when high doses of lorazepam are administered.

Objective

To evaluate the accumulation of propylene glycol in critically ill patients receiving lorazepam by continuous infusion and determine factors associated with propylene glycol concentration.

Methods

A 6-month, retrospective, safety assessment was conducted of adults admitted to the medical intensive care unit who were receiving lorazepam by continuous infusion for 12 hours or more. Propylene glycol serum concentrations were obtained 24–48 hours after continuous-infusion lorazepam was initiated and every 3–5 days thereafter. Propylene glycol accumulation was defined as concentrations of 25 mg/dL or more. Groups with and without propylene glycol accumulation were compared and factors associated with propylene glycol concentration were determined using multivariate correlation regression analyses.

Results

Forty-eight propylene glycol serum samples were obtained from 33 patients. Fourteen (42%) patients had propylene glycol accumulation, representing 23 (48%) serum samples. Univariate analyses showed the following factors were related to propylene glycol accumulation: baseline renal dysfunction, presence of alcohol withdrawal, sex, age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score, rate of lorazepam continuous infusion, and 24-hour lorazepam dose. Multivariate linear regression modeling demonstrated that propylene glycol concentration was strongly associated with the continuous infusion rate and 24-hour dose (adjusted r(2) ≥ 0.77; p < 0.001). Independent correlation analyses showed that these 2 variables were so strongly associated with propylene glycol concentration (r(2) ≥ 0.71; p < 0.001) that they alone predicted propylene glycol concentration. Seven (21%) patients developed renal dysfunction after continuous-infusion lorazepam was initiated, but associated causes were indeterminable. Other possible propylene glycol-associated adverse effects were not observed.

Conclusions

The continuous infusion rate and cumulative 24-hour lorazepam dose are strongly associated with and independently predict propylene glycol concentrations. Despite the absence of confirmed propylene glycol-associated adverse effects, clinicians should be aware that propylene glycol accumulation may occur with continuous-infusion lorazepam.

### Comparative safety of medications for severe agitation: a geriatric emergency department guidelines 2.0 systematic review [^c6f11c4f]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Synthesis Methods and Statistical Analysis

We reported the aggregate occurrence of any adverse event, adverse respiratory events, and other (nonrespiratory) adverse events for each individual study included in the systematic review. Adverse events were pooled by drug across studies of the same study type, with observational studies and clinical trials presented separately. Drugs with inadequate samples (n < 15) were not included in the pooled analysis as confidence intervals (CIs) would be large and noninterpretable. Odds ratios (ORs) are reported for the occurrence of any adverse events, adverse respiratory events, other adverse events, and need for redosing with haloperidol as a reference group. Haloperidol was selected as the reference given its common use in clinical practice and historical precedent as 1st line treatment in calming older adults with agitation. The 95% CI of ORs was calculated using, where a, b, c, d are number of cases and noncases within each medication group. We pooled data across the included studies and examined associations of antipsychotic or anxiolytic medications with time to sedation using weighted linear regression, adjusting for study. Weights were assigned as 1 to studies that provided individual‐level data. For studies that provided aggregated data, we assigned weights to the data that were proportional to the number of participants on which the data were aggregated. All statistical analyses were performed in R 4.2.3.

Subgroup dose‐response analyses were also pursued within each drug to assess the impact on any adverse events, adverse respiratory events, and other adverse events by dosing and formulation. Within each drug, a low dosing strategy was used as the reference group. Low dosing strategies were defined, based on study authors' consensus, as 0.5–2 mg for haloperidol, 2.5–5 mg for droperidol, 0.25–2.5 mg for midazolam, 0.25–1 mg for lorazepam, 1–5 mg for olanzapine, and 12.5–25 mg for quetiapine. In analyzing the impact of formulation, we pooled results from drugs available in both oral and parenteral formulations (haloperidol, olanzapine, and lorazepam) to compare safety across oral (PO), intramuscular (IM), and intravenous (IV) administrations.

### Propylene glycol-induced lactic acidosis in a patient with normal renal function: a proposed mechanism and monitoring recommendations [^6f8fb14e]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of severe propylene glycol-induced lactic acidosis not attributable to renal dysfunction that was secondary to administration of high-dose intravenous lorazepam.

Case Summary

A 24-year-old female with community-acquired pneumonia presented with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. To maintain adequate sedation and ventilation and reduce airway pressure, several relaxation strategies were used including high-dose intravenous lorazepam, fentanyl, and cisatracurium. After 18 days of high-dose continuous infusion of lorazepam (maximum dose 50 mg/h), the patient developed severe lactic acidosis secondary to propylene glycol toxicity, the main diluent of lorazepam. The acidosis temporarily resolved with bicarbonate administration and discontinuation of lorazepam. Her renal function remained stable for a time (serum creatinine 0.5 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 10 mg/dL, urine output 100–200 mL/h). However, after several more days, the patient's condition deteriorated, and she ultimately died.

Discussion

Previous cases of propylene glycol toxicity secondary to high-dose lorazepam infusion have occurred in patients with compromised renal function. Our patient's renal function remained stable throughout the hospital course, which caused us to look further for an explanation for the propylene glycol-induced lactic acidosis. Based on the Naranjo probability scale, propylene glycol was determined to be the probable cause of lactic acidosis. Since this case occurred, our intensive care unit has instituted recommendations for the prevention of lorazepam-associated propylene glycol toxicity.

Conclusions

Our case highlights the development of propylene glycol-induced lactic acidosis secondary to high-dose lorazepam infusion not associated with renal dysfunction.

### A double-blind, randomized comparison of I.V. lorazepam versus midazolam for sedation of ICU patients via a pharmacologic model [^635ff98f]. Anesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and midazolam, are frequently administered to surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients for postoperative sedation. To date, the pharmacology of lorazepam in critically ill patients has not been described. The aim of the current study was to characterize and compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of lorazepam and midazolam administered as continuous intravenous infusions for postoperative sedation of surgical ICU patients.

Methods

With Institutional Review Board approval, 24 consenting adult surgical patients were given either lorazepam or midazolam in a double-blind fashion (together with either intravenous fentanyl or epidural morphine for analgesia) through target-controlled intravenous infusions titrated to maintain a moderate level of sedation for 12–72 h postoperatively. Moderate sedation was defined as a Ramsay Sedation Scale score of 3 or 4. Sedation scores were measured, together with benzodiazepine plasma concentrations. Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were estimated using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling.

Results

A two-compartment model best described the pharmacokinetics of both lorazepam and midazolam. The pharmacodynamic model predicted depth of sedation for both midazolam and lorazepam with 76% accuracy. The estimated sedative potency of lorazepam was twice that of midazolam. The predicted C50, ss (plasma benzodiazepine concentrations where P(Sedation ≥ ss) = 50%) values for midazolam (sedation score [SS] ≥ n, where n = a Ramsay Sedation Score of 2, 3,… 6) were 68, 101, 208, 304, and 375 ng/ml. The corresponding predicted C50, ss values for lorazepam were 34, 51, 104, 152, and 188 ng/ml, respectively. Age, fentanyl administration, and the resolving effects of surgery and anesthesia were significant covariates of benzodiazepine sedation. The relative amnestic potency of lorazepam to midazolam was 4 (observed). The predicted emergence times from sedation after a 72-h benzodiazepine infusion for light (SS = 3) and deep (SS = 5) sedation in a typical patient were 3.6 and 14.9 h for midazolam infusions and 11.9 and 31.1 h for lorazepam infusions, respectively.

Conclusions

The pharmacology of intravenous infusions of lorazepam differs significantly from that of midazolam in critically ill patients. This results in significant delays in emergence from sedation with lorazepam as compared with midazolam when administered for ICU sedation.

### Oral clonazepam versus lorazepam in the treatment of methamphetamine-poisoned children: a pilot clinical trial [^01c7face]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

As depicted in Table 1, the median [IQR] treatment response and duration of symptoms was 4 hours for all patients with a hospitalization period closer to 24–48 hours. The long hospitalization period compared to the short duration of toxicity was due to the observation period to monitor for possible adverse effects (i.e. over-sedation) and persisting agitation. During the monitoring period, patients were mostly calm, but their vital signs (i.e. temperature and heart rate) changed over time, see Table 2. Our findings thus support our hypothesis that treatment with oral clonazepam or lorazepam following an IV diazepam loading dose is efficacious. It may also reduce the burden for healthcare workers, for whom establishing and maintaining the IV line in pediatric patients is a major concern.

Compared to the aforementioned studies, we managed to enroll a substantial sample of 30 patients. Replication of our findings would lend further support to the concept of the combination treatment of IV and oral BZO as a practical, novel, and cost-efficient intervention. However, further studies to evaluate different BZOs in the setting of acute methamphetamine poisoning in children are also warranted. These may include a comparison of the non-IV administration of different BZOs, e.g. by the intranasal (diazepam, midazolam), buccal and intramuscular (both midazolam) routes, which have already been tested in the management of epileptic seizures in children and shown similar efficacy as IV diazepam for this indication.

The generalizability of our findings is limited by the fact that all patients were recruited at a single center in Tehran, and the external validity may be questionable. Due to the wide age distribution and limited size of our sample we were unable to stratify outcomes by age range.

Moreover, individual patients were not randomly assigned to their treatment condition (i.e. randomization was conducted based on week of presentation), and we thus cannot rule out the possibility of clinician bias. Future research could compare the treatment regimens more systematically in a blinded RCT. Lack of administration equivalent doses of clonazepam and lorazepam was also a possible limitation. We followed textbook recommendation for recommended dose (mg/kg) of lorazepam and clonazepam, in which they were the same.

Another limitation is lack of agitation score in different times study which should be mentioned in future studies.

### Oral clonazepam versus lorazepam in the treatment of methamphetamine-poisoned children: a pilot clinical trial [^4cfd365b]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study, treatment with oral clonazepam and oral lorazepam had the same efficacy in the resolution of the signs and symptoms of methamphetamine toxicity in children. Both treatments could reduce respiratory rate with no significant effect on blood pressure, thus constituting what appears to be appropriate control of agitation. Lorazepam was superior to clonazepam in decreasing patients' heart rate and temperature. Limited access to parenteral lorazepam (as a good substitute for parenteral BZOs such as diazepam and midazolam) in Iran had had made us look for safer oral alternatives, and our results show that most of our pediatric patients were sedated adequately with the combination treatment of only 0.2-mg/Kg IV diazepam as loading dose followed by oral BZO administration (clonazepam or lorazepam at 0.05 mg/Kg). This combination treatment was well tolerated, as none of the patients in our sample experienced any complications. Oral lorazepam and clonazepam were both administered at an average dose of 1.1 mg. Since we found equal efficacy with both agents at equal dose, information from the BZO equivalency table suggests that lorazepam, as the oral BZO with a wider safety margin, should be preferred.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^f97633f0]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Selection of longer-acting benzodiazepines during transition reports that guidelines recommending a transition most commonly endorse switching to diazepam or clonazepam, with a few suggesting chlordiazepoxide; because all of these are metabolized in the liver and have active metabolites, they should not be used in patients with significant hepatic impairment; instead, lorazepam — which is not impacted by hepatic function and does not have active metabolites — is a better agent in these patients; conversion to diazepam equivalents is not straightforward and depends on patient factors such as age, metabolism, and other medications.

### Drug management for acute tonic-clonic convulsions including convulsive status epilepticus in children [^5e89b5c3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Tonic-clonic (grand mal) convulsions and convulsive status epilepticus (currently defined as a grand mal convulsion lasting at least 30 minutes) are medical emergencies and demand urgent and appropriate anticonvulsant treatment. Diazepam, lorazepam, phenobarbitone, phenytoin and paraldehyde may all be regarded as drugs of first choice.

Objectives

To review the evidence comparing diazepam, lorazepam, phenobarbitone, phenytoin and paraldehyde in treating acute tonic-clonic convulsions and convulsive status epilepticus in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's specialized register (4 July 2002); the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2002); MEDLINE (28 May 2002) and EMBASE (January 2002).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing lorazepam and other anticonvulsant drugs used for the treatment of convulsive status epilepticus in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

This was a review of published, aggregate data. The main outcome measures included cessation of the presenting tonic-clonic convulsion/episode of convulsive status epilepticus; the number of additional drugs required to stop the convulsion; people demonstrating respiratory depression and people requiring admission to the intensive care unit because of respiratory depression.

Main Results

Only one trial was found, in which children were allocated lorazepam or diazepam. The main results are as follows. (1) One or two intravenous doses stopped the convulsion in 19 of 27 (70%) lorazepam and 22 of the 34 (65%) intravenous diazepam-treated children. The relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was 1.09(95% CI 0.77 to 1.54). A single dose of rectal lorazepam stopped the convulsion in six of six, compared to six of 19 children treated with rectal diazepam, RR 3.17(95% CI 1.63 to 6.14). (2) Six of the 27 (22%) intravenous lorazepam and 12 of the 34 (35%) intravenous diazepam-treated children respectively, experienced a further convulsion within 24 hours after presentation RR 0.63(95% CI 0.27 to 1.46). (3) Only one of 27 children (4%) who received intravenous lorazepam compared to five of 34 children (15%) who received intravenous diazepam required additional antiepileptic drugs to terminate the presenting seizure RR 0.25(95% CI 0.03 to 2.03). (4) A lower incidence of respiratory depression occurred in the lorazepam-treated group: one of 27 (4%) children compared to seven of 34 in the diazepam-treated group (21%), RR 0.21(95% CI 0.02 to 1.37).

Reviewer's Conclusions

This review provides no evidence to suggest that intravenous lorazepam should be preferred to diazepam as the first-line drug in treating acute tonic-clonic convulsions including convulsive status epilepticus in children. There was some evidence from this review that rectal lorazepam may be more effective and safer than rectal diazepam, but the data were insufficient to indicate that lorazepam should replace diazepam as the first choice rectal drug in treating acute tonic-clonic convulsions and convulsive status epilepticus.

### Impact of a divided phenobarbital load and taper compared with lorazepam symptom triggered therapy in hospitalized patients [^799932be]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Benzodiazepines are the preferred treatment for alcohol withdrawal. Phenobarbital is an alternative in the setting of prescriber expertise or benzodiazepine contraindication.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a phenobarbital dosing strategy aimed at treating a spectrum of alcohol withdrawal symptoms across various patient populations.

Methods

Retrospective review of patients admitted with concerns of alcohol withdrawal between May 2018 and November 2022. Patients were separated into a before-after cohort of lorazepam or phenobarbital. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes were intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, escalation of respiratory support, increased level of care (LOC), and incidence of delirium tremens and/or seizures.

Results

Two hundred and seventy-seven patients received lorazepam and 198 received phenobarbital. Hospital LOS was longer in the phenobarbital cohort compared with the lorazepam cohort (6.9 vs 9.3 days). There was no difference in ICU LOS. Level of care increases were fewer in the phenobarbital cohort (4 events vs 19 events). There were higher rates of non-invasive respiratory interventions in the lorazepam cohort and higher rates of mechanical ventilation in the phenobarbital cohort. Utilization of phenobarbital was attributed to a reduction in delirium tremens and seizures.

Conclusion and Relevance

This study is novel because of the broad application of a phenobarbital order set across multiple levels of care and patient admission diagnoses. A risk targeted split load intravenous phenobarbital order set can safely be administered to patients with fewer escalations of care, seizures, delirium tremens, and respiratory care escalation.

When agitation persists despite administration of antimanic treatments, additional rapidly acting pharmacotherapy may often be needed. The evidence for specific efficacy of various agents in short‐term treatment of agitation is summarized in Table 11. Some of these agents are either not available or rarely used in North America (eg, midazolam and promethazine). We further note that the dose ranges in Table 11 are based on the doses studied in the trials, and would probably be appropriate in most situations. However, a comprehensive evaluation of the agitated patient is necessary (ie, medical conditions, treatments, drugs, intoxication, etc.) to determine a safe and adequate dose.

Table 11
Level of evidence and recommendations for short‐term pharmacological management of agitation a

As can be seen from Table 11, the highest level of evidence available in short‐term treatment of agitation for oral formulations of any agent is level 3, and level 2 for intramuscular (IM) or inhaled formulations. In this context, it is important to remember that the absence of evidence does not constitute lack of efficacy. Indeed, clinical experience suggests that agitation in many patients with acute mania responds well to the oral medications. Thus, a loading dose of divalproex, oral formulations of atypical antipsychotics, conventional antipsychotics such as haloperidol or loxapine, and/or benzodiazepines such as lorazepam may be appropriate. If a patient indicates willingness to take oral treatment but there is a suspicion that the patient might "cheek" the medication, then either orally dispersing tablets (ODT), those that rapidly melt, oral liquid, or oral inhalation forms should be considered. In countries where inhaled loxapine is available, this could be considered if there are no contraindications.

### Lorlatinib (Lorbrena) [^24f328fa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Steady-state lorlatinib maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) increases proportionally and AUC increased slightly less than proportionally over the dose range of 10 mg to 200 mg orally once daily (0.1 to 2 times the recommended dosage). At the recommended dosage, the mean (coefficient of variation [CV] %) Cmaxwas 577 ng/mL (42%) and the AUC0–24hwas 5650 ng∙h/mL (39%) in patients with cancer. Lorlatinib oral clearance increased at steady-state compared to single dose, indicating autoinduction.

Absorption

The median lorlatinib Tmaxwas 1.2 hours (0.5 to 4 hours) following a single oral 100 mg dose and 2 hours (0.5 to 23 hours) following 100 mg orally once daily at steady-state.

The mean absolute bioavailability is 81% (90% CI 75.7%, 86.2%) after oral administration compared to intravenous administration.

Effect of Food

There was no clinically significant effect on lorlatinib pharmacokinetics following administration of LORBRENA with a high fat, high calorie meal (approximately 1000 calories with 150 calories from protein, 250 calories from carbohydrate, and 500 to 600 calories from fat).

Distribution

Lorlatinib was 66% bound to plasma proteins at a concentration of 2.4 µM. The blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.99, in vitro. The mean (CV%) steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) was 305 L (28%) following a single intravenous dose.

### Drug management for acute tonic-clonic convulsions including convulsive status epilepticus in children [^cbcd4e5c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Tonic-clonic (grand mal) convulsions and convulsive status epilepticus (currently defined as a grand mal convulsion lasting at least 30 minutes) are medical emergencies and demand urgent and appropriate anticonvulsant treatment. Benzodiazepines (midazolam, diazepam, lorazepam), phenobarbitone, phenytoin and paraldehyde may all be regarded as drugs of first choice. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2002 and previously updated in 2005.

Objectives

To review the evidence comparing the efficacy and safety of midazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, phenobarbitone, phenytoin and paraldehyde in treating acute tonic-clonic convulsions and convulsive status epilepticus in children treated in hospital.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (1st July 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2007), and MEDLINE (1966 to July 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing any anticonvulsant drugs used for the treatment of an acute tonic-clonic convulsion including convulsive status epilepticus in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

Four trials involving 383 participants were included.(1) Intravenous lorazepam is as effective as intravenous diazepam in the treatment of acute tonic clonic convulsions, 19/27 (70%) versus 22/34 (65%), RR 1.09 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.54), has fewer adverse events and rectal lorazepam may be more effective than rectal diazepam, 6/6 versus 6/19 (31%), RR 3.17 (95% CI 1.63 to 6.14)(2) Buccal midazolam controlled seizures in 61/109 (56%) compared with 30/110 (27%) of rectal diazepam treated episodes with acute tonic-clonic convulsions, RR 2.05 (95% CI 1.45 to 2.91)(3) Intranasal midazolam is as effective as intravenous diazepam in the treatment of prolonged febrile convulsions, 23/26 (88%) versus 24/26 (92%), RR 0.96 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.14)(4) There is moderate evidence that intranasal lorazepam is more effective than intramuscular paraldehyde for acute tonic-clonic convulsions and patients treated with intranasal lorazepam are significantly less likely to require further anticonvulsants to control continuing seizures, 8/80 (10%) versus 21/80 (26%), RR 0.58 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.79).

Authors' Conclusions

The conclusions of this update have changed to suggest that intravenous lorazepam is at least as effective as intravenous diazepam and is associated with fewer adverse events in the treatment of acute tonic-clonic convulsions. Where intravenous access is unavailable there is evidence from one trial that buccal midazolam is the treatment of choice.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^86d93270]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Due to inherent methodological difficulties, considerable uncertainties exist in the evidence, and research findings should be interpreted with caution.

Recommendations for catatonia in the perinatal period

If catatonia is severe and the woman suffers from a mental illness, the psychiatric and obstetric team should make a joint decision as to which inpatient setting is most appropriate for treatment. Contact between the mother and baby should be encouraged as much as is possible and appropriate. Psychiatric care should be provided by a psychiatrist experienced in the management of perinatal mental illness. (S)
If catatonia is severe and presents high risks to the physical health of the mother and child, and treatment of the underlying condition has been ineffective or would lead to an unacceptable delay, specific treatment for catatonia should be considered. (S)
The risks of any specific treatment should be carefully weighed against the risks of other treatments or no treatments. (S)

Recommendations for catatonia during pregnancy

Screening and selection of patients for ECT should be conducted by a psychiatrist experienced in ECT, in consultation with both a psychiatrist with appropriate expertise in perinatal psychiatry and an obstetrician. (D)
If delivery is expected within a few weeks, alternative options, such as induction of labour or Caesarean section should be considered by the obstetrician, anaesthetist, paediatrician and psychiatrist. (S)
If specific treatment for catatonia is required, lorazepam at doses up to 4 mg/day should be considered initially. (S)
If lorazepam is not effective at up to 4 mg/day, and the risks to the health of the mother and/or the child are high, the use of ECT can be considered (S)

Recommendations for catatonia during breastfeeding

If treatment with lorazepam at doses higher than 4 mg/day is used, the mother should not breastfeed because of a lack of evidence of its safety. If possible and appropriate, lactation can be maintained during the period of high lorazepam dosing by expressing and discarding milk. (S)
Women can resume breastfeeding after ECT treatments. (C)

### Withdrawal from lorazepam in critically ill children [^20bf8101]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Sedatives are used in critically ill children to facilitate mechanical ventilation. Although tolerance and withdrawal are associated with use of sedatives, information about withdrawal from benzodiazepines in children is limited.

Objective

To document the occurrence of lorazepam withdrawal in critically ill children and identify predictors for the development of withdrawal.

Methods

This prospective, investigational, open-label study enrolled pediatric patients receiving a continuous infusion of lorazepam for at least 72 hours. The lorazepam dosage was tapered in a uniform fashion over 6 days by decreasing the total daily dose by 50% every other day on 3 occasions; it was then discontinued. The occurrence of withdrawal from lorazepam was determined by pediatric intensive care unit attending physicians based on clinical judgment. Patients were assessed for withdrawal twice daily beginning 48 hours after the initiation of the lorazepam taper. Assessments were continued for 72 hours after lorazepam discontinuation or until the patient experienced withdrawal, whichever came first. Patient demographic, sedative dosing, and lorazepam serum concentration data were collected to identify risk factors for withdrawal.

Results

Twenty-nine patients completed the study. They received lorazepam for a median duration of about 21 days, and withdrawal occurred in 7 patients. There were no significant differences in demographic variables, lorazepam dosage or other sedative therapy, or lorazepam serum concentrations between patients with withdrawal and those without withdrawal. No predictors of withdrawal were identified.

Conclusions

Withdrawal occurred in 24% of critically ill children receiving long-term sedation from lorazepam. Risk factors for withdrawal are unknown.

Zolpidem

described a serendipitous dramatic response to oral zolpidem 10 mg in a woman with a subcortical stroke whose catatonia was largely unresponsive to lorazepam or ECT. This was followed by other positive reports. The response is transitory, as with benzodiazepines, and is usually observed for 3–6 h, which is consistent with zolpidem's short elimination half-life of 1–4 h. Catatonia has also been reported in zolpidem withdrawal.

Several reports have been published of zolpidem's effectiveness following neurological injury due to a variety of different brain insults. It is not clear whether some of these cases following brain injury had undiagnosed catatonia. It appears that the positive effect of zolpidem in post-brain injury states occurs at a sub-sedative dose, and there is a suggestion of a differential response in patients with traumatic or anoxic brain injury.

Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine that is a selective positive modulator of the GABA-A alpha-1 subunit and this action appears to be important for its clinical efficacy. It seems selective for the gamma-2 subunit of the GABA-A receptor (alpha1-beta2-gamma2 GABA-A receptor) in animal experiments, but the implications of this in zolpidem's efficacy as a diagnostic challenge tool are not entirely clear.

The recommended dose of zolpidem is usually 10 mg orally for a diagnostic and/or therapeutic test, but 5 mg has sometimes been used in older patients. Zolpidem is available in oral formulation (and as a sublingual preparation in some countries), with no parenteral preparation available, which somewhat limits its use. A therapeutic plasma concentration of 80–150 ng/L has been suggested, with an onset of action within 10–30 min of ingestion of 10 mg zolpidem.

showed that mutism is not a good prognostic sign for lorazepam response, so it is interesting that zolpidem may differentially help improve impairment of verbal fluency in patients with catatonia.

### Mechanical ventilation with lower tidal volumes does not influence the prescription of opioids or sedatives [^567f4a37]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Mechanical ventilation guideline

Our local MV guideline has previously been described. In short, before the intervention the guideline stated that pressure controlled or pressure support MV should be used in all patients. The guideline advised use of V T between 6 and 8 ml/kg PBW. After the intervention, the guideline explicitly advised that LP MV be used with lower V T (6 ml/kg PBW). Of note, although it was mentioned in the guideline that a RR above 20 breaths/min was considered uncomfortable for patients before the intervention, after the intervention no statements were given regarding RR.

In our ICU, the pressure level with pressure controlled or pressure support was adjusted to achieve the target V T. Because it was unit policy that both nurses and physicians were able to adjust ventilatory settings on a hourly basis, 24 hours per day, V T settings were subject to frequent adjustment and refinement.

Sedation guideline

In our institution, standard intravenous sedation consists of the combined infusion of morphine and midazolam with 50 mL syringes pre-filled with 50 mg midazolam plus 50 mg morphine in sterile saline or glucose. Propofol can be used in addition, when high dosages of morphine and midazolam are needed, or solely, when frequent neurological evaluation is warranted. Morphine can also be used separately to control pain when there is no further need for sedation. The goals of sedation are to reduce agitation, stress and fear; to reduce oxygen consumption (heart rate, blood pressure and minute volume are measured continuously); and to reduce physical resistance to and fear of medical examination and daily care.

According to the guideline (Figure 1), nurses and physicians determine the level of sedation required each day. Every 2 hours, the adequacy of sedation in each patient is carefully evaluated using a Sedation Intensive Care (SEDIC) score, and the infusion of sedatives is adjusted accordingly. The SEDIC score consists of five levels of stimuli (from normal speech to nail bed pressure) and five levels of responsiveness (from normal contact to no contact). Sedation levels are defined by the sum of stimulus and response. When a SEDIC score above 8 is reached, infusion of sedation is reduced. In addition, patients weaned from midazolam receive low-dose oral benzodiazepines (lorazepam and temazepam). Haloperidol is given only to agitated or delirious patients.

### Altered pharmacokinetics in prolonged infusions of sedatives and analgesics among adult critically ill patients: a systematic review [^78974d8c]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of many drugs are altered as a consequence of the pathophysiological changes associated with critical illness. The critically ill population presents challenges when titrating infusions of sedatives and analgesics to maintain optimal sedation and pain levels. This systematic review examined the PK data in critically ill adult patients with prolonged infusions (> 24 hours) of commonly used sedatives and analgesics to highlight possible altered PK parameters compared with noncritically ill patients.

Methods

A literature search of PK studies was performed by using MEDLINE (1946-December 2017) and EMBASE (1910-December 2017); we identified further studies by citation tracking (Web of Science) and checked references of retrieved studies and review articles. All studies were included that were published in English, Chinese, or German; conducted in critically ill adult patients receiving lorazepam, midazolam, propofol, dexmedetomidine, sufentanil, alfentanil, remifentanil, morphine, or fentanyl infusion for ≥ 24 hours; and reported PK parameters. When appropriate, we conducted a meta-analysis on volume of distribution at steady state (V dss) (liters), clearance (Cl) (liters per hour), and elimination t 1/2 (hours) by using a DerSimonian-Laird random effects model to estimate the summary mean and 95% CIs. Results were compared with commonly reported PK ranges in 70-kg noncritically ill patients.

Findings

Thirty-three randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies were identified involving 1803 adult critically ill patients with 35 drug treatment arms: fifteen midazolam (n = 906) studies, three dexmedetomidine (n = 561), nine propofol (n = 165), four lorazepam (n = 86), one morphine (n = 20), two remifentanil (n = 55), and one sufentanil (n = 10). Each study showed large variations in V dss, Cl, and elimination t 1/2 within and between individual participants. High clinical and methodical heterogeneity between the dexmedetomidine studies prevented the direct comparison of PK parameters between critically ill and noncritically ill patients. Use of midazolam, propofol, and lorazepam in critically ill patients was associated with at least a 2- to 4-fold increase in Vd ss compared with noncritically ill patients; Cl decreased ∼2-fold for midazolam and 10-fold for morphine. Critically ill patients receiving prolonged infusions of midazolam, propofol, remifentanil, and sufentanil had at least 2-fold longer elimination or terminal t 1/2 than noncritically ill patients.

Implications

These findings show a marked difference in many PK parameters from those reported for noncritically ill patients. Initiatives to improve the delivery of prolonged sedatives and analgesic infusions should be informed by PK parameters (Vd ss, context-sensitive t 1/2, and elimination t 1/2) and data derived from critically ill patients.

2.1 Dosage Information

The recommended dosage for monotherapy and adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older and for adjunctive therapy for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients 4 years of age and older is included in Table 1. In pediatric patients, the recommended dosing regimen is dependent upon body weight. Dosage should be increased based on clinical response and tolerability, no more frequently than once per week. Titration increments should not exceed those shown in Table 1.

In adjunctive clinical trials in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, a dosage higher than 200 mg twice daily (400 mg per day) was not more effective and was associated with a substantially higher rate of adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

VIMPAT Injection Dosage

VIMPAT injection may be used when oral administration is temporarily not feasible [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. VIMPAT injection can be administered intravenously to adult and pediatric patients weighing 6 kg or more with the same dosing regimens described for oral dosing. For pediatric patients weighing less than 6 kg, VIMPAT injection may be initiated with a dose of 0.66 mg/kg three times daily (see Table 1).

The clinical study experience of intravenous VIMPAT is limited to 5 days of consecutive treatment.

2.2 Alternate Initial Dosage Information to Achieve the Maintenance Dosage in a Shorter Timeframe

For monotherapy and adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older and for adjunctive therapy for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients 4 years of age and older, an alternate initial dosing regimen for week 1 (e.g., including a loading dose and/or a higher initial dosage) may be administered in patients for whom achieving the recommended maintenance dosage in a shorter timeframe is clinically indicated (see Table 2). The alternate initial dosage regimen should be continued for one week. VIMPAT may then be titrated based on clinical response and tolerability, no more frequently than once per week, if needed. The loading dose should be administered with medical supervision because of the possibility of increased incidence of adverse reactions, including central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Titration increments should not exceed those shown in Table 2.

### Management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults: a systematic review of current randomised evidence [^9882f46f]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The antiepileptic drug levetiracetam in combination with the benzodiazepine clonazepam appears to be safe but does not improve the rate of seizure cessation compared with clonazepam alone.

Overall, our findings are consistent with current clinical recommendations, which reflect the consensus of using benzodiazepines as the first-line treatment of convulsive status epilepticus. It is worth noting, however, that despite the beneficial effects of benzodiazepines in the pre-hospital setting, a considerable proportion of participants who receive active treatment are still experiencing seizures on arrival at the hospital emergency department (from 16 to 67% of participants across trials).

Adverse events in terms of respiratory depression and mortality were generally low across trials with no statistically significant differences between treatment arms of individual trials.

A number of uncertainties have arisen from our findings. Buccal midazolam and rectal diazepam are currently recommended by NICE as first-line, pre-hospital treatment for people with prolonged or repeated seizures in the community as they can be administered immediately by trained carers in those at risk, without the need to wait for the paramedics to arrive. In the child population, buccal and intranasal midazolam have been reported to have similar efficacy for the early treatment of convulsive status epilepticus and the use of midazolam by non-IV route has been proposed as a favourable alternative to diazepam. We did not identify any trial in the literature assessing the use of buccal midazolam, rectal diazepam, or indeed intranasal midazolam, in the adult population. Head-to-head clinical trials comparing different benzodiazepines or different routes of administration would, therefore, be useful to inform clinical practice. In addition, it is currently unclear whether other doses of benzodiazepines than those used in the published trials would be effective and safe and future trials should consider addressing the question of optimal dosage of benzodiazepine use. Moreover, the appropriate level of training that paramedics should undertake to recognise and treat people with convulsive status epilepticus in the community has yet to be elucidated.

Further research is also needed to establish the cost-effectiveness of first-line treatments of convulsive status epilepticus. Future economic evaluations should aim at capturing the full cost of managing the convulsive epileptic episode to the time of discharge from the hospital.

### Intramuscular lorazepam for status epilepticus in children with complex medical and physical disabilities [^f998d9d0]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A protocol was developed to achieve status epilepticus (SE) resolution: step 1, intramuscular (IM) lorazepam; step 2, repeat IM lorazepam; step 3, rectal diazepam.

Objective

The primary objective was to identify the number of patients with SE resolution after step 1. Secondary objectives included categorization of mean number of IM doses per episode and patient factors associated with SE resolution.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of patients < 21 years old with complex medical and physical disabilities admitted over 5 years. For analysis, IM dosing was categorized as high dose (> 0.05 mg/kg/dose) and low dose (≤ 0.05 mg/kg/dose). A generalized linear mixed-model regression was used to assess the relationship with SE resolution at step 1 and patient characteristics.

Results

A total of 44 patients were included (n = 162 episodes). SE resolution was noted in 68.5% of episodes after step 1. Models were stratified by gender to present odds of SE resolution at step 1 versus step 2/3. For women, no covariate was significant. For men, the odds of SE resolution at step 1 were 14.9 times higher in those receiving 2 versus 4 maintenance antiepileptics, adjusting for covariates. Additionally, odds of resolution at step 1 was 3.1 times higher for high-dose versus low-dose lorazepam in males, adjusting for covariates, but was not statistically significant.

Conclusions

SE resolution was noted in 68.5% after step 1. Unadjusted, females had a higher odds of SE resolution at step 1 than males. In males, high-dose lorazepam had higher odds of SE resolution at step 1 than low-dose lorazepam, though not significantly different.

It needs to be effective and well-timed for day cases and inpatients to be discharged safely and efficiently, and remain complication-free during and after the procedure. In line with Trust guidelines, patients undergoing TOE are administered an initial dose of intravenous (IV) sedation with midazolam, followed by titration if necessary in small steps up to the maximum recommended dose. A minority of cases experience side-effects (e.g. weakness, fatigue, drowsiness) for the rest of the day, which should resolve thereafter. However, doses exceeding Trust guidelines are being administered, posing unnecessary risks for under 18 and over 60 year-olds in particular.

### Lorazepam (Loreev xr) [^5c5c034e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

No pharmacokinetic studies were conducted with LOREEV XR in patients with hepatic impairment.

Patients with Renal Impairment

No pharmacokinetic studies were conducted with LOREEV XR in patients with renal impairment. Lorazepam is poorly dialyzable. Lorazepam glucuronide, the inactive metabolite, may be highly dialyzable.

Drug Interaction Studies

Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate, an inhibitor of UGT, results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Drug Interactions (7)].

Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid, an inhibitor of UGT, may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Drug Interactions (7)].

Alcohol: An in vitro study showed significant increases of lorazepam release from LOREEV XR capsules at 2 hours with approximately 91–95% and 37–42% of the drug release in the presence of 40% and 20% alcohol, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Effects of 5% and 10% alcohol on drug release were not significant at 2 hours. There is no in vivo study conducted for the effect of alcohol on drug exposure.

### A phase I clinical trial of continual alternating etoposide and topotecan in refractory solid tumours [^7ea8c1f1]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Treatment plan

The treatment schema is illustrated in Figure 1. Patients had a history, physical examination, complete blood count and serum chemistries (including liver function tests, Mg 2+ and creatinine) performed before each week of therapy, and complete blood count with differential was performed twice each week. These assessments were repeated at 1 month after the last course of treatment and on apparent progression. Documentation of all measurable disease by examination and any appropriate imaging studies (e.g. plain radiograph, computerised tomography and nuclear medicine scan) and EKG were performed before therapy, at week 7 and 13.

On weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11, etoposide was administered orally per allocated dose level (DL) as 10 doses in 5 days with b.i.d. dosing using the i.v. preparation in sterile prefilled syringes. The i.v. preparation of etoposide was used instead of the 50 mg softgel capsules (VePesid®), to allow the necessary dose increments required for the study. Patients were instructed to squirt the contents of a syringe into orange juice and drink it, and store the etoposide at room temperature. On weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, topotecan was administered by 96-h i.v. infusion as per allocated DL. The 96-h i.v. infusion was chosen to allow ambulatory administration of chemotherapy rather than attending for the standard D1–5 30-min infusions of chemotherapy. Growth factors were not allowed to maintain dose intensity. Etoposide (VePesid™; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ, USA) and topotecan (Hycamptin™; Smith Kline Beecham, King of Prussia, PA, USA) were prepared from commercially available supplies, formulated and administered per institutional guidelines. Antiemetic therapy could include prn lorazepam 0.5–2.0 mg i.v. and/or prochlorperazine 10 mg p.o. or perphenazine 4 mg p.o. as per institutional standards. The administration of glucocorticoids or 5HT 3 antagonists as antiemetics was permitted only after the failure of other antiemetic agents. All patients were treated with warfarin 1 mg p.o. as prophylaxis against line-related thrombosis unless fully anticoagulated for another indication.

### First human study of the investigational sedative and anesthetic drug AZD3043: a dose-escalation trial to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of a 30-minute infusion in healthy male volunteers [^45cd58dd]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

AZD3043 is a positive allosteric modulator of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor that is rapidly metabolized to an inactive metabolite by esterases present in blood and liver. Preclinical results suggest that AZD3043 has the potential as a short-acting IV sedative/anesthetic drug with rapid and predictable recovery characteristics and a favorable safety and tolerability profile.

Methods

Our primary objective in this phase 1, single-center, open-label study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AZD3043 after IV infusion and to estimate the maximal tolerated dose. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of AZD3043 pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy. Sequential ascending-dose cohorts of 5 or 6 healthy male volunteers aged 18 to 45 years received a single 30-minute IV infusion of AZD3043. Assessments included adverse events, vital signs, blood gases, laboratory values, clinical signs of sedation/anesthesia, and bispectral index.

Results

Fifty-three subjects received AZD3043 in infusion rate cohorts of 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 27, 36, 54, and 81 mg/kg/h. There were no discontinuations, and dose escalation was stopped on reaching the predefined exposure limit. Adverse events occurring in > 1 subject were headache (n = 4), erythema (n = 3), chest discomfort (n = 2), nausea (n = 2), and dyspnea (n = 2). The frequency and character of adverse events appeared unrelated to dose. There were no spontaneous reports of pain on injection and no clinically relevant changes in respiratory rate or arterial blood pressure. However, heart rate increased dose-dependently at infusion rates > 18 mg/kg/h. Occurrence of sedation/anesthesia corresponded with dose; the lowest applied infusion rate to induce anesthesia according to clinical signs of sedation/anesthesia at predefined time points was 12 mg/kg/h (1 of 6 subjects anesthetized), and all subjects in the 3 highest dose groups were anesthetized. The onset of anesthesia ranged from 4 minutes in the highest infusion rate group to 29 minutes in the 12-mg/kg/h infusion rate group. Return of response to oral command occurred at 3 minutes after the end of infusion in the single subject who was anesthetized in the 12-mg/kg/h group and median 25 minutes in the 81-mg/kg/h group. Involuntary movements ranging from minor twitches to extensive movements were accompanied by increased muscle tone.

Conclusions

AZD3043 was well tolerated in this first human study and seems to exhibit rapid onset and recovery, indicating potential use as a short-acting drug for anesthesia and sedation.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^4a37d7c8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

ASAM/AAAP stimulant use disorder guideline — sedation and adjunctive agents: Phenobarbital (PBO) may be used with incremental 130–260 mg parenteral/IV/PO and a loading strategy (eg, 5–10 mg/kg) for BZD shortages or contraindications, for patients not responding to escalating doses of BZDs, and for severe sympathomimetic intoxication; other considerations include high oral bioavailability with PO dosing similar to parenteral dosing and onset of effects slower than IV but still fairly quick compared to other PO medications. Propofol dosing is 10–50 μg/kg/min based on symptoms and patient parameters, indicated for critically ill patients in the ICU and for severe sympathomimetic intoxication not responding to other agents; patients can be administered BZDs, PBO, and/or propofol concomitantly, and intubation is almost always required for propofol administration.

TABLE 1
Baseline characteristics of the included observational studies.

As depicted in Table 2, the total sample across observational studies included a total of 872 older adults receiving haloperidol (n = 117), droperidol (n = 129), lorazepam (n = 350), midazolam (n = 68), diazepam (n = 11), alprazolam (n = 12), olanzapine (n = 101), quetiapine (n = 56), ziprasidone (n = 17), risperidone (n = 6), loxapine (n = 1), ketamine (n = 1), and co‐administration of a combination of medications (n = 3). Diazepam, alprazolam, risperidone, loxapine, ketamine, and co‐administration of a combination of medications were excluded from the pooled analysis. The remaining study cohort included 838 patients.

TABLE 2
Associations of initial medication with adverse events, need for redosing, and time to sedation.

In the randomized clinical trial by Lin et al. there was a total sample of six older adults, with five subjects receiving co‐administration of haloperidol‐lorazepam and one receiving ketamine. No pooled analyses of the randomized clinical trial data were pursued due to the paucity of trial data.

3.2 Synthesis of Results

Any adverse events (respiratory or other) were observed in a total of 16.8% (141/838) patients. Any adverse events by drug were observed in 53% of patients receiving midazolam (36/68), 16% lorazepam (55/350), 16% haloperidol (19/118), 15% olanzapine (15/101), 10% droperidol (13/129), 5% quetiapine (3/56), and 0% ziprasidone (0/17). Adverse respiratory events varied widely across individual drugs, from 0% for ziprasidone (0/17) to 22% for midazolam (15/68). Among adverse respiratory events, there were 14 observed intubations among 1 patient given haloperidol, 1 olanzapine, 5 lorazepam, and 7 midazolam. Similarly, other adverse events varied widely across drugs, from 0% for ziprasidone (0/17) to 31% for midazolam (21/68). Of note, neither tachydysrhythmias, including Torsades des Pointes, nor episodes of cardiac arrest were observed.

### Effects of lornoxicam on the physiology of severe sepsis [^95bda545]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of intravenous lornoxicam on haemodynamic and biochemical parameters, serum cytokine levels and patient outcomes in severe sepsis.

Methods

A total of 40 patients with severe sepsis were included, and were randomly assigned (20 per group) to receive either lornoxicam (8 mg administered intravenously every 12 hours for six doses) or placebo. For both groups the following were recorded: haemodynamic parameters (heart rate, mean arterial pressure), nasopharyngeal body temperature, arterial blood gas changes (pH, partial oxygen tension, partial carbon dioxide tension), plasma cytokine levels (IL-1β, IL-2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8, tumour necrosis factor-α), biochemical parameters (lactate, leucocytes, trombocytes, creatinine, total bilirubin, serum glutamate oxalate transaminase), length of stay in the intensive care unit, duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality. All measurements were obtained at baseline (before the start of the study) and at 24, 48 and 72 hours from the start of lornoxicam/placebo administration.

Results

No significant differences were found between the intravenous lornoxicam and placebo groups in major cytokines, duration of ventilation and length of intensive care unit stay, and inspired fractional oxygen/arterial oxygen tension ratio (P > 0.05).

Conclusion

In these patients with severe sepsis, we found intravenous lornoxicam to exert no effect on haemodynamic and biochemical parameters, cytokine levels, or patient outcomes. Because of the small number of patients included in the study and the short period of observation, these findings require confirmation by larger clinical trials of intravenous lornoxicam, administered in a dose titrated manner.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^642d643d]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.2.7. Dose-response curves and dosage

Recommendations:

1.2.7.1. Dose-response curves should be defined clearly in early (phase I and II) randomized, clinical trials of new chemical entities for the acute treatment of migraine.

1.2.7.2. Efficacy- and tolerability-based minimum effective and optimal doses should be determined.

1.2.7.3. Effective doses of a well-established or standard drug should be utilized in comparative clinical trials, unless clinically inappropriate, in which case a clear justification for the particular dose selection should be given.

Comments:

New acute treatments for migraine should be tested against a standard comparator with established dose-response curves and optimal efficacy- and tolerability-based doses, such as rizatriptan, sumatriptan, or zolmitriptan; the CGRP receptor antagonists (i.e.g.epants) ubrogepant and rimegepant; or the 5-HT 1F receptor agonist lasmiditan.

The accepted optimal therapeutic dose of the comparator should be used.

1.2.8. Route of administration

Recommendations:

1.2.8.1. When pre-clinical and PK data demonstrate an acceptable PK profile in humans (i.e.g.ood oral bioavailability and rapid oral absorption), oral administration of the test treatment is recommended because the oral route is preferred by most people with migraine.

1.2.8.2. Alternative routes of administration, including parenteral, inhalational, buccal, intranasal, and rectal, can be utilized as circumstances dictate (e.g. severe nausea, status migrainosus).

Comments:

Gastric absorption of orally-administered medications can be delayed during migraine attacks. In early phase I or II trials, therefore, it is advisable to establish the intra- and interictal PK profile of oral treatments utilizing a crossover design in order to gauge dose selection in later efficacy trials.

### A comparison of injectable diazepam and lorazepam in the goal-directed management of severe alcohol withdrawal [^582db3b7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Benzodiazepines are the gold standard for treatment of alcohol withdrawal, yet the selection of a preferred benzodiazepine is limited due to a lack of comparative studies.

Objectives

The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of injectable lorazepam (LZP) and diazepam (DZP) in the treatment of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS).

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit with a primary diagnosis of AWS. Subjects who received at least 12 LZP equivalent units (LEU) of injectable DZP or LZP within 24 hours of initiation of the severe AWS protocol were included. The primary outcome was time with Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised (CIWA-Ar) scores at goal over the first 24 hours of treatment.

Results

A total of 191 patients were included (DZP n = 89, LZP n = 102). Time with CIWA-Ar scores at goal during the first 24 hours was similar between groups (DZP 12 hours [interquartile range, IQR, = 9–15] vs LZP 14 hours [IQR = 10–17]), P = 0.06). At 24 hours, LEU requirement was similar (DZP 40 [IQR = 22–78] vs LZP 32 [IQR = 18–56], P = 0.05). Drug cost at 24 hours was higher in the DZP group ($204.6 [IQR = 112.53–398.97] vs $8 [IQR = 4.5–14], P < 0.01).

Conclusion and Relevance

DZP or LZP are equally efficacious for the treatment of severe AWS. LZP may be preferred due to cost but both medications can be used interchangeably based on availability.

### Risperidone liquid concentrate and oral lorazepam versus intramuscular haloperidol and intramuscular lorazepam for treatment of psychotic agitation [^4c572268]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Although agitation associated with psychosis is a common presentation in the psychiatric emergency service, there is no consensus concerning the best treatment. Standard treatment often consists of intramuscular (i.m.) injection of high-potency neuroleptics, sometimes combined with benzodiazepines. The objective of this study was to determine the relative efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral risperidone versus intramuscular haloperidol, both in combination with lorazepam, for the emergency treatment of psychotic agitation in patients who are able to accept oral medications.

Method

A convenience sample of psychotic patients admitted to a large psychiatric emergency service who required emergency medication for the control of agitation and/or violence was offered risperidone (2 mg liquid concentrate) and oral lorazepam (2 mg) as an alternative to standard care at the institution, haloperidol (5 mg i.m.) and lorazepam (2 mg i.m.). Subjects who refused the oral medications were given the intramuscular treatment as a component of routine care.

Results

Thirty patients were enrolled in each treatment group. Although men were significantly more likely to choose oral medication (chi2 = 5.165, p < .023), other demographic characteristics did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment groups. Both groups showed similar improvement in agitation as measured by 5 agitation subscales of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale, and time to sedation. No patients receiving risperidone demonstrated any side effects or adverse events, while 1 patient receiving intramuscular treatment with haloperidol developed acute dystonia. One subject receiving risperidone required subsequent treatment with haloperidol for ongoing agitation.

Conclusion

Oral treatment with risperidone and lorazepam appears to be a tolerable and comparable alternative to intramuscular haloperidol and lorazepam for short-term treatment of agitated psychosis in patients who accept oral medications.
