## Question

Pjp steroid prophylaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis in the context of glucocorticoid therapy, including when to start, how to dose, when to stop, and how to individualize decisions across populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why non-HIV patients on steroids are at risk. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and guideline thresholds for starting prophylaxis. Next, I will review dosing regimens and alternatives, followed by when to discontinue prophylaxis. After that, I need to consider special populations and risk modifiers. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and highlight controversies and knowledge gaps that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk signal. PJP in non-HIV patients is often more fulminant and carries higher mortality than in HIV, and corticosteroids are a major independent risk factor, with many cases occurring during steroid taper or after recent steroid exposure, which underscores the need for proactive prophylaxis in the right patients [^ee03d569] [^7fcdee40] [^b2d2dcd8].

> I need to check the evidence hierarchy and guideline convergence. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on a pragmatic threshold of prednisone ≥ 20 mg daily for at least 4 weeks as an indication to consider prophylaxis, including ASCO/IDSA oncology guidance, ACR SLE guidance, and EULAR recommendations for autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases, with supportive data from observational cohorts and systematic reviews [^b2d2dcd8] [^6bbb3d07] [^notfound] [^62c19df2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single fixed threshold. Some guidance uses a range of 15–30 mg for 2–4 weeks, particularly in autoimmune disease, and risk is clearly modified by concomitant immunosuppressants, lymphopenia, and disease-specific factors, so I should frame this as a risk-stratified decision rather than a rigid rule [^d5b853db] [^ee03d569] [^42aa997c].

> Next, I should review dosing and alternatives. TMP-SMX is first-line: one double-strength tablet daily or three times weekly, with single-strength daily as an alternative, adjusting for renal function. If TMP-SMX is not tolerated, atovaquone 1,500 mg daily, dapsone 100 mg daily, or aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg monthly are acceptable substitutes, and some data suggest reduced-frequency TMP-SMX regimens can be effective with fewer adverse effects, though evidence quality varies [^a93faad2] [^62c19df2] [^fe2931a3].

> I will now examine when to stop prophylaxis, because this is where practice often lacks clarity. Let me verify the best available signal: a large case-control study in rheumatic diseases found that discontinuing TMP-SMX while on more than 12.5 mg prednisone equivalent/day markedly increased PJP risk, whereas tapering to ≤ 12.5 mg before stopping prophylaxis was associated with much lower risk. This supports using 12.5 mg as a practical discontinuation threshold pending further validation [^notfound] [^89ee2cd3] [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the patient has ongoing immunosuppression beyond steroids? I should confirm that many guidelines advise continuing prophylaxis until the steroid dose is tapered and other immunosuppressants are minimized, and in some contexts (e.g., rituximab with high-dose steroids), the net benefit of prophylaxis is clearest, reinforcing a cautious approach to early discontinuation [^d5b853db] [^e4cef9a3] [^74f5d8c0].

> Let me consider special populations and modifiers. In oncology and hematologic malignancy, ASCO/IDSA endorse prophylaxis at ≥ 20 mg prednisone for ≥ 4 weeks, and rituximab-based regimens or purine analogs carry elevated risk where prophylaxis is recommended. In IBD, triple immunosuppression with ≥ 20 mg prednisone supports prophylaxis. In kidney disease, KDIGO recommends PJP prophylaxis with high-dose corticosteroids, often alongside other immunosuppressants. In children, routine prophylaxis for chronic glucocorticoids is not universally recommended given low incidence and nontrivial adverse effects, so decisions should be individualized [^b2d2dcd8] [^1d7bd5cb] [^c1bb29fb] [^0a6db6e8].

> I should double-check the role of lymphopenia and other biomarkers. Lymphopenia, particularly CD4+ counts below 200–500 cells/µL depending on context, is repeatedly associated with increased PJP risk in non-HIV patients, but unlike HIV, there is no universally accepted CD4-based stopping rule; thus, low lymphocyte counts should lower the threshold to start and prolong prophylaxis rather than dictate a hard stop [^ee03d569] [^b2d2dcd8] [^fb8237ef].

> Next, I should review the balance of benefits and harms to guide shared decision-making. TMP-SMX is highly effective at preventing PJP, with NNTs around 19–32 in higher-risk cohorts, but adverse effects occur in roughly 15–20% and serious reactions in about 3%, necessitating counseling and monitoring; in lower-risk steroid doses, the NNT may exceed the NNH, so individualized risk–benefit discussions are essential [^42aa997c] [^f66d8917].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. Start TMP-SMX prophylaxis when prednisone is ≥ 20 mg daily for at least 4 weeks, consider starting at 15–20 mg if additional risk factors are present (e.g., rituximab, cyclophosphamide, lymphopenia, ILD), and continue until the steroid dose is tapered to ≤ 12.5 mg daily while also reassessing other immunosuppression. If TMP-SMX is contraindicated, use atovaquone, dapsone, or inhaled pentamidine, and revisit the need for prophylaxis at each immunosuppression change [^b2d2dcd8] [^d5b853db] [^a40ee1cd] [^a93faad2].

> Hold on, I should verify controversies and gaps so I don't overstate certainty. Evidence is largely observational; there are no randomized trials of prophylaxis thresholds in non-HIV patients, and the 12.5 mg discontinuation threshold, while biologically plausible and supported by robust observational data, still needs prospective validation. Additionally, the incremental risk from modern biologics is not fully quantified, and some malignancy contexts (e.g., brentuximab vedotin) suggest elevated PJP risk above traditional thresholds, prompting some experts to advocate broader prophylaxis in those settings [^6f2cb9a4] [^e12a2769].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address treatment-related corticosteroids briefly to avoid confusion. Adjunctive corticosteroids are indicated for moderate-to-severe PJP in HIV and are sometimes used in non-HIV PJP, but recent ICU data associate adjunctive steroids with faster death in non-HIV patients, so if considered, they should be used cautiously and ideally within 72 hours of diagnosis in severe cases, recognizing the evidence base is weaker outside HIV [^5ee4f4c8] [^eefda3e6] [^0f2af997].

---

PJP prophylaxis is indicated for patients on **≥ 20 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) for ≥ 4 weeks** [^b2d2dcd8] [^83e801e6], with stronger support when combined with other immunosuppressants or in high-risk diseases (e.g. SLE, vasculitis, IBD) [^d5b853db] [^1d7bd5cb]. TMP-SMX is **first-line** [^a93faad2]; atovaquone, dapsone, or aerosolized pentamidine are alternatives if TMP-SMX is not tolerated [^fe2931a3]. Prophylaxis should continue until steroids are tapered below 15–20 mg/day and other immunosuppression is minimized, typically ≥ 3 months after the last high-dose steroid exposure [^a40ee1cd] [^f57b2dcb]. The risk of PJP rises with higher steroid doses, longer duration, lymphopenia, and concomitant immunosuppressants; mortality is higher in non-HIV patients, so prophylaxis is justified when risk exceeds ~3.5% [^ee03d569] [^b2d2dcd8].

## Indications for PJP prophylaxis in steroid-treated patients

Current guidelines and studies support PJP prophylaxis in patients receiving **glucocorticoids** based on dose, duration, and concurrent immunosuppression:

- **Dose and duration**: Prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day (or equivalent) for ≥ 4 weeks is a widely accepted threshold for initiating prophylaxis [^b2d2dcd8] [^83e801e6].

- **Combination therapy**: Higher risk with additional immunosuppressants (e.g. rituximab, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, azathioprine) warrants prophylaxis even at lower steroid doses [^d5b853db] [^e4cef9a3].

- **Disease-specific risk**: Certain autoimmune diseases (e.g. SLE, vasculitis, IBD) carry higher PJP risk, supporting prophylaxis at steroid doses ≥ 15–20 mg/day for 2–4 weeks [^d5b853db] [^1d7bd5cb].

---

## Recommended prophylactic regimens

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is **first-line** [^a93faad2]; alternatives are used for intolerance:

| **Regimen** | **Dose** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| TMP-SMX | 1 double-strength tablet (160 mg TMP/800 mg SMX) | Daily |
| TMP-SMX | 1 double-strength tablet | Three times weekly |
| Atovaquone | 1,500 mg | Daily |
| Dapsone | 100 mg | Daily |
| Aerosolized pentamidine | 300 mg | Monthly |

---

## Duration of prophylaxis

Prophylaxis should continue until the steroid dose is tapered below 15–20 mg/day and other immunosuppression is minimized, typically for **≥ 3 months** after the last high-dose steroid exposure. In autoimmune diseases, many cases occur during taper or after stopping prophylaxis, so **individualized risk assessment** is essential [^a40ee1cd] [^f57b2dcb].

---

## Risks and benefits of prophylaxis

Benefits include a **significant reduction in PJP incidence and mortality** in high-risk patients [^74f5d8c0] [^e4cef9a3]. Risks include adverse effects such as rash, myelosuppression, and rare severe hypersensitivity; overall, TMP-SMX is well tolerated, and the NNT to prevent one PJP case is ~19–32 in high-risk groups [^42aa997c] [^74f5d8c0].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Prophylaxis is generally reserved for children with specific high-risk conditions (e.g. malignancy, transplant) rather than routine chronic steroid use [^0a6db6e8].

- **Renal impairment**: Adjust TMP-SMX dosing based on creatinine clearance [^fe2931a3].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess for adverse effects, adherence, and ongoing immunosuppression burden [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initiate prophylaxis**: Prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day for ≥ 4 weeks, especially with additional immunosuppressants or high-risk diseases [^b2d2dcd8] [^d5b853db].

- **First-line therapy**: TMP-SMX daily or three times weekly; use alternatives if intolerant [^a93faad2] [^fe2931a3].

- **Duration**: Continue until steroids are tapered below 15–20 mg/day and other immunosuppression is minimized, typically ≥ 3 months [^a40ee1cd] [^f57b2dcb].

- **Individualize**: Base decisions on disease, lymphocyte count, and patient-specific factors [^ee03d569] [^42aa997c].

---

PJP prophylaxis is indicated for patients on **≥ 20 mg/day prednisone for ≥ 4 weeks**, with stronger support when combined with other immunosuppressants or in high-risk diseases. TMP-SMX is **first-line**, and prophylaxis should continue until steroids are tapered and immunosuppression is minimized.

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^17fbd297]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the established benefits of primary PJP prophylaxis in patients with AIID, the optimal prophylaxis schedule remains uncertain. One of the most important uncertainties is the timing of discontinuation of PJP prophylaxis. TMP‐SMX carries some risk of adverse events (AEs), some of which may be severe. Therefore, minimizing exposure to TMP‐SMX while preserving its optimal prophylactic efficacy is a logical next step in building evidence for the universal recommendation for primary PJP prophylaxis. In patients with HIV, the decision to discontinue primary PJP prophylaxis is guided by CD4 counts and response to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Guidelines recommend the cessation of prophylaxis when CD4 counts have risen to more than 200 cells/mm³ and are maintained for at least three months in response to ART. However, the correlation between CD4 counts and PJP risk is less clear in patients without HIV, including those with AIID, which renders CD4 counts a less reliable surrogate measure to direct prophylaxis. Although previous studies have suggested that PJP mainly occurs when a patient receives > 15 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent, it is uncertain whether this could be a relevant indication to consider the cessation of PJP prophylaxis. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors associated with PJP infection despite prophylaxis and to offer insights into establishing an ideal primary prophylaxis regimen for patients with AIID.

### Pneumocystis jiroveci: still troublesome to diagnose and treat [^878727bb]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) poses an important risk in immunodeficient patients. Several aspects of the pathogenesis and management of PJP remain poorly understood. The aim of this review is to describe new trends and challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of PJP focused on non-HIV patients compared with patients living with HIV.

Recent Findings

The immune response to Pneumocystis jiroveci infection varies among different host types and modifies clinical and radiological presentation. The performance of microbiological diagnostic tests depends on pretest probability according to baseline disease, clinical presentation, and radiological pattern. Real-time qualitative and quantitative PCR tests have been proposed as the optimal method for PJP diagnosis, but it is essential to interpret PCR results within the clinical context. Therapy of PJP has not changed substantially, but new options with low-dose trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and combination treatment with old and new antifungals are being explored. The use of complementary steroid treatment is well established in patients living with HIV but is controversial in non-HIV patients. Protocols for primary and secondary PJP prophylaxis are evolving. Evidence for nosocomial acquisition and possible person-to-person transmission of infection suggests the need for formal infection control policies.

Summary

Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improving the prognosis of PJP, but several challenges remain to be addressed. Future efforts should focus on developing new diagnostic methods, treatment options and risk stratification tools to improve prevention strategies.

### Risk factors and prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases [^ee03d569]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases (AIIDs) are prone to serious infectious complications such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). In non-HIV patients, the prognosis is poorer, and diagnostic tests are of lower sensitivity. Given the low incidence of PJP in AIIDs, with the exception of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and the non-negligible side effects of chemoprophylaxis, routine prescription of primary prophylaxis is still debated. Absolute peripheral lymphopenia, high doses of corticosteroids, combination with other immunosuppressive agents, and concomitant lung disease are strong predictors for the development of PJP and thus should warrant primary prophylaxis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is considered first-line therapy and is the most extensively used drug for PJP prophylaxis. Nevertheless, it may expose patients to side effects. Effective alternative drugs such as atovaquone or aerosolized pentamidine could be used when trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is not tolerated or contraindicated. No standard guidelines are available to guide PJP prophylaxis in patients with AIIDs. This review covers the epidemiology, risk factors, and prevention of pneumocystis in the context of AIIDs.

### Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in inflammatory bowel disease: when should prophylaxis be considered? [^51b2d6cf]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has increased over the past several decades with a corresponding increase in the number of patients on combination immunosuppressive therapy including corticosteroids, anti-metabolites and biologic agents. The exact incidence of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) in IBD patients is unknown but there has been an increase in the number of reports of PJP in IBD patients on combination immunosuppressive therapy.

Methods

We evaluated the published literature describing PJP infections in IBD patients, as well as other non-HIV cohorts and identified risk factors for PJP infection in this group of patients. Prophylaxis and treatment regimens were reviewed.

Results

Corticosteroid therapy, lymphopenia (total lymphocyte count < 600 cells/mm³), and age greater than 55 years appear to be risk factors for developing pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. In addition, PJP mortality is greater in the non-HIV cohort in contrast to the HIV population. No evidence-based guidelines for primary PJP prophylaxis exist to direct practice for gastroenterology providers.

Conclusions

Better surveillance and reporting of opportunistic infections including PJP are needed to elucidate risk factors for acquisition of infection. Gastroenterology providers should continue to evaluate the need for PJP prophylaxis on a case-by-case basis to recognize patients who may benefit from primary PJP prophylaxis. In particular, older patients on corticosteroids, multiple immunosuppressive agents, and patients with lymphopenia should be considered for prophylaxis.

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^a40ee1cd]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although previous studies show that primary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is effective in patients with rheumatic diseases receiving immunosuppressive treatment, there is limited evidence regarding the optimal timing for prophylaxis withdrawal. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for PJP despite prophylaxis and provide evidence for an optimal prophylaxis schedule.

Methods

This case‐control study included 1,294 prophylactic episodes in 1,148 patients with rheumatic disease who received immunosuppressants and prophylactic trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole (TMP‐SMX). The primary outcome was a one‐year incidence of PJP. A Cox proportional hazards model with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to evaluate clinical factors associated with outcomes.

Results

During 1,174 person‐years of observation, 10 cases of PJP were identified, with an incidence rate of 0.85 per 100 person‐years. The mean ± SD duration of TMP‐SMX prophylaxis was 181.9 ± 128.7 days. Except in one case, PJP occurred after discontinuation of TMP‐SMX, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) interval of 117.0 (86.0–161.0) days. The dose of glucocorticoids at the time of TMP‐SMX discontinuation was significantly higher in the PJP group relative to the control group (median [IQR]: 22 [20–40] vs 10 [5–15] mg). Discontinuing TMP‐SMX while on a glucocorticoid dose > 12.5 mg/day of prednisone equivalent significantly increased the risk of PJP (adjusted hazard ratio: 13.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.71–111.80). There were 63 cases of adverse events during the observation period, and 10 (15.9%) were attributed to TMP‐SMX with probable causality.

Conclusion

Tapering glucocorticoids with 12.5 mg/day of prednisone equivalent could be a reasonable timepoint to initiate the withdrawal of PJP prophylaxis in patients with rheumatic diseases.

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^dd870c3b]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is a potentially life‐threatening opportunistic infection that occurs mainly in immunocompromised patients. Although first identified during the onset of the HIV epidemic in the early 1980s, PJP infection has become more common in non–HIV‐immunocompromised patients suffering from various conditions, such as malignancies, solid organ transplants, and autoimmune or inflammatory disease (AIID). Furthermore, PJP in patients without HIV typically exhibits rapid progression with a higher mortality rate than in HIV patients.

Trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole (TMP‐SMX) is the gold standard for PJP prophylaxis, and its efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in both HIV‐infected and non–HIV‐infected immunocompromised patients. Although no RCTs have specifically addressed this issue in patients with AIID, many observational studies have shown that prophylactic TMP‐SMX treatment significantly decreases the incidence of PJP in these patients, particularly when they receive prolonged, high‐dose glucocorticoid (GC) treatment. Based on these results, despite the weak level of evidence and the variation in risk depending on specific diseases and clinical settings, a recent recommendation from EULAR states that PJP prophylaxis should be taken into consideration when patients with AIID receive daily doses of prednisone exceeding 15 to 30 mg for longer than two to four weeks.

### Glucocorticoids, concomitant immunosuppression, and PJP prophylaxis among U.S. adults [^56b08ec6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The impact of glucocorticoids, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive therapies on Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) risk remains understudied, and prophylaxis is underutilized. Among U.S. adults in TriNetX prescribed glucocorticoids for ≥ 2 weeks in TriNetX, 44.6% received > 20mg prednisone equivalents/day. Prophylaxis rates were low, with higher glucocorticoid doses associated with lower prophylaxis odds.

### Pneumocystis pneumonia in intensive care: clinical spectrum, prophylaxis patterns, antibiotic treatment delay impact, and role of corticosteroids. A French multicentre prospective cohort study [^1c99acdc]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is an opportunistic infection affecting immunocompromised patients, and its incidence has risen in recent decades. It now affects more patients not infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) than HIV patients. PJP is potentially severe and is linked to a hospital mortality of about 5–15% in patients with HIV infection. Mortality escalates significantly beyond 50% when affecting patients with cancer, haematologic malignancy, pre-existing heart or respiratory failure, or is associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or septic shock requiring admission to intensive care.

Evidence from the past 15 years indicates that patients with autoimmune rheumatic or vascular inflammatory diseases, among others, are increasingly susceptible due to immunosuppressive treatments. Within this specific population, antibiotic prophylaxis demonstrates divergent practices without a unified consensus. In immunocompromised individuals, PJP should be suspected in cases of diffuse pneumonia, with or without respiratory distress. However, studies have underscored delays in initiating treatment among a subset of these patients during the initial hospitalization, potentially impacting in-hospital survival rates.

While corticosteroid therapy for PJP with hypoxemia in HIV patients has shown efficacy, uncertainties persist regarding its benefits in non-HIV patients.

There is a paucity of studies specifically dedicated to patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with PJP, leading to imprecise estimates of hospital mortality, long-term outcomes, and required supportive care for patients with the most severe forms of PJP.

In this context, we initiated a multicentre prospective observational study to describe ICU admission conditions for PJP patients, their clinical presentation, estimate the prevalence of prophylaxis, and finally, determine prevalence of delayed antibiotic treatment and corticosteroids use, and assess their association with 6-month mortality following ICU admission.

### The risk of opportunistic infections and the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients on checkpoint inhibitors requiring steroids [^a6d81875]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) often require treatment with high-dose systemic steroids (SS) and other immunosuppressive agents (ISAs). NCCN Guidelines recommend prophylactic antibiotics for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) for patients receiving prolonged SS/ISAs. However, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the incidence of opportunistic infections (OIs) and non-OIs and the role of prophylactic antibiotics in patients on SS/ISAs for irAEs.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients treated using immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy at 5 MedStar Health hospitals from January 2011 to April 2018. OIs were defined per the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the prevention and treatment of OIs in patients with HIV. The study cohort included patients who received ≥ 20 mg daily of a prednisone equivalent for ≥ 4 weeks to manage irAEs.

Results

The study cohort identified 112 (15%) of 758 total patients treated using ICIs. Baseline characteristics included the following: median age was 64 years, 74% (n = 82) of patients were White, 89% (n = 100) had an ECOG performance status ≤ 1, 61% (n = 68) had melanoma, 19% (n = 21) had non-small cell lung cancer, 45% (n = 50) were treated using an anti-PD-(L)1 ICI, and 33% (n = 37) were treated using an anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combination. The median starting SS dose was 100 mg of a prednisone equivalent, and 25% of patients required additional ISAs, with infliximab (n = 15) and mycophenolate mofetil (n = 9) being the most common. We found that 20% (n = 22) of patients developed any infection, including 7% (n = 8) with OIs (oral candidiasis [n = 4], nondisseminated varicella zoster infection [n = 2], PJP [n = 1], and Listeria monocytogenes endophthalmitis [n = 1]) and 13% (n = 14) with non-OIs (most common: Clostridium difficile and pneumonia [n = 5 each]). PJP prophylaxis with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was given to 13% (n = 14) patients, of whom 43% (n = 6) developed OIs/non-OIs.

Conclusions

Our study highlights the fundamental issues for patients on ICI therapy who require SS/ISAs for irAEs: the degree of immunosuppression and the relative risk of OI. We noted a low incidence of OIs overall and breakthrough infections despite PJP prophylaxis. We question whether PJP prophylaxis is efficacious or necessary. Prospective trials are required to answer these questions.

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^41b98b4f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Although the effectiveness of PJP prophylaxis in patients with AIIDs is widely recognized, there is no clear consensus on the optimal regimen, particularly regarding the duration of maintenance. Although previous studies have demonstrated the excellent prophylactic efficacy of TMP‐SMX in reducing the incidence of PJP, its use carries a potential risk of various AEs. Therefore, establishing appropriate criteria for discontinuing prophylaxis could enhance patient outcomes while improving safety. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large‐scale study to investigate the potential risk factors associated with PJP despite prophylaxis, which may provide crucial evidence for establishing an optimal prophylaxis protocol.

This study showed that the one‐year incidence of PJP among patients receiving prophylactic TMP‐SMX was low, reinforcing previous reports that TMP‐SMX has high prophylactic efficacy against PJP. Furthermore, there was only one case of breakthrough PJP during TMP‐SMX prophylaxis. Given the high effectiveness of TMP‐SMX in PJP prophylaxis, further research is needed to address next steps, such as identifying specific risk groups and determining the optimal duration for maintaining prophylaxis, to ensure effective prevention.

### Pneumocystis in metastatic lung cancer, a pragmatic approach in support of prophylaxis [^f66d8917]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In patients with lung cancer, especially with brain metastasis, corticosteroids are commonly prescribed. Life expectancy is limited to a few months or years in most cases, and physicians do not prescribe chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis spp. A retrospective study showed that fewer patients with solid tumours (3.9%) received prophylaxis compared with patients with haematological malignancies (63.6%).

Lung cancer is at low risk of PJP (< 25 cases/100 000 patient-year) like other solid tumours, excluding central nervous system cancer. But for patients having solid cancer and being treated by corticosteroids, the incidence of PJP rises to 1.3%. Furthermore, PJP is usually more abrupt and fulminantamong patients with neoplastic disease, and its mortality rate is much higher, approaching 50%, and a significant risk factor of mortality with an OR = 2.66. In different studies, 55%–87% of patients with PJP had previously used corticosteroids, and 18%–31% had a solid tumour. The most important predisposing factor for developing PJP is the use of steroids, even at a low dose (equivalent to ≥ 20 mg/day prednisone for ≥ 1 month). ATS guidelines recommend prophylaxis when prednisone doses exceed 20 mg/day for longer than 1 month.

Recent guidelinesand two general reviewsrecommend prophylaxis for patients with solid cancer receiving prolonged, high-dose corticosteroid treatment (16–25 mg of prednisolone/day or ≥ 4 mg dexamethasone daily for ≥ 4 weeks) regardless of the stage of malignancy.

Concerning the toxicity of TMP–SMX, 85% of the patients do not experience any toxic effects. So, when steroids are prescribed for a patient with cancer, especially in metastatic diseases, we prioritise a pragmatic attitude: start a prophylaxis if survival exceeds 3 months.

Learning points

Corticosteroids are a major risk factor of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), adding to the risk of PJP in lung cancer.
Guidelines recommend PJP prophylaxis by trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP–SMX) when dose > 20 mg/day.
Side effects occur in 15% of cases, and discontinuation of the prophylaxis is required in 3% of patients treated.
Our pragmatic proposal: start a primary prophylaxis if survival exceeds 3 months, and eventually discuss alternatives in case of TMP–SMX intolerance.

### Discontinuing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients with a CD4 cell count [^f7440692]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence for discontinuing primary and secondary Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients with a CD4 count < 200 cells/mm³.

Data Sources

We conducted a literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and the International Aids Society Library (up to August 2015) using the following key search terms: Pneumocystis jirovecii, pneumonia, human immunodeficiency virus, primary prophylaxis, secondary prophylaxis, and discontinuation.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language studies that evaluated discontinuation of primary and/or secondary PJP prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients with CD4 count < 200 cells/mm³ were included.

Data Synthesis

Five studies were identified, which varied in design, sample size, outcomes, and duration of follow-up. Three studies examined discontinuation of primary and secondary PJP prophylaxis; 1 study evaluated discontinuing primary PJP prophylaxis; and 1 study evaluated stopping secondary PJP prophylaxis. Two out of the 5 studies pooled data for all opportunistic infections. Overall, there was a low incidence of PJP among HIV-infected patients who discontinued primary PJP prophylaxis and were well controlled on antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Conclusions

Discontinuation of primary PJP prophylaxis appears to be safe in patients on combination ART with a suppressed HIV viral load and a CD4 count > 100 cells/mm³. Additional data are needed to support the safety of discontinuing secondary PJP prophylaxis. Decisions to discontinue PJP prophylaxis in patients with a CD4 count < 200 cells/mm(3) should be done on an individual patient basis, taking into consideration clinical factors, including ongoing adherence to ART.

Impact ofdose at discontinuing‐on the incidence of

Because the GC dose at TMP‐SMX discontinuation was significantly higher in the PJP group, we further evaluated its impact on PJP occurrence. Using maximally selected rank statistics, the optimal cutoff GC dose that best distinguished the PJP from the control group was identified as 12.5 mg prednisone equivalent (P < 0.001). In fact, 90% (9 of 10) of the patients who developed PJP in the prophylaxis group were taking > 12.5 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent dosage at the time of prophylaxis withdrawal, compared with only 35.1% (n = 451) in the control group. When the entire prophylactic episodes were divided into two groups based on the GC dose at the end of prophylaxis (> 12.5 mg vs ≤ 12.5 mg of prednisone equivalent), the episodes with higher GC dose (n = 460, 35.5%) at the time of prophylaxis withdrawal showed a significantly higher risk of PJP (HR, 18.55; 95% CI, 2.35–146.42; P = 0.006) (Figure 2). The result was consistent in the multivariable Cox regression analysis in which relevant risk factors for PJP were adjusted (adjusted HR, 13.84; 95% CI, 1.71–111.80; P = 0.014) (Table 3).

Next Steps

Incidence of P. jirovecii pneumonia has increased across all groups of immunosuppressed patients known to be at risk for this infection (excluding HIV patients) and in new groups not previously known to be at risk. To determine whether current indications for prophylaxis need to be widened, enhanced surveillance should be introduced to help characterize any additional groups of patients for whom prophylaxis is not currently recommended but who might be at risk. Particular focus should be given to patients with chronic lung disease, systemic inflammatory diseases, and solid tumors and to transplant recipients who do not currently fulfill the criteria for prophylaxis. When introducing new immunosuppressive agents and regimens, consideration should be given as to whether these agents might increase the patients' risk for P. jirovecii pneumonia.

More studies involving sequencing of P. jirovecii clinical isolates identified by PCR, coupled with national surveillance, should be used to better understand transmission dynamics and thereby inform infection control policies and clarify the role of any environmental factors (,–). More basic knowledge of the biology, pathogenesis, virulence factors, and the contribution of different strains will be crucial for explaining observed changes in P. jirovecii epidemiology.

To ensure adherence to current guidelines and to ensure that preventive prophylaxis is optimal for all groups at risk for this potentially life-threatening infection, auditing of prescribing practices for patients known to be at risk is warranted. Raising awareness among clinicians could also help ensure that prophylaxis is correctly used.

In conclusion, data from a variety of national sources demonstrate an increase in the number of cases of P. jirovecii in non–HIV-infected persons. P. jirovecii infections are largely preventable by use of inexpensive drugs. The current case numbers are taking a substantial toll on health care costs and human health. Further investigation leading to improved preventive strategies for this largely preventable infection is warranted.

### Risk-benefit analysis of primary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with rheumatic diseases receiving rituximab [^e4cef9a3]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify a specific population of patients with rheumatic diseases receiving rituximab treatment for whom the benefit from primary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) outweighs the risk of adverse events (AEs).

Methods

This study included 818 patients treated with rituximab for rheumatic diseases, among whom 419 received prophylactic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) with rituximab, while the remainder did not. Differences in 1-year PJP incidence between the groups were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Risk-benefit assessment was performed in subgroups stratified according to risk factors based on the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent 1 case of PJP and the number needed to harm (NNH) due to severe AEs. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied to minimize the confounding by indication.

Results

During the 663.1 person-years, there were 11 PJP cases, with a mortality rate of 63.6%. Concomitant use of high-dose glucocorticoids (≥ 30 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent during 4weeks after rituximab administration) was the most important risk factor. The PJP incidence (per 100 person-years) was 7.93 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.91–17.25) in the subgroup receiving high-dose glucocorticoids compared with 0.40 (95% CI 0.01–2.25) in the subgroup without high-dose glucocorticoid use. Although prophylactic TMP/SMX significantly reduced the overall PJP incidence (HR 0.11 [95% CI 0.03–0.43]), the NNT to prevent 1 case of PJP (146) was higher than the NNH (86). In contrast, the NNT fell to 20 (95% CI 10.7–65.7) in patients receiving concomitant high-dose glucocorticoids.

Conclusion

The benefit associated with primary PJP prophylaxis outweighs the risk of severe AEs in patients with rheumatic diseases receiving rituximab and concomitant high-dose glucocorticoid treatment.

### PCP prophylaxis with use of corticosteroids by neurologists [^114c0f30]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is increasingly reported in patients without HIV. Corticosteroids are a major risk factor, with up to 90% of patients receiving corticosteroid treatment prior to the development of PCP. In view of this, many specialties now prescribe PCP prophylaxis to patients receiving prolonged or high-dose glucocorticoid regimens. Neurologists frequently prescribe corticosteroids but may not be as aware of the risk for PCP. Here, we review the evidence for routine PCP prophylaxis among regular glucocorticoid users and ask what guidance there is on the subject for neurologists.

### Pneumocystis in metastatic lung cancer, a pragmatic approach in support of prophylaxis [^218cc5be]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Human pneumocystosis is a fungal infection caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii, a cosmopolitan and opportunistic ubiquitous fungus. P. jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is potentially lethal, developing mainly in the lungs of profoundly immunocompromised patients. HIV infection, organ transplants and haematological malignancies are well-defined risk factors.

A review of the literature provided arguments to consider a pathophysiological association between P. jirovecii and the use of corticosteroids, and American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines recommend prophylaxis when prednisone doses exceed 20 mg/day for longer than 1 month.

We present a case of a lethal PJP in a patient with metastatic lung cancer who received corticosteroids without prophylaxis.

### Treatment with reduced-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective in mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies [^b04aa706]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP) is a life-threatening opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. In settings with a low prevalence of untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, patients with hematologic malignancies constitute the largest risk group for developing PJP. Widespread use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis has significantly lowered the incidence of PJP in high-risk hematological patients, but PJP still occurs in high-risk patients not tolerating TMP-SMX or after discontinuing prophylaxis, and in low-risk patients not receiving prophylactic treatment, in particular patients who have received treatment with high-dose corticosteroids.

The recommended first-line treatment for PJP in patients with hematologic malignancies is TMP-SMX given at a high dose, 15–20 mg/kg of the TMP component, but the evidence supporting this high dose is anecdotal. TMP-SMX therapy may cause dose-dependent adverse events, and previous studies have shown that the standard high-dose TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP may be correlated to an increased frequency of such adverse events.

In a recent meta-analysis analyzing reduced-dose vs standard-dose TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality but an 18% absolute risk reduction of adverse events with reduced doses of TMP-SMX. However, few patients with hematological malignancies were included in this study, and it is thus unclear if these findings can be generalized to a hematological population. This retrospective multicenter study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by comparing clinical outcomes and adverse events in hematologic patients receiving a reduced vs standard dose of TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP.

### Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia… [^42aa997c]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor A recent JAMA Insights article reviewed indications for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis in immunocompromised adults. 1 The authors commented that patients receiving corticosteroids at doses equivalent to at least 20 mg/d of prednisone for at least 4 weeks who have an additional cause of immunosuppression. should receive Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis. 1 They also noted there is no consensus for when to initiate PCP prophylaxis among patients with autoimmune disease. 1 Unfortunately, without consensus and with no clear definition of "additional cause of immunosuppression, " confusion may arise regarding the appropriateness of PCP prophylaxis in individual cases.

To help decide whether PCP prophylaxis for patients with autoimmune disease is indicated, clinicians can consider the number needed to treat to prevent 1 episode of PCP balanced against the number needed to harm. disorders). 3 Among patients with cancer, the NNT was 19 to prevent 1 case of PCP. 2 In a study of patients with rheumatic disease receiving greater than 30 mg/d of prednisone for more than 4 weeks, PCP risk was higher for certain diseases, including microscopic polyangiitis and dermatomyositis. In another study of patients with rheumatologic illnesses receiving lower doses of corticosteroids, the NNT for patients receiving greater than or equal to 15 mg/d and less than 30 mg/d of prednisone or the equivalent was 204, exceeding the NNH of 45.

5 However, the NNT fell to 31 for a "high-risk" subgroup, defined as patients with baseline lymphopenia or receiving pulse-dose steroids. 5 It is unknown whether these calculations can be extended to other autoimmune diseases or to patients receiving corticosteroids in combination with newer, targeted biologic therapies, which may be less immunosuppressive. Although steroids are an established risk factor for PCP, there is heterogeneity in the risk conferred by the underlying disease, concomitant immunosuppressive therapies, and patient comorbidities. When available, the NNT and NNH can inform decision-making regarding PCP prophylaxis. When unavailable, careful consideration of the abovementioned factors, in addition to corticosteroid dose and duration, may enable clinicians to balance the risk and benefit of administering PCP prophylaxis.

Definitions

In this prospective study, investigators were asked to include only patients with proven or probable PJP based on specific biological tests and concordant clinical and radiologic presentations, as per the European definition. In every case, PJP diagnosis was retained after diagnostic workup had ruled out alternative plausible diagnoses. Cases where P. jirovecii was detected through non-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in oral or lower respiratory tract samples, or via quantitative PCR with high cycle threshold values (determined by the clinician's judgment) and lacked corresponding clinical and radiological features, should not be included.

Investigators gathered data on prior or ongoing prophylaxis of PJP upon ICU admission or upon PJP diagnosis, through interviews with patients, family members, or their primary care providers. The prophylaxis included oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), atovaquone, dapsone, or aerosolized pentamidine, without specific differentiation in the data collection regarding the type of prophylaxis.

Data were gathered on the current or recent (within 4 weeks before ICU admission) use of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medications (including corticosteroid therapy) and the specific type of medication utilized. The criterion for defining corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression was established as a daily dosage of ≥ 15 mg of prednisone-equivalent for a period of ≥ 4 weeks, or the receipt of a bolus of ≥ 500 mg within the preceding 3 months.

Infectious disease prophylaxis during glucocorticoid (GC) therapy notes that Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is a fungal infection associated with immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving GC therapy, and it is also important to consider prophylaxis for tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, and strongyloides based on geography and patient demographics; recommendations for infection prophylaxis vary and there are no neurology specific recommendations. For PJP, factors reported to increase risk in patients on GC include lymphopenia, interstitial lung disease, active malignancy, organ dysfunction, and low CD4 count, and initiation of PJP prophylaxis when chronic GC is used at a dose ≥ 20 mg/day has been recommended in the infectious disease literature and is not specific to the underlying indication for GC treatment, although the risk for PJP infection appears to vary and generally is low in the neuromuscular patient population.

### Pneumocystis in metastatic lung cancer, a pragmatic approach in support of prophylaxis [^2be7254b]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Lung cancer prognosis has improved in the last decade, including in patients with brain metastasis. However, few of these patients who receive corticosteroids have a primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). We report the case of an 80-year-old man diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer and concomitant symptomatic brain metastases, treated with 50 mg/day of prednisolone without any prophylaxis, who presented an acute PJP. After 72 hours of unsuccessful treatment of PJP, the patient died. In our review of this case and the existing literature, we emphasise the importance of a wide use of prophylaxis for PJP, especially in advanced lung cancer treated with corticosteroid therapy. We discuss this issue and report current evidence for primary prophylaxis by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

### Pneumocystis pneumonia in intensive care: clinical spectrum, prophylaxis patterns, antibiotic treatment delay impact, and role of corticosteroids. A French multicentre prospective cohort study [^5ee4f4c8]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Severe Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) requiring intensive care has been the subject of few prospective studies. It is unclear whether delayed curative antibiotic therapy may impact survival in these severe forms of PJP. The impact of corticosteroid therapy combined with antibiotics is also unclear.

Methods

This multicentre, prospective observational study involving 49 adult intensive care units (ICUs) in France was designed to evaluate the severity, the clinical spectrum, and outcomes of patients with severe PJP, and to assess the association between delayed curative antibiotic treatment and adjunctive corticosteroid therapy with mortality.

Results

We included 158 patients with PJP from September 2020 to August 2022. Their main reason for admission was acute respiratory failure (n = 150, 94.9%). 12% of them received antibiotic prophylaxis for PJP before ICU admission. The ICU, hospital, and 6-month mortality were 31.6%, 35.4%, and 40.5%, respectively. Using time-to-event analysis with a propensity score-based inverse probability of treatment weighting, the initiation of curative antibiotic treatment after 96 h of ICU admission was associated with faster occurrence of death [time ratio: 6.75; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.48–30.82; P = 0.014]. The use of corticosteroids for PJP was associated with faster occurrence of death (time ratio: 2.48; 95% CI 1.01–6.08; P = 0.048).

Conclusion

This study showed that few patients with PJP admitted to intensive care received prophylactic antibiotic therapy, that delay in curative antibiotic treatment was common and that both delay in curative antibiotic treatment and adjunctive corticosteroids for PJP were associated with accelerated mortality.

### International consensus guidance for the management of glucocorticoid related complications in neuromuscular disease [^fe2931a3]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). High credibility.

Consensus recommendations for infectious disease prophylaxis during chronic GC therapy — Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP): PJP prophylaxis should be used when the annual incidence of PJP for a given disease and treatment modality is ≥ 3.5%. For neuromuscular disease (NMD) receiving glucocorticoid (GC) monotherapy where disease-specific incidence is unknown, prophylaxis may be offered to patients receiving ≥ 20 mg/day of prednisone equivalent for ≥ 1 month; if a second immunosuppressive agent is added, prophylaxis should be offered for patients receiving ≥ 20 mg prednisone equivalent for ≥ 1 month. Trimethoprim‑Sulfamethoxazole (TMP‑SMX) one single‑strength tablet daily or one double‑strength tablet three times a week is the recommended regimen for PJP prophylaxis in patients with normal renal function, adjusted for renal function. For TMP‑SMX allergy, alternative options include atovaquone 1.5g daily, dapsone 100 mg daily, or aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg monthly.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is seen increasingly in non-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected immunocompromised populations, but few cases have previously been reported in association with gemcitabine therapy. We identified all patients administered gemcitabine between March 2009 and December 2012 at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Cases of PJP were identified using accepted definitions. Overall, 288 gemcitabine-treated patients were identified. Nine cases of PJP were detected, corresponding to an overall rate of 3.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–5.7%). PJP was diagnosed during gemcitabine therapy in seven patients, a median of 67 (range 31–109) days from commencement. Among patients with lymphoma, 4/22 developed PJP, corresponding to a rate of 18.2% (95% CI 6.1–38.2%). Fewer infections were associated with breast, lung and gastrointestinal malignancies (1/24 [4.2%], 3/118 [2.5%] and 1/61 [1.6%], respectively). A risk-based tool incorporating concomitant steroid therapy can be applied to target high-risk populations who would benefit from PJP prophylaxis during gemcitabine therapy.

### Clinical analysis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in children with malignant disease [^cc57279e]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJ), formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii, is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). Before the implementation of routine prophylaxis, PJP was the leading cause of infectious mortality in pediatric leukemia patients. While prophylaxis has significantly reduced PJP mortality in children with cancer, new challenges have emerged due to the increasing prevalence of hematologic malignancies requiring immunosuppressive therapy and the development of novel biotherapies.

Multiple risk factors for PJP have been identified. The primary risk stems from T-cell deficiency or dysfunction, whether due to underlying malignancy or immunosuppressive therapy. Corticosteroid treatment has been established as an independent risk factor associated with mortality in both adults and children. Additional risk factors include respiratory cytomegalovirus (CMV) coinfection, myeloablative conditioning for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), high-grade graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), T-cell-specific therapy (e.g. alemtuzumab), craniospinal or chest irradiation, and myelosuppressive therapy.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) remains the gold standard for PJP prophylaxis in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. While effective prophylaxis has substantially reduced PJP morbidity and mortality, a significant number of patients develop PJP despite available prophylaxis guidelines, with medication non-compliance emerging as a major contributing factor in pediatric cases. The clinical presentation of PJP typically includes fever, hypoxemic dyspnea, and nonproductive cough, accompanied by bilateral interstitial pneumonia with diffuse patchy consolidative and ground-glass opacities on chest imaging. However, early diagnosis remains challenging due to the absence of pathognomonic clinical or radiological findings at disease onset, and delayed diagnosis correlates with increased mortality. Prompt identification and treatment initiation are crucial for improving outcomes. While TMP/SMX is an effective first-line treatment, PJP remains a significant threat to immunocompromised children.

Although numerous studies have documented PJP in HIV-negative adults, research on pediatric HIV-negative PJP remains limited. This retrospective descriptive study characterizes PJP cases in children with malignant diseases at our institution. By analyzing clinical characteristics, diagnostic approaches, and treatment outcomes, we aim to enhance understanding of PJP in pediatric malignancies and provide guidance for early diagnosis and effective management.

Conclusions

This prospective observational study pinpoints that few patients with PJP admitted to the ICU had benefited from antibiotic prophylaxis despite being highly immunocompromised, that delayed antibiotic treatment is frequent and associated with faster occurrence of death, and suggests that adjunctive corticosteroid therapy for PJP in non-HIV patients may also be associated with faster occurrence of death.

### Pneumocystis pneumonia in intensive care: clinical spectrum, prophylaxis patterns, antibiotic treatment delay impact, and role of corticosteroids. A French multicentre prospective cohort study [^7b19ead2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, despite being prospective and encompassing 49 ICUs, our investigation cannot claim to accurately depict the epidemiology of severe PJP in France, as it only involves approximately one-fifth of French ICUs. Secondly, like previous studies in this area, our investigation faces limitations in assessing the effects of delayed antibiotic treatment on patient outcomes due to its observational design (i.e. non-randomized). This prohibits complete certainty in controlling for all potential confounding factors, particularly within the heterogeneous population of immunocompromised patients characterized by diverse clinical profiles and case mixes. In this context, distinguishing confirmed (proven or probable cases) from equivocal cases of PJP is complicated. Third, the assessment of the utility of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy faces similar methodological limitations.

### Low incidence of Pneumocystis pneumonia utilizing PCR-based diagnosis in patients with B-cell lymphoma receiving rituximab-containing combination chemotherapy [^40e0b7af]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Recent literature has demonstrated concern over the risk of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) when administering rituximab with combination chemotherapy such as in R-CHOP; however, the exact risk and potential need for prophylaxis is unknown. We sought to determine the incidence of PJP infection following R-CHOP administration in patients with B-cell lymphoma. Consecutive patients diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma receiving R-CHOP were evaluated from chemotherapy initiation until 180 days after the last administration. The primary outcome was cumulative incidence of PJP infection. Secondary endpoints included the association of rituximab, prednisone and subsequent chemotherapy with PJP infection risk. A total of 689 patients (53% male, median age 66 years) were included. Seventy-three percent of patients completed at least 6 cycles of R-CHOP treatment. Median rituximab and prednisone cumulative doses were 3950 mg and 5325 mg, respectively. Median daily prednisone dose through end of treatment was 45 mg (range 7.6 mg to 119 mg). The cumulative incidence of PJP was 1.51% (95% CI 0.57–2.43, at maximum follow-up of 330 days), below 3.5%, the conventional threshold for prophylaxis. Univariate analysis did not detect a statistically significant association between PJP and rituximab, steroids, or receipt of additional chemotherapy in this patient population. Our results demonstrate a low occurrence of Pneumocystis pneumonia during R-CHOP treatment of B-cell lymphoma and argue against universal anti-Pneumocystis prophylaxis in this setting. Further investigations should focus on targeted anti-Pneumocystis prophylaxis for patients presenting with high-risk baseline characteristics or when receiving rituximab-inclusive intensive combination chemotherapy regimens as treatment for other aggressive lymphoma subtypes.

### An analysis of the utilisation of chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with malignancy receiving corticosteroid therapy at a cancer hospital [^c42e9527]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is associated with high mortality in immunocompromised patients without human immunodeficiency virus infection. However, chemoprophylaxis is highly effective. In patients with solid tumours or haematologic malignancy, several risk factors for developing PCP have been identified, predominantly corticosteroid therapy. The aims of this study were to identify the potentially preventable cases of PCP in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy at a tertiary care cancer centre and to estimate the frequency of utilisation of chemoprophylaxis in these patients. Two retrospective reviews were performed. Over a 10-year period, 14 cases of PCP were identified: no cases were attributable to failed chemoprophylaxis, drug allergy or intolerance. During a 6-month period, 73 patients received high-dose corticosteroid therapy (≥ 25 mg prednisolone or ≥ 4 mg dexamethasone daily) for ≥ 4 weeks. Of these, 22 (30%) had haematologic malignancy, and 51 (70%) had solid tumours. Fewer patients with solid tumours received prophylaxis compared to patients with haematologic malignancy (3.9 vs 63.6%, P < 0.0001). Guidelines for PCP chemoprophylaxis in patients with haematologic malignancy or solid tumours who receive corticosteroid therapy are proposed. Successful primary prevention of PCP in this population will require a multifaceted approach targeting the suboptimal prescribing patterns for chemoprophylaxis.

### Pneumocystis pneumonia in intensive care: clinical spectrum, prophylaxis patterns, antibiotic treatment delay impact, and role of corticosteroids. A French multicentre prospective cohort study [^7c159277]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The association of the use of corticosteroids with 6-month mortality was analyzed using the same approach but used the entire study population from which we excluded 2 patients who were enrolled in a multicentre, double-blind randomized trial comparing corticosteroids to placebo (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02944045). Time zero was set at the time of first administration of curative antibiotic treatment for PJP. Whether patients were on corticosteroids before PJP onset was added to the list of covariables used for adjustment. A specific PS was calculated for estimating the probability of receiving corticosteroids during treatment of PJP. We classified patients in the corticosteroids group when they either received adjunctive corticosteroid therapy specifically for PJP as declared by investigators, or when they received corticosteroid therapy (≥ 40 mg/prednisone-equivalent) during at least the first week of treatment of PJP for other reasons.

We performed several exploratory subgroup analyses.

Continuous variables are summarized using median and interquartile range (IQR) (i.e. 25th and 75th percentiles). Groups were compared by Pearson χ², Fisher, Kruskal–Wallis, or Mann–Whitney U tests as appropriate.

The analyses were conducted using R software version 4.1.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). A two-tailed P value < 0.05 was considered significant. However, analyses were not adjusted for multiple testing.

Investigators confirmed that antibiotic therapy administered in all cases was considered appropriate. Viral infections included 4 cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia

i Mainly (36/49) patients with autoimmune/inflammatory diseases (see Table S5 of ESM)

Lung co-infections (bacterial, viral or fungal, either documented or only suspected, see Table 1) were common (69/158, 43.7%) during treatment of PJP.

Corticosteroid therapy

The proportion of patients who received corticosteroid therapy during their curative antibiotic treatment of PJP was 64.6% (102/158), with the highest proportion seen in patients with HIV infection (24/29 [82.8%]). In 71 (45.5%) cases, corticosteroids were given specifically for PJP (or for PJP but also other reason), as declared by investigators, at a median daily dose of 80 (IQR 60–95) mg prednisone-equivalent. When given exclusively for other reason (see details in Table S8), corticosteroids were administered at a median daily dose of 75 (IQR 50–131) mg prednisone-equivalent.

Decision of treatment withholding or withdrawing occurred in 32 (31.4%) patients treated with corticosteroids and in 14 (25.4%) not treated with corticosteroids (P = 0.60). Terminal extubation occurred in 10 (9.7%) patients of the corticosteroids group and in seven (12.7%) patients not receiving corticosteroids (P = 0.75). Lung co-infection was present during the first week of treatment of PJP for 46/102 (45.1%) and 23/54 (42.6%) patients of the corticosteroids and no corticosteroids groups, respectively (P = 0.90).

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^f57b2dcb]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

As in line with previous studies, risk factors such as lymphopenia, impaired renal function, age, and rituximab use were significantly associated with PJP. Our earlier research demonstrated that TMP‐SMX prophylaxis reduces the incidence of PJP and related mortality in patients treated with rituximab. An intriguing finding in this study was that among the 16 patients who developed PJP despite prophylaxis, 15 experienced the onset of PJP merely a few months following the cessation of prophylactic TMP‐SMX.

In this context, it is noteworthy that the PJP group in our study had a shorter prophylaxis duration than the control group, leading to the discontinuation of prophylaxis while the patients were still receiving relatively higher doses of GCs. Previous studies on PJP in patients with AIID showed that most PJP cases occurred when patients received > 15–20 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalents. Expanding upon this finding, we demonstrated that the risk of PJP persists even with prophylaxis, unless it is continued until GC doses are tapered to ≤ 12.5 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent. In fact, patients who stopped prophylactic TMP‐SMX at a dose of concomitant GC higher than the threshold showed an approximately 10‐times‐higher risk of PJP than other patients. This result suggests that tapering the GC dose by 12.5 mg/day or less can be a relevant threshold for considering the withdrawal of prophylactic TMP‐SMX.

### Utilizing a best practice advisory (BPA) to increase Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis prescribing for patients with cancer on high dose corticosteroids. | JCO oncology practice… [^6e91edc9]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids are commonly prescribed medications for cancer patients to help with symptom control from cancer treatment as well as for immunotherapy related adverse events. The risk of developing PJP is significantly increased for patients on prednisone equal to or greater than 20 mg per day x 1 month or equivalent. Steroid related PJP is associated with a 30–50% mortality in non-HIV patients. Methods: We conducted an IRB-approved retrospective chart review of individuals diagnosed with PJP at an academic medical center and 6 partner hospitals between 2016–2022. Patients were excluded if they had a diagnosis of HIV or prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant. We then created a best practice advisory built into the electronic health record to notify clinicians if a patient is at risk of developing srPJP based on their outpatient corticosteroid prescription.

The BPA is triggered system-wide if a clinician signs an outpatient prescription for a prednisone or equivalent steroid dose of 20 mg or more for a duration of at least 3 weeks. The BPA will suggest PJP prophylaxis and link to an order for the clinician to select. Results: There were 96 identified cases of srPJP in non HIV/HSCT patients. None of these patients received antibiotic prophylaxis. Among these cases, 32 patients died from ARDS due to PJP, a mortality of 33. 3%. 45% of identified cases were related to steroids prescribed for cancer management, and 68% of these received dexamethasone as the primary steroid. The BPA launched in April 2023 system wide across UC Health. Since launching the BPA in April 2023, it has been triggered 911 times with action taken by selecting an order for PJP prophylaxis 24. 5% of the time. Conclusions: Despite the efficacy of prophylaxis, many patients at risk of developing srPJP do not receive prophylaxis.

Since launching the BPA, preliminary data shows that the BPA has increased the orders placed for concurrent PJP prophylaxis. Further work must be done to determine if these orders for concurrent PJP prophylaxis were signed and if the BPA can increase PJP prophylaxis prescribing for patients on high dose corticosteroids and ultimately decrease srPJP cases and deaths.

### Incidence of Pneumocystis jirovecii and adverse events associated with Pneumocystis prophylaxis in children receiving glucocorticoids [^0a6db6e8]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial prophylaxis is indicated to prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) in profoundly immunosuppressed children. The incidence of PJP infection in children with chronic glucocorticoid exposure is unknown, and PJP prophylaxis has been associated with adverse events. We hypothesized that PJP infection is rare in children without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), cancer, or a transplant history who are using chronic glucocorticoids and that those exposed to PJP prophylaxis are more likely to experience a cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction or myelosuppression than unexposed patients.

Methods

This study involved a retrospective cohort from the Clinformatics Data Mart Database (OptumInsight, Eden Prairie, MN). We identified patients ≤ 18 years of age who received at least 2 prescriptions for a systemic glucocorticoid within a 60-day period and excluded patients with a history of PJP infection, an oncologic diagnosis, transplant, or HIV/AIDS. PJP prophylaxis exposure was identified by using national drug codes. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction or myelosuppression was identified by using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9), codes. We used a discrete time-failure model to examine the association between exposure and outcome.

Results

We identified 119399 children on glucocorticoids, 10% of whom received PJP prophylaxis. The incidences of PJP were 0.61 and 0.53 per 10000 patient-years in children exposed and those unexposed to PJP prophylaxis, respectively. In a multivariable model, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction (odds ratio, 3.20; 95% confidence interval, 2.62–3.92) and myelosuppression (odds ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.56–2.20).

Conclusions

PJP infection was rare in children using glucocorticoids chronically, and PJP prophylaxis-associated cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions and myelosuppression are more common. The use of PJP chemoprophylaxis in children without HIV/AIDS, cancer, or a transplant history who are taking glucocorticoids chronically should be considered carefully.

### Risk factors associated with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in non-HIV immunocompromised patients and co-pathogens analysis by metagenomic next-generation sequencing [^f996132e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is a potentially life-threatening opportunistic infection that predominantly affects immunocompromised hosts including those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Other non-HIV immunocompromised hosts including solid organ transplantation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, hematologic malignancies, connective tissue diseases, solid tumors and other autoimmune inflammatory disease that need systemic corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant therapy. In recent years, with the advent of antiretrovirals and prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the incidence of PJP in the HIV patients has decreased significantly. However, as the widespread use of immunosuppressive drugs and antitumor therapy, the broader application of solid organ and bone marrow transplantation, the prevalence of PJP in non-HIV immunocompromised patients has gradually increased. Studies have shown that PJP in non-HIV patients have a more progressive course and higher mortality rate (ranging from 30% to 60%) than HIV patients. Given the serious consequence of PJP in non-HIV immunocompromised patients, it is important to find the risk factors which could be used to predict the occurrence of PJP. Guidelines for preventing PJP in HIV patients are based on CD4 + T cells less than 200 cells/µl. There are no consensus guidelines for prophylaxis of PJP in non-HIV immunocompromised patients. Previous study has reported that lymphopenia, corticosteroids and a low count of CD4 + T cells are risk factors for the development of PJP in adults with autoimmune inflammatory disorders. However, whether such cut-off value of CD4 + T cells < 200 cells/µl can be used as a PJP prophylaxis in non-HIV immunocompromised patients is inconsistent between different academics.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia

Data on incidence and prevention of PJP for non-HIV related immunosuppression are best established for solid organ transplant recipients, bone marrow transplant recipients and patients with malignancy undergoing chemotherapy. There are limited data for the incidence of PJP in patients with RA. Registry data suggest a higher risk of infections with rituximab compared with TNFi. Retrospective data for RA suggest that GC play a significant role in the risk for PJP, which is supported by data from other populations. There are also limited data on the use of PJP prophylaxis for patients with RA, but both retrospective and prospective cohort analysis support the use of prophylaxis for patients with RA at risk for PJP. More robust data would be beneficial to support the use of prophylaxis for this patient population.

Hepatitis B

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus that can cause acute hepatitis as well as chronic hepatitis. Some patients develop latent infections that can reactivate in the setting of immunosuppression and cause fulminant disease. Rituximab appears to have the highest risk; one retrospective study showed that in 50 RA patients at risk for reactivation, four developed HBV reactivation, two of whom developed clinically significant hepatitis and one died as a result of their illness. There does not seem to be a significant difference in risk of reactivation with non-rituximab biologics or methotrexate therapy. Considering these risks of reactivations, the American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) and the American College of Rheumatology recommend routine screening for patients with RA treated with immunosuppressives. The AGA has issued guidelines for treatment as well as for prophylaxis for at risk patients. High-risk patients — those who are HBsAg and HBcAb positive treated with high-dose GCs (> 20 mg prednisone equivalent dose for 4 weeks or more) or HBcAb positive patients treated with rituximab — are recommended to take antiviral prophylaxis while on treatment and up to at least 6 months after treatment.

Pneumocystis jirovecii

Efficacy of prophylaxis for P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) has mostly been examined in patients receiving treatment with glucocorticoids. The exact dose and duration of treatment with glucocorticoids cannot be defined based on the available data thus far. However, prophylaxis in patients with various AIIRD receiving prednisolone more than 15–30 mg/day for more than 2–4 weeks, has been found to reduce episodes of PCP and associated mortality(table 6). On the other hand, in a study enrolling 184 patients with giant cell arteritis treated with high doses of glucocorticoids (average starting dose of 47 mg of prednisone/day), no PCP cases were recorded, while prophylaxis for PCP was given in only 5 patients.

Table 6
Prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PCP in patients treated with GC

Data for other antirheumatic treatments beyond glucocorticoids are very limited. Katsuyama et al found that patients with RA treated with bDMARDs, having also specific risk factors for PCP development, might benefit from prophylaxis for PCP. In 214patients with RA who received prophylaxis for PCP based on the presence of at least two risk factors (age ≥ 65 years, coexisting pulmonary disease and use of glucocorticoids), no PCP cases were reported, compared with the incidence observed (0.93/100 000) for patients with the same characteristics in whom prophylaxis for PCP was administered based on physician's discretion. In addition, in a small retrospective study, it was shown that annual incidence of PCP was lower in patients treated with cyclophosphamide who received PCP prophylaxis (5.33% (95% CI 0.65% to 19.24%)), compared with those who did not (9.50% (95% CI 1.15% to 34.33%)). Of note, in all but one of these patients, glucocorticoids were coadministered (mean maximum dose of prednisone: 39 mg/day). The most common prophylactic scheme in clinical practice and in published studies is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 480 mg/day or 960 mg three times a week. However, there are a handful of studies, including a RCT, suggesting that reduced dosing regimes (eg, 480 mg every other day) are equally effective and have fewer adverse effects(online supplemental table 5).

5.2.8.6 Prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection

Statement 101. We suggest that adult IBD patients on triple immunosuppression and using more than 20 mg prednisolone may be offered prophylactic antibiotics for Pneumocystis jirovecii (co-trimoxazole oral 960 mg three times weekly or 480 mg daily) (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 85.7%).

Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii using co-trimoxazole has been shown to reduce incidence by 91% in a meta-analysis of studies in transplant recipients and haematological malignancy. In the Spanish registry ENEIDA study of 571 patients treated with rescue therapy, two developed P. jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) and one died. Both had received double immunosuppression (corticosteroids and azathioprine) and had not received prophylaxis, which was given to all receiving triple immunosuppression. The risk relates as much to use of corticosteroids as to other immunosuppressive drugs. A study from the USA showed a low incidence of PJP in IBD patients despite low use of prophylaxis. There were three cases identified among 937 patients with 6066 patient-years follow-up with wide confidence intervals around the risk related to each class of immunosuppressant. Overall risk is low. PJP prophylaxis should perhaps be restricted to those on triple therapy taking ≥ 20 mg prednisolone, particularly those with other risk factors (age, frailty, comorbidity). The optimal dose regimen is unclear, but in adults co-trimoxazole 960 mg three times per week or 480 mg daily are widely used. Stevens–Johnson syndrome is a rare but devastating complication of co-trimoxazole and should be discussed with patients when offering co-trimoxazole therapy.

### Fatal Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in a HIV-negative adult [^7fcdee40]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii is responsible for P. jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) in immunocompromised individuals, with a recent rise of cases noted in non-HIV patients. A middle-aged man presented with new-onset cough, fever, hypoxia and tachypnoea. He was on a tapering course of dexamethasone for amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. He developed worsening airspace disease necessitating mechanical ventilation. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was positive for P. jirovecii and he was managed with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and pentamidine, but succumbed to cardiorespiratory arrest. One-third of PJP cases occur in non-HIV patients, and have a higher morbidity and mortality. Most immunocompromised patients typically exhibit PJP during a corticosteroid taper. The accurate dose, duration or frequency of steroid use in not well established. Diagnosis of PJP in this population is more challenging due to lower BAL yield with alternate modalities such as serum/BAL β-d-glucan and PCR enhancing the yield. Further studies are needed to highlight PJP prophylaxis in patients with steroid use.

### Practical approach to monitoring and prevention of infectious complications associated with systemic corticosteroids, antimetabolites, cyclosporine, and cyclophosphamide in nonmalignant hematologic diseases [^49af7788]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids constitute a first-line therapy for adults and children suffering from nonmalignant immune-mediated hematologic diseases. However, high disease relapse rates during the tapering period or upon drug discontinuation result in long-term corticosteroid use that increases the risk of infection. This same concept applies to other immunosuppressive agents, such as antimetabolites, calcineurin inhibitors, and cyclophosphamide. Corticosteroids are associated with a length-of-treatment and dose-dependent risk for infection. Screening and antimicrobial prophylaxis against tuberculosis, hepatitis B, Strongyloides stercoralis, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) might be indicated in patients who are scheduled to be on high-dose corticosteroids for > 4 weeks (> 30 mg of prednisone-equivalent dose [PEQ]) or in patients chronically treated (≥ 8 weeks of continuous or intermittent corticosteroid use) with moderate doses (≥ 15 to < 30 mg PEQ). Antimetabolites (azathioprine, mycophenolate) increase the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML); however, other opportunistic infections and viral reactivation have also been reported. In case of new onset of neurological symptoms, PML needs to be considered, and an urgent neurology consultation should be obtained. Cyclophosphamide-induced myelosuppression can lead to serious infections related to neutropenia. PJP prophylaxis should be considered with combination therapy of cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids until a PEQ dose ≤ 5 mg/d is reached. Data on infectious risk when cyclosporine is used in patients with nonmalignant hematologic diseases are lacking. Discontinuation of any immunosuppressive agent during an episode of infection is recommended. In all patients, adherence to an age-based immunization schedule is appropriate.

Objective

Summarize data on the pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention options for non-AIDS immunocompromised patients who have Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP); review the epidemiology of patients presenting with PJP; and discuss the first and second-line pharmacological options for treatment and prophylaxis of PJP in this population.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1989-February 2016) searched. Terms searched included combinations of Pneumocystis jirovecii, Pneumocystis carinii, non-HIV, infected, patients, prevention, prophylaxis, Bactrim, treatment, AIDS, opportunistic, immunocompromised, cancer, and pathophysiology

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles included had the most relevant information on PJP pathophysiology, and first-/second-line treatment and prophylactic options. Inclusion criteria were met and evaluated with 43 sources.

Data Synthesis

P jirovecii has a complicated life-cycle; it seeks to find compromised immune systems in order to replicate, causing life-threatening complications. With immunosuppressive medications coming to market for immunomodulating diseases, PJP has become a prevalent opportunistic infection in the non-HIV population. CD4+ lymphocyte count < 200 cells/µL is the primary risk factor for PJP presentation in these patients. With data from clinical trials, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) has become the primary treatment and prophylaxis of PJP in the non-HIV population, although second-line options are available.

Conclusion

PJP is a health problem that may result in an increased concern as more immunomodulating medications to treat various disease states are developed. Patients on these drugs or those with immunosuppressive diseases should have their CD4+ count monitored. Health care providers should continue to use TMP/SMX as the primary option in non-HIV, immunocompromised patients for treatment and prophylaxis of PJP.

### Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in intensive care units: a multicenter study by ESGCIP and EFISG [^daf3800e]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

A first important limitation, related to our primary descriptive analysis, is the lack of precise information about previous/ongoing corticosteroid treatment (e.g. dosage, length of therapy), a recognized predisposing condition to PJP, that was unfortunately unavailable retrospectively. However, in our opinion, this limitation eventually did not undermine the identification of the spectrum of baseline diseases nowadays encountered in critically ill patients with PJP. Future studies with a more detailed information on steroid treatments could help to define the possible reasons for the low prevalence of patients on PJP prophylaxis in our cohort despite the high frequency of patients with at least one predisposing disease/condition. Notably, a low frequency of PJP prophylaxis in non-HIV patients at risk of PJP was already reported by Dunbar and colleagues and by Roux and colleagues. The lack of detailed information about corticosteroid treatments also precluded the evaluation of the diagnostic performance of respiratory Pneumocystis PCR and serum BDG using the EORTC/MSGERC definition of probable PJP, although it should be highlighted that this would have resulted in a significant incorporation bias. Of course, our definition of presumptive PJP, although more suitable for the aims of the present study, is not standardized and also still hampered by a nonnegligible risk of incorporation bias, that should be necessarily acknowledged. This also considering the relatively low frequency of patients who underwent computerized tomography (56.5%), the absence of which could have further hampered the identification of PJP and its differential diagnosis in some cases. Second, in the assessment of the diagnostic performance of respiratory Pneumocystis PCR we defined any positive result as the criterion for positivity, to preserve homogeneity of interpretation despite the wide heterogeneity of employed molecular tests across centers (Additional file 1: Table S1), whereas higher fungal loads are typically more indicative of active infection than low fungal loads. In this regard, the highly fragmented data in terms of Ct values available for this study prevented us from reliably assessing potential thresholds to distinguish between colonization and infection. A third limitation arises from the recognized suboptimal sensitivity of the diagnostic gold standard (microscopy) and from the low number of microscopy tests performed in our real life cohort, that forced us to strongly rely on a definition of presumptive disease as diagnostic reference. Finally, it should be noted that mortality rates reported in this study, either for PJP or for pneumonia caused by other pathogens, are only presented descriptively and unadjusted for other prognostic factors.

Risks of infection in glomerular disease — assessment should include relevant infectious disease screening and travel history, and prevention measures include vaccines and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis when corticosteroid dose is high; additional SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is recommended by the authors. The commentary highlights that infection risk is heightened "due both to the underlying disease and loss of immune factors in the urine and more importantly to the potent immunosuppressive agents", and that "Practice Point 1.8.2 is an important consideration, as is ruling out Strongyloides infection in patients with increased risk and an elevated peripheral eosinophil count (Practice Point 1.8.3)". It advises that "Gathering a travel history, especially in those who have recently immigrated to the United States, is essential to assessing risk". For prevention, they "agree with the recommendations for vaccinating against encapsulated organisms, especially when using complement inhibitors, and the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or equivalent for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis when using a daily prednisolone equivalent dose of ≥ 20 mg as well as other immunosuppression such as cyclophosphamide or rituximab". Vaccination guidance includes: "Practice Point 1.8.1 recommends influenza, pneumococcal, and varicella vaccines for all patients with nephrotic syndrome", and "We would additionally recommend that all eligible and willing patients be immunized against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)".

Identify CRS based on clinical presentation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypotension, and hypoxia.

If CRS is suspected, withhold EPKINLY until CRS resolves. Manage according to the recommendations in Table 6 and consider further management per current practice guidelines. Administer supportive therapy for CRS, which may include intensive care for severe or life-threatening CRS.

Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurological Toxicity Syndrome (ICANS)

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ICANS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. At the first sign of ICANS, withhold EPKINLY and consider neurology evaluation. Rule out other causes of neurologic symptoms. Provide supportive therapy, which may include intensive care, for ICANS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Manage ICANS according to the recommendations in Table 7 and consider further management per current practice guidelines.

Discussion

The present study confirms that mortality associated with PJP is high, with severe PJP requiring ICU admission now primarily affecting non-HIV patients. Notably, a significant proportion (88%) of immunocompromised patients did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis. Delays in curative antibiotic therapy were common and associated with faster occurrence of death. Finally, corticosteroid treatment, once the diagnosis of PJP is confirmed, might be linked to faster occurrence of death.

The few studies exclusively focused on patients with PJP admitted to ICU have been retrospective and are now dated. One focused exclusively on patients with HIV infection and two exclusively on patients without. Therefore, comparing our results with these studies may pose challenges in interpretation, potentially influenced by changes in the epidemiology of PJP patients admitted to ICU and shifts in the overall approach to care, particularly in the management of ARDS. Our findings confirm that the proportion of patients with HIV infection requiring ICU admission for PJP is no longer predominant. The observed proportion of 18.4% in our study is lower than the roughly 29% observed in the early 2000s, but it remains non-negligible and appears stable when compared with data from 2016 to 2020 (19.5%), highlighting the ongoing nature of the HIV infection epidemic.

Our findings also confirm that beyond the increasing proportions of patients with solid or hematologic cancer and organ transplant recipients, patients with inflammatory/ autoimmune diseases constitute more than 30% of PJP cases admitted to the ICU.

The observed ICU mortality in our study among non-HIV patients was high (32.3%), aligning with some observations but considerably lower than reported by others, ranging from 48% to roughly 60%. Similarly, our overall 6-month mortality rate was 40.5%, whereas the most recent retrospective study reported a 90-day mortality rate of 67%.

An unexpected result was that only 12% of patients were under prophylaxis, despite being almost immunocompromised and potentially eligible for prophylaxis according to current guidelines. This situation may have improved since the 2000s–2010s, as the proportion of patients under prophylaxis was reported to be 1.1–3.6%, results that should be considered with caution given the retrospective nature of these studies.

The second unexpected finding was that a non-negligible proportion of patients received the first dose of curative antibiotic treatment for PJP late: among patient not yet treated upon ICU admission, 12.7% received the first dose after the 96th hour. This is in line with what was reported years ago, suggesting that the practices of intensivists may not have evolved since then. Despite a rich literature emphasizing the high index of suspicion of PJP when caring for immunocompromised patients with diffuse pneumonia, there still remains a considerable gap between theory and practice. Our study further suggests that early treatment is of paramount importance, as it reveals that a delay of 4 days accelerated the time to death by a factor 6.75. This aligns with findings from earlier retrospective studies and one prospective study, encompassing all PJP cases, whether requiring intensive care admission or not. That study demonstrated an increased risk of mortality of 1.11 for each day of delayed treatment. For obvious ethical reasons, a randomized controlled trial comparing early versus delayed treatment is not feasible. Our study, utilizing propensity score weighting, represents the highest methodological standard achievable in this scenario. Hence, based on common sense (early treatment seems inherently preferable) and our study's findings, along with prior evidence, the question appears settled: PJP should be treated as soon as the suspicion stage, and should be systematically considered in immunocompromised individuals presenting to the ICU with pneumonia and/or acute respiratory failure.

Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy in non-HIV patients with PJP has been the subject of several studies, all retrospective, some of which suggesting that corticosteroids, akin to their effects in HIV-infected patients, might improve survival, while others found no significant impact. Two recent studies, one monocentric including 130 patients, and the other multicentric including 172 solid-organ transplant receivers, used PS-IPW as we did, and found no difference in mortality between patients treated with corticosteroids at the initiation of curative antibiotic treatment and those either untreated with corticosteroids or treated late. Our results, on the other hand, suggest that corticosteroid therapy may be associated with a twofold faster occurrence of death. Therefore, to date, there is still no unequivocal answer to the question of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy for PJP in non-HIV patients. A definitive answer may come from a recently completed randomized trial, the results of which are pending (NCT02944045).

### Alterations of lung microbiota in lung transplant recipients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [^13431a6f]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

TMP-SMX is recommended for PJP prophylaxis in LTRs for at least 6∼12 months post-lung transplantation, and for LTRs with a history of PJP, lifelong prophylaxis may be indicated. At our lung transplant center, TMP-SMX is not generally prescribed for PJP prophylaxis, but LTRs with a previous episode of PJP are on lifelong prophylaxis to prevent recurrence. In this study, the main components after PJP recovery was significantly different from the episode of PJP, and similar to controls. These results suggested that disruption in the homeostasis of the microbiota by PJP could be restore balance after treatment, but the effect on graft lung function remains unknown. In spite of this, LTRs after PJP recovery had a higher abundance of Human gammaherpesvirus 4 compared with the control group, which implied the underlying immunocompromised condition. This result further supported the previous suggestion that lifelong PJP prophylaxis for these population is necessary.

### Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in kidney and simultaneous pancreas kidney transplant recipients in the present era of routine post-transplant prophylaxis: risk factors and outcomes [^e90537a2]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, in our review of over 6000 transplant recipients, routine PJP prophylaxis has drastically reduced the incidence of PJP to less than 1%. The peak incidence time period has also been shifted from the initial 6 months to the second year after transplant. Patient survival in affected patients remains dismal, with 2-year mortality rate approaching 60% with treatment. CMV has consistently been shown to be a strong predictor of subsequent PJP and because of this, we suggest extension or re-initiation of PJP prophylaxis for at least 6 months in recipients with CMV viremia. Future studies are needed to elucidate the impact of this intervention on rates of PJP in those with CMV viremia, as well as the feasibility of this approach in this population from tolerability from a myelosuppression standpoint.

### A nomogram-based clinical prediction model for adverse clinical outcomes in non-HIV Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia patients [^f67b8de8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Among the variables incorporated into our model, we selected the NLR over absolute lymphocyte count as a prognostic marker, given its superior reliability and reproducibility in critically ill patients. The NLR integrates both pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive components, offering a more comprehensive reflection of immune dysfunction and systemic inflammation in PJP. Our previous study has shown that lymphocyte counts did not differ significantly between survivors and non-survivors in non-HIV PJP, whereas NLR demonstrated stronger prognostic performance, even surpassing CD4 + T cell count in predictive accuracy. Additionally, NLR has shown clinical value in various immune-related diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, further supporting its utility as a marker of immune-inflammatory status. We also distinguished between chronic pulmonary diseases–such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and bronchiectasis–and interstitial lung disease (ILD) in our analysis. Although both categories involve structural lung abnormalities and may impair local respiratory defenses, their immunological characteristics differ substantially. Chronic pulmonary diseases are not inherently immune-mediated and typically do not require immunosuppressive therapy. In contrast, ILD often involves immune-driven inflammation and necessitates long-term glucocorticoid or immunosuppressive treatment, thereby increasing the risk for opportunistic infections like PJP.

Drug-induced and iatrogenic factors also play a critical role in shaping immunosuppressive status and increasing susceptibility to PJP. Several guidelines–including those from the German Society for Hematology and Medical Oncology, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America–recommend initiating PJP prophylaxis in patients receiving ≥ 20 mg/day of prednisone for ≥ 4 weeks. However, the impact of pre-onset corticosteroid therapy on PJP prognosis has yet to be conclusively determined. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the association between corticosteroid use within one month prior to admission and adverse hospital outcomes. Although the association did not reach statistical significance, the observed trend toward increased risk suggests potential clinical relevance. Given that long-term corticosteroid therapy is a well-established risk factor for PJP onset and prognosis, it is plausible that cumulative exposure may better capture the risk contribution of corticosteroid therapy. Due to the retrospective nature of our study, we were unable to obtain complete data on corticosteroid dosage and duration, and thus could not calculate cumulative corticosteroid exposure. Notably, a recent multicenter study quantitatively analyzed corticosteroid use and demonstrated a significant association between pre-treatment dosage and 90-day mortality in non-HIV PJP patients, highlighting the prognostic value of corticosteroid burden in this population.

### PJP pneumonia in brentuximab vedotin recipients… [^e12a2769]. ASCO (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract e19533 Background: Pneumocystis pneumonia is a catastrophic infection seen in the context of low CD4 counts. Brentuximab vedotin is a drug antibody conjugate targeting CD30 and is used to treat patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma. PJP prophylaxis is not currently recommended for patients receiving BV-based treatment despite co-expression of CD30 on CD4 cells. The frequency of PJP following BV remains poorly defined. Results: Of 402 BV recipients identified, 63 received PJP prophylaxis and were omitted. Fourteen of the 339 not on prophylaxis developed PJP following BV. Those infected had a median age of 61, 71% were male. The most common diagnoses were HL, TCL, and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma at rates of 57%, 21%, and 14% respectively. Therapy regimens included BV monotherapy, BV-CHP, and BV-AVD at rates of 43%, 21%, and 14% respectively. BV represented median 2.

Three patients had CD4 count measured at time of PJP diagnosis with median value of 157.
57. 1% had no steroid exposure beyond the treatment regimen.
14. 3% were on chronic doses of 5mg prednisone for autoimmune conditions. Short bursts of steroids prior to PJP were seen in 21. 4% with median exposure of 8 days. One patient had prolonged steroid exposure but was weaned off 17 days prior to PJP diagnosis.
71. 4% were older than 50 years at time of PJP. Conclusions: We observed rates of PJP above the commonly accepted threshold of 3. 5% for recommending prophylaxis. Among patients with an ALC greater than 1000, 75% had HL raising the question of a qualitative defect in immunity. Close ALC monitoring is recommended for patients receiving BV with a low threshold to institute PJP prophylaxis, especially amongst those older than 50 or with a diagnosis of HL.

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^6f2cb9a4]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The study has several limitations that should be addressed. First, due to the small number of PJP cases in this study, including even a few covariates in the multivariable model could potentially result in model overfitting. Although variable selection using LASSO and RSF analysis helped reduce this potential bias, the results of this study should be validated in future larger‐scale studies. Second, the prophylactic effect of TMP‐SMX may vary among individual AIIDs. However, this study could not thoroughly address this variability due to the limited number of patients in each specific disease subgroup. Furthermore, the risk of PJP is not driven by a single factor alone but rather by a complex interplay of multiple interacting factors. Although this study suggests that GC dose could serve as a relevant and easily applicable threshold for considering prophylaxis withdrawal, the decision should be further guided by more patient‐specific factors, which need to be further investigated in future studies. Third, because this study retrospectively collected data from medical records, it is possible that some potential AEs related to TMP‐SMX were missed in our analysis. Finally, the results of this study may have been affected by unmeasured factors, an inherent limitation of observational studies. An RCT would provide a clear understanding of this issue. However, considering the extremely low incidence of PJP in the study population, the sample size required to test the hypothesis with an adequate statistical power would not be feasible. As an alternative, further comparative observational studies may offer a viable option for generating additional evidence.

In conclusion, discontinuation of TMP‐SMX during GC treatment at doses > 12.5 mg prednisone equivalent significantly increased the risk of PJP. This suggests that tapering the GC to 12.5 mg/day may be a reasonable consideration when withdrawing PJP prophylaxis. Although these results need to be confirmed in future studies, they may assist physicians in determining the appropriate timing for discontinuing PJP prophylaxis in patients with AIIDs.

### Everolimus (Torpenz) [^a530238e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Non-infectious Pneumonitis

Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives. Non-infectious pneumonitis was reported in up to 19% of patients treated with everolimus in clinical trials, some cases were reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension) as a secondary event. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 non-infectious pneumonitis was up to 4% and up to 0.2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Fatal outcomes have been observed.

Consider a diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms. Consider opportunistic infections, such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) in the differential diagnosis. Advise patients to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms.

Continue TORPENZ without dose alteration in patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms. Imaging appears to overestimate the incidence of clinical pneumonitis.

For Grade 2 to 4 non-infectious pneumonitis, withhold or permanently discontinue TORPENZ based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.9)]. Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. The development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose.

### Clinical analysis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in children with malignant disease [^179ee69a]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies investigating reduced-dose or intermittent TMP/SMX regimens to minimize toxicity have shown varying results. Hughes et al. demonstrated in a prospective, double-blind randomized trial that three consecutive days weekly was as effective as daily administration for ALL patients while reducing toxicity (PJP rates: 0% vs. 21%). However, less frequent dosing schedules show higher breakthrough rates, with twice-weekly regimens yielding 1.2% breakthrough infections and weekly prophylaxis proving insufficient during intensive chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation. These findings align with our observation that 60% of PJP occurred in patients receiving sub-optimal prophylaxis schedules. Optimizing prophylactic regimens to balance efficacy and tolerability remains an important research goal.

Since its recognition as an AIDS-defining illness in 1981, PJP diagnostics have evolved significantly. While open lung biopsy remains the gold standard for detecting characteristic cysts and trophozoites, its invasive nature has led clinicians to rely on probable diagnosis based on host immune status, immunosuppression severity, and clinical, radiological, and microbiological criteria. Notably, non-HIV patients often present with more subtle but potentially more severe manifestations. In our cohort, clinical presentations included universal fever (100%), dyspnea (50%), cough (40%), respiratory insufficiency (40%), and progression to severe ARDS or respiratory failure (60%). This pattern aligns with previous reports in pediatric cancer and HSCT populations, where fever, hypoxia, tachypnea, and nonproductive cough are typical. Radiologically, all patients demonstrated diffuse bilateral infiltrates extending from the perihilar region, a characteristic finding that should prompt PJP consideration in high-risk patients.

Laboratory markers have emerged as crucial diagnostic indicators. A comparative study of 40 PJP and 40 non-PJP cases identified decreased lymphocyte counts (particularly CD3+, CD4+, and CD8 + T cells) and elevated serum LDH as significant risk factors. Our data corroborated these findings, with 90% of patients showing lymphocyte counts < 0.7 × 10⁹/L and 60% demonstrating elevated LDH. Notably, all four patients requiring mechanical ventilation had markedly elevated LDH (> 1000U/L), suggesting its potential role as a severity indicator. The AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009 trial similarly reported universal lymphopenia (< 1000/µL) at PJP onset, and Huang et al. confirmed lymphocyte counts < 0.7 × 10⁹/L as a risk factor in non-HIV immunocompromised patients.

### Risk factors associated with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in non-HIV immunocompromised patients and co-pathogens analysis by metagenomic next-generation sequencing [^fb8237ef]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

There were not specific clinical symptoms of PJP in non-HIV immunocompromised patients and the serum levels of BDG and LDH show inadequate to diagnose PJP. Due to the low positive rate of P. jirovecii detected by traditional microscopy method and the high mixed infections in non-HIV immunocompromised patients, mNGS could be recommended as a PJP diagnosis technique in immunocompromised patients. Non-HIV immunocompromised patients who concomitant use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressant with lymphocyte counts < 0.7 × 10⁹/L need to be vigilant about the occurrence of PJP. Unlike HIV patients, prophylaxis for PJP cannot rely solely on CD4 + T counts < 200 cells/µl in non-HIV immunocompromised patients. CMV was the leading co-pathogens in non-HIV immunocompromised patients with PJP. However, whether CMV infection increases the risk of PJP needs to be confirmed by further research.

### Primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients receiving rituximab [^74f5d8c0]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Although previous studies suggested that rituximab increases the risk of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), it is uncertain whether its primary prophylaxis for PJP is justified.

Research Question

Does the benefit of primary prophylaxis for PJP in patients receiving rituximab treatment outweigh the potential risk of the prophylaxis?

Study Design and Methods

This retrospective study included 3,524 patients (hematologic diseases, 2,500; rheumatic diseases, 559; pre/post-solid organ transplantation, 465) first exposed to rituximab between 2002 and 2018 in a tertiary referral center in South Korea. Patients were classified into a control group (n = 2,523) and a prophylaxis group (n = 1,001) according to the administration of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) during the first 28 days after the start of rituximab (intention-to-treat analysis). In addition, exposure to TMP-SMX was examined as a time-varying variable (time-varying analysis). The primary outcome was the prophylactic effect of TMP-SMX on the 1-year incidence of PJP. Inverse probability of treatment weights was applied to minimize the baseline imbalance. The secondary outcome included the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to TMP-SMX.

Results

Over 2,759.9 person-years, 92 PJP infections occurred, with a mortality rate of 27.2%. The prophylaxis group showed a significantly lower incidence of PJP (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.10–0.42]) than the control group. This result was consistent with the results of time-varying analysis, in which only one PJP infection occurred during TMP-SMX administration (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.01 [0.003–0.16]). The incidence of ADRs related to TMP-SMX was 18.1 (14.6–22.2)/100 person-years, and most were of mild to moderate severity. On the basis of 10 severe ADRs, the number needed to harm was 101 (61.9–261.1), whereas the number needed to prevent one PJP infection was 32 (24.8–39.4).

Interpretation
