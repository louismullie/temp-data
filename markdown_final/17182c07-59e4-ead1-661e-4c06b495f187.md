## Question

Recurrent uti men

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about recurrent urinary tract infections in men. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define recurrent UTI in men and distinguish it from a single episode. Then, I should verify the key risk factors and why recurrences in men are often "complicated" by default. Next, I will review the initial evaluation, including history, exam, urinalysis, culture, and when to image. After that, I need to consider empiric treatment choices and durations, including prostatitis and pyelonephritis scenarios. Then, I should confirm culture-directed adjustments and stewardship steps. Finally, I will examine prevention strategies, special populations, and follow-up, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't mislabel a single episode as recurrent disease. Recurrent UTI in men is generally defined as at least two culture-proven UTIs within 6 months or three within 12 months, recognizing that in men most UTIs are considered complicated by anatomy or function, so the threshold for thorough evaluation is lower than in women with uncomplicated cystitis [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology; I need to check the major risk factors that drive recurrence in men. Prostatic pathology, particularly benign prostatic hyperplasia causing obstruction and urinary stasis, is a leading driver, and addressing obstruction reduces UTI frequency; other contributors include stones, strictures, neurogenic bladder, diabetes, immunosuppression, and prior urologic instrumentation such as transrectal prostate biopsy, with rising fluoroquinolone resistance complicating prophylaxis and treatment choices [^113yacG5] [^112TE65A].

> Next, I should review the initial evaluation and make sure I don't miss a structural or functional nidus. A careful history should quantify episodes, characterize symptoms, and screen for obstructive or neurologic features; the exam should include a focused genitourinary assessment and measurement of postvoid residual to detect retention; urinalysis with microscopy and a midstream urine culture with susceptibilities should be obtained before antibiotics when feasible; given the higher pretest probability of anatomic abnormalities in men, renal ultrasound is reasonable early in the workup, with CT urography or MRI reserved for nonresponders, hematuria, stones, or suspected malignancy, and cystoscopy considered for gross hematuria, stricture, or atypical features [^111P5jJJ].

> Wait, let me verify empiric therapy choices and durations, because overtreatment is common and undertreatment risks progression. For febrile UTI or suspected acute bacterial prostatitis, fluoroquinolones remain common empiric choices given prostatic penetration, with treatment typically 10–14 days, though stewardship and local resistance patterns should guide selection; for afebrile cystitis without systemic features, shorter courses of nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, or fosfomycin may suffice if renal function and local susceptibility allow; in severe illness or sepsis, initial IV therapy with a beta-lactam or a fluoroquinolone is appropriate, with step-down to oral agents when stable [^116wywDX] [^1164PKSN] [^112TE65A].

> I should double-check culture-directed adjustments and avoid therapeutic inertia. Once culture and susceptibilities return, I need to narrow or change therapy accordingly; if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours, I should repeat cultures and reassess for obstruction, abscess, or an alternative diagnosis; in prostatitis or when a nidus is suspected, longer total durations and consideration of source control are prudent, balancing stewardship goals [^116wywDX] [^112TE65A].

> Let me consider prevention carefully, because repeated antibiotics carry collateral damage. Non-antibiotic measures include optimizing bladder emptying to reduce residual urine, treating BPH or other obstructive lesions, increasing fluid intake, and considering methenamine salts when appropriate; when recurrences persist despite these measures, continuous or post-coital antibiotic prophylaxis can be considered, with agents such as nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, or cephalexin chosen based on prior uropathogens and local resistance, and with explicit counseling on risks and monitoring for adverse effects [^116puVk9] [^111tZGmw] [^114rAos1].

> But wait, what if the patient has special circumstances that alter management. In neurogenic bladder or chronic catheter users, UTIs are often complicated and may present atypically; diagnosis should integrate symptoms, pyuria, and bacteriuria rather than relying on culture alone, and prevention hinges on optimized bladder management, catheter care, and selective antibiotic use to avoid resistance; in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, recurrent UTIs warrant evaluation for infected cysts or stones and may require prolonged therapy or procedural source control; in men with chronic pelvic pain syndromes, I need to ensure I exclude persistent or recurrent infection and then pivot to pain-focused care pathways [^114DhFPg] [^1126Xhoi] [^113wC3L1].

> I should confirm follow-up and surveillance so I don't overtest or miss treatment failure. Routine post-treatment test-of-cure in asymptomatic men is not recommended; if symptoms persist beyond 7 days or recur rapidly, I should repeat urinalysis and culture and reassess for obstruction, stones, or alternative diagnoses; documentation of each episode with symptoms, pyuria, and uropathogen helps distinguish relapse from reinfection and guides long-term strategy [^111XL5y9] [^113EKioz].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to apply the same "do not routinely image" stance from women's uncomplicated rUTI guidelines to men, but that would be a mistake; I should correct that. Unlike women with recurrent uncomplicated cystitis, men with recurrent UTIs have a higher likelihood of structural or functional abnormalities, so early imaging with renal ultrasound and selective use of CT urography or MRI is appropriate, particularly with nonresponse, hematuria, stones, or atypical features, aligning with radiology appropriateness criteria and urologic practice patterns [^111Gwyks].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, reference-aligned approach: define recurrence with culture-based criteria, identify and treat underlying drivers like obstruction or stones, obtain cultures before antibiotics when safe, tailor empiric therapy to severity and local resistance, escalate evaluation promptly if treatment fails, prioritize non-antibiotic prevention, and reserve prophylaxis for carefully selected patients after shared decision-making, all while documenting episodes rigorously to guide longitudinal care [^116wywDX] [^112TE65A] [^111tZGmw].

---

Recurrent UTIs in men are defined as **≥ 2 culture-proven UTIs in 6 months or ≥ 3 in 12 months** [^notfound] and are uncommon, often signaling an underlying anatomic or functional abnormality [^notfound]. Evaluation should include a **focused history, exam, urinalysis, and culture** [^113gEoge]; if abnormalities are suspected, obtain renal ultrasound or CT [^111Gwyks], and consider cystoscopy for hematuria or stricture risk [^111P5jJJ]. Management treats the acute episode with culture-directed antibiotics [^116wywDX] and addresses the cause — such as obstruction, stones, or prostatitis — to prevent recurrence [^113yacG5]. Non-antibiotic prevention (e.g. methenamine, cranberry, D-mannose) is reasonable [^111kzGSH]; reserve antibiotic prophylaxis for select cases after shared decision-making [^1166XZJb]. Persistent or complex cases warrant urology referral [^notfound].

---

## Definition and epidemiology

Recurrent UTI in men is defined as **≥ 2 culture-proven UTIs in 6 months or ≥ 3 in 12 months** [^notfound]. UTIs are less common in men than women, and recurrence is unusual, often indicating an underlying abnormality [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors contribute to **recurrent UTIs in men**:

- **Anatomic abnormalities**: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), urethral strictures, vesicoureteral reflux, and congenital anomalies [^113yacG5].
- **Functional abnormalities**: Neurogenic bladder, detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, and chronic urinary retention [^notfound].
- **Instrumentation**: Recent urologic procedures, catheterization, or cystoscopy [^113yacG5].
- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, and chronic kidney disease [^notfound].
- **Lifestyle factors**: Poor hydration, inadequate hygiene, and sexual activity [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough evaluation is essential to identify underlying causes and guide management:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Detailed history and physical examination | Identify symptoms, risk factors, and comorbidities [^113LgLaa] |
| 2 | Urinalysis and urine culture with sensitivity | Confirm infection and guide antibiotic therapy [^113gEoge] |
| 3 | Renal ultrasound or CT scan | Detect structural abnormalities (stones, obstruction, tumors) [^111Gwyks] |
| 4 | Cystoscopy | Evaluate for urethral strictures, bladder tumors, or other mucosal abnormalities [^111P5jJJ] |
| 5 | Post-void residual measurement | Assess for urinary retention [^117SwQTq] |

---

## Management strategies

### Acute treatment

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be guided by local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors; common agents include **fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole** [^1164PKSN]. Therapy should be adjusted to culture results to ensure targeted therapy [^117H4oaD]. Treatment duration is typically 7–14 days, depending on the severity and site of infection [^116wywDX].

---

### Addressing underlying causes

- **Obstruction**: Surgical or medical management of BPH, urethral strictures, or stones [^113yacG5].
- **Prostatitis**: Longer antibiotic courses (4–6 weeks) and alpha-blockers for chronic prostatitis [^notfound].
- **Neurogenic bladder**: Intermittent catheterization, anticholinergic medications, or botulinum toxin injections [^notfound].
- **Instrumentation**: Minimize catheter use and maintain strict aseptic technique [^notfound].

---

### Preventive measures

- **Non-antibiotic prophylaxis**: Methenamine salts, cranberry products, and D-mannose may reduce recurrence [^1171guRo].
- **Antibiotic prophylaxis**: Reserved for select patients after shared decision-making due to resistance and adverse effects [^1166XZJb].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Increased fluid intake, improved hygiene, and regular bladder emptying [^116puVk9].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor recurrence, assess treatment response, and adjust management. Repeat **urine cultures** are indicated for persistent or recurrent symptoms [^113EKioz]. Ongoing evaluation for underlying abnormalities should continue until the cause is identified and addressed [^notfound].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Urology referral is indicated for:

- Persistent or complex recurrent UTIs despite appropriate management [^notfound].
- Suspected structural or functional abnormalities requiring surgical intervention [^notfound].
- Complicated cases involving stones, tumors, or neurogenic bladder [^notfound].

---

Recurrent UTIs in men are uncommon and often indicate an underlying abnormality. A **comprehensive evaluation and targeted management** — addressing both infection and causative factors — are essential to prevent recurrence and complications [^notfound].

### Updates in clinical management of recurrent urinary tract infections [^1171guRo]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and burdensome in women. Here, we discuss challenges with our current models of care and how evolving insights into the female urogenital microbiome have advanced the understanding of how we diagnose, treat, and prevent recurrent UTIs in nonpregnant adult women. Traditional care models attribute recurrent UTIs mainly to gastrointestinal sources, resulting in significant emphasis on eradicating pathogens with potential overreliance on antibiotics. Evidence now shows that the bladder harbors a complex microbiome, with interactions between the urinary and vaginal environments and immune mechanisms at the bladder mucosal surface influencing infection susceptibility. Thus, in updated models of care, more emphasis is placed on enhancing the protective microbiome. This may be especially important in postmenopausal women, who experience microbiome shifts that increase vulnerability to recurrent infections, underscoring the role of estrogen therapy and microbiome-supportive interventions. Updated treatment approaches emphasize antimicrobial stewardship, advocating for confirmation of the diagnosis and delayed antibiotic initiation when safe, and judicious use of antibiotics for symptom relief. Prevention strategies highlight the importance of vaginal estrogen, methenamine salts, and other supplements rather than exclusive reliance on prophylactic antibiotics. Ongoing research into emerging therapies such as UTI vaccines and bacteriophage drugs may further decrease our reliance on antibiotics in the future. This clinical update underscores the need for individualized care plans that balance effective infection management while minimizing antibiotic-related harms, emphasizing a holistic, microbiome-centered approach to recurrent UTI prevention and treatment.

Over 50% of adult women experience at least 1 urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and almost one-quarter of them will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI). Recurrent UTI is defined as ≥ 2 UTIs in a 6-month period or ≥ 3 UTIs in 12 months (at least 1 of these episodes should be culture-proven to confirm infectious etiology). In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment considerations for recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in the adult female population. We provide a focused overview of the comprehensive management of these patients, with input from infectious disease physicians, urogynecologists, and urologists with expertise in rUTI, highlighting updated recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Urologic Association, Canadian Urologic Association, and American Urogynecologic Society. Finally, given the variety of prevention strategies, different treatment goals, and the need for "preference sensitive" decisions, we highlight the need for shared decision-making with patients.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^116Nr2Uk]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — episode timing and management considerations indicate that episodes do not need to be in the immediate six months preceding presentation, and that recurrence burden should guide prophylaxis; expectant management may be less appropriate than active prophylaxis in an individual who has received more than three to four therapeutic courses of antibiotics in the past year. Patients with a long culture-proven history at lower-than-definition frequency (two episodes within six months within the previous year) may also be appropriate to include under the rUTI umbrella, and patients consistently presenting with one to two symptomatic infections per year for multiple years will likely benefit from a more proactive management strategy similar to that for rUTI.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113gEoge]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in women: Clinicians should obtain urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity with each symptomatic acute cystitis episode prior to initiating treatment in patients with rUTIs. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) Although no randomized, prospective studies were identified that were specifically designed to document direct effects of procuring urinalysis and urine culture with antibiotic sensitivities prior to initiating treatment, the bulk of observational data supports the comprehensive laboratory diagnostic evaluation of each episode (e.g., urinalysis and standard urine culture), and every effort should be made to obtain urinalysis, microbiological identification, and antimicrobial resistance patterns to confirm the diagnosis and follow clinical responses to management; the routine prescription of antibiotics based on patient symptoms without microbiological evaluation should be discouraged, and independent evaluation of each symptomatic episode not only allows for the modification of treatment plans as needed to address atypical or antimicrobial-resistant bacteria but will also help to identify those patients with one of the numerous alternative diagnoses who would benefit from a different approach to treatment.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^114AqSwd]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This document seeks to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life by reducing recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) events.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized to inform this guideline was conducted by a methodology team at the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center. A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through December 2017) and Embase (through January 16, 2018). An update literature search was conducted on September 20, 2018.

Results

When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such evidence-based statements are provided as Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Conclusions

Our ability to diagnose, treat, and manage rUTI long-term has evolved due to additional insights into the pathophysiology of rUTI, a new appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobial therapy, rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and better reporting of the natural history and clinical outcomes of acute cystitis and rUTI. As new data continue to emerge in this space, this document will undergo review to ensure continued accuracy.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^114TV6QX]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are more common in women and are frequently defined as ≥ 2 episodes in the last 6 months or ≥ 3 episodes in the last 12 months. In a primary care setting, 53% of women above the age of 55 years and 36% of younger women report a recurrence within 1 year. Thus, management and prevention of recurrent UTI is of utmost significance. This review aims to highlight the latest research in prevention strategies and suggest a management pathway.

Methods

A search was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases for the latest systematic reviews and high-quality randomized controlled trials. Special emphasis was placed on the remit "recurrent" and strongly adhered to. Furthermore, a Google search was conducted for current guidelines on the management of UTIs.

Results

Current prevention strategies include eliminating risk factors that increase the risk of acquiring recurrent UTI and continuous, post-coital and self-initiated antimicrobial prophylaxis. Other prospective preventative strategies, currently under trial, include use of vaccinations, D-mannose and lactobacillus (probiotics).

Conclusion

Although risk factors should be identified and addressed accordingly, individualized antibiotic prophylaxis remains the most effective method of management. Non-antibiotic prevention strategies such as cranberry, vitamin C and methenamine salts lack strong evidence to be introduced as routine management options and as alternatives to antibiotics. Based on current evidence and guidelines, a management pathway is recommended. Emerging therapies require further evaluation before they can be recommended.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113EKioz]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Follow-up evaluation in recurrent urinary tract infection — clinicians should repeat urine cultures to guide further management when UTI symptoms persist following antimicrobial therapy (Expert Opinion). After initiating antimicrobial therapy for UTI, clinical cure is expected within three to seven days, and it is reasonable to repeat microbiological assessment if UTI symptoms persist beyond seven days. Although a second antibiotic can be given empirically, this should only be done after a urine sample is obtained to minimize unnecessary treatment when laboratory data is inconsistent with persistent infection.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114xto5v]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women (AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline) — scope and purpose: The guideline limits scope to recurrent episodes of localized (restricted to the lower urinary tract) cystitis in women and states that it does not apply to individuals with complicating factors at higher risk for development of UTI or decreased efficacy of therapy, or those with signs or symptoms of systemic bacteremia. Within this document, the term UTI refers to acute bacterial cystitis unless otherwise specified. The stated aims are to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs by reducing recurrence of UTI events.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^111qkLx9]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Follow-up evaluation in recurrent urinary tract infection — for patients with persistent UTI symptoms after microbiological cure, clinicians should evaluate for alternative causes to patient symptoms (Expert Opinion). Clinicians should explore alternative diagnoses for patients who continue to experience persistent lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) after achieving microbiological cure of a UTI, as symptoms may stem from other underlying conditions such as overactive bladder, bladder pain syndrome, pelvic floor disorders or even undiagnosed genitourinary malignancy. Acquired myofascial tension of the pelvic floor musculature, characterized by pelvic pain, urinary frequency/urgency and difficulties voiding, can mimic UTI symptoms but requires a different management approach, and psychological factors such as anxiety or depression may also contribute to LUTS.

### A review for clinical practice in the treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women over age 65 [^113ZsabT]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a pervasive, costly, and dangerous cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, which can lead to further complications if they become recurrent or progress to urosepsis. Recurrent UTI is a particular concern among postmenopausal females because of increased risk factors and decreased estrogen levels, leading to changes in the urogenital epithelium and subsequently causing alterations in the urogenital microbiome. Prevention strategies for recurrent UTIs are often incorporated into patient-centered care plans, but finding the right management can be difficult for older women since many of the common treatment options have contraindications and adverse side effects. This review aims to describe the diagnosis, treatment, and special considerations for the treatment and prevention of recurrent UTIs in women over 65. Current prevention strategies include both antibiotic and nonantibiotic options. The antibiotic choice for older women presents a few unique challenges, including frequent allergy or intolerance of side effects, renal or liver dysfunction, and polypharmacy or drug interactions. Nonantibiotic options range from readily accessible drugstore remedies to experimental vaccines, which all are accompanied by certain advantages and disadvantages. Appropriate management plans can help to reduce symptoms and poor outcomes among older females. In addition, we hope future studies continue to investigate the proper dosing and routes for optimal management in this aging female population.

### Urinary tract infections and bacterial prostatitis in men [^113yacG5]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to highlight advances in research on urinary tract infections (UTIs) and bacterial prostatitis in men in the preceding year.

Recent Findings

The antiseptic properties of the prostate secretions might be an important factor for prevention of recurrency. Risk factors for UTI in men include prostate enlargement and urological interventions, such as transrectal prostate biopsy. Preventive treatment of prostate enlargement has been demonstrated to reduce frequency of UTI. Ensuing infections after prostate biopsy, such as UTI and bacterial prostatitis, are increasing due to increasing rates of fluoroquinolone resistance. The increasing global antibiotic resistance also significantly affects management of UTI in men, and therefore calls for alternative strategies. Apart from prevention of complicating factors leading to UTI, a more thorough understanding of the pathophysiology may play a more important role in the future, to define new targets for treatment. Interesting results that might interfere with the intracellular mucosal bacterial load in the bladder wall have been found in the last years.

Summary

UTI in men and bacterial prostatitis are currently underrepresented in the medical literature. Increasing antibacterial resistance calls for novel strategies in the prevention and management of UTI and bacterial prostatitis in men.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections in women: diagnosis and management [^111PCAzk]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections, presenting as dysuria or irritative voiding symptoms, are most commonly caused by reinfection with the original bacterial isolate in young, otherwise healthy women with no anatomic or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract. Frequency of sexual intercourse is the strongest predictor of recurrent urinary tract infections in patients presenting with recurrent dysuria. In those who have comorbid conditions or other predisposing factors, recurrent complicated urinary tract infections represent a risk for ascending infection or urosepsis. Escherichia coli is the most common organism in all patient groups, but Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Proteus, and other organisms are more common in patients with certain risk factors for complicated urinary tract infections. A positive urine culture with greater than 102 colony-forming units per mL is the standard for diagnosing urinary tract infections in symptomatic patients, although culture is often unnecessary for diagnosing typical symptomatic infection. Women with recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infections can be treated with continuous or postcoital prophylactic antibiotics; other treatment options include self-started antibiotics, cranberry products, and behavioral modification. Patients at risk of complicated urinary tract infections are best managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics initially, urine culture to guide subsequent therapy, and renal imaging studies if structural abnormalities are suspected.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1132Z6kn]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Our perceptions of recurrent UTI (rUTI) have evolved due to additional insights into rUTI pathophysiology, an appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobials ("collateral damage"), rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance, and better reporting of the natural history of localized cystitis and rUTI. This document seeks to guide the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate antibiotic use, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotics, provide guidance on strategies for rUTI prevention, and improve outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs.

Materials and Methods

In 2024, this Guideline was reviewed via the AUA Update Literature Review process, which identified 87 studies for full-text review published between June 1, 2021 and November 1, 2024. Of those 87 studies, 14 met inclusion criteria for review. The subsequent amendment is based on data released since the last review of this Guideline in 2021.

Results

The Panel developed evidence- and consensus-based statements based on an updated review to provide guidance on evaluation and management of rUTI in women. These updates are detailed herein.

Conclusions

This update provides several new insights, including expansion of non-antibiotic options for UTI prophylaxis, greater understanding of the value of a negative urinalysis in ruling out UTI, and a paradigm shift away from microbial detection to reliance on clinician judgement when weighing the individual risks and benefits of antibiosis. This Guideline will require further review as the diagnostic and treatment options in this space continue to evolve.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1123yACV]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — molecular diagnostics with next-generation sequencing (NGS) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provide broader organism detection and quantitative pathogen load yet currently lack rigorous outcome evidence; preliminary studies show potential benefits but raise concerns about overdiagnosis and limited applicability to atypical presentations. PCR is only able to detect taxa targeted by pre-selected primers, while NGS provides a broader representation of all bacteria present, and PCR can determine the quantitative amount of each pathogen present, while NGS cannot reliably provide a readout of overall bacterial levels, yet these techniques currently lack rigorous evidence that urine multiplex molecular tests improve diagnosis or clinical outcomes. Preliminary evidence includes a small prospective randomized study of men and women with symptoms of acute cystitis (N = 44) in which NGS-guided treatment exhibited greater symptomatic improvement than standard urine culture, a large retrospective analysis where PCR diagnostics were associated with reduced emergency department presentations and fewer subsequent hospitalizations, and randomized trials in women with complicating factors documenting improved outcomes with PCR-based guidance confirming shorter testing times, reduced empiric antibiotic prescribing, and fewer repeat visits. However, these trials involved patients with complicating factors who may differ from women without them and who tend to exhibit higher rates of bacteriuria even without infection, so more sensitive detection methods would be expected to increase overdiagnosis; these findings applied to participants with a high pretest probability of urinary tract infection, and no studies have demonstrated utility of these molecular approaches for atypical presentations such as pelvic pain or chronic lower urinary tract symptoms.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management — men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with complicating factors — empiric management and pyelonephritis exclusions: When empiric therapy of an acute UTI with complicating factors is initiated, treatment should be reevaluated once urine culture and sensitivity results are available; the initial selection of empiric therapy should reflect the patient's individual uropathogen history, current treatment (eg, if currently on UTI suppression antibiotics), and response to prior therapy, and if clinically reasonable, antimicrobial therapy should be delayed pending culture results and organism susceptibility so antimicrobial treatment can be targeted based on the uropathogen profile. For pyelonephritis, several otherwise useful UTI antibiotics are not recommended for acute pyelonephritis treatment, including nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment because of high rates of TMP-SMX resistance, and empirically initiated antibiotics should be refined when the urine culture results are available.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^11285M1j]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment, not diagnosis — describe a clinical syndrome characterized by local bladder signs and symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain, and are defined by absence of findings suggesting infection beyond the bladder: no fever unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or unstable vital signs) unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no flank pain, and no costovertebral angle tenderness. Uncomplicated UTI can occur in females or males, patients with underlying urologic abnormalities, patients with immunocompromise, and persons with diabetes; recurrent UTI can be uncomplicated. Patients with urinary catheters (including transurethral, suprapubic, and intermittent catheterization), stents, and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes generally do not have uncomplicated UTI, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® recurrent lower urinary tract infections in females [^111Gwyks]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women are common, with an overall lifetime risk over > 50%. UTIs are considered recurrent when they follow complete clinical resolution of a previous UTI and are usually defined as at least three episodes of infection within the preceding 12 months. An uncomplicated UTI is classified as a UTI without structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract and without relevant comorbidities. Complicated UTIs are those occurring in patients with underlying structural or medical problems. In women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs, cystoscopy and imaging are not routinely used. In women suspected of having a recurrent complicated UTI, cystoscopy and imaging should be considered. CT urography or MR urography are usually appropriate for the evaluation of recurrent complicated lower urinary tract infections or for women who are nonresponders to conventional therapy, develop frequent reinfections or relapses, or have known underlying risk factors. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Urinary tract infection and neurogenic bladder [^112MV4GD]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent, recurrent, and lifelong for patients with neurogenic bladder and present challenges in diagnosis and treatment. Patients often present without classic symptoms of UTI but with abdominal or back pain, increased spasticity, and urinary incontinence. Failure to recognize and treat infections can quickly lead to life-threatening autonomic dysreflexia or sepsis, whereas overtreatment contributes to antibiotic resistance, thus limiting future treatment options. Multiple prevention methods are used but evidence-based practices are few. Prevention and treatment of symptomatic UTI requires a multimodal approach that focuses on bladder management as well as accurate diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment.

### Quality appraisal of clinical guidelines for recurrent urinary tract infections using AGREE II: a systematic review [^113fyWm7]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections worldwide, being experienced by one in three women at least once in their lifetime. Recurrent UTI is defined as more than three infections per year or more than two infections per 6 months, and it has a significant impact on quality of life, as highlighted by an international web-based survey of 1941 affected women. There is also a significant economic burden due to the costs of preventive strategies and sick leave. Most recurrent UTIs occur in otherwise healthy women who have no structural genitourinary tract abnormalities.

CPGs are defined as "systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate healthcare in specific clinical circumstances" and are developed to optimize and standardize care. The successful implementation of a CPG depends on rigorous development, a clear implementation strategy, and adequate dissemination. Multiple studies across different clinical areas have shown that variability exists in the quality of CPGs, indicating that there is considerable room for improvement, especially in rigour of development and applicability. This is important because diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty can ensue if CPGs differ in core recommendations because of these limitations.

Differences in clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations for the preventive treatment of recurrent UTI have been mentioned previously, but the authors of that report did not assess methodological quality. As a result, diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty might ensue. We could find not a systematic appraisal of the quality of CPGs for the prevention and diagnostics of recurrent UTI in women. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument is often used to assess the methodological quality of CPGs in other areas. We therefore aimed to assess the methodological quality of CPGs for recurrent UTI and to summarize recommendations to help clinical decision makers choose the correct CPG for treatment or diagnostics.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — scope and exclusions specify that for the purposes of this Guideline the Panel considers only recurrent episodes in women of localized cystitis restricted to the lower urinary tract; infections with suspected upper urinary tract or systemic involvement should be managed differently, and in this Guideline the term urinary tract infection (UTI) will refer to acute bacterial cystitis. This Guideline does not specifically consider patients in whom complicating factors may put them at higher risk for decreased treatment efficacy or for progression of a localized UTI to systemic infection, including an anatomic or functional abnormality of the urinary tract such as stone disease, diverticulum, or neurogenic bladder, an immunocompromised host, or urinary foreign bodies such as indwelling urethral catheters or ureteral stents.

### Gaps in knowledge and recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^113BSLEM]. Current Opinion in Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The focus of this review is to present recent literature and gaps in knowledge (GIKs) surrounding the current and future treatment and prevention of uncomplicated recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women.

Recent Findings

Recurrent urinary tract infections are common, significantly reduce quality of life, and create a substantial economic burden to the healthcare system. They are disproportionately affecting the postmenopausal women. Antibiotics, which are used for the treatment and prophylaxis of uncomplicated rUTI, have become problematic, as there is a global rise in allergy and resistance to these agents and their use is associated with further antimicrobial resistance. Thus, in recent decades, several alternative, nonantibiotic approaches have been evaluated.

Summary

There is a critical need for a concerted and standardized methodology for diagnosing, treating, and monitoring women with rUTIs. Additionally, novel nonantibiotic alternative treatment and preventive measures for UTIs are desperately required to address the global issue of antibiotic recalcitrance in all age groups, and specifically older women. Research efforts have sought to develop alternative and more effective techniques; many of which appear to be promising, but require additional evaluation and validation through clinical trials.

CP/CPPS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and it is critical to exclude confusable disorders that may be the source of symptoms; patients with a documented history of UTI should be assessed for persistence or recurrent infection. A complete review of systems should be performed, and in patients where appropriate positive review of symptoms exist, clinicians should consider early referral to other specialties.

### Lack of uniformity among United States recommendations for diagnosis and management of acute, uncomplicated cystitis [^117LnxXk]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Acute, uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most common bacterial infections seen in clinical practice. Quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts to optimize cystitis management rely on clinicians managing patients in a manner recommended by experts and guidelines. However, it is unclear if recent recommendations for cystitis from experts and guidelines from US medical societies that provide recommendations are well aligned.

Methods

We examined recommendations and guidelines for acute, symptomatic cystitis in women published in US medical societies' journals from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2016, within the fields of family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine, female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery, and infectious diseases.

Results

All recommendations endorsed the use of symptoms and urine dipstick to diagnose cystitis. Some societies did not recommend urine dipstick in patients with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), classic UTI symptoms, or a lack of underlying conditions or competing diagnoses. All endorsed nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line agents. Some guidelines classified fluoroquinolones as second- or third-line, while others considered them first-line treatment for UTI. Avoiding use of amoxicillin and ampicillin, antibiotic agents with high prevalence of resistance in the US, was recommended by some societies.

Conclusions

US recommendations differed in their approach to the treatment of acute, uncomplicated cystitis. Lack of uniformity likely contributes to clinical management variance for patients with UTI and hampers quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts aimed at promoting optimal management. Our findings emphasize the need for more consistent recommendations for cystitis management.

### Latin American consensus on uncomplicated recurrent urinary tract infection-2018 [^112UM7hm]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

An estimated 20–30% of adult women who experience an initial urinary tract infection (UTI) will have recurrent infection. In these patients, prophylaxis may be considered to improve their quality of life and control overuse of antibiotics. Despite this need, there is currently no Latin American consensus on the treatment and prophylaxis of recurrent UTIs. This consensus, signed by a panel of regional and international experts on UTI management, aims to address this need and is the first step toward a Latin American consensus on a number of urogynecological conditions. The panel agrees that antibiotics should be considered the primary treatment option for symptomatic UTI, taking into account local pathogen resistance patterns. Regarding prophylaxis, immunoactive therapy with the bacterial lysate OM-89 received a grade A recommendation and local estrogen in postmenopausal women grade B recommendation. Lower-grade recommendations include behavior modification and D-mannose; probiotics (Lactobacilli), cranberries, and hyaluronic acid (and derivatives) received limited recommendations; their use should be discussed with the patient. Though considered effective and receiving grade A recommendation, antimicrobial prophylaxis should be considered only following prophylaxis with effective non-antimicrobial measures that were not successful and chosen based on the frequency of sexual intercourse and local pathogen resistance patterns.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) — contamination suspicion and contaminants management: Contamination should be suspected when a specimen shows growth of normal vaginal flora, mixed cultures containing more than one organism, or low quantities (i.e., < 10³ CFU/mL) of a pathogenic organism in an asymptomatic patient; growth of organisms thought to be contaminants generally do not require treatment, and when there is high suspicion for contamination, clinicians can consider obtaining a catheterized specimen for further evaluation prior to treatment.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in women; more than 50% of women will be diagnosed with a UTI in her lifetime. Many of these women will go on to develop recurrent UTI. Nevertheless, evidence-based prevention of recurrent UTI is under-utilized. Here, the authors provide detailed practical advice on UTI prevention with a thorough review of the evidence. Non-antibiotic prevention measures discussed include increased fluid intake, vaginal estrogen therapy, methenamine, and cranberry. Antibiotic prophyalxis for carefully selected patients is also discussed.

Self-treatment with antibiotics for recurrent UTI — Self-treatment can be paired with standing physician orders for urine culture before and possibly after treatment, but compared with continuous prophylaxis it is associated with a higher rate of infection (2.2 UTI per year vs 0.2 UTI per year). Self-treatment is an option for women with the ability to reliably recognize UTI symptoms and start antibiotics, those not suitable for long-term prophylaxis, or those who do not wish to take long-term therapy, and patients should contact their clinician if symptoms progress or fail to resolve within 48 hours. Fluoroquinolones are not preferred agents for self-treatment regimens, and we recommend use of other agents whenever possible.

### Guidelines for the management of male urinary tract infections in primary care: a lack of international consensus-a systematic review of the literature [^1164PKSN]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of adult male urinary tract infections (mUTIs) in primary care lacks international consensus. The main objective of this study was to describe the different guidelines for the diagnosis and management of mUTIs in primary care, to assess their methodological quality, and to describe their evidence-based strength of recommendation (SoR).

Methods

An international systematic literature review of the electronic databases Medline (PubMed) and EMBASE, and gray-literature guideline-focused databases was performed in 2021. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) assessment tool was used by 2 independent reviewers to appraise each guideline.

Results

From 1,678 records identified, 1,558 were screened, 134 assessed for eligibility, and 29 updated guidelines met the inclusion criteria (13 from Medline, 0 from EMBASE, and 16 from gray literature). Quality assessment revealed 14 (48%) guidelines with high-quality methodology. A grading system methodology was used in 18 (62%) guidelines. Different classifications of mUTIs are described, underlining a lack of international consensus: an anatomic classification (cystitis, prostatitis, pyelonephritis) and a symptomatic classification (approach based on the intensity and tolerance of symptoms). The duration of antibiotic treatment for febrile mUTIs has been gradually reduced over the last 20 years from 28 days to 10–14 days of fluoroquinolones (FQ), which has become the international gold standard. Guidelines from Scandinavian countries propose short courses (3–5 days) of FQ-sparing treatments: pivmecillinam, nitrofurantoin, or trimethoprim. Guidelines from French-speaking countries use a watchful waiting approach and suggest treating mUTIs with FQ, regardless of fever.

Conclusions

This lack of scientific evidence leads to consensus and disagreement: 14 days of FQ for febrile mUTIs is accepted despite a high risk of antimicrobial resistance, but FQ-sparing treatment and/or short treatment for afebrile mUTIs is not. The definition of afebrile UTIs/cystitis is debated and influences the type and duration of antibiotic treatment recommended.

Short-course therapy for uncomplicated acute UTI — Three-day regimens of TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones have comparable effectiveness with 79%–100% and 85%–98% cure rates and are widely accepted when there are no complicating factors. These regimens are as effective for symptomatic relief as longer 5- to 10-day regimens and have improved compliance, decreased costs, and lower adverse reaction rates. The efficacy of 5 days of nitrofurantoin is comparable to 3 days of TMP-SMX, and five days of nitrofurantoin has better efficacy than a 3-day regimen.

Recurrent urinary tract infection guideline methods — risk of bias assessment describes independent assessment with predefined criteria, rating studies as "low risk of bias", "medium risk of bias", or "high risk of bias", and evaluating systematic reviews using AMSTAR 2; "low risk of bias" studies are generally considered valid, "medium risk of bias" studies are susceptible to some bias but not necessarily enough to invalidate results, while "high risk of bias" studies have significant flaws that may invalidate results, were considered less reliable than low or medium risk studies, and were excluded in sensitivity analyses to gauge impact.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — antibiotic prophylaxis evidence synthesis: the systematic review identified 28 trials evaluating antibiotics for prevention of rUTI, most were rated as medium to high risk of bias, and sample sizes ranged from 26 to 308 (total N = 2,758). These trials demonstrated that antibiotics perform better than placebo with consistent results across antibiotics, and the duration of preventive treatment ranged from 6 to 12 months. When comparing prophylactic antibiotic use to placebo or no antibiotics, antibiotics were associated with a decreased likelihood of experiencing ≥ 1 UTI recurrence (11 studies; RR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.37; I² = 14%; absolute risk difference [ARD]: −46%, 95% CI: −56% to −37%). Because most relevant randomized controlled trials were published prior to 1995, results should be interpreted in light of current resistance patterns.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — cystoscopy and upper tract imaging should not be routinely obtained in the index patient presenting with rUTI (Expert Opinion), supported by low diagnostic yield data: in a single-institutional cohort of 163 women, cystoscopy identified only 9 clinically significant cases and only five were uniquely identified, and intravenous urography (IVU) was normal in 91.7% with only 5.5% positive IVUs among 164 female patients without management change; cystoscopy is not necessary for gross hematuria with a positive urine culture and no risk factors for urothelial malignancy, but if any risk factors are present cystoscopy should be performed, and further evaluation for bladder cancer should be performed with gross hematuria without documented infection; higher yield may occur in "high-risk" presentations (gross or persistent microscopic hematuria, pyelonephritis, atypical presentation), and for any patient with suspicion for pyelonephritis, or history of hematuria or renal calculi, upper tract imaging is recommended.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — repeat testing for suspected contamination (Clinical Principle) advises that clinicians should obtain repeat urine studies when an initial specimen is suspect for contamination, with consideration for obtaining a catheterized specimen. Establishing infection requires linking acute-onset symptoms to laboratory evidence including pyuria ≥ 5 WBC/hpf on microscopic urinalysis and uropathogenic bacteria, and contamination with skin and vaginal bacteria can occur, supporting repeat or catheterized specimens when contamination is suspected.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — antibiotic resistance risk after antibiotic exposure is supported by a meta-analysis: "In 5 studies of urinary tract bacteria (14,348 participants), the pooled odds ratio for resistance was 2.5 (95% CI: 2.1 to 2.9) within 2 months of antibiotic treatment and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.2 to 1.5) within 12 months". The authors note persistence and population impact, as "The effect is greatest in the month immediately after treatment but may persist for up to 12 months", and "even transient use of antibiotics can affect the carriage of resistant organisms and impact the endemic level of resistance in the population".

Recurrent urinary tract infection — diagnostic criteria and documentation (Clinical Principle) states that clinicians should document evidence of inflammation (pyuria) and uropathogenic bacteria during symptomatic episodes, defining recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) as at least two acute episodes in six months of urinary tract–associated symptoms and signs. Evidence of infection should include significant bacteriuria and urinary inflammation (pyuria with ≥ 5 WBC/hpf on microscopic urinalysis), and the absence of pyuria rules out UTI in symptomatic women with confirmed bacteriuria. Documentation of bacterial uropathogens during each symptomatic period is critical, and inconsistent bacteriuria or organisms should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses; given limitations of standard urine culture, clinicians should consider additional available information, including alternative tests, with critical deliberation, and it is important to consider all clinical and laboratory data when deciding whether antibiotic treatment is needed.

### The urobiome in men and women: a clinical review [^111GEQ15]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotic therapy alone is unable to control recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI); uropathogens have become multiresistant, and alternative strategies are needed. Far from sterile, the urinary tract contains various low-biomass microbiota, some of whose members appear to protect against clinical UTI.

Objectives

This narrative review summarizes (a) the current knowledge of male and female urobiomes in healthy and diseased states, as well as their interplay among sexual partners and (b) clinical trials to date assessing probiotic and other nonantibiotic measures to reduce UTI.

Sources

We used the PubMed interface to search Ovid Medline for articles describing urogenital flora, UTI, UTI dysbiosis, the effects of sexual intercourse on urogenital flora, and clinical trials of probiotics as UTI prophylaxis.

Content

The healthy urobiome of women contains several Lactobacillus species, some of which may impede Escherichia coli growth in the urinary tract. Although Lactobacilli have been found in male urethral microbiota, their presence in male bladder microbiota is less certain. Distal male urethral and vaginal microbiomes of male and sexual female partners influence one another, but more research is needed on the direct interplay of their full urobiomes. Clinical trials assessing the therapeutic potential of Lactobacilli have been largely underpowered and highly varied in tested formulations and routes and frequencies of administration; as such, they have failed to show a clear benefit. Faecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection was shown, in a retrospective study of seven patients, to reduce recurrent UTI as a side effect.

Implications

The urobiome in men and women is complex, variable, and still understudied. Although there is hope that Lactobacilli and faecal microbial transplantation could be future nonantibiotic options for recurrent UTI, both require more pharmacologic and clinical research to identify optimal preparations and routes of administration.
