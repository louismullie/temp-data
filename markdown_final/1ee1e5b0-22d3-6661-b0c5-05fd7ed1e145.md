## Question

26-year-old woman with meningococcemia presenting with meningitis signs, petechiae/purpura, leukocytosis, and septic shock; asks which cytokine is involved in septic shock pathogenesis.

A 26-year-old woman developed rapidly progressive septic shock associated with nuchal rigidity, petechiae, and purpura. She tested positive for both Kernig and Brudzinski's signs and shows signs of confusion, dyspnea, and hypotension. The blood culture results confirmed the presence of Neisseria meningitidis, and a complete blood count (CBC) revealed leukocytosis. Which one of the cytokines below takes part in the pathogenesis of septic shock?

Answer Choices:
A. Tumor necrosis factor-α
B. Interleukin-5
C. Interleukin-12
D. Interleukin-4

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which cytokine among the given options is involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock in meningococcemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of septic shock and the canonical cytokine cascade. Then, I should verify which of the listed cytokines are central drivers versus bystanders or anti-inflammatory. Next, I will consider disease-specific context for Neisseria meningitidis and whether that changes the answer. Finally, I will eliminate incorrect options and confirm the best choice with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: meningococcemia with septic shock reflects invasive Gram-negative sepsis with endotoxin-driven systemic inflammation, vascular leak, and hypotension. The key mediator cascade in Gram-negative sepsis is LPS → TLR4 → MyD88/TRIF → NF-κB → TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and downstream effectors that drive shock physiology, so I should anchor on that pathway before considering alternatives [^notfound].

> Now, I need to check each option against established pro-inflammatory drivers of septic shock. TNF-α is a prototypical early cytokine in septic shock pathogenesis, with robust evidence linking it to vascular permeability, coagulopathy, and hemodynamic collapse in sepsis. This aligns with the canonical model of endotoxin-induced shock and with clinical observations of TNF-α elevation in severe infections, so Option A is strongly supported [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the distractors. IL-5 is a Th2 cytokine primarily involved in eosinophil recruitment and allergic responses; it is not a recognized driver of septic shock pathogenesis, so I should exclude Option B. IL-4 is also a Th2 cytokine with anti-inflammatory and Th2-polarizing effects; it does not drive the pro-inflammatory cascade of septic shock, so Option D should be excluded as well [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about IL-12. IL-12 is indeed a pro-inflammatory cytokine that promotes Th1 immunity and IFN-γ production, and it can be elevated in some infections, but it is not considered a central mediator of septic shock pathogenesis compared with TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. Moreover, in COVID-19 cohorts, higher IL-12 levels were actually seen in milder disease rather than severe disease, which argues against IL-12 being a principal driver of shock physiology in systemic inflammatory syndromes, so Option C is less appropriate here [^8340883a].

> I should double-check whether any of the provided references directly tie IL-12 to septic shock. The documents repeatedly emphasize IL-12's role in Th1 polarization, antitumor immunity, and autoimmune inflammation, and they detail IL-12/23 blockade in psoriasis and IBD, but they do not establish IL-12 as a core mediator of septic shock; by contrast, TNF-α is consistently listed among pro-inflammatory mediators of cell-mediated immunity and sepsis biology, reinforcing that TNF-α is the correct choice in this context [^b854a5d3] [^33b7ae47].

> Putting this together, the most accurate answer is Tumor necrosis factor-α, because it is a foundational upstream cytokine in the endotoxin-driven shock cascade in Gram-negative sepsis, whereas IL-5 and IL-4 are Th2/anti-inflammatory skewing cytokines and IL-12, though pro-inflammatory, is not the central driver of septic shock pathogenesis in this setting [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **TNF-α** because it is a central mediator of septic shock pathogenesis in meningococcemia, driving endothelial injury, vascular leak, and multiorgan failure via TLR4/NF-κB signaling [^notfound]. IL-12 and IL-4 are not primary mediators of septic shock, and IL-5 is not involved in this pathway.

## Pathophysiology of septic shock in meningococcemia

Meningococcemia causes **septic shock** through rapid bacterial dissemination and endotoxin release, triggering a dysregulated innate immune response with cytokine storm, endothelial injury, and vascular collapse [^510a482b]. The key steps include:

- **Bacterial invasion**: Neisseria meningitidis invades the bloodstream, releasing lipooligosaccharide (LOS), a potent endotoxin [^510a482b].
- **Endotoxin recognition**: LOS binds TLR4 on innate immune cells, activating NF-κB and MAPK pathways [^notfound].
- **Cytokine cascade**: This induces pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) that drive endothelial activation, vascular leak, and shock [^notfound].

---

## Role of TNF-α in septic shock

TNF-α is a **central mediator** of septic shock in meningococcemia:

- **Early mediator**: TNF-α is rapidly produced after endotoxin exposure and initiates the cytokine cascade [^notfound].
- **Endothelial injury**: TNF-α upregulates adhesion molecules, increases vascular permeability, and promotes microthrombi, causing DIC and organ failure [^notfound].
- **Hemodynamic effects**: TNF-α causes vasodilation, capillary leak, and myocardial depression, contributing to refractory shock [^notfound].
- **Clinical correlation**: Elevated TNF-α correlates with disease severity and mortality in septic shock [^notfound].

---

## Other cytokines and their roles

| **Cytokine** | **Role in septic shock** |
|-|-|
| IL-1β | - Pro-inflammatory <br/> - Induces fever <br/> - Endothelial activation <br/> - Contributes to shock [^notfound] |
| IL-6 | - Acute-phase response <br/> - Lymphocyte apoptosis <br/> - Contributes to immunosuppression [^notfound] |
| IL-8 | - Chemokine <br/> - Neutrophil recruitment <br/> - Contributes to tissue damage [^notfound] |
| IL-10 | - Anti-inflammatory <br/> - Limits tissue damage <br/> - But contributes to immunosuppression [^notfound] |

---

## Why not IL-12, IL-4, or IL-5?

- **IL-12**: Primarily drives Th1 differentiation and IFN-γ production; not a direct mediator of endothelial injury or shock physiology [^notfound].
- **IL-4**: A Th2 cytokine that opposes pro-inflammatory pathways; not implicated in septic shock [^notfound].
- **IL-5**: Involved in eosinophil recruitment; not relevant to septic shock pathogenesis [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications

Understanding TNF-α's role explains why **anti-TNF therapies** have been explored in septic shock, though results are mixed and not standard care. It also underscores the need for rapid antibiotics, hemodynamic support, and organ support in meningococcemia [^cbeba1b6].

---

TNF-α is the **primary cytokine** involved in septic shock pathogenesis in meningococcemia, driving endothelial injury, vascular collapse, and multiorgan failure via TLR4/NF-κB signaling [^notfound].

Collectively, if these local mechanisms to suppress IL12 activity act similarly in humans, knowledge derived from these integrated wet and dry-lab studies could be used to stratify patients based on the prevalence of specific cross-talk mechanisms present within the tumor and guide selecting patient-specific immunotherapies. In a clinical trial setting, mechanism-based biomarkers that stratify patient populations could be used to improve the statistical power of less expensive clinical trials. In an adjuvant setting, mitigating these cross-talk mechanisms in conjunction with immune checkpoint modulators could expand the differential therapeutic window between productive local anti-tumor immunity and toxic peripheral effects due to auto-immunity, thereby broadening the clinical benefit of existing immunotherapies.

The discovery of interleukin (IL)-6 and its receptor subunits provided a foundation to understand the biology of a group of related cytokines: IL-12, IL-23, and IL-27. These family members utilize shared receptors and cytokine subunits and influence the outcome of cancer, infection, and inflammatory diseases. Consequently, many facets of their biology are being therapeutically targeted. Here, we review the landmark discoveries in this field, the combinatorial biology inherent to this family, and how patient datasets have underscored the critical role of these pathways in human disease. We present significant knowledge gaps, including how similar signals from these cytokines can mediate distinct outcomes, and discuss how a better understanding of the biology of the IL-12 family provides new therapeutic opportunities.

### Interleukin-12: biological properties and clinical application [^ef190450]. Clinical Cancer Research (2007). Low credibility.

Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a heterodimeric protein, first recovered from EBV-transformed B cell lines. It is a multifunctional cytokine, the properties of which bridge innate and adaptive immunity, acting as a key regulator of cell-mediated immune responses through the induction of T helper 1 differentiation. By promoting IFN-gamma production, proliferation, and cytolytic activity of natural killer and T cells, IL-12 induces cellular immunity. In addition, IL-12 induces an antiangiogenic program mediated by IFN-gamma-inducible genes and by lymphocyte-endothelial cell cross-talk. The immunomodulating and antiangiogenic functions of IL-12 have provided the rationale for exploiting this cytokine as an anticancer agent. In contrast with the significant antitumor and antimetastatic activity of IL-12, documented in several preclinical studies, clinical trials with IL-12, used as a single agent, or as a vaccine adjuvant, have shown limited efficacy in most instances. More effective application of this cytokine, and of newly identified IL-12 family members (IL-23 and IL-27), should be evaluated as therapeutic agents with considerable potential in cancer patients.

The interleukin 12 (IL-12) family is unique in having the only heterodimeric cytokines, including IL-12, IL-23, IL-27 and IL-35. This feature endows these cytokines with a unique set of connections and functional interactions not shared by other cytokine families. Despite sharing many structural features and molecular partners, cytokines of the IL-12 family mediate surprisingly diverse functional effects. Here we discuss the unique and unusual structural and functional characteristics of this cytokine family. We outline how cells might interpret seemingly similar cytokine signals to give rise to the diverse functional outcomes that characterize this cytokine family. We also discuss the therapeutic implications of this complexity.

Introduction

Tumor-induced immune suppression is recognized as an important mechanism by which tumors evade immune-mediated detection and destruction. A number of strategies to overcome this suppression have been evaluated, but local IL-12 expression consistently appears to be one of the most effective methods to achieve this due to its central role in T- and NK-cell-mediated inflammatory responses –. Unfortunately, clinical application of IL-12-based therapies remains problematic due to the potential for rapid development of lethal inflammatory syndrome –. The development of strategies to overcome IL-12-mediated toxicity is currently the subject of intense research and a number of modifications to IL-12 have been explored. Most recently, tumor-targeted oncolytic adenoviral (AdV) delivery of membrane-anchored IL-12 variants was analyzed in the context of efficacy against metastatic pancreatic cancer. However, delivery of therapeutically effective doses of AdV resulted in membrane saturation of IL-12, leading to release into the serum and subsequent toxicity. More promising drug-inducible IL-12 systems allow easier management of IL-12 levels over long periods, resulting in a reasonable degree of clinical efficacy. However, inefficient transduction of tumor cells with carrier vectors and the lack of simultaneous induction of inflammation currently limits the overall anti-tumor effect of this approach.

Interleukin 12 (IL-12) is central to the orchestration of cell-mediated immune responses in the innate as well as the adaptive immune system. Recent studies of the pathogenesis of diseases as disparate as measles and asthma have suggested that the complement system, itself at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity, is a biologically relevant regulator of IL-12 production. These data are reviewed here.

Interleukin-12

The IL-12 family comprises unique heterodimeric cytokines that include IL-12, IL-23, IL-27 and IL-35. The heterodimeric 70 kDa biologically active form of IL-12 (p35–p40) is composed of two independently produced subunits, α (IL12p35) and β (IL12p40), linked by disulphide bonds. The α subunit (IL12p35) shares sequence homology with IL-6 and can also be part of IL-23 (p19–p40), whereas the β subunit (IL12p40) is shared with IL-35 (p35/Ebi3).

IL-12 is mainly produced by activated antigen-presenting cells such as DCs, macrophages, monocytes and B cells. IL-12 production is a tightly controlled process, regulated mainly at the transcriptional level. Production is initiated by activation of pathogen recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors in antigen-presenting cells upon sensing of pathogen-associated molecular patterns) or damage-associated molecular patterns. In addition, cytokine stimulation and direct immune cell–cell contact, including CD40–CD40L interactions, induce IL-12 production. This latter CD40-dependent mechanism is likely to be the principal mechanism for the production of IL-12 in cancer. IL-12 binds to the IL-12 receptor (IL-12R), expressed as a high-affinity heterodimer of IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12Rβ2 subunits mostly on T cells and NK cells. The β1 subunit is constitutively expressed on immune cells, whereas the β2 subunit is upregulated in T cells and NK cells upon activation.

In addition, "Treatment may be switched to an IL-17i biologic instead of a TNFi biologic if the patient has severe psoriasis or a contraindication to TNFi biologic treatment". For partial response or TNFi contraindications while on IL-12/23i, "MTX may be added to the current IL-12/23i biologic therapy instead of switching to a TNFi or an IL-17i biologic in patients with a partial response to the current therapy; MTX may also be added to the current IL-12/23i biologic therapy instead of switching to a TNFi biologic in the presence of contraindications to TNFi biologics".

### IL-12p40: an inherently agonistic cytokine [^14bcaeff]. Trends in Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

IL-12p40 is known as a component of the bioactive cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 but it is not widely recognized as having intrinsic functional activity. Recent publications have altered this perception and support an independent role for IL-12p40. IL-12p40 is induced in excess over the other subunits of IL-12 and IL-23 and can exist in a monomeric or homodimeric form. Its most widely appreciated function is to provide a negative feedback loop by competitively binding to the IL-12 receptor. However, IL-12p40 acts as a chemoattractant for macrophages and promotes the migration of bacterially stimulated dendritic cells. It is associated with several pathogenic inflammatory responses such as silicosis, graft rejection and asthma but it is also protective in a mycobacterial model. An appreciation of the independent function of IL-12p40 is important for improving our understanding of both protective and pathogenic immune responses.

### Interleukin 12 (IL-12) family cytokines: role in immune pathogenesis and treatment of CNS autoimmune disease [^76b583f6]. Cytokine (2015). Low credibility.

Cytokines play crucial roles in coordinating the activities of innate and adaptive immune systems. In response to pathogen recognition, innate immune cells secrete cytokines that inform the adaptive immune system about the nature of the pathogen and instruct naïve T cells to differentiate into the appropriate T cell subtypes required to clear the infection. These include Interleukins, Interferons and other immune-regulatory cytokines that exhibit remarkable functional redundancy and pleiotropic effects. The focus of this review, however, is on the enigmatic Interleukin 12 (IL-12) family of cytokines. This family of cytokines plays crucial roles in shaping immune responses during antigen presentation and influence cell-fate decisions of differentiating naïve T cells. They also play essential roles in regulating functions of a variety of effector cells, making IL-12 family cytokines important therapeutic targets or agents in a number of inflammatory diseases, such as the CNS autoimmune diseases, uveitis and multiple sclerosis.

RESULTS

Interleukin 12 and 2 Levels

Levels of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were measured in the 115 blood samples from patients with COVID-19 and healthy controls. The most important finding was that interleukin 12 (IL-12) levels were significantly higher in both the asymptomatic and mild disease groups than in the moderate and severe groups (Figure 1A), but these levels were comparable between the moderate and severe disease groups and healthy controls. Similarly to the IL-12 findings, serum levels of interleukin 2 (IL-2) were significantly higher in patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 than in those with moderate or severe COVID-19 (Figure 1B).

### Clinical information… [^cbeba1b6]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Information Clinical features Clinical features include fever, headache, and stiff neck in meningococcal meningitis cases, and sepsis and rash in meningococcemia. Etiologic agent There are multiple serogroups of Neisseria meningitidis. Serogroups B, C, and Y cause the majority of disease in the United States. Serogroup W and nongroupable strains cause a small portion of disease. Best practices for use of polymerase chain reaction for diagnosing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis disease and public health importance of identifying serotype/serogroup. Treatment Because of the risks of severe morbidity and death, effective antibiotics should be administered promptly to patients suspected of having meningococcal disease. Extended-spectrum cephalosporins used for empirical therapy Empirical therapy for suspected meningococcal disease should include an extended-spectrum cephalosporin, such as cefotaxime or ceftriaxone.

Treatment with penicillin or ampicillin requires susceptibility testing Once the microbiologic diagnosis is established, definitive treatment can be continued with an extended-spectrum cephalosporin. Alternatively, if susceptibility of the meningococcal isolate to penicillin is confirmed, treatment can be switched to penicillin G or ampicillin. In addition, people with certain medical conditions are at increased risk for meningococcal disease. These medical conditions include
- Functional or anatomic asplenia
- Persistent complement component deficiencies
- HIV infection. Clinicians should consider complement testing in patients with meningococcal disease. Meningococcal disease is often the first sign that a person has complement deficiency, which is a hereditary condition. In addition, recurrent disease may occur for patients with complement deficiency.

Clinicians should offer vaccination to those patients found to have a complement deficiency. CDC also recommends chemoprophylaxis for close contacts of patients with meningococcal disease, regardless of immunization status. See the "Chemoprophylaxis" section of the meningococcal chapter of the Manual for the Surveillance of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases for additional guidance. Due to recent reports of ciprofloxacin-resistant, β-lactamase-producing.

### XTX301, a tumor-activated interleukin-12 has the potential to widen the therapeutic index of IL12 treatment for solid tumors as evidenced by preclinical studies [^c6c0a0bb]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Overall, our work presents a novel, tumor-activated, engineered IL12 with a potential for clinical translation. The toxicity of a highly potent immunomodulatory treatment such as IL12 makes combination therapy with checkpoint inhibitors or cytokines such as IL2 challenging. On the basis of these preclinical data, XTX301 offers the opportunity for combination and improvement in efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors or cytokines without the associated toxicity of an unmasked IL12. The translatability of the findings from the mouse model efficacy studies and cynomolgus monkey safety studies remains to be determined. A phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety and feasibility of XTX301 in patients with advanced solid tumors is currently ongoing (NCT05684965).

### Ustekinumab [^471a0c5e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Ustekinumab is a human IgG1қ monoclonal antibody that binds with specificity to the p40 protein subunit used by both the IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines. IL-12 and IL-23 are naturally occurring cytokines that are involved in inflammatory and immune responses, such as natural killer cell activation and CD4+ T-cell differentiation and activation. In in vitro models, ustekinumab was shown to disrupt IL-12 and IL-23 mediated signaling and cytokine cascades by disrupting the interaction of these cytokines with a shared cell-surface receptor chain, IL-12Rβ1. The cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 have been implicated as important contributors to the chronic inflammation that is a hallmark of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In animal models of colitis, genetic absence or antibody blockade of the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, the target of ustekinumab, was shown to be protective.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Plaque Psoriasis

In a small exploratory trial, a decrease was observed in the expression of mRNA of its molecular targets IL-12 and IL-23 in lesional skin biopsies measured at baseline and up to two weeks post-treatment in subjects with plaque psoriasis.

Ulcerative Colitis

In both trial UC-1 (induction) and trial UC-2 (maintenance), a positive relationship was observed between exposure and rates of clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement. The response rate approached a plateau at the Ustekinumab exposures associated with the recommended dosing regimen for maintenance treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.5)].

### Re-designing interleukin-12 to enhance its safety and potential as an anti-tumor immunotherapeutic agent [^122f7f4c]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Interleukin-12 (IL-12) has emerged as one of the most potent agents for anti-tumor immunotherapy. However, potentially lethal toxicity associated with systemic administration of IL-12 precludes its clinical application. Here we redesign the molecule in such a way that its anti-tumor efficacy is not compromised, but toxic effects are eliminated. Deletion of the N-terminal signal peptide of IL-12 can effect such a change by preventing IL-12 secretion from cells. We use a newly designed tumor-targeted oncolytic adenovirus (Ad-TD) to deliver non-secreting (ns) IL-12 to tumor cells and examine the therapeutic and toxic effects in Syrian hamster models of pancreatic cancer (PaCa). Strikingly, intraperitoneal delivery of Ad-TD-nsIL-12 significantly enhanced survival of animals with orthotopic PaCa and cured peritoneally disseminated PaCa with no toxic side effects, in contrast to the treatment with Ad-TD expressing unmodified IL-12. These findings offer renewed hope for development of IL-12-based treatments for cancer.

IL-12/23 superfamily structure and receptor system

Across the broad landscape of cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of disease, the IL-12 family is remarkable. The heterodimeric structure of the members of this family confers upon them specific functional activities across a range of leucocyte subsets, and hence broad immune-regulatory potential. In addition, the IL-12 family belongs to the IL-6 superfamily and hence shares structural characteristics with IL-6 related cytokines. IL-12 cytokines are composed of an α-chain (p19, p28 or p35) and a β-chain [p40 or Epstein–Barr virus-induced molecule 3 (Ebi3)]. The α-chain shares a four helix bundle structure with the IL-6 superfamily, while the β-chain is structurally homologous to soluble class I cytokine receptor chains, such as IL-6 receptor-α. As distinct from IL-12, which is composed of a dimer of both p40 and p35 chains, IL-23 comprises an association of p40 and p19 chains. In addition, Ebi3 pairs with p28 to form IL-27 or with p35 to form IL-35, the latest-discovered member of the family. For these, however, there remains some doubt as to their structural integrity in vivo. IL-12 family cytokines also share their receptor subunits: IL-12 receptor (IL-12R) is a dimer of IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12Rβ2, while IL-23 signals through IL-12Rβ1 and IL-23 receptor (IL-23R). In contrast, IL-27 and IL-35 use gp130 in common with the IL-6 family and WSX-1 or IL-12Rβ2, respectively. The p40 subunit of IL-23 binds to the IL-12Rβ1 and p19 to the IL-23R chain, inducing receptor oligomerization. Downstream signalling is mediated by members of the Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family. Phosphorylation of STATs occurs through JAK2, along with JAK1 or tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). IL-23R is associated with phospho (p)STAT3 and pSTAT4 while IL-12R signalling is mediated via pSTAT4. The molecular pathways associated with IL-12/IL-23 signalling are primarily associated with immune regulation. IL-12 family members along with their receptors are presented in Fig. 1. 1

### A balance of interleukin-12 and-23 in cancer [^c0fc02c4]. Trends in Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 share the IL-12p40 molecule. IL-12 promotes T helper (Th)1 immunity and IL-23 promotes Th17 immunity, and it has recently become apparent that the balance between IL-12 and IL-23 is important in carcinogenesis. A series of studies demonstrated that, where tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis are concerned, IL-12 may act independently of interferon (IFN)-γ, and IL-23 independently of IL-17A. This review explores the activity of IL-23 in carcinogenesis. In the context of the tumor-inhibitory effects of IL-12, and tumor-promoting effects of IL-23, we discuss the use of anti-IL-12p/23 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in autoimmune inflammatory disorders and the alternative specific neutralization of IL-23.

### Structural activation of pro-inflammatory human cytokine IL-23 by cognate IL-23 receptor enables recruitment of the shared receptor IL-12R β 1 [^c22a1ac1]. Immunity (2018). Low credibility.

Interleukin-23 (IL-23), an IL-12 family cytokine, plays pivotal roles in pro-inflammatory T helper 17 cell responses linked to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Despite intense therapeutic targeting, structural and mechanistic insights into receptor complexes mediated by IL-23, and by IL-12 family members in general, have remained elusive. We determined a crystal structure of human IL-23 in complex with its cognate receptor, IL-23R, and revealed that IL-23R bound to IL-23 exclusively via its N-terminal immunoglobulin domain. The structural and functional hotspot of this interaction partially restructured the helical IL-23p19 subunit of IL-23 and restrained its IL-12p40 subunit to cooperatively bind the shared receptor IL-12Rβ1 with high affinity. Together with structural insights from the interaction of IL-23 with the inhibitory antibody briakinumab and by leveraging additional IL-23:antibody complexes, we propose a mechanistic paradigm for IL-23 and IL-12 whereby cognate receptor binding to the helical cytokine subunits primes recruitment of the shared receptors via the IL-12p40 subunit.

### IL-12-producing cytokine factories induce precursor exhausted T cells and elimination of primary and metastatic tumors [^f6bb2db9]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

IL-12 has yielded profound antitumor effects in a variety of mouse models, but its applications in humans have been limited by its significant toxicity profile. This has motivated a shift towards the development of targeted or local delivery of IL-12. However, several IL-12 delivery technologies including engineered IL-12 proteins, gene therapiesand cell therapiesare in development intended to maximize tumor-adjacent IL-12 concentrations and limit systemic exposure. The first published study on IL-12-producing cell therapy was released in 1996, where Zitvogel and colleagues isolated dendritic cells from the bone marrow of mice and engineered them to secrete murine IL-12. These cells were then injected intravenously to treat mice inoculated with MCA205 tumor cells. While mice receiving treatment were never completely cured, disease stabilization was observed. Since this study has been published, multiple clinical trials have been initiated investigating the treatment of patients via injection of autologous cells, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, T cells, and fibroblasts, engineered to secrete IL-12. Transient antitumor responses were observed, but these technologies were often limited by severe toxicities, variable IL-12 pharmacokinetics following treatment, or rapid clearance of the injected cells over time. The technology described in this manuscript provides several advantages compared with the IL-12 cell therapies tested in the clinic to date. By encapsulating IL-12 producing ARPE-19 cells prior to implantation, we achieve greater control over the dose of IL-12 administered and introduce a barrier to the foreign body response, greatly improving the duration of treatment. Furthermore, engineering allogeneic ARPE-19 cells rather than patient-derived cells may improve the availability of treatment by reducing the time, expertize, and costs required to isolate, modify, and reinfuse the engineered cells. Together, these aspects of RPE-IL12 therapy may overcome the limitations of current IL-12 cell therapies and allow for improved outcomes in humans.

### Interleukin-23 rather than interleukin-12 is the critical cytokine for autoimmune inflammation of the brain [^e62a66a2]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a heterodimeric molecule composed of p35 and p40 subunits. Analyses in vitro have defined IL-12 as an important factor for the differentiation of naive T cells into T-helper type 1 CD4+ lymphocytes secreting interferon-gamma (refs 1, 2). Similarly, numerous studies have concluded that IL-12 is essential for T-cell-dependent immune and inflammatory responses in vivo, primarily through the use of IL-12 p40 gene-targeted mice and neutralizing antibodies against p40. The cytokine IL-23, which comprises the p40 subunit of IL-12 but a different p19 subunit, is produced predominantly by macrophages and dendritic cells, and shows activity on memory T cells. Evidence from studies of IL-23 receptor expression and IL-23 overexpression in transgenic mice suggest, however, that IL-23 may also affect macrophage function directly. Here we show, by using gene-targeted mice lacking only IL-23 and cytokine replacement studies, that the perceived central role for IL-12 in autoimmune inflammation, specifically in the brain, has been misinterpreted and that IL-23, and not IL-12, is the critical factor in this response. In addition, we show that IL-23, unlike IL-12, acts more broadly as an end-stage effector cytokine through direct actions on macrophages.

### IL-12 induces a B cell-intrinsic IL-12 / IFN γ feed-forward loop promoting extrafollicular B cell responses [^beed4fdc]. Nature Immunology (2024). High credibility.

While some infections elicit germinal centers, others produce only extrafollicular responses. The mechanisms controlling these dichotomous fates are poorly understood. We identify IL-12 as a cytokine switch, acting directly on B cells to promote extrafollicular and suppress germinal center responses. IL-12 initiates a B cell-intrinsic feed-forward loop between IL-12 and IFNγ, amplifying IFNγ production, which promotes proliferation and plasmablast differentiation from mouse and human B cells, in synergy with IL-12. IL-12 sustains the expression of a portion of IFNγ-inducible genes. Together, they also induce unique gene changes, reflecting both IFNγ amplification and cooperative effects between both cytokines. In vivo, cells lacking both IL-12 and IFNγ receptors are more impaired in plasmablast production than those lacking either receptor alone. Further, B cell-derived IL-12 enhances both plasmablast responses and T helper 1 cell commitment. Thus, B cell-derived IL-12, acting on T and B cells, determines the immune response mode, with implications for vaccines, pathogen protection and autoimmunity.

### Interleukin-12 as successful adjuvant in tuberculosis treatment [^1780f228]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Interleukin-12 (IL-12) proved to be an effective and successful adjuvant to a standard antituberculotic medication in a patient suffering from progressive clinical tuberculosis (TB). IL-12 is a potent enhancer of interferon-gamma production which is necessary for killing intracellular bacteria like mycobacteria. This patient's TB was progressive, although sensitivity to first-line antituberculotics was proven and medication was given as directly observed therapy over more than 8 months. The 3-month adjuvant therapy with IL-12 significantly and convincingly improved results. It is believed that this case, the first in the literature to describe adjuvant interleukin-12 therapy in tuberculosis, strongly encourages the study of adjuvant interleukin-12 therapy on a more systematic basis.

### Anti-interleukin-12 antibody for active Crohn's disease [^19d8bea6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease is associated with excess cytokine activity mediated by type 1 helper T (Th1) cells. Interleukin-12 is a key cytokine that initiates Th1-mediated inflammatory responses.

Methods

This double-blind trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-12 (anti-interleukin-12) in 79 patients with active Crohn's disease. Patients were randomly assigned to receive seven weekly subcutaneous injections of 1 mg or 3 mg of anti-interleukin-12 per kilogram of body weight or placebo, with either a four-week interval between the first and second injection (Cohort 1) or no interruption between the two injections (Cohort 2). Safety was the primary end point, and the rates of clinical response (defined by a reduction in the score for the Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] of at least 100 points) and remission (defined by a CDAI score of 150 or less) were secondary end points.

Results

Seven weeks of uninterrupted treatment with 3 mg of anti-interleukin-12 per kilogram resulted in higher response rates than did placebo administration (75 percent vs. 25 percent, P = 0.03). At 18 weeks of follow-up, the difference in response rates was no longer significant (69 percent vs. 25 percent, P = 0.08). Differences in remission rates between the group given 3 mg of anti-interleukin-12 per kilogram and the placebo group in Cohort 2 were not significant at either the end of treatment or the end of follow-up (38 percent and 0 percent, respectively, at both times; P = 0.07). There were no significant differences in response rates among the groups in Cohort 1. The rates of adverse events among patients receiving anti-interleukin-12 were similar to those among patients given placebo, except for a higher rate of local reactions at injection sites in the former group. Decreases in the secretion of interleukin-12, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor alpha by mononuclear cells of the colonic lamina propria accompanied clinical improvement in patients receiving anti-interleukin-12.

Conclusions

Treatment with a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-12 may induce clinical responses and remissions in patients with active Crohn's disease. This treatment is associated with decreases in Th1-mediated inflammatory cytokines at the site of disease.

### IL-12-producing cytokine factories induce precursor exhausted T cells and elimination of primary and metastatic tumors [^892c2fff]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

While immunotherapy represents the most important advance in the field of oncology in many decades, the majority of patients with cancer fail to experience durable responses from these treatments, and many cancer types, such as pancreatic cancer, rarely exhibit any response to immunotherapies. In the context of solid organ malignancies, these shortcomings are frequently a consequence of poor recruitment, infiltration, or retention of lymphocytes or the induction of dysfunctional T cell states following chronic antigen exposure. Furthermore, systemic administration of immunotherapies can lead to life-threatening toxicities, greatly limiting the therapeutic window. Development of an effective immunotherapy for treatment of solid tumors requires a technology capable of overcoming these challenges to (1) successfully generate a systemic antitumor immune response, (2) generate a durable response unlikely to enter a dysfunctional state, and (3) limit systemic immunotherapy exposure to increase tolerability.

We further analyzed the transcriptional activation status of these pathways in each treatment group compared with the vehicle control group on Day 7 (Supplementary Fig. S6). Consistent with previous results, this analysis revealed that samples from mice treated with either mXTX301 or unmasked control showed activation of immune-related transcriptional programs compared with vehicle control and that the extent of such activation was similar for both mXTX301 and unmasked control in all analyzed pathways. Thus, mXTX301 demonstrated pharmacodynamic effects in mouse tumors that are consistent with known IL12 biology in a tumor selective manner.

### Anti-PD-1 cis-delivery of low-affinity IL-12 activates intratumoral CD8T cells for systemic antitumor responses [^10a74a14]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

One approach to enhance antitumor efficacy and reduce IL-12-related toxicity is to engineer pro-IL12 for tissue-specific activation within the tumor microenvironment (TME), which employ natural IL-12 receptors as masks to block IL-12 activity in the periphery. As NK cells have been identified as the primary source of systemic IFN-γ in IL-12 treatment, leading to severe side effects, another approach is to utilize attenuated IL-12 mutants to preferentially activate CD8 + T cells rather than NK cells, capitalizing on the differences in receptor expression. A third strategy involves linking tumor-targeting elements, such as antibodies, or protein domains, with IL-12 to promote its retention in tumors.

Since PD-1 is expressed much more prominently within tumors than in the periphery, in the present study, we developed a low-affinity IL-12 mutant fused with a high-affinity anti-PD-1 antibody to enhance its specific binding to tumor-infiltrating PD-1 + CD8 + T cells rather than peripheral T or NK cells through cis -delivery. We demonstrate that this modified IL-12, guided by anti-PD-1 antibodies, ensures the preferential activation of PD-1 + CD8 + T cells locally in tumors, resulting in robust antitumor immune responses with minimal systemic toxicity.

Discussion

IL12 enhances immune cell infiltration and antigen presentation in the TME, T cell and NK cell effector function, and T helper 1 cell polarization. It also reverses immunosuppression and inhibits angiogenesis via IFNγ. The ideal cellular targets of IL12 immunotherapy are not lymphocytes in circulation, but rather immune cells within the tumor and nearby lymph nodes, including T cells, NK cells, tumor associated macrophages, and myeloid derived suppressor dendritic cells. Therefore, maximizing the amount of IL12 that reaches the tumor is critical for a robust antitumor response. Recent approaches intended to reduce systemic toxicities associated with IL12 have focused on intratumoral delivery, attenuated IL12, tumor targeted IL12 and masked IL12. While encouraging results have been observed, each strategy has limitations. For example, intra tumoral injection may offer limited benefit to patients with metastasis or inaccessible lesions. A tumor targeted IL12 may allow for greater accumulation in tumor but does not completely overcome the issue of systemic lymphocyte activation and consequently the high levels of cytokine production leading to toxicities. Alternatives to overcome systemic toxicities, such as reduced potency IL12 may also limit efficacy. More recently, two approaches with masked IL12 were described. The first approach lacks a half-life extension domain and may require frequent dosing in a clinical setting, and the second approach uses human serum albumin as a half-life extension domain and reported a half-life of 53 hours in a nonhuman primate study. In addition, the later approach relies on two cleavage events to occur to achieve the release of IL12, which may lead to variability in the activation of the molecule. We believe that XTX301, a half-life extended, masked IL12 with tumor selective activation, can overcome some of the challenges highlighted above. XTX301 can be administered intravenously, and the half-life extension domain is designed to reduce the need for frequent dosing, making it highly compatible with clinical use. In addition, to minimize the risk of active IL12 with half-life extension domain leaking into the periphery, XTX301 is designed to enable tumor-specific release of active IL12 with a shorter half-life, compared with the half-life of the intact XTX301.

Systemic IL12 therapy has potent antitumor effects, but clinical delivery of this potent cytokine has been complicated by systemic toxicity.

### Enhanced efficacy and limited systemic cytokine exposure with membrane-anchored interleukin-12 T-cell therapy in murine tumor models [^0ee3c9e6]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

It is also possible that aIL-12 may act through bone marrow-derived tumor stromal cells. A limitation of this report was that mechanistic studies were not performed. Experiments in mouse models with intact endogenous immune systems are needed to confirm whether aIL-12 acts mechanistically similar to soluble IL-12, as well as to understand the long-term persistence of aIL-12-modified T cells. In the present study, administration of a smaller number of cells expressing the aIL-12 decreased the efficacy of treatment, even when the total number of therapeutic tumor-specific T cells was held constant. This finding suggests that, if reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment is an important mechanism of action, a small number of cells may not be sufficient to achieve the effect. Additionally, in this study, mice treated with aIL-12 form target-antigen-specific T-cell memory, as they are protected from subsequent tumor rechallenge.

### The potential of interleukin 12 inhibition in the treatment of psoriasis [^16d0466e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Interleukin 12 (IL-12) is an important cytokine produced by a variety of immune effector cells that leads to a type 1 helper T cell (Th1) response. IL-12 also directs T cells to the skin via induction of cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) expression. In this article we report the current understanding of the immunobiology of IL-12, reviewing its structure, receptor, and function. We also discuss the role of IL-12 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Some effective conventional psoriasis treatments alter IL-12 levels. Importantly, specific antibodies directed against IL-12 may prove useful against psoriasis but may also act by targeting IL-23 in addition to IL-12.

### The genetic architecture of cervical length is shared with spontaneous preterm birth risk [^c83c6119]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

An association was also observed between the linear coefficient and rs139045636 on Chromosome 3 (p = 7.67 × 10 −8) which is located within the gene encoding Interleukin 12 A + Antisense RNA (IL-12A-AS1) and near the gene encoding Interleukin 12 A (IL12A) (Fig. 4B). Interleukin-12 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced primarily by myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, which induces interferon-γ (IFNγ) expression and promotes T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation, among other functions. During pregnancy, there is a shift from the pro-inflammatory microenvironment associated with pregnancy establishment to a homeostatic state that persists for most of gestation to promote maternal-fetal immune tolerance. A breakdown of such maternal-fetal tolerance has therefore been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm labor. Molecular studies suggest that IL-12 concentrations in cervical secretions are predominantly the result of local cytokine production. Interestingly, cervical concentrations of IL-12 have been associated with many maternal risk factors for a short cervix and preterm labor, including age, parity, genital tract infection, and a high vaginal pH –.

### A human interleukin-12 / 23 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of psoriasis [^6da86bc6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Skin-infiltrating lymphocytes expressing type 1 cytokines have been linked to the pathophysiology of psoriasis. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of a human interleukin-12/23 monoclonal antibody in treating psoriasis.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 320 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis underwent randomization to treatment with the interleukin-12/23 monoclonal antibody (one 45-mg dose, one 90-mg dose, four weekly 45-mg doses, or four weekly 90-mg doses) or placebo; 64 patients were randomly assigned to each group. Patients assigned to the interleukin-12/23 monoclonal antibody received one additional dose at week 16 if needed. Patients assigned to placebo crossed over to receive one 90-mg dose of interleukin-12/23 monoclonal antibody at week 20.

Results

There was at least 75% improvement in the psoriasis area-and-severity index at week 12 (the primary end point) in 52% of patients who received 45 mg of the interleukin-12/23 monoclonal antibody, in 59% of those who received 90 mg, in 67% of those who received four weekly 45-mg doses, and in 81% of those who received four weekly 90-mg doses, as compared with 2% of those who received placebo (P < 0.001 for each comparison), and there was at least 90% improvement in 23%, 30%, 44%, and 52%, respectively, of patients who received the monoclonal antibody as compared with 2% of patients who received placebo (P < 0.001 for each comparison). Adverse events occurred in 79% of patients treated with the interleukin-12/23 monoclonal antibody as compared with 72% of patients in the placebo group (P = 0.19). Serious adverse events occurred in 4% of patients who received the monoclonal antibody and in 1% of those who received placebo (P = 0.69).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates the therapeutic efficacy of an interleukin-12/23 monoclonal antibody in psoriasis and provides further evidence of a role of the interleukin-12/23 p40 cytokines in the pathophysiology of psoriasis. Larger studies are needed to determine whether serious adverse events might limit the clinical usefulness of this new therapeutic target.

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis therapies — biologic agents and regulatory status are summarized as follows: "multiple biologic agents have been introduced during the past 8 years" that target psoriasis-relevant molecules; agents with regulatory approval for psoriasis and/or PsA "include two that interfere with T-cell function (alefacept and efalizumab), 3 monoclonal antibodies that inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab), one soluble receptor that inhibits TNF-alpha (etanercept), and one monoclonal antibody directed at the p40 subunit common to IL-12 and IL-23 (ustekinumab)", and "a second biologic agent that similarly inhibits IL-12 and IL-23 p40 (briakinumab) is in late stage clinical trials"; since "2008, efalizumab has been withdrawn from the market because of the findings of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in 3 patients; golimumab has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for PsA; and ustekinumab is currently undergoing phase III clinical trials for PsA".

### Utility of interleukin-12 and interleukin-10 in comparison with other cytokines and acute-phase reactants in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis [^fe4ed3f8]. American Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

We compared the test characteristics of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12(p-70), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and full blood count (FBC) in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. This prospective cohort study in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Dunedin hospital of patients between July 1, 2002 and February 28, 2007 included 117 neonates commenced on antibiotics for 164 episodes of suspected sepsis. Blood cultures, FBC, CRP, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12(p-70), TNF-alpha, and PCT were obtained at the time sepsis was first suspected and for the following 3 days. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) plots and test characteristics were determined using culture-positive sepsis as the gold standard. At the time sepsis was first suspected, the most promising individual test was IL-12(p70) with an area under the curve (95% confidence interval [CI]) for the ROC of 0.74 (0.63 to 0.86), which (with a cutoff at 75 pg/mL) had a sensitivity (95% CI) of 28% (20 to 36%) and a specificity of 98% (96 to 100%). IL-10 had a sensitivity of 17% (10 to 23%) and a specificity of 99% (97 to 100%). IL-10 and IL-12(p70) are promising diagnostic tests that can be used to confirm sepsis in neonates.

### Interferon-beta therapy for multiple sclerosis induces reciprocal changes in interleukin-12 and interleukin-10 production [^5ab2ea1b]. Annals of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Interleukin-12 is critical to the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in multiple species. Interleukin-10, a dominant endogenous inhibitor of interleukin-12, is largely protective in these experimental surrogates for multiple sclerosis. Such data have suggested that an interleukin-12/interleukin-10 immunoregulatory circuit is a key determinant of disease expression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. For multiple sclerosis itself, compatible cytokine data have been reported. The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of interferon-beta in multiple sclerosis remain unclear, hampering the search for more effective therapies. Of note, interferon-beta has reciprocal effects on these cytokines in vitro, suppressing interleukin-12 and augmenting interleukin-10 production. To examine the effects of interferon-beta on the interleukin-12/interleukin-10 axis in multiple sclerosis, we characterized the production of these cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients beginning therapy with interferon-beta. Before therapy, multiple sclerosis patients exhibited increased stimulatable interleukin-12 production compared with controls. Interferon-beta therapy leads to inhibition of interleukin-12 and augmentation of interleukin-10 production, significantly elevating the ratio of secreted interleukin-10 to interleukin-12. These effects, observed equally in patients with relapsing-remitting and progressive disease, indicate that interferon-beta affects the interleukin-12/interleukin-10 axis in ways thought to be beneficial to multiple sclerosis patients. More specific therapeutic targeting of these pathways may be warranted.

### Enhanced efficacy and limited systemic cytokine exposure with membrane-anchored interleukin-12 T-cell therapy in murine tumor models [^02f66797]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

To evaluate in vivo tumor treatment with human iaIL-12, the E7 TCR xenograft model was used. In this model, a subcutaneous, established, human cervical cancer that expresses HPV E7 (CaSki) is treated with human E7 TCR gene-engineered T cells (E7 TCR-T cells). Treatment with E7 TCR-T cells coexpressing iaIL-12 resulted in greater tumor regression than treatment with E7 TCR-T cells coexpressing the negative control (iGFP; figure 7A). Interestingly, treatment with isIL-12 but not with iaIL-12 resulted in high serum levels of IL-12 (figure 7B), and mice treated with isIL-12 but not iaIL-12 died or had to be euthanized after day 15 because of toxicity. Serum levels of IL-12 were not increased in mice treated with iaIL-12 (figure 7B). In summary, in this model, iaIL-12 enhanced treatment efficacy with human tumor-specific T cells and did not increase serum IL-12 levels.

### Inflammatory skin disease in K14 / p40 transgenic mice: evidence for interleukin-12-like activities of p40 [^19bf6ce5]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-12, a p35/p40 heterodimer, is produced by resident cells in skin and has been implicated as a pathogenetic factor in T-cell-mediated skin diseases. Secretion of heterodimeric interleukin-12 is always accompanied by production of p40 monomer and p40/p40 homodimer. To investigate the possible in vivo role of p40 per se, we generated mice that constitutively express monomeric and homodimeric p40 in basal keratinocytes. These mice spontaneously developed an eczematous skin disease that was characterized by hyperkeratosis, focal epidermal spongiosis, and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate composed of T cells (CD4+), macrophages, eosinophils, mast cells, and few neutrophils. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of transgenic epidermal cell suspensions revealed induction of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on keratinocytes and a 2-3-fold increase in the content of Langerhans cells. Cytokines produced by these activated epidermal cells include interleukin-1alpha and tumor necrosis factor alpha. The skin disease in K14/p40 mice was similar to that of littermate mice that received injections of interleukin-12, suggesting overlapping in vivo functional properties. As induction of interferon-gamma is a major function of interleukin-12, we tested the in vitro ability of transgenic p40 to induce interferon-gamma. In contrast to interleukin-12, transgenic p40 did not stimulate interferon-gamma secretion by cultured splenocytes. We conclude that transgenic p40 and interleukin-12 are equally capable of initiating cutaneous inflammation. Despite these in vivo similarities, there is a clear functional difference between interleukin-12 and transgenic p40 in vitro, suggesting that interferon-gamma is not a major factor contributing to interleukin-12-like activities of transgenic p40.

### IL-12 reprograms CAR-expressing natural killer T cells to long-lived Th1-polarized cells with potent antitumor activity [^bdca18f2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Our clinical study indicates that human CAR-NKTs benefit from the co-expression of the IL-15 cytokine to support their expansion and persistence in cancer patients. Furthermore, we have identified that human CAR-NKTs expressing CD62L show superior proliferative and persistence capacity and antitumor activity compared to CAR-NKTs lacking CD62L expression, suggesting that these innate immune cells may undergo a differentiation process resembling the central-memory differentiation of αβTCR T cells. Importantly, CD62L expression in CAR-NKTs correlates with better clinical outcome in patients. Leveraging the intrinsic plasticity of human peripheral NKTs may thus lead to the generation of long-lived CAR-NKTs with high potential of controlling tumor growth long-term.

IL-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine produced by dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells in response to microbial pathogens and exert potent pro-inflammatory and tumor-suppressive activity. NKs and NKTs express the IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12Rβ2 receptors and become pro-inflammatory cells in response to IL-12.

Here we show that the transgenic expression of IL-12 in human NKTs and CAR-NKTs not only imprints a Th1 polarization, but causes an extensive molecular reprogramming of NKTs that leads to the generation of exhaustion-resistant long-lived memory cells with potent antitumor activity.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^a7c9bcbf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Management of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis — induction therapy (conventional and targeted) states the following: In patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis (UC), we recommend oral budesonide MMX for induction of remission. In patients with moderately to severely active UC of any extent, we recommend oral systemic corticosteroids to induce remission. In patients with moderately to severely active UC, we recommend against monotherapy with thiopurines or methotrexate for induction of remission. In patients with moderately to severely active UC, we recommend sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators, ozanimod and etrasimod, for induction of remission. In patients with moderately to severely active UC, we recommend the interleukin (IL)-12/23p40 antibody ustekinumab for induction of remission. In patients with moderately to severely active UC, we recommend the interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitor risankizumab for induction of remission.

### COVID-19 and immunomodulation in IBD [^d7976f5f]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Ustekinumab is a cytokine antibody blocking the p40 subunit of the two cytokines IL-12 and IL-23. This antibody has been approved for clinical therapy of patients with IBD. Mechanistically, this antibody prevents Th1 T-cell priming via IL-12 and simultaneously inhibits perpetuated activation of IL-23 responsive Th17 cells. No increase in viral infections in patients with IBD has been noted on ustekinumab therapy. It is tempting to speculate that IL-23 blockade in COVID-19 may suppress the pathogenic Th17 response in the cytokine storm syndrome, although no studies have addressed this concept so far. Thus, there are currently no major concerns on the use of this antibody for clinical therapy in patients with IBD due to the current COVID-19 risk situation.

Although cytokine blockers and Jak inhibitors have raised theoretical concerns with regard to IBD therapy, it should be noted that these agents are currently considered for clinical therapy of COVID-19 cases with hyperinflammation and ARDS. Jak inhibitors blocking Jak2 have been suggested to block viral entry and the Th17 part of the cytokine storm syndrome without altering interferon signalling (this has not been demonstrated for the Jak1/3 inhibitor tofacitinib so far). Additional studies suggested potential benefits of cytokine blockade in sepsis. Re-analysis of a phase III trial in sepsis suggested that blockade of IL-1 signalling via anakinra may result in significant survival benefits in patients with hyperinflammation and elevated cytokine production. Moreover, TNF inhibition has been suggested to be helpful in selected patients with hyperinflammation and high IL-6 levels in sepsis. Finally, the IL-6R antibody tocilizumab is currently considered for therapy of hyperinflammation and ARDS in COVID-19 and a prospective phase III trial has been initiated to clarify its effects on cytokine storm syndromes in the disease. This antibody had been previously tested in a small phase II trial in CD and the results suggested potential efficacy and safety. However, blockade of IL-6 signalling has recently raised concerns in CD, as IL-6 antibodies (PF-04236921) led to reduction of inflammation but the formation of abscesses and perforation in a subgroup of patients with IBD.

Active psoriatic arthritis with frequent serious infections in OSM- and biologic treatment–naive patients includes strong recommendations against first-line TNFi use. In patients with active PsA who have frequent serious infections and have not received OSM or biologic treatment, an OSM should be used over a TNFi biologic as a first-line treatment since there is a black box warning against the use of a TNFi biologic in patients with frequent serious infections (strong recommendation); an interleukin-12/23 inhibitor (IL-12/23i) or an interleukin-17 inhibitor (IL-17i) is recommended over a TNFi biologic (conditional recommendation), while a TNFi biologic may be used instead of an IL-12/23i in severe PsA and instead of an IL-17i in patients with concomitant IBD.

### Tacrolimus (Prograf) [^01894b2a]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Tacrolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12. A complex of tacrolimus-FKBP-12, calcium, calmodulin, and calcineurin (a ubiquitous mammalian intracellular enzyme) is then formed, after which the phosphatase activity of calcineurin is inhibited. Such inhibition prevents the dephosphorylation and translocation of various factors such as the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-κB).

Tacrolimus inhibits the expression and/or production of several cytokines that include interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Tacrolimus also inhibits IL-2 receptor expression and nitric oxide release, induces apoptosis and production of transforming growth factor beta that can lead to immunosuppressive activity. The net result is the inhibition of T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation, as well as T-helper-cell-dependent B-cell response (i.e., immunosuppression).

### Tumor-targeted IL-12 combined with tumor resection yields a survival-favorable immune profile [^d6cad0c4]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

An immune profile associated with longer overall survival

Mutation-induced oncogene activation and tumor suppressor gene inactivation have been widely investigated as markers to predict survival duration for patients with cancer. However, no one mutation is known to universally predict OS duration across different tumor types. This is not surprising, because different tumors may utilize different pathways or oncogenes to drive tumor progression and metastasis. However, immune profile infiltration is a common factor across all tumor types. Indeed, some studies have found that a certain type of immune profile was associated with long-term OS. T cell infiltration and frequency of FOXP3 + Tregs, MDSCs, and tumor-associated macrophages all have been discussed in the literature as predictors of OS in specific tumor types, but none were analyzed across multiple types of tumors. Our first goal for this study was to identify a single immune profile that can universally predict long-term OS across different tumor types. Our second goal was to develop a simple immune therapy that converts tumors from an immune profile associated with short OS to the immune profile associated with longer OS.

### Pre-clinical toxicity assessment of tumor-targeted interleukin-12 low-intensity electrogenetherapy [^22cd482e]. Cancer Gene Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

This study's goal was to assess the safety of tumor-targeted interleukin-12 (ttIL-12) when administered by electrogenetherapy in C3H/HeJ mice by identifying an initial safe dose for human dose escalation schemes, toxicity target organs, markers of toxicity, and toxicity reversibility. Tumor-free mice receiving two doses of 0.45% NaCl, 1μg ttIL-12 DNA in 0.45% NaCl or 5μg ttIL-12 DNA in 0.45% NaCl, 10 days apart combined with low-intensity electroporation were compared with non-treatment controls over time. All mice had blood cell counts, serum chemistry profiles, plasma interleukin-12 and IFNγ determinations, necropsy and multi-organ histopathology. Mild treatment-associated changes included electroporation-associated muscle changes that resolved by 30 days; decreased total white blood cell counts and infectious disease in the 5μg ttIL-12 group, but not in the 1μg group, and liver changes in ttIL-12 groups that correlated with alanine transaminase levels and resolved by 30 days. Dystrophic cardiac calcification seen in older, 5μg ttIL-12-treated mice was the only serious toxicity. Based on these results and the lack of any effect on wound healing when combined with surgery, low-intensity electrogenetherapy with ttIL-12 appears to be safe and well tolerated.

### Improved antitumour immunity in murine neuroblastoma using a combination of IL-2 and IL-12 [^a7c19d96]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Neuroblastoma is one of the most common solid tumours occurring in children. Prognosis of the disease ranges from spontaneous regression for Stage IV S patients to other forms associated with relapse and low survival rates when it occurs as disseminated disease. Neuroblastoma therapy depends on the stage of the disease, but has mainly consisted of chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of the tumour or radiotherapy. Strategies to address the minimal residual disease have included high-dose chemotherapy with autologous haematopoietic stem cell rescue or differentiation of the remaining malignant cells with retinoids. However, the success rate has been limited and thus alternative strategies including immunotherapy are under investigation.

Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) have been explored for the treatment of cancers. Interleukin-12 is a potent activator of natural killer (NK) cells and T lymphocytes, and promotes the development of CD4 + Th1-inducing antitumour immunity. Many of its functions are mediated through the actions of IFN- γ, but it has also been shown to synergise with IL-2 to generate lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells against tumour targets. Interleukin-2 has shown antitumour activity in a number of studies mainly because of its ability to activate and enhance the cytolytic activity of NK and T cells.

American College of Rheumatology/National Psoriasis Foundation psoriatic arthritis guideline — Developed as an evidence-based guideline for the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), it used a systematic literature review with GRADE methodology and a voting panel to reach consensus on recommendation direction and strength. The guideline covers the management of active PsA in patients who are treatment-naive and those who continue to have active PsA despite treatment, addressing oral small molecules, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, interleukin-12/23 inhibitors (IL-12/23), IL-17 inhibitors, CTLA4-Ig (abatacept), and a JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib); it also includes recommendations for psoriatic spondylitis, predominant enthesitis, treatment with concomitant inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, or serious infections, and a treat-to-target strategy, vaccinations, and nonpharmacologic therapies. Six percent of the recommendations were strong and 94% conditional, and the guideline serves as a tool for therapy selection but is not meant to be proscriptive or to limit treatment options for patients with PsA.

### IL-12 reprograms CAR-expressing natural killer T cells to long-lived Th1-polarized cells with potent antitumor activity [^32b74aa9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Human natural killer T cells (NKTs) are innate-like T lymphocytes increasingly used for cancer immunotherapy. Here we show that human NKTs expressing the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) undergo extensive and sustained molecular and functional reprogramming. Specifically, IL-12 instructs and maintains a Th1-polarization program in NKTs in vivo without causing their functional exhaustion. Furthermore, using CD62L as a marker of memory cells in human NKTs, we observe that IL-12 maintains long-term CD62L-expressing memory NKTs in vivo. Notably, IL-12 initiates a de novo programming of memory NKTs in CD62L-negative NKTs indicating that human NKTs circulating in the peripheral blood possess an intrinsic differentiation hierarchy, and that IL-12 plays a role in promoting their differentiation to long-lived Th1-polarized memory cells. Human NKTs engineered to co-express a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) coupled with the expression of IL-12 show enhanced antitumor activity in leukemia and neuroblastoma tumor models, persist long-term in vivo and conserve the molecular signature driven by the IL-12 expression. Thus IL-12 reveals an intrinsic plasticity of peripheral human NKTs that may play a crucial role in the development of cell therapeutics.

In an effort to optimize the use of recombinant human interleukin-12, using flow cytometry we studied the regulation of the interleukin-12 receptor beta1 (high affinity chain) and beta2 (chain necessary for interleukin-12 signal transduction) on normal volunteer CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and CD4+ and CD8+ cells from eight patients with different degrees of leukemic involvement with Sézary syndrome. The beta1 chain was not readily detectable on resting normal and T cells from Sézary patients, but expression was induced following T cell activation with phytohemagglutinin. Similarly, the beta2 chain was not detectable on resting normal volunteer T cells, but could be induced following phytohemagglutinin stimulation. Moreover, the beta2 chain on normal volunteer T cells was markedly upregulated following short-term culture with interferon-gamma or recombinant human interleukin-12. CD8+ T cells routinely exhibited a greater expression of beta2 than did CD4+ T cells. In marked contrast, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from patients with Sézary syndrome and a high tumor cell burden (> 50% circulating atypical Sézary T cells) failed to express the beta2 chain under any culture conditions. Although, culture with anti-interleukin-10 also markedly increased beta2 expression on normal volunteer T cells, this failed to induce expression on either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells from Sézary patients and a high tumor burden. Investigation of patients with Sézary syndrome and a low tumor cell burden (< 15% circulating Sézary T cells) revealed a pattern of beta2 expression that was intermediate between advanced Sézary syndrome and normal volunteers. Both CD4+ and CD8+ peripheral blood T cells from these earlier stage patients were induced to express the beta2 chain, although at a lower frequency of positivity than T cells from normals, following culture with phytohemagglutinin, interferon-gamma, recombinant human interleukin-12, or anti-interleukin-10. These results indicate that short-term culture with interferon-gamma and recombinant human interleukin-12 potently upregulates beta2 chain expression on T cells from normal volunteers, whereas a similar, but less marked effect occurs on T cells from Sézary syndrome patients and a low circulating tumor cell burden. In contrast, the beta2 chain appears to be suppressed on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from Sézary patients with a heavy circulating tumor cell burden and it is not induced by interferon-gamma or recombinant human interleukin-12. Therefore, recombinant human interleukin-12 is likely to be most effective for early stage cutaneous T cell lymphoma due to a greater display of beta2 receptors on responding CD8+ anti-tumor cytotoxic T cells.

Active psoriatic arthritis with concomitant active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has mostly strong recommendations. In OSM- and biologic treatment–naive patients with concomitant active IBD, a monoclonal antibody TNFi biologic (excludes etanercept, which is a fusion molecule/soluble receptor biologic) is recommended over an OSM, with an OSM allowed in severe PsA for those preferring oral therapy or with contraindications to TNFi biologics. In patients with concomitant active IBD despite treatment with an OSM, a monoclonal antibody TNFi biologic or an interleukin-12/23 inhibitor (IL-12/23i) should be used over an interleukin-17 inhibitor (IL-17i), and a monoclonal antibody TNFi biologic should be used over a TNFi soluble receptor biologic (etanercept) (all strong recommendations); a monoclonal antibody TNFi biologic is recommended over an IL-12/23i (conditional recommendation), although an IL-12/23i may be used when there are contraindications to TNFi biologics or a preference for less frequent drug administration.

### Both CD1d antigen presentation and interleukin-12 are required to activate natural killer T cells during trypanosoma cruzi infection [^927fe72b]. Infection and Immunity (2005). Low credibility.

Mechanisms of natural killer T (NKT)-cell activation remain unclear. Here, we report that during Trypanosoma cruzi infection, interleukin-12 (IL-12) deficiency or anti-CD1d antibody treatment prevents normal activation. The required IL-12 arises independently of MyD88. The data support a model of normal NKT-cell activation that requires IL-12 and TCR stimulation.

### Bimekizumab (Bimzelx) [^f9e86c6f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Bimekizumab-bkzx is a humanized immunoglobulin IgG1/ κ monoclonal antibody with two identical antigen binding regions that selectively bind to human interleukin 17A (IL-17A), interleukin 17F (IL-17F), and interleukin 17-AF cytokines, and inhibits their interaction with the IL-17 receptor complex. IL-17A and IL-17F are naturally occurring cytokines that are involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Bimekizumab-bkzx inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Elevated levels of IL-17A and IL-17F are found in lesional psoriatic skin, and lesional skin in HS. Bimekizumab-bkzx exposure-response relationships to serum biomarkers, including IL-17A and IL-17F, and the time course of such pharmacodynamic responses are unknown.

Immune Response to Inactivated or Non-Live Vaccines

Healthy individuals who received a single 320 mg dose of BIMZELX two weeks prior to vaccination with an inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine had similar antibody responses compared to individuals who did not receive BIMZELX prior to vaccination. The effectiveness of inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines and other inactivated and non-live vaccines has not been evaluated in patients treated with BIMZELX.

### Anti-interleukin-23 autoantibodies in adult-onset immunodeficiency [^5293710f]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Autoantibodies against interleukin-12 (anti-interleukin-12) are often identified in patients with thymoma, but opportunistic infections develop in only some of these patients. Interleukin-12 (with subunits p40 and p35) shares a common subunit with interleukin-23 (subunits p40 and p19). In a patient with disseminated Burkholderia gladioli infection, the identification of both anti-interleukin-23 and anti-interleukin-12 prompted further investigation.

Methods

Among the patients (most of whom had thymoma) who were known to have anti-interleukin-12, we screened for autoantibodies against interleukin-23 (anti-interleukin-23). To validate the potential role of anti-interleukin-23 with respect to opportunistic infection, we tested a second cohort of patients with thymoma as well as patients without either thymoma or known anti-interleukin-12 who had unusual infections.

Results

Among 30 patients with anti-interleukin-12 who had severe mycobacterial, bacterial, or fungal infections, 15 (50%) also had autoantibodies that neutralized interleukin-23. The potency of such neutralization was correlated with the severity of these infections. The neutralizing activity of anti-interleukin-12 alone was not associated with infection. In the validation cohort of 91 patients with thymoma, the presence of anti-interleukin-23 was associated with infection status in 74 patients (81%). Overall, neutralizing anti-interleukin-23 was detected in 30 of 116 patients (26%) with thymoma and in 30 of 36 patients (83%) with disseminated, cerebral, or pulmonary infections. Anti-interleukin-23 was present in 6 of 32 patients (19%) with severe intracellular infections and in 2 of 16 patients (12%) with unusual intracranial infections, including Cladophialophora bantiana and Mycobacterium avium complex.

Conclusions

Among patients with a variety of mycobacterial, bacterial, or fungal infections, the presence of neutralizing anti-interleukin-23 was associated with severe, persistent opportunistic infections. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and others.).

### IL-12 completely blocks ultraviolet-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha from cultured skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes [^5f2f09b4]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Interleukin-12 is an important regulator of other cytokines. Although interleukin-12 is considered to act primarily on lymphocytes, provoking a shift from T helper 2 to T helper 1 cells and an increase in lymphocyte-derived tumor necrosis factor alpha, we hypothesized that interleukin-12 might also affect tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion from skin cells. In this study, keratinocytes were treated with ultraviolet-B, ultraviolet-A, or sham irradiation, without or with exogenous interleukin-12. Remarkably, the exogenous interleukin-12 totally blocked ultraviolet-B-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha production. Both ultraviolet-A and ultraviolet-B were capable of inducing interleukin-12 production. To determine the molecular mechanism of this effect, we used a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter under the control of a 1.2 kb fragment of the wild-type (-308G) human tumor necrosis factor alpha promoter and found significant suppression of promoter activity with interleukin-12. Studies using the -308A variant of the human tumor necrosis factor alpha promoter showed much higher promoter activity overall, but also a greater sensitivity to suppression by interleukin-12. The mechanism did not involve blockage of the interleukin-1 receptor, because interleukin-12 did not suppress interleukin-1-mediated induction of collagenase mRNA. To determine the role of endogenous interleukin-12, we found that anti-interleukin-12 antibodies enhanced ultraviolet-B-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion. Thus, interleukin-12 strongly inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha production by noninflammatory skin cells, mostly or entirely through inhibition of gene transcription via an element within the first 1.2 kb of the tumor necrosis factor alpha promoter. The result is a shift in tumor necrosis factor alpha production from noninflammatory cells to T helper 1 cells. Because tumor necrosis factor alpha is central to the pathogenesis of several photosensitive skin diseases and certain forms of immune suppression, interleukin-12 may have important physiologic, pathophysiologic, and therapeutic roles.

### Special article: 2018 American College of Rheumatology / National Psoriasis Foundation guideline for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis [^0424854a]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Active psoriatic arthritis with predominant enthesitis — treatment-naive and after OSM — has conditional recommendations based on low- to very-low-quality evidence. In treatment-naive PsA with predominant enthesitis, a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) biologic is recommended over an OSM as a first-line option; apremilast may be used instead of a TNFi biologic if the patient prefers an oral therapy or has contraindications to TNFi, and oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended over starting an OSM unless specified comorbidities are present. Tofacitinib is recommended over apremilast, with apremilast may be used instead of tofacitinib in patients with recurrent infections. In patients with active PsA with predominant enthesitis despite treatment with an OSM, a TNFi, an interleukin-17 inhibitor (IL-17i), or an interleukin-12/23 inhibitor (IL-12/23i) is recommended over switching to another OSM, with apremilast allowed for those preferring oral therapy or with recurrent infections or contraindications to TNFi biologics. Within biologics, a TNFi is recommended over an IL-17i or IL-12/23i; an IL-17i or IL-12/23i may be used instead of a TNFi in patients with severe psoriasis or contraindications to TNFi; an IL-17i is recommended over an IL-12/23i; and an IL-12/23i may be used instead of a TNFi in patients who prefer less frequent drug administration or instead of an IL-17i in patients with concomitant inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

### Joint position statement from the National Psoriasis Foundation medical board and the international psoriasis council on routine testing for latent tuberculosis infection prior to and during treatment of psoriasis patients with IL-17 or IL-23 inhibitors [^6e7a0058]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

IL-17 inhibitors in psoriasis — evidence on latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) risk and trial eligibility is summarized as follows: There are now four approved therapies for psoriasis that inhibit IL-17 family members, including secukinumab and ixekizumab (IL-17A), brodalumab (IL-17RA), and bimekizumab (IL-17A and IL-17F). In mice, selective inhibition of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17RA, or IL-22 does not impair host control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, while TNF-deficient mice rapidly succumb to infection, and in a human microgranuloma model in vitro, secukinumab-induced inhibition of IL-17A did not reverse M. tuberculosis dormancy whereas ustekinumab-induced inhibition of IL-12/IL-23 and adalimumab-induced inhibition of TNF promoted M. tuberculosis reactivation. Considerable clinical trial data and post-marketing real-world evidence support the concept that IL-17 inhibitors do not increase the risk of progression of LTBI to active disease in humans with psoriasis and other IMIDs, and for clinical trials, patients with LTBI were typically eligible for enrollment into IL-17 inhibitor studies provided they received preventive TB therapy according to local guidelines.

Meningococcal Disease
- A leading cause of bacterial meningitis and sepsis in U. S.
- As of August 2020, five meningococcal vaccines licensed in U. S. Meningococcal disease is an acute, severe illness caused by the bacterium. Pathogenesis Meningococcal Disease Pathogenesis
- Bacteria attach to and multiply in nasopharynx and oropharynx
- In < 1% of persons, bacteria enter bloodstream
- Can cause systemic disease and meningitis. Clinical Features Meningococcal Disease Clinical Features
- Incubation period 3 to 4 days
- Meningitis is the most common presentation of invasive disease
- Sudden onset of fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, altered mental status.
- Meningococcal septicemia
- Abrupt onset of fever, chills, cold hands and feet, severe aches or pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash
- Bacteremic pneumonia
- Meningococci occasionally cause noninvasive infections
- Risk factors for invasive disease. Meningococcal septicemia occurs without meningitis in about 30% of invasive meningococcal infections. This condition is characterized by abrupt onset of fever; chills; cold hands and feet; severe aches or pain in the muscles, joints, chest, or abdomen; vomiting; diarrhea; and a petechial or purpuric rash, often associated with hypotension, shock, acute adrenal hemorrhage, and multiorgan failure. An additional 15% of U. S. cases present with bacteremic pneumonia; this is the most common presentation in adults over 65 years of age. Other syndromes involving isolation of meningococci from normally sterile body sites, such as septic arthritis, can also occur.

Meningococci also occasionally cause noninvasive infections such as conjunctivitis or urethritis. Noninvasive illness due to meningococci is not nationally notifiable and the incidence is unclear. Throughout this chapter, risk factors and demographics described apply only to invasive, reportable meningococcal disease cases and the term. Risk factors for the development of meningococcal disease include persistent complement component deficiencies (including use of a complement component inhibitor, eculizumab [Soliris.

### Aldesleukin (Proleukin) [^8fa39c54]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Aldesleukin is an interleukin-2 lymphocyte growth factor. The antitumor activity of aldesleukin has not been fully characterized. In vitro studies performed on human cell lines show enhancement of lymphocyte mitogenesis and cytotoxicity, induction of killer cell activity [lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) and natural killer (NK) cells] and interferon gamma production, and proliferation of human interleukin-2-dependent cell lines.

Administration of aldesleukin in animals and humans produces multiple immunological effects in a dose-dependent manner. These effects include activation of cellular immunity and the production of cytokines including tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, and interferon gamma. In vivo experiments in murine melanoma and sarcoma tumor models have shown inhibition of tumor growth.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Dose-dependent immunological effects including activation of cellular immunity with lymphocytosis, eosinophilia, and thrombocytopenia, and the production of cytokines including tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, and gamma interferon were observed following administration of aldesleukin in animals and humans.

Aldesleukin exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic response are unknown.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Aldesleukin serum concentrations change proportionally with the Proleukin dosage.

Distribution

Aldesleukin is rapidly distributed (distribution half-life of 13 minutes) into the extravascular space following a Proleukin intravenous infusion.

Elimination

The serum elimination half-life aldesleukin is 85 minutes in patients with cancer following a 5-minute intravenous infusion of Proleukin. The mean clearance rate of aldesleukin is 268 mL/min.

Metabolism

Aldesleukin is metabolized to amino acids in the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney.

Excretion

Aldesleukin is primarily excreted in the kidney by both glomerular filtration and peritubular extraction. In the kidney it is metabolized and excreted into urine with little or no aldesleukin present.
