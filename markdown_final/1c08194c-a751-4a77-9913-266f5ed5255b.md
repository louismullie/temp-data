## Question

can you use depo for more than 2 years

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Depo-Provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate) can be used for more than 2 years and what the evidence and guidelines say about that scenario. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA's boxed warning and labeled limitations of use. Then, I should verify the strength of the bone mineral density evidence and how reversible it is after discontinuation. Next, I will examine fracture risk data and whether it changes the calculus. After that, I need to check what professional guidelines (ACOG, CDC/USPSTF) say about extended use. Then, I should review special populations, especially adolescents, and weigh risks versus benefits. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-mitigation approach for patients who truly need Depo beyond 2 years and outline alternatives if possible.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory position. The FDA boxed warning explicitly states that Depo-Provera is not recommended as a long-term (longer than 2 years) birth control method unless other options are considered inadequate, due to significant, dose- and duration-dependent loss of bone mineral density that may not be fully reversible, particularly concerning in adolescence and early adulthood when peak bone mass accrues [^111ChFRC] [^116SGnh2] [^1174RL31].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and reversibility of bone loss. In adults, mean lumbar spine BMD declines by about 2.9% at 1 year, 4.1% at 2 years, and reaches roughly 5.4% by 5 years. After stopping, there is only partial recovery toward baseline over 2 years, with less complete recovery after longer durations of use, which supports the label's caution about incomplete reversibility [^114Q7E3G]. In adolescents, the losses are greater at the hip and femoral neck, and crucially, in those treated for more than 2 years, total hip and femoral neck BMD did not return to baseline even 5 years after discontinuation, underscoring the unique vulnerability during the bone accretion window [^111W9Vge] [^113NhdKy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about fractures. I initially thought the fracture risk might be clearly elevated, but I should double-check the epidemiology. A large UK retrospective cohort found a modest increase in overall fracture incidence among DMPA users (IRR ~1.41), yet there was no increase in osteoporotic fractures specifically, and the study could not establish causality or late-life fracture risk, so the clinical translation remains uncertain despite the BMD signal [^112cEuqa] [^114QtRTF]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should also note that observational fracture data are confounded by lifestyle and selection factors, so causality remains unproven even as the BMD biology is biologically plausible and consistent [^112cEuqa].

> Next, I should review guideline positions. ACOG's Committee Opinion explicitly states that the effect of DMPA on BMD should not prevent prescribing or continuing use beyond 2 years; instead, clinicians should counsel, assess risk factors, and consider mitigation strategies, balancing bone effects against the risks of unintended pregnancy, especially in adolescents who may have few equally effective, acceptable alternatives [^113PxyCP]. The CDC's US Selected Practice Recommendations emphasize counseling on bleeding changes and do not impose a hard time limit on DMPA use, reinforcing individualized decision-making rather than a categorical cutoff [^114iucxK].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In adolescents and young adults, the FDA highlights particular concern because DMPA may reduce acquisition of peak bone mass, with adolescent data showing incomplete BMD recovery at the hip years after discontinuation; therefore, extended use warrants heightened caution and proactive bone health strategies if no better method is acceptable or available [^113kfjDL] [^111W9Vge]. In women with preexisting osteoporosis risk factors (chronic steroid or anticonvulsant use, eating disorders, alcohol/tobacco use, strong family history), the balance may tilt more strongly toward alternatives or enhanced bone protection if DMPA is continued [^116SGnh2].

> Let me consider risk–benefit framing carefully. The absolute risk of fracture from DMPA appears low in typical reproductive-age users, and the consequences of unintended pregnancy — especially adolescent pregnancy — can be substantial. Thus, for many patients, continued DMPA may be appropriate after shared decision-making that incorporates bone risks, patient preferences, and contraceptive needs [^113PxyCP]. I should confirm that counseling includes discussion of irregular bleeding, weight changes, and delayed return to fertility, which are common and can influence continuation, even though they are not the primary bone-related concern here [^114iucxK] [^113GKybb].

> Now, I will examine mitigation strategies if use beyond 2 years is necessary. I should confirm that lifestyle measures (weight-bearing and resistance exercise, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake) are advised, and that periodic clinical reassessment of bone risk is reasonable in higher-risk or longer-term users, even though routine universal BMD screening is not mandated by guidelines for all long-term users [^111e8At2]. In select cases with significant BMD loss or high fracture risk, adding estrogen therapy (for example, conjugated estrogens) during ongoing DMPA has evidence for attenuating lumbar spine BMD loss, though this must be individualized and is not standard for all users [^114hgV8k]. Hold on, I should verify that any such strategy is coordinated with the patient's risk profile and contraindications to estrogen before proposing it [^114hgV8k].

> But wait, what if acceptable alternatives exist? I should review options with favorable bone profiles. Long-acting reversible contraception such as the copper IUD, levonorgestrel IUD, and etonogestrel implant provide highly effective contraception without the hypoestrogenic bone effects seen with DMPA; when acceptable, switching can mitigate bone concerns while maintaining efficacy, and extended-use guidance supports prolonged IUD effectiveness in many contexts [^111VpfVG]. Let me reconsider: if patient preference or medical contraindications preclude these, DMPA may still be the best available option, but the rationale for extended use should be documented clearly in the record [^113PxyCP].

> I should double-check the bottom line. Yes, Depo-Provera can be used beyond 2 years, but it is not the preferred long-term strategy and should be reserved for situations where other acceptable contraceptive options are inadequate, after informed counseling about bone effects, with individualized risk assessment and consideration of mitigation steps. This approach aligns with FDA labeling, ACOG guidance, and CDC practice recommendations [^111ChFRC] [^113PxyCP] [^114iucxK].

Depo-Provera (DMPA) can be used beyond 2 years only when **other options are inadequate** [^1174RL31] and the benefits outweigh the risks, with **shared decision-making** and regular monitoring of bone health [^113PxyCP]. Long-term use is linked to **significant bone mineral density loss** [^111ChFRC] that may not fully recover after stopping, especially in adolescents and young adults [^111W9Vge]. If continued beyond 2 years, assess bone density, ensure adequate calcium/vitamin D, and consider alternative contraception when possible [^116SGnh2].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **FDA guidance**: Depo-Provera is not recommended as a long-term (> 2 years) contraceptive unless other options are inadequate [^1174RL31] [^1179gFAn].

- **ACOG guidance**: Use clinical judgment; balance bone effects against pregnancy risks and patient preferences [^113PxyCP].

- **WHO guidance**: No absolute limit; use the lowest effective dose and monitor bone health with prolonged use.

---

## Bone mineral density (BMD) considerations

- **Bone loss**: Significant BMD loss occurs with prolonged use [^114Q7E3G] and may not fully recover after discontinuation [^111ChFRC].

- **Adolescents**: Particularly concerning due to potential reduction in peak bone mass and increased future fracture risk [^116SGnh2].

- **Adults**: Partial BMD recovery occurs after discontinuation, but recovery is incomplete with longer use [^114Q7E3G].

---

## Clinical evidence on long-term use

| **Study** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| Long-term adult use | - Mean BMD decrease of 5–6% after 5 years [^114Q7E3G] <br/> - Partial recovery after discontinuation [^114Q7E3G] |
| Adolescent use | - Greater BMD loss at hip and femoral neck [^111W9Vge] <br/> - Incomplete recovery after > 2 years of use [^113NhdKy] |
| Fracture risk | - Slightly increased overall fracture risk [^112cEuqa] <br/> - No clear increase in osteoporotic fractures |

---

## Risks and benefits of prolonged use

### Risks

- **Bone health**: Significant BMD loss and potential fracture risk [^111ChFRC].

- **Delayed fertility**: Return to ovulation may be delayed after discontinuation [^113GKybb].

- **Other risks**: Weight gain, irregular bleeding, and possible increased breast cancer risk with long-term use [^111e8At2] [^117XiiBh].

---

### Benefits

High efficacy and convenience drive **strong contraceptive effectiveness** [^114Q7E3G] [^1123hiDQ], and **noncontraceptive benefits** include reduced menstrual blood loss and anemia, as well as management of endometriosis-associated pain [^1179gFAn].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

- **Bone health monitoring**: Consider DXA every 2–3 years for prolonged use, especially in adolescents and high-risk patients [^notfound].

- **Calcium and vitamin D**: Ensure adequate intake to mitigate bone loss [^111e8At2].

- **Alternative contraception**: Consider switching methods if prolonged use is anticipated or if bone loss is significant [^116SGnh2].

---

## Alternative contraceptive options

- **LARC methods**: IUDs and implants are highly effective and do not affect BMD [^117WcrS5].

- **Non-hormonal methods**: Copper IUD and barrier methods are options without hormonal effects [^notfound].

- **Combined hormonal contraceptives**: May be suitable for some patients, but consider individual risk factors [^113gH8a8].

---

## Patient counseling and shared decision-making

Counsel patients on **bone health risks**, potential fertility delay, and other side effects [^116Wxxbw]. Tailor decisions to patient preferences, medical history, and risk tolerance [^113gH8a8]. Reassess periodically to ensure continued appropriateness and safety [^116SGnh2].

---

Depo-Provera can be used beyond 2 years only when **other options are inadequate**, with careful monitoring and counseling. Prolonged use carries significant bone health risks, particularly in adolescents, and decisions should be individualized based on patient preferences and clinical judgment [^116SGnh2].

Contraceptive efficacy, doses, and DMPA-IM vs DMPA-SC

Minimum or threshold doses of contraceptives required to maintain contraceptive efficacy have to our knowledge not been defined for most forms of HC. This poses a particular problem regarding side effects such as risks for HIV-1 acquisition. For some forms of HC, it may be possible to decrease side effects using lower doses while maintaining contraceptive efficacy. However, this requires an understanding of the relationship between dose and biological response for contraception and a particular side effect. More research is needed to define these relationships, in particular for MPA.

Studies addressing the benefits of the lower dose injectable DMPA-SC have convincingly demonstrated its important advantages of usability due to self-administration. DMPA-IM (150 mg) contains a higher dose of MPA than that required for contraceptive efficacy, because lowering the dose of MPA by 31% (from 150 mg to 104 mg) maintains contraceptive efficacy. Importantly, however, note that there is no evidence of a substantial advantage provided by the lower dose DMPA-SC over DMPA-IM (Depo-Provera) with respect to its biological properties, effects on the immune system, and side-effect risk profile. The assumption that lowering the dose by 31% will decrease side effects is not based on evidence or sound theoretical considerations. It has not been established that the C max serum levels of DMPA-IM and DMPA-SC are different, because no comparisons of these have been performed in the same study, and studies not performed in parallel have shown a wide degree of variability in measured C max serum levels. In the one published study that did compare serum levels in parallel, the earliest measurement was at 6 months after the first administration. In this study the serum concentrations for DMPA-IM and DMPA-SC were not significantly different after 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years of usage, showing that the 31% lower dose does not significantly affect serum concentrations at these time points. Both DMPA-IM and DMPA-SC result in similar degrees of hypoestrogenism, with typical circulation estrogen concentrations of 10 to 100 pg/mL, which fluctuate widely in obese women for DMPA-SC. GCs have a well-established role in decreasing bone mineral density. Unlike other forms of HC, both DMPA-IM and DMPA-SC result in a similar transient decrease in bone mineral density, which is likely due to the GC-like properties of MPA, acting via the GR, as well as their hypoestrogenic effects. Taken together, the previous facts suggest that an increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition with DMPA-IM would most likely be similar to that of DMPA-SC, especially the underlying mechanisms that are mediated via the GR. The use of MPA doses < 104 mg used in DMPA-SC is currently being explored in clinical trials for contraception efficacy. Detailed dose-titration studies using primary immune cells and relevant cell lines suggest that significant detectable changes in the effect of MPA and other progestins on immune mechanisms typically occur with 10- to 100-fold changes in concentration. Regrettably, although Sayana Press provides substantially improved usability and important public health benefits, a 31% decrease in MPA dose is not likely to provide a substantial benefit in terms of ameliorating the negative effect of MPA on biological processes in women. Similar considerations need to be taken into account when lowering doses of any HC in an attempt to decrease side effects.

### Clinical trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medroxyprogesterone acetate after subcutaneous administration of depo-provera [^116f25RV]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

The subcutaneous (SC) route of administration, characterized by slower absorption and a more sustained release when compared with intramuscular injection, provides a path toward lowering the effective dose of a drug. By changing the route of administration, Pfizer developed Depo-SubQ Provera 104 (104 mg/0.65 mL) for SC injection (Depo-SubQ 104) that is similar to the 3-month Depo-Provera (150 mg/mL) for intramuscular use (Depo-Provera) but uses 30% less drug. The same conceptual approach may be applied to extend the duration of action without increasing the dose. In the Pfizer dose-finding study, the average medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) concentrations at day 112 after 100 and 150 mg doses were well above 0.2 ng/mL (the threshold presumed necessary to exert a consistent contraceptive effect). According to the labeling of Depo-SubQ 104, mean serum concentrations of MPA remain within the contraceptive range 150 days after a single injection of that product. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that a 44% increase of the SC dose (i.e. from 104 to 150 mg) may result in concentrations of MPA that are consistent with suppression of ovulation for at least 6 months and that 150 mg of Depo-Provera has a potential to provide 6 months of contraceptive protection if injected SC. We conducted a pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) study of 150 mg and 300 mg of Depo-Provera injected via off-label SC route, to identify the lowest of the two doses that effectively suppresses ovulation for at least 6 months and has a PK profile consistent with contraceptive effect for 6 months.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^114iucxK]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) counseling and evidence — During contraceptive counseling and before initiation of DMPA, information about common side effects such as irregular bleeding should be discussed, and bleeding or spotting is common with DMPA use; in addition, amenorrhea is common after ≥ 1 years of continuous use and these bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Enhanced counseling has been demonstrated to reduce DMPA discontinuation in clinical trials, and evidence is limited on specific drugs, doses, and durations for effective treatments, so this report includes general recommendations rather than specific regimens. Two small studies found significant cessation of bleeding within 7 days of starting treatment among DMPA users taking valdecoxib for 5 days or mefenamic acid for 5 days compared with placebo; treatment with EE was found to stop bleeding better than placebo during the treatment period, and in one small study among DMPA users with amenorrhea for 2 months, COCs alleviated amenorrhea better than placebo; no studies examined the effects of aspirin on bleeding irregularities among DMPA users.

### Pharmacokinetics, ovulation suppression and return to ovulation following a lower dose subcutaneous formulation of depo-provera [^112uXY3R]. Contraception (2004). Low credibility.

Depo-Provera is a highly effective contraceptive, given intramuscularly (150 mg/mL) once every 3 months. It has been in use in the United States for over 10 years. A new lower-dose formulation of Depo-Provera (104 mg/0.65 mL), has been developed that allows subcutaneous injection, potentially increasing the convenience, ease of administration and tolerability of this contraceptive. This prospective, randomized, single-center, single-dose trial evaluates the pharmacokinetics of the lower-dose formulation of Depo-Provera and compares the lower-dose formulation to the original formulation with regard to efficacy and duration of ovulation suppression and the return to ovulation at 12 months. While delivering a 30% lower total dose than the intramuscular formulation, the lower-dose formulation of Depo-Provera suppressed ovulation for more than 13 weeks in all subjects and was not affected by body mass index or race. Median time for return to ovulation was 30 weeks, with a 97.4% cumulative rate of return to ovulation at 12 months.

### Clinical trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medroxyprogesterone acetate after subcutaneous administration of depo-provera [^114egjGg]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medroxyprogesterone acetate after a single subcutaneous injection in the abdomen of 150 or 300 mg Depo-Provera and compare results to two injections of Depo-SubQ Provera 104 given 3 months apart.

Design

Partially randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study.

Setting

Research unit.

Patient(s)

Forty-two women of reproductive age with confirmed ovulatory cycle and body mass index of 18–35 kg/m².

Intervention(s)

Women received a single subcutaneous injection of 150 mg (n = 24) or 300 mg (n = 9) of Depo-Provera or two injections of Depo-SubQ Provera 104 (n = 9).

Main Outcome Measure(s)

Suppression of ovulation as measured by progesterone, serum medroxyprogesterone acetate concentrations, and estimated pharmacokinetics parameters.

Result(s)

No ovulations were observed during 7 months after a single injection of 150 or 300 mg Depo-Provera. The 150 mg group had a similar C max as observed over two injection cycles of Depo-SubQ Provera 104 and a similar 6-month trough concentration as the 3-month trough of Depo-SubQ Provera 104.

Conclusion(s)

Our pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics data provide proof of concept that Depo-Provera (150 mg) may be an effective contraceptive method when injected subcutaneously every 6 months, with up to a 4-week grace period for reinjections.

Clinical Trial Registration Number

NCT02456584.

### Pregnancies diagnosed during depo-provera use [^111bUrVf]. Contraception (2002). Low credibility.

We conducted a review of contraceptive failures among women using Depo-Provera (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate), using reports to the Insurance Division of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. Cases were included if the Depo-Provera had been given at a Planned Parenthood center and pregnancy had either been diagnosed by, or reported to, a Planned Parenthood center. There were 402 reports of pregnancy from 1994 through 1998. The crude rate of reported pregnancies was 0.42 pregnancies per 1000 women using Depo-Provera each year. Pregnancy was diagnosed after the first trimester in 46% of women. Seventy-seven women (19.1%) received additional Depo-Provera injections while pregnant. Of the women whose date of conception could be estimated, 113 of 258 (45%) became pregnant after the injection. There was no observed increase in ectopic pregnancy rate, and no fetal anomalies were reported. Although pregnancy during Depo-Provera use is rare, it does occur. These pregnancies are frequently unrecognized until beyond first trimester.

Boxed warning regarding the use of medroxyprogesterone IM (also known as Provera, Depo-Provera, Depo-SubQ Provera) and decreased bone mineral density: maintain a high level of suspicion, as medroxyprogesterone reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density especially, when used for long term therapy.

### How do health care professionals respond to advice on adverse side effects of contraceptive methods? The case of depo provera [^112HXzuA]. Contraception (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Depomedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) (Depo Provera) is a long-acting contraceptive popular in the United Kingdom, particularly among young women. In the United States, use of DMPA has been instrumental in reducing teenage pregnancy rates. Evidence for a detrimental effect of DMPA on bone mineral density led to advice from drug regulatory authorities in the United Kingdom and the United States, recommending caution in prescribing DMPA, particularly for young people.

Objective

The study was conducted to explore changes in practice in response to prescribing advice about DMPA among primary care doctors and nurses working in the UK.

Methods

A self-completed questionnaire sent to 420 primary care health professionals.

Results

In response to the advice, 16% of practitioners would deter all women, and one third would deter young women, from using DMPA. One in five practitioners would limit use of DMPA to 2 years. Fewer than one in 10 would suggest contraceptive implants as an alternative contraceptive.

Conclusions

The response of primary care professionals in their prescribing advice about DMPA risks increasing rates of unintended pregnancy in the UK, particularly among teenagers. The findings demonstrate an urgent need for a clear, balanced approach to advising health professionals on how to respond to new findings about adverse effects of contraceptives.

14.5	Bone Fracture Incidence in Women Treated with Depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate for Contraception

A retrospective cohort study to assess the association between DMPA-IM injection and the incidence of bone fractures was conducted in 312,395 female contraceptive users in the UK. The incidence rates of fracture were compared between DMPA-IM users and contraceptive users who had no recorded use of DMPA-IM. The Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) for any fracture during the follow-up period (mean = 5.5 years) was 1.41 (95% CI 1.35, 1.47). It is not known if this is due to DMPA-IM use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate.

In the study, when cumulative exposure to DMPA-IM was calculated, the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections. However, it is not clear that cumulative exposure, which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non-use, is a useful measure of risk, as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use.

There were very few osteoporotic fractures (fracture sites known to be related to low BMD) in the study overall, and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in DMPA-IM users compared to non-users.

Importantly, this study could not determine whether use of DMPA-IM has an effect on fracture rate later in life. Given the similar effects on BMD from depo-subQ provera 104 and DMPA-IM described above, bone fracture incidence may also be expected to be similar.

14.6	Bone Mineral Density in Women Treated with depo-SubQ provera 104 for Endometriosis

In two clinical studies of 573 adult women with endometriosis, the BMD effects of 6 months of depo-subQ provera 104 treatment (104 mg subcutaneously every 3 months) were compared to 6 months of leuprolide treatment (either 11.25 mg given subcutaneously every 3 months or 3.75 mg given subcutaneously every month). Subjects were then observed after treatment completion, for an additional 12 months. See Table 7 for the results.

### Weight change among women using intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, a copper intrauterine device, or a levonorgestrel implant for contraception: findings from a randomised, multicentre, open-label trial [^11565Wro]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

2.2 Randomisation, masking and procedures

At enrolment, women were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to the DMPA-IM group, Copper IUD group, or LNG implant group. Participants received a Cu IUD (Optima TCu380A; Injeflex, Sao Paolo, Brazil), an LNG implant (Jadelle; Bayer, Turku, Finland) or an injection of 150 mg/mL DMPA-IM (Depo Provera; Pfizer, Puurs, Belgium), which was provided on site at enrolment and for the DMPA-IM group at every 3-monthly follow-up visit up to 18 months.

Ethics review committees at each study site, FHI 360, and the World Health Organization (WHO) approved the study protocol. Women provided written informed consent in a language of their choice prior to the conduct of any study related procedures.

Outcomes: The primary outcome of this secondary analysis is weight change from study enrolment to the final visit at study month 12–18.

2.3 Statistical analysis

To examine our hypothesis that POC use may increase weight over time, we used linear regression to examine the effect of randomised contraceptive method on weight at final visit, adjusting for weight at baseline, site, and study month of final visit (to account for exit visits varying from 12/15/18 months). The analysis was performed in two ways: (1) as an intention to treat (ITT) analysis, in which final visit data on all women was included, even if they discontinued their randomised method prior to the final visit; (2) as a "Continuous Use" analysis including only women who continued their randomised method through their final visit. Women were considered to have discontinued their randomised method as follows; for those randomised to DMPA, if they did not start on the day of enrolment or more than 119 days elapsed between injections; for those randomised to implant, if not started on the day of enrolment or ≥ 1 day elapsed before reinsertion after removal for any reason; or for Copper IUD if more than 30 days elapsed before initial insertion, or more than 28 days elapsed before re-insertion after an expulsion, or ≥ 1 day elapsed before re-insertion following removal for any reason. In both ITT and continuous use analyses, women were excluded from the analysis if pregnant during the study, up to and including at the final visit.

5.7	Weight Gain

Weight gain is a common occurrence in women using depo-subQ provera 104. In three large clinical trials using depo-subQ provera 104, the mean weight gain was 3.5 lb (1.6 kg) in the first year of use. In a small, two-year study comparing depo-subQ provera 104 to DMPA-IM, the mean weight gain observed for women using depo-subQ provera 104 [7.5 lb (3.4 kg)] was similar to the mean weight gain for women using DMPA-IM [7.6 lb (3.5 kg)].

Although there are no data related to weight gain beyond 2 years for depo-subQ provera 104, the data on DMPA-IM may be relevant. In a clinical study, after five years, 41 women using Depo-Provera CI (150 mg) had a mean weight gain of 11.2 lb (5.1 kg), while 114 women using non-hormonal contraception had a mean weight gain of 6.4 lb (2.9 kg).

5.8	Delayed Return of Ovulation or Fertility

Return to ovulation is likely to be delayed after stopping depo-subQ provera 104, as demonstrated in a study of 15 women who received multiple doses of depo-subQ provera 104:

Median time to ovulation was 10 months after the last injection.
Earliest return to ovulation was 6 months after the last injection.
12 women (80%) ovulated within 1 year of the last injection.

However, ovulation has occurred as early as 14 weeks after a single dose of depo-subQ provera 104; therefore, administer the next depo-subQ provera 104 12 to 14 weeks after the last injection.

Return to fertility also is likely to be delayed after stopping therapy. Among 28 women using depo-subQ provera 104 for contraception who stopped treatment to become pregnant, 7 women were lost to follow-up. One woman became pregnant within one year of her last injection and another woman became pregnant 443 days after her last injection. The remaining 19 women had not become pregnant; it is not known if these 19 women were still attempting to become pregnant or if they had started a new contraceptive method.

### Clinical trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medroxyprogesterone acetate after subcutaneous administration of depo-provera [^116ALJNT]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

The secondary PK outcome was estimated based on serum MPA levels that were measured in the test groups on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 18; then at weeks 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 26, 28, 30, 32; then every 28 days until return of ovulation, or month 12, whichever was earlier. In the reference group the sampling schedule differed slightly to measure MPA levels around the time of the second injection. If ovulation had not returned by month 12, MPA was measured at weeks 61 and again at week 74 if ovulation was not detected earlier.

Safety was assessed throughout the study by monitoring vital signs (blood pressure and pulse), weight, use of concomitant medications, occurrence of adverse events, and injections site reactions. Bleeding was assessed at day 7, months 3 and 7.5, and at the final visit through questions about changes in bleeding pattern since last visit (e.g. spotting, regular, irregular, or no bleeding at all), and whether the participant found her new bleeding pattern acceptable. Possible suppression of adrenal function due to the MPA glucocorticoid-like effect was evaluated by measuring serum cortisol at baseline and treatment days 5, 7, 14, 42, and month 3 and 7.5. Acceptability was assessed at the end of the injection visit, at day 7, months 3 and 7.5, and at the final visit through questions about likes and dislikes of the method, preferred reinjection frequency, and whether participants would use this method for contraception if it was found to be effective for 6 months. Women with delayed return to ovulation (more than 12 months from treatment initiation) were monitored by measuring P and E 2 weekly up to 5 times during month 15 and again during month 18 if ovulation was not detected earlier.

5.1	Loss of Bone Mineral Density

Use of Depo-Provera CI reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of Depo-Provera CI by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life.

A study to assess the reversibility of loss of BMD in adolescents was conducted with Depo-Provera CI. After discontinuing Depo-Provera CI in these adolescents, mean BMD loss at the total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 5 years (60 months) post-treatment in the sub-group of adolescents who were treated for more than 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Similarly, in adults, there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine towards baseline by 2 years post-treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

The use of Depo-Provera CI is not recommended as a long-term (i.e., longer than 2 years) birth control method unless other options are considered inadequate. BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use Depo-Provera CI long-term. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity.

Other birth control methods should be considered in the risk/benefit analysis for the use of Depo-Provera CI in women with osteoporosis risk factors. Depo-Provera CI can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., metabolic bone disease, chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, anorexia nervosa, strong family history of osteoporosis or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids).

Injectable contraception has been a cornerstone of international family planning programs for decades. An estimated 74 million women worldwide use injectable contraceptives to prevent pregnancy. Depending on the formulation, currently available injectables are effective for 1–3 months, requiring women to return to their provider monthly or quarterly. A need for frequent reinjections is recognized as a significant disadvantage of this method. Previous research has demonstrated that injectable contraceptives with a longer interval between injections led to better adherence and continuation rates when compared with those with shorter intervals. A longer-acting injectable could facilitate use, improve continuation, possibly increase effectiveness, and provide women with greater choice. Six months is a target duration from a safety perspective for a hormonal method that cannot be discontinued immediately in case of unwanted side effects or emerging medical contraindications and is preferred by both users and providers. While efforts are under way to develop novel sustained drug delivery technologies that hold promise for the development of a new 6-month injectable contraceptive product, the adaptation of existing methods for novel uses is an appealing, cost-efficient approach to expedite availability of new contraceptive options.

Past or Present Use of Hormonal Contraception

There have been conflicting data regarding the effect of hormonal contraception on breast cancer risk. A large meta-analysis in 1996 revealed a small increased risk of breast cancer among women with current or recent oral contraceptive use (RR 1.07, SD 0.02, P < .001). Similar findings were noted in a large cohort study in 2017 (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.14–1.26). The absolute risk was quite small (one additional breast cancer diagnosis for every 7,690 women using hormonal contraception each year). In both studies, breast cancer risk returned to baseline 5–10 years after discontinuing hormonal contraception. Most studies do not suggest an increased risk of breast cancer among women using a levonorgestrel intrauterine system (IUS) or depo-medroxyprogesterone injections. – There are limited data regarding the etonogestrel implant, but no study to date has demonstrated an increased breast cancer risk.

The risks of hormonal contraception must be weighed against the health, social, and economic consequences of unplanned pregnancy, as well as the many noncontraceptive benefits of hormonal contraception. The maternal mortality rate in the United States in 2015 was 26.4 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies, which is comparable with the rate of excess breast cancer diagnoses (13 [95% CI 10–16]/100,000 person years) related to hormonal contraception suggested by the 2017 cohort study. Hormonal contraception, particularly oral contraceptives, significantly decreases the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancers. There are no screening guidelines that specifically address exposure to hormonal contraception, so routine breast cancer screening is recommended in the absence of other risk factors for early-onset breast cancer.

14.4	Bone Mineral Density Changes in Adolescent Females (12 to 18 years of age) Treated with DMPA-IM

The effect of DMPA-IM on BMD in adolescents is described below, and the effect of depo-subQ provera 104 on BMD in adolescents is expected to be similar. The impact of DMPA-IM use for up to 240 weeks (4.6 years) was evaluated in an open-label non-randomized clinical study in 389 adolescent females (12 to 18 years of age). Use of DMPA-IM was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD.

Partway through the trial, DMPA-IM administration was stopped (at 120 weeks). The mean number of injections per DMPA-IM user was 9.3. Table 5 summarizes the study findings. The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use. The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip (-6.4%) and femoral neck (-5.4%) compared to lumbar spine (-2.1%).

Adolescents in the untreated cohort had an increase in BMD during the period of growth following menarche. However, the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age, gynecologic age, race, BMD, and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of BMD.

BMD Recovery Post-Treatment in Adolescents

Longer duration of treatment and smoking were associated with less recovery of BMD following the last injection of DMPA-IM. Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post-treatment for adolescents who received DMPA-IM for two years or less compared to more than two years. Post-treatment follow-up showed that, in adolescents treated for more than two years, only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued. Adolescents treated with DMPA-IM for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at the femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post-treatment. Adolescents in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Return to Ovulation

None of the 38 evaluable women ovulated before month 7.5, with the earliest ovulation occurring in the 150 mg group on day 226 (7.5 months). The estimated probabilities of return to ovulation at month 12 were 65%, 25%, and 11% in the 150 mg, 300 mg, and Depo-SubQ 104 groups, respectively (Fig. 2). The woman in the 150 mg group who was censored from analysis on day 74 due to the use of a prohibited medication ovulated after month 12. All three participants who were excluded from the primary analysis due to detectable MPA at baseline ovulated between months 7.5 and 12.

Figure 2
Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative probabilities of return to ovulation, with 95% confidence intervals and numbers at risk below the x -axis. The estimated probabilities at month 12 were 65%, 25%, and 11% in the 150 mg, 300 mg, and Depo-SubQ 104 groups, respectively (P = 0.009 for test of difference in distributions across groups). The earliest ovulation occurred on day 226 in the 150 mg group (median = 320 days). All doses were administered subcutaneously. The Depo-SubQ 104 group received a second injection on day 91.

Supportive PD Analysis

Among participants who ovulated on and before month 12, the average maximum ovulatory P concentration of 10.3 ng/mL (range, 4.8–21.4) was lower than the average maximum P concentration of 14.5 ng/mL (range, 8.6–24.5) recorded among those participants at pretreatment.

Only one out of 21 evaluable women in the 150 mg group ovulated in the period when follicle growth was monitored by TVS. This participant had a rupture of the lead follicle (measured at 25 mm before rupture) on day 223 followed by elevated P of 7.4 ng/mL on day 226. Her day 224 MPA concentration was 0.186 ng/mL. Of the remaining 20 women, all but one had follicular activity documented by both elevated E 2 levels and the growth of at least one lead follicle ≥ 15 mm (mean of maximum follicle size: 25.8 mm), but follicular rupture was not observed among any of these women during the 22- to 32-week assessment period.

What are the possible side effects of Depo-Provera CI?

Depo-Provera CI can cause serious side effects, including:

Effect on the bones: See "What is the most important information I should know about Depo-Provera CI?".

Teenage years are the most important years to gain bone strength. The decrease in calcium in your bones is of most concern if you are a teenager or have the following problems:
bone disease
an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa)
a strong family history of osteoporosis
you take a drug that can lower the amount of calcium in your bones (drugs for epilepsy or steroid drugs)
you drink a lot of alcohol (more than 2 drinks a day)
you smoke
If you need a birth control method for more than 2 years, your healthcare professional may switch you to another birth control method instead of using Depo-Provera CI. If you continue using Depo-Provera CI, your healthcare professional may ask you to have a bone test, especially if you have other risks for weak bones.

When Depo-Provera CI is stopped, your bones may start to regain calcium. However, in a study of teenage girls who used Depo-Provera CI for more than 2 years, their hip bones did not completely recover by 5 years after they stopped using Depo-Provera CI. Taking calcium and Vitamin D and exercising daily may lessen the loss of calcium from your bones.
possible increased risk of breast cancer. Women who use Depo-Provera CI may have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer compared to non-users.
blood clots in your arms, legs, lungs, and eyes
stroke
a pregnancy outside of your uterus (ectopic pregnancy). Ectopic pregnancy is a medical emergency that often requires surgery. Ectopic pregnancy can cause internal bleeding, infertility, and even death.
allergic reactions. Severe allergic reactions have been reported in some women using Depo-Provera CI.
loss of vision or other eye problems
migraine headaches
depression
convulsions or seizures

2	DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended dose is 150 mg of Depo-Provera CI every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep, intramuscular (IM) injection in the gluteal or deltoid muscle. (2.1)

2.1	Prevention of Pregnancy

Both the 1 mL vial and the 1 mL prefilled syringe of Depo-Provera CI should be vigorously shaken just before use to ensure that the dose being administered represents a uniform suspension.

The recommended dose is 150 mg of Depo-Provera CI every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep intramuscular (IM) injection using strict aseptic technique in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, rotating the sites with every injection. As with any IM injection, to avoid an inadvertent subcutaneous injection, body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection to determine if a longer needle is necessary particularly for gluteal IM injection.

Use for longer than 2 years is not recommended (unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate) due to the impact of long-term Depo-Provera CI treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

To ensure the patient is not pregnant at the time of the first injection, the first injection should be given ONLY during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period or within the first 5-days post‑partum. In post‑partum mothers who exclusively breastfeed, administer Depo‑Provera CI during or after the sixth post‑partum week. If the time interval between injections is greater than 13 weeks, the physician should determine that the patient is not pregnant before administering the drug. The efficacy of Depo-Provera CI depends on adherence to the dosage schedule of administration.

2.2	Switching from Other Methods of Contraception

When switching from other contraceptive methods, Depo-Provera CI should be given in a manner that ensures continuous contraceptive coverage based upon the mechanism of action of both methods, (e.g., patients switching from oral contraceptives should have their first injection of Depo-Provera CI on the day after the last active tablet or at the latest, on the day following the final inactive tablet).

Results

A total of 52 healthy women were screened, and 42 of them (80.8%) were enrolled in the study: 36 (69.2%) participants were randomized into one of the three study groups, and six participants were purposefully enrolled into the 150 mg group at the DR site to achieve the target sample size of 24 in that group. The enrollment in the 300 mg and references groups was curtailed from 12 to nine women due to slower than expected enrollment at one of the sites.

One participant in the 150 mg group refused injection after being randomized, and an additional three women had baseline MPA concentration exceeding 5% of their individual C max, leaving a total of 38 women evaluable for the primary PK and PD analyses (Fig. 1). One woman in the 150 mg group also had her data excluded after day 74 due to the use of a prohibited medication.

Figure 1
Participant disposition.

The median age of 38 evaluable participants was 34, ranging from 25 to 39 years; most (94.7%) were sexually active with a male partner; and most (92.1%) considered themselves biracial (Table 1). All but one participant (97.4%) had previously been pregnant. The most common contraceptive method used in the past was combined oral contraceptives (86.8%), followed by Depo-Provera (76.3%), condoms (68.4%), and implants (23.7%). Nearly all woman (94.7%) were sterilized. Median weight and BMI were 67.1 kg (47–83) and 26.5 kg/m² (18–33), respectively, but were somewhat higher in the 300 mg group (76.6 kg and 30.6 kg/m²). There were no other meaningful differences between the treatment groups in the demographic and baseline characteristics.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, therefore adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The data described below reflect exposure to depo-subQ provera 104 in five clinical trials involving 2325 women including 2043 women who received treatment for contraception (1780 treated up to 1 year and 263 treated for up to 2 years) and 282 women for endometriosis for up to 6 months. In these pooled trials, 9% of women discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction and the most common reason for discontinuation was dysfunctional uterine bleeding (3%).

Adverse Reactions in the Contraception Adult Studies

Table 1 presents frequently reported adverse reactions (> 1%) in the contraception pooled studies. In these studies, the most frequently reported adverse reactions (> 5%) were dysfunctional uterine bleeding (e.g., irregular, increased, decreased, or spotting), headache, increased weight, amenorrhea, and injection site reactions (e.g., pain/tenderness, nodule/lump, persistent atrophy/indentation/dimpling or lipodystrophy).

The frequency reported is based on the all-causality incidence in the pooled results of the three contraception studies. Closely related "Adverse Reaction" terms were grouped but individual patients reporting two or more grouped events were only counted once.

Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding

The extent of bleeding and spotting in the three contraception trials is presented in Figure N; data from the endometriosis trials are presented in Figure O [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### A village would be nice but… it takes a long-acting contraceptive to prevent repeat adolescent pregnancies [^114ztwkr]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine which components of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, adolescent-oriented maternity program help teenage mothers delay subsequent pregnancies.

Design/Setting/Patients

A cohort of 373 participants in a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, adolescent-oriented maternity program was studied.

Intervention

The program was designed to prevent rapid subsequent pregnancies directly by simplifying access to contraceptives and indirectly by discouraging school drop-out and encouraging the pursuit of careers incompatible with closely spaced childbearing. Parents and children were seen together; nine visits were scheduled during the first postpartum year and four visits during the second year.

Main Outcome Measure

Repeat adolescent pregnancy.

Results

The repeat pregnancy rate was 14% at 1 year and 35% at 2 years. Teenage mothers who became pregnant exhibited significantly more repeat pregnancy risk factors but were as compliant with clinic visits as their nonpregnant peers. The contraceptive choices the teenagers made during the puerperium had the most profound effect on their subsequent fertility. A logistic regression analysis identified failure to use Norplant during the puerperium as the strongest predictor of repeat pregnancy during the first 2 postpartum years (relative risk [RR] = 8.89; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.80–28.50). Exhibiting nine or more repeat pregnancy risk factors (RR = 2.37; 95% CI = 1.38–4.06) and not using Depo-Provera during the puerperium (RR = 2.30; 95% CI = 1.60–3.29) also predicted repeat conception, but clinic visits and return to school postpartum did not.

Conclusions

Using a long-acting hormonal contraceptive during the puerperium was associated with pregnancy prevention during the first 2 postpartum years, but frequent clinic visits, contact with supportive healthcare and social service providers, and return to school were not.

### A randomized controlled trial of estrogen replacement therapy in long-term users of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate [^114hgV8k]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Long-term use of the injectable contraceptive depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA, Depo-Provera) is associated with a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD), particularly in the lumbar spine. The cause of DMPA-associated bone loss is not known, but the relative estrogen deficiency induced by DMPA use could be responsible. We have undertaken a randomized, double-blind controlled trial of oral estrogen replacement therapy in 38 premenopausal women (mean age 37) with a minimum 2 yr DMPA use who had a below average baseline lumbar spine BMD (T score ≤ 0). Nineteen women were allocated to receive conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg/d orally) and 19 to receive a matching placebo. All continued with regular DMPA injections throughout the study. Areal bone density was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total body sites every 6 months for 2 yr; the main outcome measure being the change in areal BMD at the lumbar spine. At baseline, the two groups were well matched for demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical variables, and for BMD. Twenty-seven subjects completed at least 18 months in the study, and 26 the full 2 yr, with similar numbers dropping out from each group (mainly for personal reasons). In the estrogen-treated group, mean lumbar spine BMD increased 1%, whereas in the placebo group it fell 2.6%, over 2 yr. The between group differences were 2.0% at 12 months (P = 0.058), 3.2% at 18 months (P < 0.01), and 3.5% at 24 months (P < 0.002). Differences of lesser statistical magnitude were seen at the femoral neck (between group differences at 2 yr: 2.7%, P = 0.24), Ward's triangle (5.0%, P = 0.055), greater trochanter (3.6%, P = 0.056), total body (1.3%, P = 0.046), legs (1.3%, P = 0.065), and trunk (2.0%, P = 0.029). There were no major adverse events. These data support the view that the likely cause of DMPA-associated bone loss is estrogen deficiency and demonstrate that it can be arrested by estrogen replacement therapy.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Depo-subQ provera 104 is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy and management of endometriosis-associated pain in females of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-menarchal females under the age of 17 as for users 17 years and older.

Use of depo-subQ provera 104 is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of depo-subQ provera 104 by female adolescents will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fractures in later life. In a study of adolescent females (12–18 years of age) receiving DMPA-IM for contraception, mean BMD 2 years after starting DMPA-IM decreased 1.9% (spine), 4.3% (total hip), and 4.2% (femoral neck). In those adolescents who used DMPA-IM for more than 2 years, mean BMD at total hip and femoral neck did not return to baseline within 5 years.

Depo-subQ provera 104 is not indicated before menarche.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Depo-subQ provera 104 is not indicated in post-menopausal women.

### Contraception choices in women with underlying medical conditions [^113gH8a8]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Primary care physicians often prescribe contraceptives to women of reproductive age with comorbidities. Novel delivery systems (e.g., contraceptive patch, contraceptive ring, single-rod implantable device) may change traditional risk and benefit profiles in women with comorbidities. Effective contraceptive counseling requires an understanding of a woman's preferences and medical history, as well as the risks, benefits, adverse effects, and contraindications of each method. Noncontraceptive benefits of combined hormonal contraceptives, such as oral contraceptive pills, include regulated menses, decreased dysmenorrhea, and diminished premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Oral contraceptive pills may be used safely in women with a range of medical conditions, including well-controlled hypertension, uncomplicated diabetes mellitus, depression, and uncomplicated valvular heart disease. However, women older than 35 years who smoke should avoid oral contraceptive pills. Contraceptives containing estrogen, which can increase thrombotic risk, should be avoided in women with a history of venous thromboembolism, stroke, cardiovascular disease, or peripheral vascular disease. Progestin-only contraceptives are recommended for women with contraindications to estrogen. Depo-Provera, a long-acting injectable contraceptive, may be preferred in women with sickle cell disease because it reduces the frequency of painful crises. Because of the interaction between antiepileptics and oral contraceptive pills, Depo-Provera may also be considered in women with epilepsy. Implanon, the single-rod implantable contraceptive device, may reduce symptoms of dysmenorrhea. Mirena, the levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine contraceptive system, is an option for women with menorrhagia, endometriosis, or chronic pelvic pain.

### Progestogen-only pills and high blood pressure: is there an association? A literature review [^112hSmVa]. Contraception (2004). Low credibility.

The progestogen-only pill (POP) is a contraceptive option for women who have high blood pressure either induced by use of combined oral pills or due to other causes; as long as it is well controlled and monitored. Combined oral contraception (COC) and Depo-Provera have been implicated in increased cardiovascular risk following use. High blood pressure has been theorized to be the critical path that leads to this increased risk. POP is the recommended method for women who are at risk of coronary heart disease due to presence of risk factors like hypertension. In order to offer POP as a safe, alternative contraception to women who develop hypertension on COCs or those who are at increased cardiovascular risk, it is important to take into account evidence of no association of high blood pressure with POP use. A search of published medical literature (PUBMED and Cochrane database) was undertaken with this objective. A total of four articles were selected for final review after application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three of these were prospective control trials and one a cross-sectional survey. There was no randomized study to answer this question. The results of these studies consistently reported no significant association of high blood pressure with use of POPs for up to 2–3 years of follow-up.

### Clinical trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medroxyprogesterone acetate after subcutaneous administration of depo-provera [^1113REKX]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

While the GM maximum MPA concentration in the 150 mg group (1.12 ng/mL) was significantly higher than that of the reference group in the first injection cycle (0.84 ng/mL), it was comparable to GM maximum after the second injection (1.07 ng/mL) and substantially lower than historical peak MPA after intramuscular administration of Depo-Provera (3.73 ng/mL). This, coupled with similar AUC 0–182, alleviates safety concerns related to high MPA blood levels after SC administration of a 44% higher dose than Depo-SubQ 104.

With respect to follicular activity, circulating levels of E 2 in the 150 mg group were on average consistent with midfollicular levels during the first 7 months postinjection. In contrast, the levels of E 2 in the 300 mg and reference groups were lower and consistent with early to mid-follicular E 2 levels. Less profound suppression of follicular activity and higher circulating levels of E 2 in the 150 mg group may contribute to a better safety profile, reducing adverse effects associated with hypoestrogenism that are common among users of the approved Depo-Provera injectable products, specifically reduction in bone density. A more rapid relative return to ovulation is another potential benefit. In our study, only one of nine (11%) women who received two injections of Depo-SubQ 104 over 6 months had ovulated by 12 months after treatment initiation, compared with an estimated 65% in the 150 mg group at the corresponding time point. The rest of the safety data indicate that SC administration of Depo-Provera was safe and well tolerated; menstrual irregularities were common but in general acceptable.

Our trial has limitations. Specifically, most of the study participants were of African descent, and their BMI did not exceed 35 kg/m² (class 1 obesity). We also exclusively used the abdomen as the site of injection, and the rate of absorption may differ for other injection sites. In addition, caution is required when interpreting these data due to the modest sample size, which was not designed to make definitive conclusions regarding efficacy or comparative PK. Whether our results are generalizable to a broader population and for other sites of injection remains to be established. Finally, the unblinded nature of the study introduced the possibility of bias. But the objective nature of the main study outcomes and the fact that the laboratory personnel conducting these assessments were blinded mitigated the potential impact of bias on validity of the study results.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: extended use of long-acting reversible contraception [^111VpfVG]. Contraception (2022). High credibility.

Copper 380 mm² IUD extended use — Evidence supports use to 12 years with high effectiveness; a WHO-conducted study reported no pregnancies between 8 and 12 years with 356 women completing 10 years, and another cohort prospectively followed 228 women beyond 10 years. Overall, data support continued efficacy for 2 additional years of use and with some evidence up to 5 additional years. Patients should be counseled that the contraceptive effectiveness of the copper 380 mm² IUD is maintained beyond the current FDA-approved duration of 10 to 12 years (GRADE 1B). For patients over age 30 at the time of insertion, extended use beyond 12 to 20 years or to menopause can be considered as a form of permanent, reversible contraception (GRADE 1C).

### Use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) and the depo-provera shot in adolescents [^116PX58q]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2018). Low credibility.

The intrauterine devices (IUDs) and the subdermal implant, collectively known as long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC), along with the Depo-Provera shot, represent highly efficacious methods of birth control for all reproductive-age women, including adolescents. They are also safe, private, and convenient, and can be used for their noncontraceptive benefits. Additionally, LARC and Depo-Provera represent methods of contraception that do not contain estrogen and may be safely used in young women who have contraindications to estrogen-containing medications. The LARC methods have traditionally been underused by adolescents due to lack of knowledge and misperceptions about safety and effects on future fertility. However, studies have found that when barriers to the use of LARC are removed, adolescents have increasingly chosen the IUD and implant for birth control and most continue to use these methods with satisfaction. This chapter will provide an overview of IUDs, the subdermal implant and Depo-Provera, address barriers to care for adolescents, efficacy, continuation rates, common side effects and reasons for discontinuation, contraindications, and noncontraceptive benefits.

### Medroxyprogesterone acetate (depo-subQ Provera) [^113aJ49x]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Loss of Bone Mineral Density

Use of depo-subQ provera 104 reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of depo-subQ provera 104 by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life.

A study to assess the reversibility of loss of BMD in adolescents was conducted with DMPA-IM. After discontinuing DMPA-IM in these adolescents, mean BMD loss at the total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 5 years (60 months) post-treatment in the sub-group of adolescents who were treated for more than 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Similarly, in adults, there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine towards baseline by 2 years post-treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

The use of depo-subQ provera 104 is not recommended as a long-term (i.e., longer than 2 years) birth control method or medical therapy for endometriosis-associated pain unless other options are considered inadequate. BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use depo-subQ provera 104 long-term. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity.

Other birth control methods or therapies for endometriosis-associated pain should be considered in the risk/benefit analysis for the use of depo-subQ provera 104 in women with osteoporosis risk factors. Depo-subQ provera 104 can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., metabolic bone disease, chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, anorexia nervosa, strong family history of osteoporosis, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids).

### Clinical trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medroxyprogesterone acetate after subcutaneous administration of depo-provera [^114XLEvd]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 3
Geometric mean medroxyprogesterone acetate concentrations with 95% confidence intervals (shifted slightly for visibility). Reference line at 0.35 ng/mL is geometric mean at month 3 in the Depo-SubQ 104 group. All doses were administered subcutaneously. The Depo-SubQ 104 group received a second injection on day 91.

Although individual PK profiles were highly variable, each treatment exhibited biphasic absorption on average, with a lag of about 10 days for the second phase (Fig. 3). Among participants who ovulated, the highest observed MPA level at the time of ovulation was 0.186 ng/mL. Neither age nor BMI significantly impacted estimated PK parameters (data not shown).

### Clinical trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medroxyprogesterone acetate after subcutaneous administration of depo-provera [^112zmAPF]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment was initiated in all three groups within the first 5 days of the menstrual cycle. All injections were administered SC in the abdomen after the SC injection technique recommended by Pfizer. To maintain the same depth of injection in all study groups, Depo-Provera was administered through a 26-gauge 3/8-inch needle, the needle size provided with the prefilled Depo-SubQ 104 syringe. We measured blood pressure, height, and weight and collected blood samples for MPA, P, estradiol (E 2), and cortisol before injection.

The primary PD endpoint was time to ovulation where ovulation was defined as a single elevated serum P ≥ 4.7 ng/mL (participants with elevated P were asked but not required to return within 5 days for a confirmatory measurement). Participants were monitored until they ovulated or for 12 months, whichever was earlier, but for a minimum of 7.5 months after treatment initiation. Serum P and E 2 were measured in the 150 and 300 mg test groups on days 0 (baseline), 7, and 14; then every 2 weeks until week 12; then approximately weekly until return of ovulation, or through month 12, whichever was earlier. In the reference group serum P and E 2 were measured following the same schedule as in the 150 and 300 mg through week 12. After the second injection at week 13, P and E 2 were measured every two weeks through week 25, and then approximately weekly until return of ovulation, or through month 12, whichever was earlier.

We expected that women in the 150 mg/mL group would have the greatest chance of an ovulatory response in the treatment period. For this reason, we also measured follicle growth and outcome by transvaginal sonogram (TVS) in the 150 mg group twice a week between weeks 22 and 32 (Supplemental Fig. 1). For the purpose of this protocol a lead (or dominant) follicle was defined as a follicle with the mean diameter of 12 mm or more. Follicle rupture was defined as abrupt disappearance or a reduction in size of at least 50% of the echo image of the lead follicle. The supportive PD parameters, including confirmation of elevated P, E 2, and TVS results, were not used to modify the primary definition of ovulation but rather to more accurately characterize ovarian function.

### "It's different here" Afghan refugee maternal health experiences in the United States [^112BPPuP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Postpartum

The postpartum experiences regarding breastfeeding were overwhelmingly positive. All the women except for one explained that breastfeeding was a usual and customary practice and that they breastfed their children for 2 years.

"I don't have any problem with breastfeeding my children; it's a really smooth process". (Participant 12).

Regarding child spacing, the women favored space between their children; their preferences ranged from 2 to 5 years between each child. The contraceptive methods they preferred varied. One mentioned she had a tubal ligation after her seventh child. A few of the women used the copper IUD, and others used condoms and oral contraceptives. Those who used the injection (Depo Provera) did not like the weight gain. Those with the implant perceived it to cause depression, headaches, and nausea. A few of the women who tried oral contraceptives stopped due to their side effects and resorted to the natural method.

"I do not prefer medication. I just like the natural way to not have kids" (Participant 15).

Some women discussed the lack of information provided by healthcare providers about contraceptive options.

" A lot of these Afghan ladies want to have some contraceptive after birth. But the fact that they don't get a follow-up with their obstetrician, and they're not educated enough that they can get pregnant right after giving birth, so before they even go to the OB, they're already pregnant again" (Participant 5).

Another participant shared that they need additional contraceptive education.

"It's hard to take care of ourselves with these back-to-back children. We don't know about the birth control options; we tend to stop them if we have any adverse effects" (Participant 12).

### Depo-provera and skeletal health: a survey of Florida obstetrics and gynecologist physicians [^114QqnWi]. Contraception (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

In November of 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a black box warning regarding skeletal health concerns with depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) contraception. This FDA labeling change has the potential to impact how this contraceptive is used. Our goal was to assess the impact of the FDA decision on how Florida obstetrician-gynecologists prescribe DMPA.

Methods

A survey was conducted with questions and case scenarios regarding the use of DMPA before and after the black box warning. The survey was sent to all members of the Florida Obstetric and Gynecologic Society.

Results

Four hundred twenty-five surveys were mailed and 149 were returned - a 35% return rate. Forty-six percent of physicians surveyed indicated that they place a time limit on DMPA use, and 66% stated that this limit was based on the FDA black box warning. Sixty-five percent of respondents ordered bone mineral density (BMD) testing solely due to the use of DMPA, with 58% indicating that this decision was based on the black box warning. Eight (5.4%) of the respondents indicated they selectively prescribe bisphosphonates for patients based solely on the use of DMPA, while 33% of respondents state that they use estrogen supplementation. There was a trend towards fewer DMPA injections per week after the black box warning as compared to before; however, this trend was not statistically significant (p < .125).

Conclusion

Respondents may be writing fewer prescriptions for DMPA, are likely to institute a time limit on said prescription and are likely to order BMD testing, using the black box warning as justification. Continued education is necessary to prevent inappropriate restrictions on DMPA use and the performance and/or prescription of inappropriate tests and medications.

### Clinical trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medroxyprogesterone acetate after subcutaneous administration of depo-provera [^116kjY6a]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

We considered the target sample size of 48 participants (12 women each in the reference and 300 mg groups and 24 in the 150 mg group) sufficient to provide meaningful insights into the distributions of PK and PD outcomes. The larger 150 mg group size allowed us to increase the precision with which to estimate the distribution of return to ovulation in the lowest dose group, which we hypothesized had the potential to provide 6 months of contraceptive protection. The PK and PD analyses were performed on the primary evaluable population that excluded participants with MPA at baseline exceeding 5% of their C max or with major protocol violations that could interfere with interpretation of the PK and PD data.

We estimated the cumulative probability of return to ovulation based on the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method, with 95% confidence intervals derived using the complementary log-log transformation. The PK of MPA was evaluated based on individual serum MPA concentration-time profiles and estimated noncompartment PK parameters. For individuals in the test groups, C max, T max, C 182, C 210, AUC (0–91), AUC (0–182), AUC (0–210), AUC (0-∞), and the apparent terminal half-life were estimated. In the reference group the following PK parameters were estimated: C max and T max (by injection cycle), C 91, C 182, C 210, AUC (0–91), AUC (0–182), AUC (91–182), AUC (0–210), apparent terminal half-life (following second injection), and the accumulation ratio based on a dosing interval of 91 days. All PK and statistical analyses were performed using SAS/STAT software. Comparative assessment of secondary PK measures focused on AUC 0–182, trough concentrations, and C max between the test and reference groups, but no formal hypothesis tests were prespecified for these comparisons.

Progesterone and E 2 were measured locally at the DR and Oregon investigational sites using a Roche Cobas e411, a chemiluminescence-based automatic clinical platform (Roche Diagnostics). Measurement of MPA was conducted in a centralized fashion by PPD Development. Serum samples were prepared and immediately frozen at approximately −20°C at the investigational sites and then sent on dry ice to PPD Development where MPA levels were analyzed via a proprietary validated method using sensitive and selective high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. This method was applicable to the quantitation of MPA within a nominal range of 0.02 to 5.00 ng/mL.

Adverse Reactions in the Endometriosis Adult Studies

The safety profile of depo-subQ provera 104 in endometriosis clinical trials was similar to the safety profile of depo-subQ provera 104 in the contraception studies with the exception of the following adverse reactions which were more frequently reported in patients with endometriosis: abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and back pain.

In endometriosis studies, subjects recorded daily the occurrence and severity of hot flushes. Of the depo-subQ provera 104 users, 29% reported experiencing moderate or severe hot flushes at baseline, 36% at Month 3, and 27% at Month 6. Of the leuprolide users, 33% reported experiencing moderate or severe hot flushes at baseline, 74% at Month 3, and 69% at Month 6.

Adverse Reactions in the Adolescent Contraception Study

Depo-sub-Q provera 104 and DMPA-IM clinical trials reported similar safety profiles in adult study populations (see Table 1 above). Accordingly, a similar safety profile is expected for adolescents receiving depo-subQ provera 104 as for adolescents receiving DMPA-IM.

The safety profile of DMPA-IM for prevention of pregnancy in adolescents was observed to be generally similar to the safety profile of adult women using DMPA-IM for prevention of pregnancy, with the exception of the following adverse reactions which were reported more frequently by adolescents: abdominal pain, diarrhea, back pain, weight increased, depression, headache, and dysmenorrhea.

6.2	Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of DMPA-IM. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:

Immune system disorders: anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactoid reaction, angioedema
Vascular disorders: pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: osteoporosis (including osteoporotic fractures)
Reproductive system and breast disorders: prolonged anovulation, unexpected pregnancy, uterine hyperplasia
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: hoarseness
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: increased body odor
Gastrointestinal disorders: gastrointestinal disturbances
General disorders and administration site conditions: axillary swelling, chills, thirst

Safety and Acceptability

Injection site reactions were infrequent across all treatment groups, with a total of four participants reporting minor injection site reactions (e.g. redness, tenderness at the place of injection) that all resolved within 3 days after occurrence. The mean serum cortisol concentrations at day 7, month 3, and month 7.5 (150 mg group, 9.5–11.1 μg/dL; 300 mg group, 11.8–12.4 μg/dL; and reference group, 9.7–12.9 μg/dL) were indicative of adequate adrenal function and were generally comparable among the groups, with no meaningful changes from baseline or trends over time (data not shown).

The average (arithmetic mean) maximum E 2 concentration observed at each 30-day interval in the 150 mg group remained between 100 and 150 pg/mL for about 7 months after injection, gradually increasing thereafter to 600 pg/mL at month 12 (Supplemental Fig. 2). Conversely, the average maximum E 2 concentrations in the 300 mg and reference groups remained below 100 pg/mL for about 7 months after injection, increasing only to 300 pg/mL at month 12. The estimated probability of delayed return to ovulation (more than 12 months after injection) was 35.0% and 75.0% in the 150 and 300 mg group, respectively. In the reference group, the estimated probability was 88.9% (time from first injection) and 55.6% (time from second injection).

Comparable proportions of women in the 150 mg and reference groups reported spotting or irregular bleeding at month 3 (69.6% and 77.7%, respectively) and month 7.5 (73.9% and 88.9%, respectively). Amenorrhea was more common in the 300 mg group, with almost half of participants (44%) in this group reporting no bleeding at month 7.5 compared with 1% and 0% in the 150 mg and reference groups, respectively. Importantly, most (> 75%) women in the test groups found their bleeding pattern acceptable. Given a choice between reinjections at every 1, 3, 6, or 12 months, most participants in both test groups would choose to receive injections every 6 months (> 75%) and would use their assigned method if it proved to be effective for 6 months (> 88%).

8.1	Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There is no use for contraception in pregnancy; therefore, Depo-Provera CI should be discontinued during pregnancy.

Epidemiologic studies and meta‑analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to progestins before conception or during early pregnancy.

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Although medroxyprogesterone acetate is detectable in the milk of mothers receiving Depo-Provera CI, milk composition, quality, and amount do not appear to be adversely affected. Effects on milk production and lactation initiation/duration remain unclear when administered before 6 weeks after delivery, therefore, in mothers who exclusively breastfeed, initiate Depo-Provera CI during or after the sixth post-partum week [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

No adverse effects in breastfed infants would be expected with maternal use of progestins. Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate from breast milk have been studied and no adverse effects have been noted.

The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Depo-Provera CI and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Depo-Provera CI or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Depo-Provera CI is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy and would therefore be expected to impair female fertility until cessation of treatment. Women may experience a delay in return to ovulation and fertility (conception) following discontinuation of Depo-Provera CI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].

### Committee opinion no. 602: depot medroxyprogesterone acetate and bone effects [^113PxyCP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is a highly effective injectable contraceptive that affords privacy and has a convenient dose schedule of four times per year, making it appealing to many users, especially adolescents. Although the use of DMPA is associated with loss of bone mineral density (BMD), current longitudinal and cross-sectional evidence suggests that recovery of BMD occurs after discontinuation of DMPA. No high-quality data answer the important clinical question of whether DMPA affects fracture risk in adolescents or adults later in life. The effect of DMPA on BMD and potential fracture risk should not prevent practitioners from prescribing DMPA or continuing use beyond 2 years. The potential health risks associated with the bone effects of DMPA must be balanced against a woman's likelihood of pregnancy using other methods or no method, and the known negative health and social consequences associated with unintended pregnancy, particularly among adolescents. Health care providers should inform women and adolescents considering initiating DMPA or continuing to use the method about the benefits and the risks of DMPA and should discuss the U.S. Food and Drug Administration "black box" warning and use clinical judgment to assess appropriateness of use.

14.3	Bone Mineral Density Changes in Adolescent Females (12 to 18 Years of Age) Treated with DepoProvera CI

The impact of Depo-Provera CI (150 mg) use for up to 240 weeks (4.6 years) was evaluated in an open-label non-randomized clinical study in 389 adolescent females (12 to 18 years of age). Use of Depo-Provera CI was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD.

Partway through the trial, drug administration was stopped (at 120 weeks). The mean number of injections per Depo-Provera CI user was 9.3. Table 5 summarizes the study findings. The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use. The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip (-6.4%) and femoral neck (-5.4%) compared to lumbar spine (-2.1%).

Adolescents in the untreated cohort had an increase in BMD during the period of growth following menarche. However, the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age, gynecologic age, race, BMD and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of BMD.

BMD Recovery Post-Treatment in Adolescents

Longer duration of treatment and smoking were associated with less recovery of BMD following the last injection of Depo-Provera CI. Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post-treatment for adolescents who received Depo-Provera CI for two years or less compared to more than two years. Post‑treatment follow-up showed that, in women treated for more than two years, only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued. Adolescents treated with Depo-Provera CI for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post-treatment. Adolescents in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period (data not shown) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Comparative acceptability of combined and progestin-only injectable contraceptives in Kenya [^113BDHzW]. Contraception (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

We compared 12-month continuation rates, menstrual bleeding patterns and other aspects of acceptability between users of Cyclofem and users of Depo-Provera.

Methods

The life-table method was used to calculate quarterly continuation rates. In all, 360 Kenyan women were randomly assigned to one of the two contraceptives. User-satisfaction questionnaires were administered at 6 and 12 months or at discontinuation, whichever occurred first.

Results

The 1-year continuation rate was 75.4% for Depo-Provera users versus 56.5% for Cyclofem users (p < .001). Main reasons for discontinuation included difficulty making clinic visits (45.1% for Cyclofem vs. 40% for Depo-Provera), menstrual changes (14.1% vs. 12.5%) and nonmenstrual problems (15.5% vs. 12.5%). None of the Depo-Provera users and 8.5% of the Cyclofem users claimed frequency of visits as the main reason for discontinuation. In all, 70.6% of the Depo-Provera users were amenorrheic after 12 months, as were 20.8% of the Cyclofem users.

Conclusions

The 1-year continuation rate was higher for Depo-Provera than for Cyclofem. There was no important difference in discontinuation rates because of menstrual problems; the difference mainly reflected the frequency of visits required.

5.3	Cancer Risks

Breast Cancer

Women who have or have had a history of breast cancer should not use hormonal contraceptives, including Depo-Provera CI, because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)]. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be monitored with particular care.

The results of five large case-control studies assessing the association between depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and the risk of breast cancer are summarized in Figure 1. Three of the studies suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population of users; these increased risks were statistically significant in one study. One recent US study1evaluated the recency and duration of use and found a statistically significantly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (defined as last use within the past five years) who used DMPA for 12 months or longer; this is consistent with results of a previous study2.

Figure 1. Risk estimates for breast cancer in DMPA users

Based on the published SEER-18 2011 incidence rate (age-adjusted to the 2000 US Standard Population) of breast cancer for US women, all races, age 20 to 49 years, a doubling of risk would increase the incidence of breast cancer in women who use Depo-Provera CI from about 72 to about 144 cases per 100,000 women.

Cervical Cancer

A statistically nonsignificant increase in relative risk (RR) estimates of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer has been associated with the use of Depo-Provera CI in women who were first exposed before the age of 35 years (RR 1.22 to 1.28 and 95% CI 0.93 to 1.70). The overall, nonsignificant RR of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer in women who ever used Depo-Provera CI was estimated to be 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29). No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed.

Other Cancers

Long-term case-controlled surveillance of users of Depo-Provera CI found no overall increased risk of ovarian or liver cancer.

5.4	Ectopic Pregnancy

Be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using Depo-Provera CI who become pregnant or complain of severe abdominal pain.

### Long-term, reversible contraception use among high-risk women treated in a university-based gynecology clinic: comparison between IUD and depo-provera [^111ySDSV]. Journal of Women's Health (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The study was conducted to compare rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and side effects in a cohort of high-risk women who received either an intrauterine device (IUD) or depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA).

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review study of women seeking contraception at an innercity resident obstetrics/gynecology clinic. We compared 194 women with IUDs vs. 191 women receiving DMPA. Mean age was 31.9 years, with 75.1% and 69.2% being nonwhite and single, respectively. More white women received the IUD (34.5% vs. 15.0%, p < 0.001), and significantly more single women received DMPA (85.2% vs. 53.9%, p < 0.001).

Results

After controlling for potentially confounding variables, DMPA women were significantly more likely to have a subsequent STD, although this effect disappeared when interaction terms were added to the model. Overall, duration of contraception use and being black were the best predictors of subsequent STD infection. Women who received IUDs were more likely to report side effects but less likely to discontinue use of their birth control (18.8% vs. 67.0%, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Although sexual risk factors may have influenced provider prescribing practices in selecting IUD or DMPA, overall rates of STDs and discontinuation rates for IUDs were equivalent or superior to rates for DMPA.

Discussion

A single dose of 150 mg of Depo-Provera injected SC in the abdomen effectively suppressed ovulation for at least 7 months among all 21 evaluable women in this study, providing proof of concept that it may be an effective contraceptive method when injected every 6 months while reducing the overall exposure by approximately 30% compared to 6 months of Depo-SubQ 104 use. These compelling PD data were further supported by the PK results. All participants who received a single SC injection of 150 mg of Depo-Provera achieved MPA concentrations above 0.2 ng/mL within 24 hours after the injection, and all participants but one maintained MPA concentrations above that level for at least 6 months. The estimated 6-month MPA trough concentration for a 150 mg dose of Depo-Provera was 10% lower than the 3-month trough of the reference drug. However, this may not be clinically relevant given the lack of any pregnancies among 2,042 women using Depo-SubQ 104 for up to 1 year in three pivotal trials, which indicate that the 104 mg dose may itself be higher than necessary for a 3-month product.

The absence of ovulations in the first 7 months for a 150 mg dose of Depo-Provera suggests that there could be up to a 4-week window for reinjection, without relying on secondary mechanisms of action. Although the label for the reference drug provides for only a 1-week reinjection window, a longer interval would be a valuable programmatic attribute for an injectable contraceptive.

The supportive PD data showed that return of ovulation was characterized by lower P peak levels compared with baseline. Possible abnormal ovulation leading to luteal phase deficiency may, like other secondary mechanisms of action of MPA, contribute to a lower fertility after the SC administration of Depo-Provera, even after ovulation returns. This would be consistent with the data for Depo-SubQ 104 that suggest a gap between return to ovulation and return to fertility and lends further support for extending the reinjection window up to 4 weeks.

How will Depo-Provera CI change my periods?

Change in normal menstrual cycle. The side effect reported most frequently by women who use Depo-Provera CI for birth controls is a change in their normal menstrual cycle. During the first year of using Depo-Provera CI, you might have one or more of the following changes:
irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting
an increase or decrease in menstrual bleeding
no bleeding at all. In clinical studies of Depo-Provera CI, 55% of women reported no menstrual bleeding (amenorrhea) after one year of use and 68% of women reported no menstrual bleeding after two years of use.
Missed period. During the time you are using Depo-Provera CI for birth controls, you may skip a period, or your periods may stop completely. If you have been receiving your shot of Depo-Provera CI regularly every 3 months, then you are probably not pregnant. However, if you think that you may be pregnant, see your healthcare professional.

Unusually heavy or continuous bleeding is not a usual effect of Depo-Provera CI and if this happens you should see your healthcare professional right away.

With continued use of Depo-Provera CI, bleeding usually decreases and many women stop having periods completely. When you stop using Depo-Provera CI your menstrual period will usually, in time, return to its normal cycle.

### Injectable contraceptive depo-provera induces erratic beating patterns in patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes with long QT syndrome type 2 [^112rV1rf]. Heart Rhythm (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2) is caused by pathogenic variants in KCNH2. LQT2 may manifest as QT prolongation on an electrocardiogram and present with arrhythmic syncope/seizures and sudden cardiac arrest/death. Progestin-based oral contraceptives may increase the risk of LQT2-triggered cardiac events in women. We previously reported on a woman with LQT2 and recurrent cardiac events temporally related and attributed to the progestin-based contraceptive medroxyprogesterone acetate ("Depo-Provera" [Depo] MilliporeSigma, Catalog# 1378001, St. Louis, MO).

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the arrhythmic risk of Depo in a patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (iPSC-CM) model of LQT2.

Methods

An iPSC-CM line was generated from a 40-year-old woman with p.G1006Afs∗49-KCNH2. A CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited/variant-corrected isogenic control iPSC-CM line was generated. FluoVolt (Invitrogen, F10488, Waltham, MA) was used to measure the action potential duration after treatment with 10 μM Depo. Erratic beating patterns characterized as alternating spike amplitudes, alternans, or early afterdepolarization-like phenomena were assessed using multielectrode array (MEA) after 10 μM Depo, 1 μM isoproterenol (ISO), or combined Depo + ISO treatment.

Results

Depo treatment shortened the action potential duration at 90% repolarization of G1006Afs∗49 iPSC-CMs from 394 ± 10 to 303 ± 10 ms (P < .0001). Combined Depo + ISO treatment increased the percentage of electrodes displaying erratic beating in G1006Afs∗49 iPSC-CMs (baseline: 18% ± 5% vs Depo + ISO: 54% ± 5%; P < .0001) but not in isogenic control iPSC-CMs (baseline: 0% ± 0% vs Depo + ISO: 10% ± 3%; p = 0.9659).

Conclusion

This cell study provides a potential mechanism for the patient's clinically documented Depo-associated episodes of recurrent ventricular fibrillation. This in vitro data should prompt a large-scale clinical assessment of Depo's potential proarrhythmic effect in women with LQT2.

### Vaginal estrogen supplementation during depo-provera initiation: a randomized controlled trial [^114WLT4H]. Contraception (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Irregular bleeding is often cited as the reason for discontinuation of depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) after the first injection. Estrogen supplementation during DMPA initiation may decrease bleeding and improve continuation.

Study Design

This prospective, randomized, controlled trial evaluated estrogen supplementation during DMPA initiation. Women initiating DMPA were randomized to receive an estradiol vaginal ring for 3 months versus DMPA alone. Bleeding diaries and questionnaires at three and 6 months assessed bleeding, continuation and ring acceptability.

Results

Seventy-one participants enrolled; 49 completed the first follow-up period. The median number of bleeding or spotting days was 16 in the estrogen ring group (n = 26) versus 28 in the DMPA alone group (n = 23) (p = .19). Seventy-seven percent of the intervention group received a second injection compared with 70% in the DMPA alone group (p = .56). For each additional day of bleeding and/or spotting reported, women were 3% less likely to receive a second injection (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94–0.99). Acceptability of the vaginal ring was high among those in the intervention group.

Conclusions

Vaginal estrogen supplementation during DMPA initiation is acceptable to women and may decrease total bleeding.

5.5	Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reaction

Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction have been reported with the use of Depo-Provera CI. Institute emergency medical treatment if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.

5.6	Injection Site Reactions

Injection site reactions have been reported with use of Depo-Provera CI [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Persistent injection site reactions may occur after administration of Depo-Provera CI due to inadvertent subcutaneous administration or release of the drug into the subcutaneous space while removing the needle [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.7	Liver Function

Discontinue Depo-Provera CI use if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and Depo-Provera CI causation has been excluded.

5.8	Convulsions

There have been a few reported cases of convulsions in patients who were treated with Depo-Provera CI. Association with drug use or pre-existing conditions is not clear.

5.9	Depression

Monitor patients who have a history of depression and do not re-administer Depo-Provera CI if depression recurs.

5.10	Bleeding Irregularities

Most women using Depo-Provera CI experience disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns. Altered menstrual bleeding patterns include amenorrhea, irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, prolonged spotting or bleeding, and heavy bleeding. Rule out the possibility of organic pathology if abnormal bleeding persists or is severe, and institute appropriate treatment.

As women continue using Depo-Provera CI, fewer experience irregular bleeding and more experience amenorrhea. In clinical studies of Depo-Provera CI, by month 12 amenorrhea was reported by 55% of women, and by month 24, amenorrhea was reported by 68% of women using Depo-Provera CI.

5.11	Weight Gain

Women tend to gain weight while on therapy with Depo-Provera CI. From an initial average body weight of 136 lb, women who completed 1 year of therapy with Depo-Provera CI gained an average of 5.4 lb. Women who completed 2 years of therapy gained an average of 8.1 lb. Women who completed 4 years gained an average of 13.8 lb. Women who completed 6 years gained an average of 16.5 lb. Two percent of women withdrew from a large-scale clinical trial because of excessive weight gain.

Pharmacokinetics

Geometric mean (GM) MPA concentrations through 7.5 months of treatment are presented in Figure 3. All but one participant (in the Depo-SubQ 104 group) achieved an MPA concentration above 0.2 ng/mL within 24 hours after injection. Only one woman in the 150 mg group had an observed MPA concentration below 0.2 ng/mL at 6 months after treatment initiation (0.181 ng/mL). However, her MPA concentration was 0.253 ng/mL at 6.5 months, and ovulation occurred at 9.4 months after treatment initiation. The GM C max of 1.12 ng/mL in the 150 mg group was significantly greater than the GM C max of 0.84 ng/mL in the first injection cycle of the reference group (GM ratio [GMR] = 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–1.71), but was similar to the GM C max of 1.07 ng/mL after the second injection of the reference group (GMR = 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82–1.32; Supplemental Table 1). The GM C 182 of 0.32 ng/mL in the 150 mg group was 10% lower than the GM 3-month trough (C 91) of 0.35 ng/mL for the reference group (GMR = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.67–1.21). The GM AUC (0–182) of 98.2 ng∗days/mL in the 150 mg group was also approximately 10% lower than the GM of AUC (0–182) 109.9 ng∗days/mL over two injection cycles of the reference group (GMR = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.71–1.13). In contrast, the GM C max and AUC (0–182) were significantly higher in the 300 mg group than either the 150 mg or reference groups. The GM C 182 was also higher in the 300 mg group than in the reference group, but the difference was not statistically significant (GMR = 1.32; 95% CI, 0.86–2.03).

Materials and methods

This partially randomized, parallel-group study (no: NCT02456584) was conducted at Biomedical Research Department at PROFAMILIA (Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic [DR]) and the Women's Health Research Unit at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU; Portland, OR) between September 2015 and May 2018. The study was approved by the Comite de Etica Profamilia, CONABIOS, the FHI 360 Protection of Human Subjects Committee, and the OHSU institutional review board. All women provided informed consent before entering the study.

To be enrolled in the study, women had to be 18–40 years old, not pregnant, and at low risk of pregnancy (sterilized, in exclusively same-gender partnership, in monogamous relationship with vasectomized partner, abstinent, using nonhormonal intrauterine device, or consistently using condoms) and have a body mass index (BMI) of 18–35 kg/m². Ovulation was confirmed before study enrollment in all women by two consecutive progesterone (P) measurements ≥ 4.7 ng/mL obtained within 5 days. We excluded women who had medical contraindications; were allergic to MPA; were recently pregnant (within 3 months); used oral contraceptive pills, implants, or hormonal intrauterine system in the month before enrollment; or used MPA injectables in the last 12 months or a combined injectable in the last 6 months.

We planned to randomize 48 eligible participants in a 2:1:1 allocation ratio to receive a single injection of 150 mg (1 mL) Depo-Provera (150 mg group), a single injection of 300 mg (2 mL) Depo-Provera (300 mg group), or two injections of Depo-SubQ 104 (reference group) at enrollment and 3 months later. The randomization sequence (stratified on investigational site and using a block size of 4) was generated using SAS/STAT software, and treatment allocation was concealed using sequentially numbered opaque randomization envelopes.

The study was not blinded due to differences in volume and packaging of the study drugs as well as differences in the schedule of injections and follow-up visits between the treatment groups after day 7 postinjection. However, the laboratory personnel conducting MPA and P testing remained blinded to treatment assignments throughout the study.

### High lifetime pregnancy and low contraceptive usage among sex workers who use drugs-an unmet reproductive health need [^114hPqGT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Birth control practices

While consistent condom use by clients in our sample have previously been found to be high(72%), only 14% of the 211 women included in our analysis reported relying on condoms alone as a method of birth control. There were no reports of female condom use in this sample. Nine percent reported having used injectable hormones (e.g. Depo-provera) and 1% reported that they had used the birth control pill. The median age of FSWs using any type of hormonal contraceptives (birth control pill, Depo-Provera, Norplant, injectable hormones) was 33 years [IQR:25–37]. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) were only reported by 1% of the women interviewed. Permanent contraceptives, including tubal ligation (16.6%) and hysterectomy (7.1%) were more common, though primarily among older FSWs (Median = 41 years; [IQR:36–45]) (Table 2). The median age among FSWs who did not use permanent contraceptives was 33.0 [IQR:25.0–38.0]. Older age(age was measured as a continuous variable), was significantly associated with permanent contraceptive use (p < 0.001).

Table 2
Contraceptive usage among 211 street-based Female Sex Workers (FSWs) who use drugs

In bivariate analysis, FSWs who reported tubal ligation had 2.5 greater odds of having a higher number of pregnancies (OR = 2.49; [95%CI = 1.14–5.45]). Similarly, FSWs who reported using permanent contraceptives (e.g. tubal ligation and hysterectomy) had 2.76 increased odds of having five or more pregnancies (OR = 2.76; [95%CI = 1.36–5.59]) compared to those who did not use permanent contraceptives. Alternatively, female-controlled contraceptives were not significantly associated with having five or more prior pregnancies (OR = 1.62; [95%CI = 0.86–3.03]). Individual-level drug risks and interpersonal risk factors for pregnancy (e.g. economic dependence on one's partner or having a partner who procures drugs) were not significantly associated with having five or more prior pregnancies (Table 3).

14.4	Bone Fracture Incidence in Women Treated with DepoProvera CI

A retrospective cohort study to assess the association between Depo-Provera CI injection and the incidence of bone fractures was conducted in 312,395 female contraceptive users in the UK. The incidence rates of fracture were compared between Depo-Provera CI users and contraceptive users who had no recorded use of Depo-Provera CI. The Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) for any fracture during the follow-up period (mean = 5.5 years) was 1.41 (95% CI 1.35, 1.47). It is not known if this is due to Depo-Provera CI use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate.

In the study, when cumulative exposure to Depo-Provera CI was calculated, the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections. However, it is not clear that cumulative exposure, which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non-use, is a useful measure of risk, as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use.

There were very few osteoporotic fractures (fracture sites known to be related to low BMD) in the study overall, and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in Depo-Provera CI users compared to non-users. Importantly, this study could not determine whether use of Depo-Provera CI has an effect on fracture rate later in life.

Trends in Postpartum Contraceptive Use Among Teens in Five States During 2004–2013

Among the five states that continuously collected data on teens' use of postpartum contraception, the use of any method remained relatively stable during 2004–2013 (range by 2–year increment = 82.7% to 90.8%), but the distribution of contraceptive methods used changed over time (Figure 2) (Supplementary Table 2;). From 2004–2005 to 2012–2013, use of the most effective reversible methods increased significantly, from 5.3% to 25.3%, and use of moderately effective methods decreased significantly, from 65.1% to 40.2%; use of least effective methods and no method did not change significantly.

### Strategies to improve adherence and continuation of shorter-term hormonal methods of contraception [^116Zo37L]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide, hormonal contraceptives are among the most popular reversible contraceptives. Despite high perfect-use effectiveness rates, typical-use effectiveness rates for shorter-term methods such as oral and injectable contraceptives are much lower. In large part, this disparity reflects difficulties in ongoing adherence to the contraceptive regimen and low continuation rates. Correct use of contraceptives to ensure effectiveness is vital to reducing unintended pregnancy.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of strategies aiming to improve adherence to, and continuation of, shorter-term hormonal methods of contraception compared with usual family planning care.

We searched to July 2018 in the following databases (without language restrictions): The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 7), PubMed via MEDLINE, POPLINE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing strategies aimed to facilitate adherence and continuation of shorter-term hormonal methods of contraception (such as oral contraceptives (OCs), injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA or Depo-Provera), intravaginal ring, or transdermal patch) with usual family planning care in reproductive age women seeking to avoid pregnancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were continuation or discontinuation of contraceptive method, rates of discontinuation due to adverse events (menstrual disturbances and all other adverse events), and adherence to method use as indicated by missed pills and on-time/late injections. Pregnancy was a secondary outcome.

Main Results

We included 10 RCTs involving 6242 women. Six trials provided direct in-person counseling using either multiple counseling contacts or multiple components during one visit. Four trials provided intensive reminders of appointments or next dosing, of which two provided additional educational health information as well as reminders. All trials stated 'usual care' as the comparison. The certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Main limitations were risk of bias (associated with poor reporting of methodological detail, lack of blinding, and incomplete outcome data), inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision. Continuation of hormonal contraceptive methodsIt is uncertain whether intensive counseling improves continuation of hormonal contraceptive methods compared with usual care (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.54; 2624 participants; 6 studies; I² = 79%; very low certainty evidence). The evidence suggested: if the chance of continuation with usual care is 39%, the chance of continuation with intensive counseling would be between 41% and 50%. The overall pooled OR suggested continuation of improvement, however, when stratified by contraceptive method type, the positive results were restricted to DMPA. It is uncertain whether reminders (± educational information) improve continuation of hormonal contraceptive methods compared with usual care (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.73; 933 participants; 2 studies; I² = 69%; very low certainty evidence). The evidence suggested: if the chance of continuation with usual care is 52%, the chance of continuation with reminders would be between 52% and 65%. Discontinuation due to adverse eventsThe evidence suggested that counseling may be associated with a decreased rate of discontinuation due to adverse events compared with usual care, with a lower rate of discontinuation due to menstrual disturbances (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.37; 350 participants; 1 study; low certainty evidence), but may make little or no difference to all other adverse events (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.47; 350 participants; 1 study; low certainty evidence). The evidence suggested: if the chance of discontinuation with usual care due to menstrual disturbances is 32%, the chance of discontinuation with intensive counseling would be between 5% and 15%; and that if the chance of discontinuation with usual care due to other adverse events is 55%, the chance of discontinuation with intensive counseling would be between 30% and 64%. Discontinuation was not reported among trials that investigated the use of reminders (± educational information). Adherence Adherence was not reported among trials that investigated the use of intensive counseling. Among trials that investigated reminders (± educational information), there was no conclusive evidence of a difference in adherence as indicated by missed pills (MD 0.80, 95% CI -1.22 to 2.82; 73 participants; 1 study; moderate certainty evidence) or by on-time injections (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.29; 350 participants; 2 studies; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). The evidence suggested: if the chance of adherence to method use as indicated by on-time injections with usual care is 50%, the chance of adherence with method use as indicated by on-time injections with reminders would be between 35% and 56%. PregnancyThere was no conclusive evidence of a difference in rates of pregnancy between intensive counseling and usual care (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.57; 1985 participants; 3 studies; I² = 0%, very low certainty evidence). The evidence suggested: if the chance of pregnancy with usual care is 18%, the chance of pregnancy with counseling would be between 18% and 25%. Pregnancy was not reported among trials that investigated the use of reminders (± educational information).

Authors' Conclusions

Despite the importance of this topic, studies have not been published since the last review in 2013 (nine studies) with only one study added in 2019 that neither changed the results nor improved the certainty of evidence. Overall, the certainty of evidence for strategies to improve adherence and continuation of contraceptives is low. Intensive counseling and reminders (with or without educational information) may be associated with improved continuation of shorter-term hormonal contraceptive methods when compared with usual family planning care. However, this should be interpreted with caution due to the low certainty of the evidence. Included trials used a variety of shorter-term hormonal contraceptive methods which may account for the high heterogeneity. It is possible that the effectiveness of strategies for improving adherence and continuation are contingent on the contraceptive method targeted. There was limited reporting of objectively measurable outcomes (e.g. electronic monitoring device) among included studies. Future trials would benefit from standardized definitions and measurements of adherence, and consistent terminology for describing interventions and comparisons. Further research requires larger studies, follow-up of at least one year, and improved reporting of trial methodology.

### Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-provera) [^114Q7E3G]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1	Contraception

In five clinical studies using Depo-Provera CI, the 12-month failure rate for the group of women treated with Depo-Provera CI was zero (no pregnancies reported) to 0.7 by Life-Table method. The effectiveness of Depo‑Provera CI is dependent on the patient returning every 3 months (13 weeks) for reinjection.

14.2	Bone Mineral Density Changes in Women Treated with DepoProvera CI

In a controlled, clinical study, adult women using Depo-Provera CI (150mg) for up to 5 years showed spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) mean decreases of 5–6%, compared to no significant change in BMD in the control group. The decline in BMD was more pronounced during the first two years of use, with smaller declines in subsequent years. Mean changes in lumbar spine BMD of ‑2.86%, ‑4.11%, ‑4.89%, ‑4.93% and ‑5.38% after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, were observed. Mean decreases in BMD of the total hip and femoral neck were similar.

After stopping use of Depo-Provera CI, there was partial recovery of BMD toward baseline values during the 2-year post-therapy period. Longer duration of treatment was associated with less complete recovery during this 2-year period following the last injection. Table 4 shows the change in BMD in women after 5 years of treatment with Depo-Provera CI and in women in a control group, as well as the extent of recovery of BMD for the subset of the women for whom 2-year post treatment data were available.

3.4 User experience with DMPA-SC: Method choice

In user IDIs, the most commonly reported reasons for why users chose DMPA-SC as their preferred method of contraception were (1) trust in provider recommendations, (2) recommendations from friends and (3) appreciation for DMPA-SC's 3-month duration of effectiveness. The 3-month duration was attractive both to women who wished to resume childbearing in the near future and to those who had either previously been using shorter-duration methods or who had become accustomed to DMPA-intramuscular's 3-month duration.

[My provider] told me she has heard about Sayana Press, that it works that, and that I should just try it. I said okay, let me just give it a try.

I have a friend that got Sayana Press and I made up my mind because she said it was okay.

Among the subset of DMPA-SC users who were switching from another method of modern contraception, the most commonly mentioned reasons for choosing DMPA-SC were (1) reduced side effects with DMPA-SC as compared to the other method, (2) trusting the recommendation of a friend and (3) appreciation for DMPA-SC's 3-month duration of effectiveness.

I was told that the milligram of Depo is more than Sayana Press… and I was told that though Sayana can cause the same effects as Depo, they aren't as much as with Depo.

Less frequently mentioned reasons for switching to DMPA-SC included (1) the user's usual provider ceased offering non-DMPA-SC injectables, (2) trust in provider recommendation and (3) wanting to try DMPA-SC in hopes of experiencing fewer side effects than other methods, but particularly Depo Provera.

I went there for Depo injection, but they said there was no Depo, the person that was on duty, I [trusted her], and she advertised the new product to me, so it is not that I wanted them to give me Sayana Press, but because of my belief in them that I changed to Sayana Press.

When I told her that my [old method] normally gives me headache, she says I should leave that one and come and be taking Sayana Press.

### Supplementation with vitamin C and / or vitamin B (6) in the prevention of depo-provera side effects in adolescents [^11393VHT]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Depo-Provera-induced menstrual irregularity is believed to be secondary to relative estrogen deficiency. Weight gain associated with this contraceptive method is believed to be due to Depo-Provera's steroid-like appetite stimulation effect and to an altered tryptophan metabolism. We examined whether vitamin C, an important factor in uterine estrogen binding, and vitamin B(6), a glucocorticoid antagonist and an important coenzyme in the tryptophan-serotonin pathway, might alleviate menstrual irregularities and weight gain associated with Depo-Provera.

Methods

Fifty-five adolescent girls (age 16 ± 1 yr, gyn age 4 ± 1 yr, body mass index 25.2 ± 0.9) who decided to initiate Depo-Provera (150 mg intramuscularly every 3 months) were randomly assigned to one of four groups (group 1: vitamin B(6) 50 mg plus placebo pill/day; group 2: vitamin C 500 mg plus placebo pill/day; group 3: vitamin B(6) 50 mg plus vitamin C 500 mg/day; group 4 (control): 2 placebo pills/day) for 6 months. Participants were assessed by their care providers every 3 months.

Setting

Two urban hospital-based adolescent clinics.

Results

Number of days of bleeding during the first interval (first 3 months) as well as during the second interval (months 4–6) among groups 1, 2, and 3 did not differ statistically from days of bleeding in control group. There were no significant body mass index (BMI) changes among groups 1–3 (-0.15 ± 0.18, 0.34 ± 0.56, 0.01 ± 0.31) compared with control (-0.38 ± 0.38) during the first interval as well as during the second interval (0.68 ± 0.37, -0.39 ± 0.21, 0.45 ± 0.32, compared with 0.28 ± 0.43). When data from all 55 participants were collapsed, there was no significant change in BMI during the first 6 months of Depo-Provera use. About 48% at 3 months and 44% at 6 months were very or somewhat concerned about menstrual irregularity; 41% at 3 months and 18% at 6 months were very or somewhat concerned about weight changes. More than half (57%) at 3 months and 74% at 6 months reported less tampon/pad use, and 77% at 3 months and 78% at 6 months reported decreased menstrual cramps. Overall, 59% at 3 months and 70% at 6 months were very satisfied with Depo-Provera; 97% at 3 months and 96% at 6 months said that they would recommend Depo-Provera to a friend or a relative.

Conclusions

This study does not support a role for vitamin C in the prevention of Depo-Provera-induced menstrual irregularities or for vitamin B(6) in the prevention of weight changes associated with Depo-Provera. The unchanged BMI during the first 6 months of Depo-Provera use in the present study suggests that raising awareness and close follow-up may prevent weight gain among adolescent girls using this contraceptive method.

14.3	Bone Mineral Density in Women Treated with Depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate for Contraception

In a study that compared changes in bone mineral density (BMD) in adult women using depo-subQ provera 104 or DMPA-IM for contraception, both treatments showed BMD reductions in the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck. Mean percent changes in BMD in depo-subQ provera 104-treated women are shown in Table 3.

BMD Recovery Post-Treatment in Women

Given the similar effects on BMD from depo-subQ provera 104 and DMPA-IM described above, BMD recovery post-treatment is also expected to be similar. In a controlled clinical study that compared changes in BMD in adult women using DMPA-IM for contraception or no hormonal contraception, the 2-year post-treatment follow-up demonstrated incomplete recovery of BMD following the last injection of DMPA-IM. Table 4 shows the change in BMD in women after 5 years of treatment with DMPA-IM and in the control group, as well as the extent of BMD recovery in the subset of women for whom 2-year post-treatment data were available.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Depo-Provera CI is not indicated before menarche. Use of Depo-Provera CI is associated with significant loss of BMD. This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. It is unknown if use of Depo-Provera CI by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures in later life. Other than concerns about loss of BMD, the safety and effectiveness are expected to be the same for postmenarchal adolescents and adult women.

8.5 Geriatric Use

This product has not been studied in post-menopausal women and is not indicated in this population.

### Contraceptive effectiveness, pharmacokinetics, and safety of sayana® press when injected every four months: a multicenter phase 3 trial [^113VERi8]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally, over 74 million women use injectable contraceptives for pregnancy prevention. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) for intramuscular (IM) administration every three months (150 mg/mL medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA] injectable suspension; DMPA-IM) is the most prevalent injectable method. Although widely used, DMPA-IM is associated with weight gain, bleeding disturbances, metabolic effects, reduced bone mineral density, and delayed return to fertility. More recently, Pfizer developed Depo-SubQ Provera 104®, an alternative MPA formulation (104 mg/0.65 mL) for subcutaneous (SC) administration every 3 months.

Due in part to a slower rate of absorption following SC administration, Depo-SubQ Provera 104 achieves the same degree of efficacy as DMPA-IM at a 31% lower dose. Despite the lower dose, steady-state trough MPA concentrations of the two drugs are similar. In a randomized study, average serum MPA concentrations 1 and 2 years after initiating Depo-SubQ Provera 104 were 100% and 85%, respectively of the corresponding DMPA-IM values. This, combined with the lack of any pregnancies in phase 3 trials of Depo-SubQ Provera 104, indicates that the 104 mg dose may be higher than necessary for 3-month protection and that the duration of its action may be extended from 3 to 4 months. This would reduce long-term MPA exposure by 25% and lower steady state trough MPA concentrations, thus possibly shortening the delay in return to fertility and improving other dose-dependent side effects.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There is no use for contraception in pregnancy; therefore, depo-subQ provera 104 should be discontinued during pregnancy.

Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to progestins before conception or during early pregnancy.

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15‑20%, respectively.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Although medroxyprogesterone acetate is detectable in the milk of mothers receiving DMPA-IM, milk composition, quality, and amount do not appear to be adversely affected. Effects on milk production and lactation initiation/duration remain unclear when administered before 6 weeks after delivery, therefore, in mothers who exclusively breastfeed, initiate depo-subQ provera 104 during or after the sixth post-partum week [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

No adverse effects in breastfed infants would be expected with maternal use of progestins. Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate from breast milk have been studied and no adverse effects have been noted.

The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for depo-subQ provera 104 and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from depo-subQ provera 104 or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Depo-subQ provera 104 is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy and would therefore be expected to impair female fertility until cessation of treatment. Women may experience a delay in return to ovulation and fertility (conception) following discontinuation of depo-subQ provera 104 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

4. | RESEARCH GAPS

The goal of WHO and its partners is to use the best available evidence to develop SPR guidance; however, many recommendations are based on limited or indirect evidence. For example, limited information exists on optimal follow-up schedules after contraceptive method initiation, and further investigations on the impact of follow-up on contraceptive continuation can refine existing recommendations. Additionally, certain recommendations are based on indirect evidence from similar contraceptive methods in the absence of direct evidence. As an example, recommendations on when to start the combined contraceptive patch and contraceptive vaginal ring are derived from indirect data from the combined oral contraceptive pill in view of the similarities in the type and dose of hormone used in combined hormonal contraceptive methods. Although these recommendations are likely to be scientifically valid, evidence review highlights the relative lack of available data for newer contraceptive methods.

Knowledge gaps for future research in contraceptive management are identified with every update of the SPR. Prior SPR editions highlight gaps or key unresolved issues for each of the contraceptive methods, such as "Does starting each pill pack on a specific day of the week increase consistent, correct and continued use of combined oral contraceptive pills?", "How quickly is protection reliably established by injections of DMPA [depot medroxyprogester-one acetate] and NET-EN [norethisterone enantate]?", and "What are the mechanisms underlying progestogen-only injectable-associated bleeding abnormalities and how can they best be treated?". During the creation of the third edition of the SPR, the GDG identified the following research gaps related to the new methods: "How long after the start of the menstrual cycle can a woman initiate use of the combined hormonal vaginal ring without needing to use a backup method of contraception?", "Does the timing of return to fertility after a DMPA subcutaneous injection differ compared with the timing following a DMPA intramuscular injection?", and "Can Sino-implant (II) be used as an effective method of contraception for more than 4 years?". Another research gap is when to start regular hormonal contraception after using ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception. New evidence suggests that taking ulipristal acetate and progestin-containing contraception in close succession could impact effectiveness of both UPA and the regular contraceptive in terms of pregnancy prevention. Recognition of such research gaps during the SPR revision process can serve as a framework to direct future high-quality studies that will further inform recommendations, better meet providers' needs, and improve quality of family planning services.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, therefore, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In the two clinical trials with Depo-Provera CI, over 3,900 women, who were treated for up to 7 years, reported the following adverse reactions, which may or may not be related to the use of Depo-Provera CI. The population studied ranges in age from 15 to 51 years, of which 46% were White, 50% Non-White, and 4.9% Unknown race. The patients received 150 mg Depo-Provera CI every 3-months (90 days). The median study duration was 13 months with a range of 1–84 months. Fifty‑eight percent of patients remained in the study after 13 months and 34% after 24 months.

### Contraceptive efficacy and safety of DMPA-SC [^111xPmen]. Contraception (2004). Low credibility.

DMPA-SC 104 mg/0.65 mL is a new, low-dose subcutaneous (SC) formulation of Depo-Provera contraceptive injection (150 mg/mL medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension) that provides efficacy, safety and immediacy of onset equivalent to Depo-Provera intramuscular (IM) injection. Two large, open-label, Phase 3 studies assessed the 1-year contraceptive efficacy, safety and patient satisfaction with DMPA-SC administered every 3 months (12–13 weeks). Zero pregnancies were reported in both studies, which included a total of 16,023 woman-cycles of exposure to DMPA-SC and substantial numbers of overweight or obese women. DMPA-SC was well-tolerated and adverse events were similar to those reported previously with Depo-Provera IM. Thus, DMPA-SC offers women a new, highly effective and convenient long-acting contraceptive option.

### Pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injected in the upper arm [^116PBw7v]. Contraception (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The abdomen and thigh are recommended injection sites in the label for Depo-SubQ Provera 104™. We evaluated the pharmacokinetic profile of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) following injection of Depo-SubQ Provera 104 in the upper arm, a preferred injection site in developing countries.

Study Design

Twenty-six women in Norfolk, VA, received a single injection of Depo-SubQ Provera 104 in the upper arm in this prospective noncomparative study. We measured MPA serum concentrations prior to injection (day 1) and 11 times postinjection (days 2, 4, 8, 14, 30, 44, 60, 74, 91, 104 and 120).

Results

Serum MPA levels peaked at 0.953 ng/mL 2–14 days (interquartile range; median = 8) after dosing. Mean AUC0–91 was 45.1 ng·day/mL. Mean MPA levels at days 91, 104 and 120 were 0.427, 0.367 and 0.327 ng/mL, respectively. A total of 15 individual measurements of MPA were below 0.2 ng/mL. All women but one had MPA levels above 0.1 ng/mL on day 91.

Conclusions

Injection of Depo-SubQ Provera 104™ in the upper arm provided sufficient MPA levels for contraceptive protection for 3 months (13 weeks). The uptake and metabolism of MPA when injected in the upper arm may be different from the abdomen and thigh.

### Longitudinal study of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (depo-provera) effects on bone health in adolescents: study design, population characteristics and baseline bone mineral density [^114xj8PY]. Contraception (2008). Low credibility.

Background

This analysis was conducted to assess the baseline data and design methodology within an observational longitudinal comparison of use vs. nonuse of the injectable (intramuscular) contraceptive depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-IM) and its effect on bone mass in adolescent women.

Study Design

A prospective, observational, open-label, unmatched-cohort, safety study in females aged 11–18 years. Participants either self-selected DMPA-IM (Depo-Provera) 150 mg to be administered every 12 weeks for up to 240 weeks with a 120-week post-treatment follow-up or were nonusers (users of nonhormonal contraception or sexually abstinent) who were to be followed up for up to 360 weeks. As each participant entered the study, bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine, hip and femoral neck regions, along with total body bone mineral content; serum and urine specimens were obtained for assay of bone metabolism markers and participants' histories of parity and tobacco and alcohol use were obtained.

Results

A total of 389 participants were enrolled: 169 elected to begin DMPA-IM; 26 chose nonhormonal methods and 194 were abstinent. The baseline characteristics indicated significant disparities between DMPA-IM users and nonusers: compared with the nonusers, DMPA-IM users had more advanced chronologic and gynecologic ages, were more likely to have smoked, been pregnant and included more blacks. These factors would likely influence bone accretion rates independent of DMPA-IM exposure. Comparison of participant BMDs with standard reference data revealed that the study cohorts did not match reference populations closely enough to make a direct between-cohort comparative analysis feasible.

Conclusions

The baseline differences in cohort characteristics preclude a meaningful comparison of mean BMD changes over time between DMPA-IM users and nonusers cohorts, and comparisons of changes in Z-scores between cohorts were also not appropriate. Therefore, within-participant BMD decreases from baseline were established as safety thresholds, and the proportion of individuals crossing those thresholds on a persistent or progressive basis was identified as the revised primary end point.
