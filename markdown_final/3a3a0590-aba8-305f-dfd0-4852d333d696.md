## Question

What are signs and symptoms of a pulmonary embolism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical syndrome and why PE is hard to diagnose. Then, I should verify the most common symptoms and their frequencies. Next, I will examine key signs and their predictive value. After that, I need to consider how presentation varies with severity, age, sex, and comorbidities. Finally, I should integrate special populations and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified clinical takeaway with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the core clinical problem: PE has a nonspecific presentation that spans from asymptomatic to sudden death, which is precisely why clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion and use structured pretest probability tools to guide testing, rather than relying on any single symptom or sign in isolation [^8a2185e5] [^e88c8354] [^4457a683].

> I will now examine the most common symptoms. Dyspnea is the predominant symptom across studies and guidelines, typically occurring suddenly and at rest, though exertional dyspnea can occur and dyspnea may even be absent in severe cases with circulatory collapse, so I should not anchor on its presence or absence alone [^8a2185e5] [^15157262]. Pleuritic chest pain is the next most frequent symptom and is classically described, but I need to remember it can be retrosternal or pleural and may be less prominent in older adults or those with comorbidities [^8a2185e5] [^b2326cb0]. Cough is common and may be dry or accompanied by hemoptysis, which, when present, should heighten suspicion but remains relatively infrequent overall [^8a2185e5] [^19f1394f]. Syncope signals high-risk physiology and should trigger urgent evaluation for massive or submassive PE with right ventricular strain, even if other symptoms are minimal [^8a2185e5] [^e88c8354].

> Wait, let me verify frequencies so I don't overstate them. Contemporary registry data show dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain are indeed the most common, with hemoptysis around 6–13% overall and with notable variation by age and sex, being more frequent in younger men and uncommon in older women with high-risk PE, which aligns with the pathophysiology of pulmonary infarction being less likely in severe, central emboli [^19f1394f] [^b2326cb0]. I initially thought hemoptysis might approach 20–25%, but that higher range reflects older or pediatric series and is not representative of modern adult cohorts, so I should correct that estimate downward to roughly 6–13% in adults [^19f1394f].

> Next, I should review key signs. Tachycardia is the most consistent physical finding and is incorporated into validated pretest tools, though it is nonspecific and may reflect pain, anxiety, or hypoxemia rather than PE per se [^5f943aa8] [^b36b4392]. Hypoxemia with low oxygen saturation supports the diagnosis, particularly when unexplained by underlying lung disease, and should prompt further evaluation rather than reassurance [^8a2185e5] [^e88c8354]. Signs of deep vein thrombosis, such as unilateral leg swelling, erythema, or tenderness, meaningfully increase the pretest probability and, when present, justify starting with lower-extremity ultrasound because a proximal DVT confirms VTE and guides anticoagulation without pulmonary imaging [^5f943aa8] [^4d69279e]. Hemodynamic instability, including hypotension, shock, or cardiac arrest, defines high-risk PE and mandates immediate imaging and consideration of reperfusion therapies [^8a2185e5] [^e88c8354].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "typical" presentations. I need to check how severity modifies symptoms. High-risk PE is more often associated with dyspnea, syncope, and tachycardia, whereas pleuritic pain and hemoptysis may be less prominent because larger central emboli cause ischemia without infarction, explaining the discordance between severity and classic infarction symptoms [^b2326cb0] [^8a2185e5]. Conversely, low-risk PE may present with isolated pleuritic pain or even be incidentally discovered, reinforcing the need to integrate pretest probability rather than dismiss subtle symptoms [^8a2185e5] [^15157262].

> I should double-check age and sex effects. Older patients more often present with syncope and nonspecific dyspnea, and they less frequently have pleuritic pain or hemoptysis, which can mislead clinicians toward cardiac or metabolic etiologies rather than PE [^b2326cb0] [^19f1394f]. Younger men have a higher incidence of hemoptysis and pleuritic pain, whereas younger women may have more chest pain in low-risk presentations, underscoring the need to avoid anchoring bias by demographics [^b2326cb0] [^19f1394f]. These patterns also explain why pretest tools that include hemoptysis and clinical DVT signs may underperform in older adults with high-risk PE, so I need to adjust my threshold for imaging accordingly [^b2326cb0].

> Let me consider special populations. In pregnancy, dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain are common, but physiologic changes obscure diagnosis; guidelines emphasize a high index of suspicion and tailored imaging strategies, often favoring V/Q scanning when the chest radiograph is normal to minimize radiation, while using compression ultrasonography when DVT symptoms are present [^292d4f8e] [^db43f7d4]. In pediatrics, PE is uncommon but underrecognized; presentations include chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and syncope, and D-dimer and ECG are less reliable, so clinical suspicion plus imaging is critical when risk factors exist [^5734b533] [^3e043b22]. In hospitalized patients, fatal PE is frequently unsuspected, with a substantial fraction lacking typical symptoms, which means absence of classic features cannot safely exclude disease in high-risk inpatients [^7f93e367].

> But wait, what if the embolism is nonthrombotic. Nonthrombotic PEs, such as fat, tumor, or air embolism, can mimic thrombotic PE clinically, with dyspnea, hypoxemia, and hemodynamic compromise, yet they often lack the classic infarction symptoms like pleuritic pain or hemoptysis, so I should keep a broad differential when the context fits and tailor imaging and management to the embolic material [^08aab92c] [^704871cc].

> I need to ensure I integrate this into a practical approach. Because no single symptom or sign reliably diagnoses or excludes PE, I should use validated pretest probability tools such as Wells or revised Geneva, apply PERC in low-risk patients to safely avoid testing, and deploy D-dimer selectively with age-adjusted thresholds in those with low or intermediate probability before proceeding to CTPA or V/Q scanning, reserving immediate imaging for high-risk or unstable patients [^5f943aa8] [^0d6a0898] [^e88c8354]. This strategy reduces missed diagnoses while avoiding overtesting and the harms of unnecessary imaging and overtreatment [^c1db5e6f] [^f940cd3c].

> In summary, I should confirm that the most common presentation is sudden dyspnea with pleuritic chest pain, often accompanied by cough and occasionally hemoptysis, while tachycardia, hypoxemia, and signs of DVT are the most useful bedside findings. Syncope signals high-risk disease and should never be ignored. Presentation varies with severity, age, and sex, and many patients, especially inpatients, may have atypical or minimal symptoms, so a structured, risk-stratified approach is essential to avoid both missed PE and unnecessary testing [^8a2185e5] [^e88c8354] [^b2326cb0] [^7f93e367].

Pulmonary embolism (PE) presents with **nonspecific symptoms** and signs, making it easy to miss. The most common symptoms are **sudden dyspnea** [^8a2185e5], **pleuritic chest pain** [^44abdf71], and **tachycardia** [^5ca95c6e]; cough, hemoptysis, and syncope are also frequent [^5ca95c6e]. Signs include **tachypnea**, **hypoxemia**, and signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) such as unilateral leg swelling or tenderness [^5f943aa8]. Severe cases may show hypotension, cyanosis, or shock [^8a2185e5]. Because symptoms are nonspecific, use **clinical prediction rules** (Wells or Geneva) [^5f943aa8] and D-dimer testing [^e88c8354] to guide imaging and diagnosis [^f940cd3c].

---

## Common symptoms

The most frequently reported symptoms of PE include:

- **Dyspnea (shortness of breath)**: Sudden onset, often at rest, and may be severe [^8a2185e5] [^15157262].
- **Pleuritic chest pain**: Sharp, worsens with inspiration; the most common life-threatening cause of pleuritic pain [^44abdf71].
- **Tachycardia**: Heart rate > 100 bpm; a common and sensitive sign [^5f943aa8].
- **Cough**: May be dry or produce sputum; hemoptysis (coughing up blood) occurs in 6–13% [^19f1394f].
- **Syncope (fainting)**: Indicates severe PE with hemodynamic compromise [^8a2185e5].

---

## Common signs

Physical examination may reveal:

- **Tachypnea**: Rapid, shallow breathing; often present [^15157262].
- **Hypoxemia**: Low oxygen saturation (< 90%) on pulse oximetry [^notfound].
- **Signs of DVT**: Unilateral leg swelling, erythema, warmth, or tenderness [^c17615aa].
- **Tachycardia**: Heart rate > 100 bpm [^5f943aa8].
- **Fever**: Low-grade fever may occur, especially with pulmonary infarction [^notfound].
- **Pleural rub**: Rare, but may be heard on auscultation [^notfound].

---

## Less common symptoms and signs

PE can also present with less specific features, including:

- **Non-pleuritic chest pain**: Retrosternal or pressure-like pain [^86a69c3a].
- **Orthopnea**: Difficulty breathing when lying flat [^15157262].
- **Wheezing or stridor**: Due to bronchospasm or partial airway obstruction [^notfound].
- **Abdominal pain**: Rare, may mimic other intra-abdominal conditions [^5be14349].
- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias may occur [^86a69c3a].

---

## Severity-based clinical presentation

PE severity significantly influences presentation:

| **Severity** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|
| Low-risk PE | - Mild dyspnea <br/> - Pleuritic chest pain <br/> - Minimal hypoxemia <br/> - Often ambulatory [^notfound] |
| Intermediate-risk PE | - Moderate dyspnea <br/> - Chest pain <br/> - Tachycardia <br/> - Hypoxemia <br/> - Possible right ventricular dysfunction [^notfound] |
| High-risk PE | - Severe dyspnea <br/> - Syncope <br/> - Hypotension <br/> - Shock <br/> - Cardiac arrest <br/> - Marked hypoxemia <br/> - Right ventricular failure [^8a2185e5] |

---

## Special populations

Certain populations may have atypical presentations:

- **Elderly patients**: More likely to present with syncope, confusion, or nonspecific symptoms [^b2326cb0].
- **Pregnant patients**: Dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain are common, but diagnosis is challenging due to physiologic changes [^292d4f8e].
- **Patients with comorbidities**: COPD, heart failure, or malignancy may mask or alter typical symptoms [^0a50ba3e].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Given the nonspecific nature of symptoms and signs, a structured approach is essential:

- **Clinical prediction rules**: Wells or Geneva scores to assess pretest probability [^5f943aa8] [^b36b4392].
- **D-dimer testing**: High sensitivity; negative results in low-probability patients effectively exclude PE [^e88c8354] [^f918e8b1].
- **Imaging**: CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the gold standard; ventilation-perfusion scans or ultrasound are alternatives when CTPA is contraindicated [^e88c8354] [^3f3ca578].

---

Pulmonary embolism presents with **nonspecific symptoms and signs**, most commonly sudden dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and tachycardia [^8a2185e5]. Severe cases may show hypotension, cyanosis, or shock [^8a2185e5]. Because symptoms are nonspecific, use **clinical prediction rules** and D-dimer testing to guide imaging and diagnosis [^e88c8354].

Pulmonary embolism is one of the leading causes of death due to cardiovascular disease. Timely diagnosis is crucial, but challenging, as the clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism is unspecific and easily mistaken for other common medical emergencies. Clinical prediction rules and D-dimer measurement allow stratification of patients into groups of expected prevalence and are key elements in adequate selection of patients for diagnostic imaging; however, the strengths and weaknesses of the multiple proposed prediction rules, when to measure D-dimer, and which cutoff to apply might be elusive to a significant proportion of physicians. 13 international guidelines authored by medical societies or expert author groups provide recommendations on facets of the diagnostic investigations in suspected pulmonary embolism, some of which are hallmarked by pronounced heterogeneity. This Review summarises key recommendations of each guideline, considers the most recent evidence on the topic, compares guideline recommendations on each facet of the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, and provides a synthesis on the most common recommendations.

This first of two practice reviews addresses pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis considering important aspects of PE clinical presentation and comparing evidence-based PE testing strategies. A companion paper addresses the management of PE. Symptoms and signs of PE are varied, and emergency physicians frequently use testing to 'rule out' the diagnosis in people with respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms. The emergency clinician must balance the benefit of reassuring negative PE testing with the risks of iatrogenic harms from over investigation and overdiagnosis.

Advances in the management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) have improved diagnostic accuracy and made management algorithms safer, easier to use, and well standardized. These diagnostic algorithms are mainly based on the assessment of clinical pretest probability, D-dimer measurement, and imaging tests-predominantly computed tomography pulmonary angiography. These diagnostic algorithms allow safe and cost-effective diagnosis for most patients with suspected PE. In this review, we summarize signs and symptoms of PE, current existing evidence for PE diagnosis, and focus on the challenge of diagnosing PE in special patient populations, such as pregnant women, or patients with a prior VTE. We also discuss novel imaging tests for PE diagnosis and highlight some of the additional challenges that might require adjustments to current diagnostic strategies, such as the reduced clinical suspicion threshold, resulting in a lower proportion of PE among suspected patients as well as the overdiagnosis of subsegmental PE.

Objective

The purpose of this essay is to highlight the clinical features and imaging findings associated with different types of nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism.

Conclusion

Nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism is an infrequent condition with various causes that can be life-threatening pathologic conditions. The entity presents a diagnostic challenge because of the low specificity of clinical symptoms and imaging signs. Awareness of the imaging features of nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism facilitates correct diagnosis and leads to appropriate patient care.

### Pulmonary embolism: care standards in 2018 [^665607fd]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

### Diagnostic assessment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^36f8476f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common disorder that can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality through the clinical manifestations of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Although rapid diagnosis and treatment are critical in preventing PE, mortality and major morbidity due to conditions such as postthrombotic syndrome may complicate the differential diagnosis of VTE. The clinical symptoms associated with DVT are neither sensitive nor specific and can be indicative of a wide range of diagnoses. Because imaging studies can be expensive and are sometimes inconclusive, they should be used judiciously in patients with highly suspected VTE. This review offers a clinical perspective on the accurate, routine diagnosis of VTE, including an overview of common clinical signs and symptoms, as well as the advantages and drawbacks of available diagnostic strategies.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

The diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is challenging to even the most seasoned physician. Although dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia and haemoptysis are hallmark features, PE also presents with non‐specific symptoms like fever, syncope or cough. While hormone use, recent surgery or trauma, malignancy and prior venous thromboembolism (VTE) are well‐known predisposing factors, recent infection, autoimmune or inflammatory bowel disease and recent admission for heart failure or myocardial infarction are also risks. Pregnancy increases risk, particularly in the third trimester until 6 weeks post‐partum, though evidence for increased risk in the first two trimesters is less convincing. Advanced age, obesity and smoking amplify these risks.PE should be considered in any patient with common presenting symptoms and pervasive risk factors.

### How I diagnose acute pulmonary embolism [^f69e39fc]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is frequently considered in patients presenting to the emergency department or when hospitalized. Since symptoms are a-specific and the consequences of anticoagulant treatment are considerable, objective tests to either establish or refute the diagnosis have become a standard of care. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA), which has replaced pulmonary angiography as first-line imaging test, is associated with radiation exposure, several complications resulting from contrast dye administration, and over diagnosis. Importantly, CTPA can be avoided in 20% to 30% of patients who present with a first or recurrent episode of clinically suspected acute PE by using a standardized algorithm. This algorithm should always include a clinical decision rule to assess the likelihood that PE is present, followed by a D-dimer blood test and/or CTPA. The aim of this review is to provide clinicians this practical diagnostic management approach using evidence from the literature.

### Pulmonary embolism [^af6d5f19]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common illness that can cause death and disability. It is difficult to detect because patients present with a wide array of symptoms and signs. The clinical setting can raise suspicion, and certain inherited and acquired risk factors predispose susceptible individuals. D-dimer concentration in blood is the best laboratory screening test, and chest CT has become the most widespread imaging test. Treatment requires rapid and accurate risk stratification before haemodynamic decompensation and the development of cardiogenic shock. Anticoagulation is the foundation of therapy. Right-ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography and higher than normal concentrations of troponin identify high-risk patients who might need escalation of therapy with thrombolysis or embolectomy even if the blood pressure is normal on presentation. When patients are admitted to medical wards or when patients undergo surgery, their physicians should prescribe prophylactic measures to prevent PE. After hospital discharge, prophylaxis should continue for about a month for patients at high risk of thromboembolism.

### Diagnosis and management of pulmonary embolism [^eb2d44a1]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a challenging pathology commonly faced by emergency physicians, and diagnosis and management remain a crucial skill set. Inherent to the challenge is the breadth of presentation, ranging from asymptomatic pulmonary emboli to sudden cardiac death. Diagnosis and exclusion have evolved over time and now use a combination of clinical decision calculators and updates to the classic d-dimer cutoffs. Management of pulmonary emboli revolves around appropriate anticoagulation, which for most of the patients will comprise newer oral agents. However, there remains a substantial degree of practice variation and ambiguity when it comes to higher risk patients with submassive or massive pulmonary emboli.

### Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism: the task force for the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^704871cc]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Non-thrombotic PE does not represent a distinct clinical syndrome. It may be due to a variety of embolic materials and result in a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, making the diagnosis difficult. With the exception of severe air and fat embolism, the haemodynamic consequences of non-thrombotic emboli are usually mild. Treatment is mostly supportive but may differ according to the type of embolic material and clinical severity.

### Pulmonary embolism [^8a2185e5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on pulmonary embolism:

- **Definition**: PE is defined as an occlusion of the pulmonary artery or one of its branches, most often caused by a thrombus originating from deep veins of the lower extremities. The clot blocks blood flow to the pulmonary circulation, leading to impaired oxygen exchange and potentially life-threatening hemodynamic instability.
- **Pathophysiology**: Most pulmonary emboli (70–80%) arise from thrombi in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis, though about 6% originate in the upper extremities. Thrombosis is promoted by Venous stasis, Endothelial injury, and Hypercoagulability-the classic Virchow triad. Risk factors include major surgery, trauma, immobility, cancer, estrogen therapy, pregnancy, and inherited thrombophilias. Hemodynamic compromise results from increased pulmonary vascular resistance, RV overload, reduced LV filling, and decreased cardiac output.
- **Epidemiology**: PE occurs in approximately 60–120 cases per 100,000 people per year, causing an estimated 60,000–100,000 deaths annually in the US. Incidence increases with age, from fewer than 50 per 100,000 in those younger than 50 to about 350 per 100,000 in people older than 75. Widespread use of CT pulmonary angiography has increased diagnosis, including detection of smaller, nonfatal emboli. In-hospital mortality is about 14%, and 90-day mortality approaches 20%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for PE include immobilization or recent surgery, previous history of DVT or PE, malignancy, and certain genetic conditions. Other factors such as HR > 100 bpm and the presence of hemoptysis can also increase the likelihood of PE according to the Wells' Criteria.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, PE can present with a variety of symptoms including acute dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, tachycardia, and syncope. Some patients may also present with hemoptysis or signs of DVT such as unilateral leg swelling. Severe cases can cause hypotension, right HF, or cardiac arrest. Complications can include RV dysfunction, arrhythmia, hemodynamic collapse, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of PE varies depending on patient's hemodynamic status, underlying disease, and the presence of RV dysfunction. Adverse events within 30 days of PE diagnosis, such as death, secondary cardiogenic shock, or recurrent VTE, occur in approximately 7.4% of patients. Long-term prognosis can be influenced by the cause of the PE, with idiopathic PE associated with a worse long-term survival compared to other causes.

### Pulmonary embolism: an unsuspected killer [^a9d3e7f2]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The presentation of PE is often subtle and may mimic other diseases. Many pulmonary emboli invariably preclude diagnosis by their occult nature or by leading to rapid death from cardiopulmonary arrest. In patients who do manifest symptoms from PE, accurate diagnosis is essential. Often it is difficult to distinguish the vague symptoms of PE from other diagnoses, such as acute coronary syndrome, pneumonia, COPD, CHF, aortic dissection, myocarditis or pericarditis, pneumothorax, and musculo-skeletal or gastrointestinal causes. Regardless of the presentation, the most fundamental step in making the diagnosis of PE is first to consider it. Historical clues and risk factors should raise the clinician's suspicion.PE is an unsuspected killer with a nebulous presentation and high mortality. In all likelihood, PE will remain an elusive diagnosis despite advances in technology and a wealth of research. A high index of suspicion is required, but no amount of suspicion would eliminate all missed cases. Patients with significant underlying cardiopulmonary disease seem to be the most challenging. Patients with significant comorbidity have poor reserve and are likely to have poor outcomes, especially if the diagnosis is not made and anticoagulation is not initiated early. Controversy exists over the best diagnostic approach to PE. A battery of diagnostic studies is available, with few providing definitive answers. Studies such as CT may be helpful at some institutions but offer poor predictive value at others. Other diagnostic tests are not universally available. It is hoped that further research and improvements in current diagnostic modalities will clear some of the current confusion and controversy of this ubiquitous and deadly disease.

### Clinical manifestation of pulmonary embolism [^51a511bd]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Results of prospective studies have shown that physicians' estimate of clinical likelihoods of PE have predictive value. The ability of clinicians to assess the factors that determine the probability of disease based on clinical manifestations such as history and signs and symptoms at presentation, and to make bedside estimates of that probability, has not been systematically studied. Data suggest that that this would be a fruitful area of future investigation. Susec et al noted that there has been a total of three studies (including their own) which have examined the clinical features such as risk factors, signs, and symptoms associated with PE in ambulatory outpatients. Hence, the data collected thus far might not be generalizable to the ED patient population. As with other illnesses, the ED patients usually present later and more atypically. The prevalence of PE could be lower among this population compared with hospitalized patients, causing a lower positive predictive value, derivable from the clinical features and risk factors at presentation. Finally, the ED patient population is usually healthier and younger than the hospitalized patients, and it is well recognized that PE can be clinically silent in young patients and that 28% have no associated risk factors. Based on their finding, the authors argue that clinical pathways to risk stratify patients in an ambulatory setting could be less useful than anticipated. The validity of these findings needs further investigation, however.

### Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^aa19ac2c]. Thrombosis Research (2001). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common, lethal yet treatable disease. The clinical diagnosis of PE remains to be a problem due to the nonspecific presenting signs, symptoms, electrocardiographic findings, arterial blood gas abnormalities and chest X-ray changes. Despite these nonspecific clinical findings, clinicians are adept at assigning pretest probability using overall clinical assessment. Clinical models have been developed to improve the accuracy of pretest probability assessment. D-dimers are becoming a widely available clinical tool useful in the diagnostic management of suspected PE. The limitations of the imaging modalities for PE [ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scanning, spiral computerised tomography, pulmonary angiography and venous leg imaging] necessitate the use of these tests in series and in combination with clinical pretest probability assessment and D-dimer in diagnostic management algorithms. These algorithms permit safe diagnostic management of patients with suspected PE while limiting invasiveness, inaccessibility and expense.

### Computer tomography for venous thromboembolic disease [^6a320576]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolic disease is composed of two disease entities: pulmonary thromboembolism/pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis. Clinical signs and symptoms of venous thromboembolic disease often are nonspecific and, as a result, the diagnosis may be difficult. If left untreated, pulmonary embolism can lead to a potentially fatal outcome. This article focuses on CT angiography as the diagnostic modality for thromboembolic pulmonary embolism and briefly discusses nonthromboembolic pulmonary embolism.

### An official American Thoracic Society / Society of Thoracic Radiology clinical practice guideline: evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism in pregnancy [^47fe2d58]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism in pregnancy — burden and diagnostic yield context are described as follows: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of pregnancy-related mortality in the developed world, accounting for 20% of maternal deaths in the United States. Accurate clinical diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pregnancy is notoriously difficult due to the overlap of signs and symptoms between physiologic changes of pregnancy and development of PE or deep venous thrombosis (DVT). VTE is ultimately confirmed in less than 10% of pregnant women who present with concerning clinical features.

### Diagnostic strategies for suspected pulmonary embolism [^1a32ac95]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism often remains a difficult diagnosis for the clinician, particularly in patients with comorbidity factors. This is in contrast with the availability of effective treatment, which should be prescribed as soon as possible. To date, there is still no ideal diagnostic test that is accurate, safe, readily available and cost-effective. Recent technical advances in computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and laboratory findings have raised new possibilities in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains one of the most challenging medical diseases in the emergency department. PE is a potentially life threatening diagnosis that is seen in patients with chest pain and/or dyspnea but can span the clinical spectrum of medical presentations. In addition, it does not have any particular clinical feature, laboratory test, or diagnostic modality that can independently and confidently exclude its possibility. This article offers a review of PE in the emergency department. It emphasizes the appropriate determination of pretest probability, the approach to diagnosis and management, and special considerations related to pregnancy and radiation exposure.

### Pulmonary embolism [^68efa932]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

PE is one of the great challenges in medicine. It is a disease that carries with it a high mortality rate, yet no historical piece of information, physical examination finding, or diagnostic modality is perfect at excluding its possibility. Emergency physicians must be vigilant about considering PE in the differential diagnosis of a variety of presenting complaints and must use a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic options as they manage patients with suspected or confirmed PE. The diagnostic options range from bedside diagnostic tests to highly specialized imaging available at only specialized institutions. Knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each of the diagnostic modalities assists the physician in employing the best test. Therapeutic options also vary widely and include anticoagulation, vena caval interruption, systemic thrombolysis, embolectomy, and other therapeutic adjuncts, such as ECMO and inhaled nitric oxide. Similarly, awareness of the indications and contraindications to the varied therapeutic agents ensures appropriate therapy when the diagnosis is made.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^b8e31177]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Description

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a severe disease and is difficult to diagnose, given its nonspecific signs and symptoms. Because of this, testing patients with suspected acute PE has increased dramatically. However, the overuse of some tests, particularly computed tomography (CT) and plasma d-dimer measurement, may not improve care while potentially leading to patient harm and unnecessary expense.

Methods

The literature search encompassed studies indexed by MEDLINE (1966–2014; English-language only) and included all clinical trials and meta-analyses on diagnostic strategies, decision rules, laboratory tests, and imaging studies for the diagnosis of PE. This document is not based on a formal systematic review, but instead seeks to provide practical advice based on the best available evidence and recent guidelines. The target audience for this paper is all clinicians; the target patient population is all adults, both inpatient and outpatient, suspected of having acute PE.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients in whom acute PE is being considered.

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should not obtain d-dimer measurements or imaging studies in patients with a low pretest probability of PE and who meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria.

Best Practice Advice 3

Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should not use imaging studies as the initial test in patients who have a low or intermediate pretest probability of PE.

Best Practice Advice 4

Clinicians should use age-adjusted d-dimer thresholds (age × 10 ng/mL rather than a generic 500 ng/mL) in patients older than 50 years to determine whether imaging is warranted.

Best Practice Advice 5

Clinicians should not obtain any imaging studies in patients with a d-dimer level below the age-adjusted cutoff.

Best Practice Advice 6

Clinicians should obtain imaging with CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in patients with high pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should reserve ventilation-perfusion scans for patients who have a contraindication to CTPA or if CTPA is not available. Clinicians should not obtain a d-dimer measurement in patients with a high pretest probability of PE.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, stratification, and natural history of pulmonary embolism [^569193f4]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially fatal form of venous thromboembolism that can be challenging to diagnose and manage. PE occurs when there is obstruction of the pulmonary vasculature and is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. A combination of acquired and inherited factors may contribute to the development of this disease and should be considered, since they have implications for both susceptibility to PE and treatment. Patients with suspected PE should be evaluated efficiently to diagnose and administer therapy as soon as possible, but the presentation of PE is variable and nonspecific so diagnosis is challenging. PE can range from small, asymptomatic blood clots to large emboli that can occlude the pulmonary arteries causing sudden cardiovascular collapse and death. Thus, risk stratification is critical to both the prognosis and management of acute PE. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, and natural history of PE and deep vein thrombosis.

BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to measure the incidence of the signs and symptoms of acute PE according to age, sex, BMI and PE severity. We demonstrated that the signs and symptoms of acute PE depend on the severity of PE and patient characteristics. However, PE diagnosis remains challenging. The suspicion of PE was based on pretest probability scores, and the diagnosis was confirmed using MDCT-PA.

This study analysed the incidence of symptoms and signs commonly present in acute PE according to severity, age, sex and BMI. We assume that these factors influence the clinical picture of acute PE and that clinicians should be aware of these relationships.

Haemoptysis is a typical symptom of acute PE and is included in the Geneva revised score and the Wells score. The reported incidence of haemoptysis in patients with acute PE, regardless of PE severity, was 6%–13%. In our cohort, the incidence of haemoptysis varied depending on age and sex, with younger men having an incidence of haemoptysis between 11.5% and 16.5% in all strata of PE risk, whereas the incidence of haemoptysis in the other three subgroups was < 5.0% in high-risk PE. The presence of haemoptysis is a consequence of pulmonary infarction, and its presence was more likely to be detected in younger patients according to the investigation by Ruaro et al. However, this study enrolled 493 patients with acute PE, and there were no data about the association of sex with the presence of pulmonary infarction, especially with respect to the mortality risk score. In that study, the incidence of pulmonary infarction decreased significantly with increasing PE severity, similar to our results.

### Diagnosis and exclusion of pulmonary embolism [^3bfb7617]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Failure to test for pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a lethal mistake, but PE and produces symptoms similar to many other diseases. Overtesting for PE has negative consequences.

Objectives

Use published evidence to create a rationale and safe diagnostic approach for ambulatory and emergency patients with suspected PE in 2017.

Findings

Pulmonary embolism need not be pursued in patients with no symptoms of PE in the present or recent history (dyspnea, chest pain, cough or syncope), and always normal vital signs. When clinicians have a low clinical suspicion for PE or a Wells score < 2, they can reasonably exclude PE with the Pulmonary Embolism Rule out Criteria (PERC rule). For patients with a "PE-unlikely" pretest probability (Wells or simplified revised Geneva score < 5), PE can be ruled out with a normal or age-adjusted D-dimer concentrations. Other patients should undergo pulmonary vascular imaging, and the choices are discussed, including computerized tomographic pulmonary angiography, planar and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).

Conclusions

A thoughtful algorithm for PE exclusion and diagnosis requires pretest probability assessment in all patients, followed by selective use of clinical criteria, the quantitative D-dimer, and pulmonary vascular imaging.

### Pulmonary embolism [^d0ce7aa9]. Chest Surgery Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common problem for which prompt diagnosis and treatment is essential to minimize mortality. The clinical presentation is more variable than sudden dyspnea and chest pain, especially in the critical care patient. Recognition of venous thromboembolic (VTE) risk factors can help develop a good clinical suspicion for PE. A wide range of diagnostic tests are available to the clinician. The ventilation/perfusion scan, pulmonary arteriogram, and lower extremity investigations are still important for diagnosis. Other noninvasive tests such as spiral CT with venography, echocardiography, and D-dimers are becoming more accepted. Heparin is the mainstay of PE therapy, but thrombolytic treatment may be lifesaving in the unstable patient. VTE prophylaxis should be considered in all post-operative or critical care patients.

Conclusion

The suggested approaches are based on a non-systematic review of the guidelines and literature, and expert consensus. Management in an individual patient should be based on clinical risk–benefit assessment, careful management of coagulation status and effective physician–patient communication. Structured follow-up post-acute PE is important to improve patient outcomes, including diagnosing CTEPH. How best to deliver such care and how best to structure follow-up PE clinics requires further evaluation.

### Pulmonary embolism in pregnancy [^1efcbd99]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the leading cause of maternal mortality in the developed world. Mortality from PE in pregnancy might be related to challenges in targeting the right population for prevention, ensuring that diagnosis is suspected and adequately investigated, and initiating timely and best possible treatment of this disease. Pregnancy is an example of Virchow's triad: hypercoagulability, venous stasis, and vascular damage; together these factors lead to an increased incidence of venous thromboembolism. This disorder is often suspected in pregnant women because some of the physiological changes of pregnancy mimic its signs and symptoms. Despite concerns for fetal teratogenicity and oncogenicity associated with diagnostic testing, and potential adverse effects of pharmacological treatment, an accurate diagnosis of PE and a timely therapeutic intervention are crucial. Appropriate prophylaxis should be weighed against the risk of complications and offered according to risk stratification.

### Patient information: pulmonary embolism… [^3bb42ab2]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that blocks a blood vessel in the lung. A PE is usually caused by a blood clot that forms in a vein and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. In the US, PE affects approximately 370 000 people per year and is estimated to cause 60 000 to 100 000 deaths per year. Signs and Symptoms of Pulmonary Embolism Patients with a small PE may experience no symptoms. Larger PEs commonly cause shortness of breath and chest pain. Very large PEs can limit the heart's ability to deliver blood to the lung, causing low blood pressure, fainting, or death. Risk Factors for Pulmonary Embolism. Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism The first step of diagnosis involves determining the likelihood of PE using a validated scoring system or the clinical opinion of a treating clinician.

Patients at low or moderate risk of PE typically undergo blood testing for D-dimer, which is a by-product of blood clotting. If the D-dimer level is low, no further evaluation for PE is needed. An imaging study should be ordered for all patients at high risk of PE and those at low or intermediate risk who have elevated D-dimer. The preferred imaging test is a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram, which uses intravenous contrast to identify blood clots in the pulmonary artery. Patients at high risk of death from PE without an increased risk of bleeding should receive a clot-dissolving medication. Other treatment options for high-risk PE may include catheter-based therapy or surgery to remove blood clots from the lung. Potential Consequences of Pulmonary Embolism. Some patients develop post-PE syndrome, which may include shortness of breath and decreased health-related quality of life several months after starting anticoagulation.

Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with an acute PE develop chronically elevated pressure in the pulmonary artery. This condition has a mortality rate of 25% to 30% at 3 years, if untreated, but can be cured or improved with surgery.

### Beyond pulmonary embolism; nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism as diagnostic challenges [^b48c53c3]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism (NTPE) is less well understood and is encountered less frequently than pulmonary embolism from venous thrombosis. NTPE results from embolization of nonthrombotic material to the pulmonary vasculature originating from many different cell types as well as nonbiologic or foreign materials. For many radiologists NTPE is a challenging diagnosis, presenting nonspecific or unusual imaging findings in the setting of few or unusual clinical signs. The aim of this paper is to review the pathophysiology of diverse causes of NTPE, which should aid radiologists to better understand and, more importantly, diagnose these infrequent events.

Introduction

Recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) have significantly improved patient prognoses. However, its clinical presentation is variable, and proper management depends on prompt diagnosis. The most common symptoms of PE are dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain and cough. The correlation between clinical presentation and PE severity has not been investigated, and this relationship may change over time. Thus, there is some recent evidence that age and the presence of comorbidities could be associated with some clinical presentations of acute PE, such as pulmonary infarction, which has been demonstrated more in younger patients with fewer comorbidities, antiphospholipid syndrome in sarcoidosisor acute PE without deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Current guidelinessuggest using pretest probability scores, such as the revised Le Gal et al Kline and Wellsand YEARS, together with D-dimer testing to select normotensive patients with suspected PE for CT-pulmonary angiography (CT-PA) for final diagnosis. These tools use demographic data (age), anamnestic data (history of malignancies, recent surgery, immobilisation or previous venous thromboembolism), signs (tachycardia, DVT and haemoptysis) and symptoms (unilateral lower limb pain). However, the clinical presentation varies depending on the severity of PE. For instance, acute severe PE may be oligosymptomatic, presented only as dyspnoea and tachycardia, and represented as a low probability using all three pretest probability scores. High-risk PE may be easily overlooked because of the lack of common elements in pretest probability rules (eg, haemoptysis and signs of DVT) that are elements of the pretest scores, but they might be rarely present in high-risk PE patients. Thus, the suspicion of acute PE is based on pretest probability scores in emergency settings, where inexperienced doctors often try to diagnose acute PE that can be presented with multiple manifestations and is mixed with the symptoms and signs of adjacent comorbidities.

A better understanding of the association of some important patient characteristics, such as age, sex and body mass index (BMI), with the clinical presentation of acute PE of different severity, is needed for better diagnosis of the disease. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the clinical presentation of acute PE, PE severity and patient age and sex. We examined the incidence of major clinical signs and symptoms of acute PE in younger and older (according to median age) men and women with respect to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) mortality risk model.

### Pulmonary embolism: making sense of the diagnostic evaluation [^17ab444d]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Despite the publication of the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis in 1990, the diagnostic evaluation of pulmonary embolism continues to be approached in an inconsistent fashion. The reasons for this are unclear but likely have to do with inadequate methods for predicting pretest probability of disease and the inconvenience and perceived risk of pulmonary angiography. Because pulmonary embolism and its treatment carry substantial risk of morbidity and mortality, a consistent approach to evaluation is desirable. This article reviews large, prospective studies that suggest that it may be unnecessary to diagnose pulmonary embolism with the certainty that pulmonary angiography allows. Finally, the article proposes an algorithm that may be acceptable to patients and clinicians alike if safety is confirmed in future prospective studies.

### Cost-effectiveness of strategies for diagnosing pulmonary embolism among emergency department patients presenting with undifferentiated symptoms [^3c7b227b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Symptoms associated with pulmonary embolism can be nonspecific and similar to many competing diagnoses, leading to excessive costly testing and treatment, as well as missed diagnoses. Objective studies are essential for diagnosis. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of different diagnostic strategies in an emergency department (ED) for patients presenting with undifferentiated symptoms suggestive of pulmonary embolism.

Methods

Using a probabilistic decision model, we evaluated the incremental costs and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life-years gained) of 60 testing strategies for 5 patient pretest categories (distinguished by Wells score [high, moderate, or low] and whether deep venous thrombosis is clinically suspected). We performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

Results

In the base case, for all patient pretest categories, the most cost-effective diagnostic strategy is to use an initial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay D-dimer test, followed by compression ultrasonography of the lower extremities if the D-dimer is above a specified cutoff. The level of the preferred cutoff varies with the Wells pretest category and whether a deep venous thrombosis is clinically suspected. D-dimer cutoffs higher than the current recommended cutoff were often preferred for patients with even moderate and high Wells categories. Compression ultrasonography accuracy had to decrease below commonly cited levels in the literature before it was not part of a preferred strategy.

Conclusion

When pulmonary embolism is suspected in the ED, use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay D-dimer assay, often at cutoffs higher than those currently in use (for patients in whom deep venous thrombosis is not clinically suspected), followed by compression ultrasonography as appropriate, can reduce costs and improve outcomes.

### Acute pulmonary embolism: a review [^e88c8354]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is characterized by occlusion of blood flow in a pulmonary artery, typically due to a thrombus that travels from a vein in a lower limb. The incidence of PE is approximately 60 to 120 per 100 000 people per year. Approximately 60 000 to 100 000 patients die from PE each year in the US.

Observations

PE should be considered in patients presenting with acute chest pain, shortness of breath, or syncope. The diagnosis is determined by chest imaging. In patients with a systolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg, the following 3 steps can be used to evaluate a patient with possible PE: assessment of the clinical probability of PE, D-dimer testing if indicated, and chest imaging if indicated. The clinical probability of PE can be assessed using a structured score or using clinical gestalt. In patients with a probability of PE that is less than 15%, the presence of 8 clinical characteristics (age < 50 years, heart rate < 100/min, an oxygen saturation level of > 94%, no recent surgery or trauma, no prior venous thromboembolism event, no hemoptysis, no unilateral leg swelling, and no estrogen use) identifies patients at very low risk of PE in whom no further testing is needed. In patients with low or intermediate clinical probability, a D-dimer level of less than 500 ng/mL is associated with a posttest probability of PE less than 1.85%. In these patients, PE can be excluded without chest imaging. A further refinement of D-dimer threshold is possible in patients aged 50 years and older, and in patients with a low likelihood of PE. Patients with a high probability of PE (ie, > 40% probability) should undergo chest imaging, and D-dimer testing is not necessary. In patients with PE and a systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher, compared with heparin combined with a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin followed by warfarin alone, direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran, are noninferior for treating PE and have a 0.6% lower rate of bleeding. In patients with PE and systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mm Hg, systemic thrombolysis is recommended and is associated with an 1.6% absolute reduction of mortality (from 3.9% to 2.3%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In the US, PE affects approximately 370 000 patients per year and may cause approximately 60 000 to 100 000 deaths per year. First-line therapy consists of direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran, with thrombolysis reserved for patients with systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mm Hg.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — epidemiology, sources, and outcomes are summarized as follows: PE occurs in 250,000 patients annually, and the vast majority (90%–95%) arise from deep vein thrombosis of the legs, most involving proximal veins; additional sources include mobile masses, endocarditis, thrombi on indwelling lines or leads, and thrombi or tumors from right-heart structures. PE is the third most common cause of vascular death after myocardial infarction and stroke and the leading preventable cause of death in hospital patients; about 10% or more of symptomatic cases are rapidly fatal, another 5% die after starting treatment, about a third are left with residual symptoms, and 2% develop thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension due to unresolved PE.

### Simple and accurate prediction of the clinical probability of pulmonary embolism [^8fb42f2e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Rationale

Clinical probability assessment is a fundamental step in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.

Objectives

To develop a predictive model for pulmonary embolism based on clinical symptoms, signs, and the interpretation of the electrocardiogram.

Methods

The model was developed from a database of 1,100 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, of whom 440 had the disease confirmed by angiography or autopsy findings. It was validated in an independent sample of 400 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (71% were inpatients). Easy-to-use software was developed for computing the clinical probability on palm computers and mobile phones.

Measurements and Main Results

The model comprises 16 variables of which 10 (older age, male sex, prolonged immobilization, history of deep vein thrombosis, sudden-onset dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, hemoptysis, unilateral leg swelling, electrocardiographic signs of acute cor pulmonale) are positively associated, and 6 (prior cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, orthopnea, high fever, wheezes, or crackles on chest auscultation) are negatively associated with pulmonary embolism. In the validation sample, 165 (41%) of 400 patients had pulmonary embolism confirmed by angiography. The prevalence of pulmonary embolism was 2% when the predicted clinical probability was slight (0 to 10%), 28% when moderate (11 to 50%), 67% when substantial (51 to 80%), and 94% when high (81 to 100%). There was no significant difference between inpatients and outpatients with respect to the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in the four probability categories.

Conclusions

The proposed model is simple and accurate, and it may aid physicians when assessing the clinical probability of pulmonary embolism.

Immediate CT applies to patients who are "Hemodynamically unstable, with suspected PE" or have "High pretest probability of PE", with the basis that "Risks of inaction outweigh risks of CT" and that there is an "Incidence of PE 19%-28% even with a d-dimer level < 500 ng/mL". Defer CT until after d-dimer result for "Intermediate pretest probability" or "Low pretest probability and PERC > 0", supported by "Low incidence of PE (< 1.1%) if d-dimer level < 500 ng/mL". No CT or d-dimer test is suggested for "Low pretest probability and PERC = 0", given an "Incidence of PE < 1%". For patients with symptoms of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and PE, "Begin with lower-extremity venous ultrasonography", because "Similar treatment will be pursued without exposing the patient to the risks of radiation or intravenous contrast". A safety note states, "Hemodynamic instability may make transport for imaging problematic. Supportive measures or empirical anticoagulation until imaging can be obtained may be required".

### Signs and symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism and their predictive value for all-cause hospital death in respect of severity of the disease, age, sex and body mass index: retrospective analysis of the regional PE registry (REPER) [^b2326cb0]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Background

The incidence of the signs and symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) according to mortality risk, age and sex has been partly explored.

Patients and Methods

A total of 1242 patients diagnosed with acute PE and included in the Regional Pulmonary Embolism Registry were enrolled in the study. Patients were classified as low risk, intermediate risk or high risk according to the European Society of Cardiology mortality risk model. The incidence of the signs and symptoms of acute PE at presentation with respect to sex, age, and PE severity was investigated.

Results

The incidence of haemoptysis was higher in younger men with intermediate-risk (11.7% vs 7.5% vs 5.9% vs 2.3%; p = 0.01) and high-risk PE (13.8% vs 2.5% vs 0.0% vs 3.1%; p = 0.031) than in older men and women. The frequency of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis was not significantly different between subgroups. Older women with low-risk PE presented with chest pain less commonly (35.8% vs 55.8% vs 48.8% vs 51.9%, respectively; p = 0.023) than men and younger women. However, younger women had a higher incidence of chest pain in the lower-risk PE group than in the intermediate-risk and high-risk PE subgroups (51.9%, 31.4% and 27.8%, respectively; p = 0.001). The incidence of dyspnoea (except in older men), syncope and tachycardia increased with the risk of PE in all subgroups (p < 0.01). In the low-risk PE group, syncope was present more often in older men and women than in younger patients (15.5% vs 11.3% vs 4.5% vs 4.5%; p = 0.009). The incidence of pneumonia was higher in younger men with low-risk PE (31.8% vs < 16% in the other subgroups, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Haemoptysis and pneumonia are prominent features of acute PE in younger men, whereas older patients more frequently have syncope with low-risk PE. Dyspnoea, syncope and tachycardia are symptoms of high-risk PE irrespective of sex and age.

### Clinical features of suspected and unsuspected fatal pulmonary emboli in hospitalized patients [^7f93e367]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is often unsuspected by treating clinicians. Since the adoption of clinical prediction scores for PE and the widespread availability of computed tomography (CT)-pulmonary angiogram, there are few reports of clinical presentations of hospitalized patients who died of PE.

Objectives

To compare the clinical signs, symptoms, and comorbidities of hospitalized patients who died of PE for whom PE was suspected versus not suspected antemortem.

Study Design and Methods

Case-control study from January 1999 to December 2018 in one Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital. We compared groups to examine differences in clinical presentations of fatal PE over the two decades.

Results

Among 1345 autopsies performed during the study period, 52 patients (4%) with fatal PE were included in the final analyses. PE was unsuspected before death in 29/52 patients (56%). Comparing groups, there were significant differences for: dyspnea (suspected 91%; unsuspected: 59%, p = 0.01); active malignancy (suspected 74%; unsuspected: 28%, p = 0.002); and atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking treatment (suspected: 62%; unsuspected 30%, p = 0.03). A greater proportion of patients with unsuspected PE lacked symptoms of PE (suspected 0%; unsuspected: 31%, p = 0.003).

Conclusions

Fatal PE remains a common, unsuspected cause of inpatient death in the modern era. Symptoms of PE, active malignancy, and potentially confounding AV nodal blocking treatment were less frequent in patients with unsuspected PE. These data highlight the variation in presentation and the challenge of making the diagnosis in many hospitalized patients, particularly those without typical symptoms.

### Clinical characteristics of patients with acute pulmonary embolism: data from PIOPED II [^15157262]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Selection of patients for diagnostic tests for acute pulmonary embolism requires recognition of the possibility of pulmonary embolism on the basis of the clinical characteristics. Patients in the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis II had a broad spectrum of severity, which permits an evaluation of the subtle characteristics of mild pulmonary embolism and the characteristics of severe pulmonary embolism.

Methods

Data are from the national collaborative study, Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis II.

Results

There may be dyspnea only on exertion. The onset of dyspnea is usually, but not always, rapid. Orthopnea may occur. In patients with pulmonary embolism in the main or lobar pulmonary arteries, dyspnea or tachypnea occurred in 92%, but the largest pulmonary embolism was in the segmental pulmonary arteries in only 65%. In general, signs and symptoms were similar in elderly and younger patients, but dyspnea or tachypnea was less frequent in elderly patients with no previous cardiopulmonary disease. Dyspnea may be absent even in patients with circulatory collapse. Patients with a low-probability objective clinical assessment sometimes had pulmonary embolism, even in proximal vessels.

Conclusion

Symptoms may be mild, and generally recognized symptoms may be absent, particularly in patients with pulmonary embolism only in the segmental pulmonary branches, but they may be absent even with severe pulmonary embolism. A high or intermediate-probability objective clinical assessment suggests the need for diagnostic studies, but a low-probability objective clinical assessment does not exclude the diagnosis. Maintenance of a high level of suspicion is critical.

### Pulmonary embolism [^004bc305]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is caused by emboli, which have originated from venous thrombi, travelling to and occluding the arteries of the lung. PE is the most dangerous form of venous thromboembolism, and undiagnosed or untreated PE can be fatal. Acute PE is associated with right ventricular dysfunction, which can lead to arrhythmia, haemodynamic collapse and shock. Furthermore, individuals who survive PE can develop post-PE syndrome, which is characterized by chronic thrombotic remains in the pulmonary arteries, persistent right ventricular dysfunction, decreased quality of life and/or chronic functional limitations. Several important improvements have been made in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of acute PE in recent years, such as the introduction of a simplified diagnostic algorithm for suspected PE as well as phase III trials demonstrating the value of direct oral anticoagulants in acute and extended treatment of venous thromboembolism. Future research should aim to address novel treatment options (for example, fibrinolysis enhancers) and improved methods for predicting long-term complications and defining optimal anticoagulant therapy parameters in individual patients, and to gain a greater understanding of post-PE syndrome.

### Improving the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the emergency department [^8b238028]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department is challenging due to the lack of clinical diagnostic criteria and imperfect investigations. The presenting symptoms are common and non-specific varying from chest pain, shortness of breath, cough and haemoptysis, to syncope and cardiac arrest. There is a high false positive rate with non-invasive testing (d-dimer) but relatively significant potential adverse events (radiation and contrast associated complications) with more invasive testing such as Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA).

Various scoring systems exist in an attempt to limit unnecessary imaging for those identified as having a low pre-test probability of pulmonary embolism without increasing the risk of missing the potentially life threatening diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Using a combination of the Wells score and either a d-dimer (if PERC positive) or no testing (if PERC negative) can reduce the need for imaging. These scoring systems are particularly useful for junior doctors who may lack clinical experience. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) has been validated for use within the emergency department. Within the emergency departments in which this project was undertaken there were no specific guidelines that junior doctors were required to follow although discussion with senior clinicians prior to requesting a d-dimer or imaging was encouraged.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines describe proposed best standards that should be met when considering the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism which involves appropriate use of the Wells scoring system.

Below is a summary of these guidelines:

Patients with signs or symptoms of pulmonary embolism should all have an assessment of their general medical history, a physical examination, and a chest X-ray. All patients with suspected pulmonary embolism should have their probability of pulmonary embolism assessed using the two-level Pulmonary Embolism Wells score.

Patients with a likely two-level Wells score should NOT have a d-dimer and be offered CTPA with the exception of patients with contrast allergy, renal impairment, or in whom risk of irradiation is high who should instead be offered a Ventilation Perfusion (V/Q) scan. All patients not able to have immediate imaging should have interim parenteral anticoagulant therapy.

### Chest pain mimicking pulmonary embolism may be a common presentation of COVID-19 in ambulant patients without other typical features of infection [^bf22f9e7]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Given the strong link with immunothrombosis and the peripheral distribution of lung parenchymal changes associated with COVID‐19, we hypothesized that a proportion of mild COVID‐19 cases may present with chest pain secondary to localized pulmonary infarction and subsequent irritation of the adjacent lung pleura. Due to the focal nature of the infection, these patients would not necessarily present with classical COVID‐19 symptoms of breathlessness, dry cough, fever and loss of taste; instead, they may present to the emergency department with pleuritic‐type chest pain. Our aims were therefore to investigate outpatients presenting with suspected PE symptoms, but where PE was not confirmed by CTPA during a three month period in 2020 at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic in the UK and also over the corresponding timeframe in 2019. The clinical and radiological features of these cases and later SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody serology in those who were tested are reviewed.

### Diagnostic management of acute pulmonary embolism: a prediction model based on a patient data meta-analysis [^f940cd3c]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The diagnostic management of pulmonary embolism (PE) is a challenge faced by physicians in emergency rooms, outpatient clinics, and hospital wards, because signs and symptoms of PE are non-specific. The threshold to refer patients for (further) testing is usually low, since the consequences of a missed PE diagnosis can be serious and potentially fatal. PE can be confirmed or ruled out with sensitive and specific imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion scanning.

The use of a diagnostic algorithm based on a clinical decision rule, consisting of medical history and physical examination findings, combined with D-dimer testing is recommended in patients with clinically suspected PE to exclude the disease and thereby reduce the need for CT scans. This is important since imaging results in radiation exposure, risk of contrast reactions or nephropathy, increased healthcare utilization and costs, overdiagnosis of small clots with uncertain relevance, and potential shortage of iodinated contrast material. In patients with a low or intermediate clinical probability and a D-dimer below a fixed or variable threshold, PE is considered excluded and imaging can be safely withheld. Nonetheless, up to 50% to 70% of patients with suspected PE with non-low clinical probability and elevated D-dimer levels are referred for imaging, and PE is not diagnosed in about 70% of those. Moreover, there are concerns about the generalizability of these algorithms given the differences in case-mix and PE prevalence across healthcare settings.

Thus far, the development of PE diagnostic scores has focused on simplicity, allowing the scores to be calculated at the bedside to rapidly decide which patients should be referred for D-dimer testing or directly for imaging. These scores are based on simple multivariable logistic regression models in which continuous variables were often categorized and potential interaction was ignored. Derivation of most PE diagnostic models also did not follow state-of-the-art methodological principles currently recommended including use of multiple imputation and internal-external validation. Finally, several diagnostic PE models include a subjective 'Gestalt' variable to indicate whether 'PE is the most likely diagnosis', which is difficult to standardize as it may vary depending on physician experience.

An alternative approach to the diagnostic management of suspected acute PE is to use a model which calculates an absolute PE probability for each patient, allowing the physician to make individualized management decisions, i.e. deciding whether imaging is required. Using a large individual patient dataset (IPD), we sought to derive and validate such a diagnostic model including objective clinical items and quantitative D-dimer testing.

### Excluding pulmonary embolism at the bedside without diagnostic imaging: management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism presenting to the emergency department by using a simple clinical model and D-dimer [^f9877674]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Wells' criteria for pulmonary embolism" for pulmonary embolism.

The Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism is a clinical prediction rule that stratifies patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) into different risk categories. It is used in the emergency department or outpatient setting to determine the likelihood of PE in patients presenting with symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or unexplained cough.

The Wells' Criteria includes factors such as clinical signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), an alternative diagnosis less likely than a PE, heart rate over 100 beats per minute, immobilization or surgery in the previous four weeks, previous history of DVT or PE, hemoptysis, and malignancy.

The score helps clinicians decide whether to proceed with further diagnostic testing, such as D-dimer testing or computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Patients are classified as having a low, moderate, or high probability of PE based on their total score.

The Wells' Criteria should not be used in patients with a clear alternative diagnosis, or in patients who have been on full anticoagulation for more than 48 hours. It is also not applicable in pregnant patients or in patients under the age of 18.

The Wells' criteria for pulmonary embolism calculator assesses the likelihood of a pulmonary embolism based on seven input factors, each contributing a specific score, which when summed, categorizes the risk level. These factors are: clinical signs and symptoms of deep venous thrombosis, previous history of pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis, heart rate over 100 beats per minute, immobilization for 3 or more days or recent surgery within the past 4 weeks, if pulmonary embolism is as likely as or more likely than an alternative diagnosis, hemoptysis, and cancer or recent end of cancer treatment.

The inputs are boolean (yes/no) values for each criterion which correspond to predetermined scores:

| **Factor** | **Score** |
|-|-|
| Clinical signs and symptoms of deep venous thrombosis | 3 |
| Previous, objectively diagnosed pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis | 1.5 |
| Heart rate > 100 | 1.5 |
| Immobilization ≥ 3 days or surgery in the previous 4 weeks | 1.5 |
| Pulmonary embolism as likely as or more likely than an alternative diagnosis | 3 |
| Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) | 1 |
| Cancer/palliative care/stopped treatment of cancer within 6 months | 1 | To calculate the total score, assess each input factor: if the input is true (yes), add its corresponding score to the total; if false (no), add zero. The sum of these scores determines the risk interpretation:

- A total score of 2 or less implies a low risk of pulmonary embolism with a probability of 1.3%.
- A score between 2.5 and 6 suggests a moderate risk with a probability of 16.2%.
- A score greater than 6 indicates a high risk with a probability of 40.6%.

The outputs of this calculator include both the numerical score and its interpretation, providing an analysis of the risk level for pulmonary embolism based on the users' inputs. The systematic consideration of clinically relevant symptoms and history enhances the accuracy of predicting pulmonary embolism risk.

### Emergency evaluation for pulmonary embolism, part 1: clinical factors that increase risk [^72f1fcdd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be fatal, but profligate testing for PE can harm patients.

Objectives

With consideration of potential medicolegal implications, this two-part review provides current evidence about the care of patients with suspected and diagnosed PE in the emergency department (ED) setting.

Discussion

In part 1, we review published evidence to describe the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation of PE in the ED setting. Older age, surgery requiring endotracheal intubation within the past 30 days, new use of oral contraceptives, and prior unprovoked venous thromboembolism in nonanticoagulated patients are clear risk factors for PE in ED patients. Recent history of unexplained dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis increase probability, but the effect of syncope is less clear. Treated and inactive cancer, smoking, obesity, and pregnancy have not been found to increase the probability of PE in symptomatic ED patients. Unexplained dyspnea, tachycardia, and a low pulse oximetry reading increase probability of PE. Finding of wheezing on lung auscultation reduces the probability of PE, and findings that suggest deep venous thrombosis increase the probability of PE.

Conclusions

Understanding of risk factors, historical data, and physical findings that have been found to increase or decrease the probability of PE in symptomatic ED patients can help create rational guidelines for the diagnostic approach to PE.

American Thoracic Society/Society of Thoracic Radiology guideline — suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) in pregnancy: In pregnant women with suspected PE and signs and symptoms of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), we suggest performing bilateral compression ultrasonography (CUS) of lower extremities followed by anticoagulation treatment, if positive or further testing, if negative (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence); in those with suspected PE and no DVT signs or symptoms, we suggest performing studies of the pulmonary vasculature rather than CUS of the lower extremities (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). Across suspected PE cases, we recommend a chest radiograph (CXR) as the first radiation-associated procedure in the imaging work-up (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). With a normal CXR, we recommend lung scintigraphy as the next imaging test rather than computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). After a nondiagnostic ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) scan, we suggest further diagnostic testing rather than clinical management alone (weak recommendation, low quality evidence), and if further investigation is chosen, we recommend CTPA rather than digital subtraction angiography (DSA) (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). With an abnormal CXR, we suggest CTPA as the next imaging test rather than lung scintigraphy (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).

BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic methods

ECG was performed on admission. The typical PE ECG signs were recorded (S1Q3T3 sign, right bundle branch block (RBBB), negative T-waves in the precordial leads, S-waves in the aVL and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation).

To define right ventricular dysfunction, transthoracic echocardiography was performed in most patients at admission, and the systolic pressure in the RV was measured indirectly using tricuspid regurgitation velocity. Cardiac transthoracic ultrasound was performed on admission in 1117/1242 patients (89.9%). We have no precise data on compression ultrasound (CUS) examinations during hospitalisation; however, the main approach was to perform CUS in patients with symptomatic lower limb DVT.

High-sensitivity troponin concentration was measured on admission using commercial laboratory kits.

The signs and symptoms of acute PE were assessed according to sex, age and PE risk (low, intermediate and high). The symptoms and signs of PE used in this study are as follows:

Haemoptysis was defined as the presence of bloody sputum according to the patient's anamnestic claims, or if it became obvious that the patient had haemoptysis during physical examination.

Symptomatic DVT was defined as lower limb oedema with or without pain. In patients with these symptoms, CUS venography was used to confirm the DVT diagnosis, but it was not used routinely in all patients without symptoms of DVT, although we are aware that some patients could have asymptomatic DVT.

Chest pain is defined as a symptom of pleural pain or retrosternal pain in patients. Unfortunately, from the beginning of our registry, we did not classify these two types of chest pain and could not analyse them separately.

Dyspnoea was defined as breathing effort required at rest or 'lack of air' reported by the patient or detected during physical examination.

Syncope was defined as a temporary loss of consciousness with spontaneous full recovery. Tachycardia was defined as 100 pm on ECG at admission.

Pneumonia was defined as fever with condensation of pulmonary tissue on the CT-PA.

Ethics

Patients were informed during hospitalisation that their medical data, without revealing their identity, would be recorded in the registry of acute PE patients, and their informed consent was obtained. The Ethical Committee of the Military Medical Academy Belgrade, the central institution of the registry and institutional review boards from other hospitals involved gave us permission to publish the results from the registry (code numbers for the decisions of EC are 20/2022, 3/2021 and 160/2019).

### Submassive pulmonary embolism [^0a50ba3e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) presents a spectrum of hemodynamic consequences, ranging from being asymptomatic to a life-threatening medical emergency. Management of submassive and massive PE often involves clinicians from multiple specialties, which can potentially delay the development of a unified treatment plan. In addition, patients with submassive PE can deteriorate after their presentation and require escalation of care. Underlying comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, congestive heart failure, and interstitial lung disease can impact the patient's hemodynamic ability to tolerate submassive PE. In this review, we address the definitions, risk stratification (clinical, laboratory, and imaging), management approaches, and long-term outcomes of submassive PE. We also discuss the role of the PE response team in management of patients with PE.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism [^73ddd2a6]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnostic management of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is complicated by its heterogeneous clinical presentation. Current diagnostic algorithms, combining clinical probability estimation with D-dimer testing and imaging tests, are very safe to exclude PE, although at costs of high numbers of CT-examinations. In view of cost- and time-saving as well as safety issues, several attempts have recently been undertaken to reduce the number of required imaging tests. Especially the age-adjusted D-dimer threshold has greatly improved the potential for non-invasive exclusion of PE. Once the diagnosis of PE is established, immediate initiation of anticoagulant therapy is of vital importance. A new generation of direct oral anticoagulants, which overcomes the main disadvantages of conventional vitamin-K antagonists, has recently emerged. Risk stratification of hemodynamically stable PE patients with use of clinical decision rules, cardiac biomarkers or imaging tests, aids physicians in determining the most appropriate treatment approach for the individual patient. This is essential to differentiate patients at low risk of adverse outcome, who may be safely treated at home, from intermediate-risk patients, who require closer monitoring and for whom recent studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of systemic thrombolytic therapy. This article reviews recent advances and challenges that remain in the diagnostic work-up and initial management of acute, clinically stable PE.

### Emergency department management of pulmonary embolism [^d4fef1ab]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

There are several points that bear repetition. First, consider the diagnosis of PE in all patients presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, oxygen desaturation, or unexplained hypotension. Evaluate these patients in a rational manner. At any individual hospital, develop algorithms with consultants so that when one is faced with a patient with a PE, the flow of both diagnostics and therapeutics flows smoothly and rapidly. Consider the concept of risk stratification, and remember that not all patients with PE are created equal. In particular, be on the same page with all consultants regarding the use of right heart echocardiography, both for its potential diagnostic capabilities and for its ability to identify patients who could be at greater risk for bad outcomes.

How can I differentiate between acute and chronic PE?

It is not infrequent to see patients with significant proximal chronic thromboembolic disease who have erroneously been thrombolysed. Several factors may suggest chronic rather than acute PE. Long duration of symptoms, a previous VTE, features of pulmonary hypertension on examination in the absence of systemic hypotension and or tachycardia and bilateral bruits due to stenoses (appreciated during breath hold on auscultation) favour a chronic process. Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic changes indicating longstanding increased RV afterload include a dominant R wave in V1 with absence of tachycardia and a systolic pulmonary artery pressure > 60 mm Hg on echocardiography (the RV cannot acutely generate a higher pressure). McConnell's sign (RV free wall hypokinesis with preserved RV apical contraction) and the '60/60' sign (pulmonary acceleration time below 60 ms with a tricuspid gradient of 30–60 mm Hg on echocardiography) suggest acute rather than chronic PE. An increased RV–LV ratio may be present in acute and chronic thromboembolic disease but the presence of RV hypertrophy and large bronchial arteries are suggestive of chronic disease. Within the pulmonary arteries, mural calcified thrombus forming an obtuse angle with the vessel wall, completely stenosed and narrowed segmental vessels and signs of recanalisation with contrast flowing either side of 'webs' of organised thrombi are suggestive of chronic disease. Within the parenchyma, peripheral wedge-shaped infarcts may be present in acute PE while a mosaic perfusion pattern with reduction in pulmonary arterial size in low attenuation areas of the lung suggests chronic disease.

Suggested approach: A chronic history, markedly elevated systolic pulmonary arterial pressures, RV and bronchial artery hypertrophy, thrombus calcification, webs and a mosaic perfusion pattern should raise suspicion of chronic rather than acute PE.

### Pulmonary embolism severity assessment and prognostication [^8d58e4c5]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

For patients who have acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE), risk of short-term death and adverse outcomes should drive the initial treatment decisions. Practice guidelines recommend that patients who have a high-risk of PE-related death and adverse outcomes, determined by the presence of haemodynamic instability (i.e., shock or hypotension), should receive systemically administered thrombolytic therapy. Intermediate-high risk patients might benefit from close observation, and some should undergo escalation of therapy beyond standard anticoagulation, particularly if haemodynamic deterioration occurs. Low-risk for adverse outcomes should lead to early hospital discharge or full treatment at home. Validated prognostic tools (i.e., clinical prognostic scoring systems, imaging studies, and cardiac laboratory biomarkers) assist with risk classification of patients who have acute symptomatic PE.

### Signs and symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism and their predictive value for all-cause hospital death in respect of severity of the disease, age, sex and body mass index: retrospective analysis of the regional PE registry (REPER) [^20af46ba]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Conclusion

The incidence of haemoptysis was higher in younger men with intermediate and high-risk PE, and on the contrary, haemoptysis is very rare in younger women with high-risk PE. The presence of symptomatic DVT was more often observed in all cohorts with low-risk and intermediate-risk PE than in those with high-risk PE; however, this was not statistically significant. The presence of chest pain was much more common in younger patients of both sexes, and it remained frequent in high-risk younger men, but much less frequent in younger women. The incidence of dyspnoea was higher in all cohorts with respect to PE severity, except in older men, where the incidence of dyspnoea was similar across the PE severity risk strata. The incidence of syncope was higher in both older subgroups in low-risk patients and increased in all cohorts with PE severity, reaching a maximum in older men with high-risk PE, where 42.5% of patients presented with syncope. Tachycardia was more pronounced in younger patients of both sexes with intermediate-risk PE, and its frequency significantly increased with the risk of PE in all cohorts. The presence of pneumonia at presentation was more distinct in younger men with low-risk and intermediate-risk PE than in the other cohorts. Considering BMI, haemoptysis and pneumonia were more marked in normal-weight patients with intermediate-risk PE, while dyspnoea was a prominent symptom in the low-risk obese cohort. Among all the analysed symptoms and signs, only the presence of pneumonia was associated with higher hospital death, whereas symptomatic DVT was associated with a lower mortality risk, independent of age, sex and ESC mortality risk score.

### Pulmonary embolism… [^3dd61b81]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that blocks the blood vessels supplying the lungs. The clot most often comes from the leg veins and travels through the heart to the lungs. When the blood clot lodges in the blood vessels of the lung, it may limit the heart's ability to deliver blood to the lungs, causing shortness of breath and chest pain, and, in serious cases, death. The US surgeon general estimates that 100 000 to 180 000 deaths occur from PE each year in the United States and identifies PE as the most preventable cause of death among hospitalized patients. The January 9, 2013, issue of JAMA contains an article about management of PE. Risk factors Genetic and acquired tendencies to develop blood clots.

Pregnancy; use of birth control pills or hormone therapy Obesity Smoking Cancer Medical illnesses including heart disease, lung disease, and kidney disease Older age Recent surgery, trauma, hospitalization, or prolonged bed rest Signs and symptoms Shortness of breath Chest discomfort Coughing up blood. Palpitations Dizziness and fainting Leg swelling and discomfort Treatment Anticoagulants are the main treatment for pulmonary embolism and work by preventing new blood clots from forming while the body breaks down the pulmonary embolism. Options for anticoagulation in patients with PE include intravenous heparin and injectable enoxaparin, dalteparin, and fondaparinux. Oral anticoagulants for PE include warfarin and rivaroxaban. Most patients with PE receive at least 6 months of anticoagulation treatment. Many patients are advised to continue anticoagulation treatment for longer than 6 months, sometimes lifelong, if their risk of recurrent PE is high.

For some patients with large or massive pulmonary embolism, more aggressive therapy is required. These treatments include clot-dissolving medications, invasive procedures to remove the embolus with catheters or surgery, and implantation of a filter device to catch free blood clots before they reach the heart.

### A case of panic to pulmonary embolism [^5be14349]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a rare paediatric diagnosis, but its presence is likely to be underestimated due to the subtle and non-specific nature of its symptoms. Common clinical features of PE include shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain and acute cardiovascular collapse. Less common symptoms can include persistent unexplained tachycardia, fever or deep vein thrombosis. Rarely do patients present with abdominal pain and self-resolving shortness of breath; symptoms our patient experienced. However, in contrast to popular belief, having normal vital signs does not necessarily lower the probability of PE. D-dimer, a specific fibrin degradation product, has a good negative predictive value for venous thromboembolism diagnosis but its use in children is less clear, with up to 40% of children with PE having a normal D-dimer level. CT pulmonary angiography remains the gold standard in diagnosis.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — intermediate pretest probability: For patients at intermediate risk for PE, D-dimer testing is warranted. As for patients at low pretest probability, a normal plasma D-dimer level (ideally, age-adjusted [age × 10 ng/mL] but otherwise < 500 ng/mL) provides sufficient negative predictive value for PE; no imaging studies are indicated, and an elevated plasma D-dimer level should prompt imaging studies.

Pulmonary embolism

Pulmonary embolism was previously considered to be an uncommon disease in the pediatric population. Albeit still infrequent, pulmonary embolism is now reported to be more common in autopsy series than previously thought. However, diagnosis in clinical practice is still challenging, in part because of nonspecific clinical findings and inaccurate laboratory tests. Diagnostic criteria for pulmonary embolism in adults, such as elevated heart rate, low blood oxygen saturation, or clinical signs and symptoms, are less specific in children. Diagnostic tests such as D-dimer levels and ECG findings have not been validated in children. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is required to diagnose pulmonary embolism in children.

There is a bimodal age peak in pediatric pulmonary embolism, being more common in neonates and adolescents. Central venous lines, complex medical conditions, congenital heart disease, immobilization, prothrombotic states, and oral contraceptives are known risk factors, whereas idiopathic pulmonary embolism in children is very rare. In most cases, a child with pulmonary embolism has a combination of two or more risk factors (e.g. oral contraceptives and obesity, cardiac patient with a central line, trauma patient with a prothrombotic state). There are certain clinical situations in which pulmonary embolism is highly suspected. For example, clinicians are more alert for embolism in patients with congenital heart disease with endovascular devices and hypoxemia (Fig. 6).

Pulmonary embolism in pregnancy — presenting features and prediction rules are outlined as follows: In a study of 38 pregnant women with confirmed PE, dyspnea (62%), pleuritic chest pain (55%), cough (24%), and sweating (18%) were the four most common features at presentation; there are no validated clinical prediction guidelines such as the Wells or Geneva criteria for determining pre-test probability of PE in the pregnant population, and clinicians must generally rely on their clinical judgment and employ a high index of suspicion.

### Paradoxical embolism [^b34cb465]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Paradoxical embolism is an important clinical entity among patients with venous thromboembolism in the presence of intracardiac or pulmonary shunts. The clinical presentation is diverse and potentially life-threatening. Although the serious nature and complications of paradoxical embolism are recognized, the disease entity is still rarely considered and remains under-reported. This paper provides an overview on the different clinical manifestations of paradoxical embolism, describes the diagnostic tools for the detection of intracardiac and pulmonary shunts, reviews therapeutic options, and summarizes guideline recommendations for the secondary prevention of paradoxical embolism.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism — epidemiology, symptoms, and diagnostic evaluation in acute chest pain: The incidence of PE is estimated at 65 cases per 100000, one-third of deaths are sudden, and 60% are undiagnosed before death; risk factors include inherited hypercoagulable states and acquired risk factors such as recent surgery, trauma, immobilization, malignancy, smoking, obesity, and oral contraception, and dyspnea followed by pleuritic chest pain is the most common presenting symptom with signs of deep venous thrombosis possibly present on examination. CTA using PE protocol is the diagnostic modality of choice in stable patients, ventilation-perfusion scanning is a second-line alternative in the acute setting, and use of clinical prediction rules to select patients for imaging can decrease radiation exposure and cost; troponin and brain natriuretic peptide can be elevated, echocardiography may reveal acute right ventricular strain consequent to large PEs, and troponin and brain natriuretic peptide are both markers for higher mortality rate. Recognition of PE is important because prompt anticoagulation improves outcomes, and diagnostic evaluation depends on clinical assessment of pretest probability; D-dimers are highly sensitive but not very specific for PE in emergency department patients, and measurement of D-dimers using age- and sex-specific cutoffs may be useful in patients at low to intermediate pretest probability such that those with negative D-dimers can probably be discharged without further testing whereas those with positive values should be considered for CTA.

### Epidemiology and management of massive, sub-massive, and non-massive pediatric pulmonary embolism: a systematic reviews [^3e043b22]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Symptoms and presentations

The clinical presentation of PE varied widely across studies:

Common Symptoms: Thoracalgia (42%), dyspnea (38%), hemoptysis (25%), syncope (18%), and deep vein thrombosis (15%) were frequently reported [4,8,9].

Submassive PE: Characterized by imaging findings of right ventricular dysfunction, with echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension in 85% of cases.

Massive PE: Often presented with hemodynamic instability and signs of severe cardiopulmonary compromise, including tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxia.

Quality assessment

We assessed the included cohort studies and case series using the NIH tool. The quality of the included cohorts ranged from fair to poor, whereas it ranged from fair to good in case series (Supplementary Table). This indicates the crucial need for large future studies to address PE in pediatric population.

### Prediction of pulmonary embolism in the emergency department: the revised Geneva score [^b36b4392]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism requires clinical probability assessment. Implicit assessment is accurate but is not standardized, and current prediction rules have shortcomings.

Objective

To construct a simple score based entirely on clinical variables and independent from physicians' implicit judgment.

Design

Derivation and external validation of the score in 2 independent management studies on pulmonary embolism diagnosis.

Setting

Emergency departments of 3 university hospitals in Europe.

Patients

Consecutive patients admitted for clinically suspected pulmonary embolism.

Measurements

Collected data included demographic characteristics, risk factors, and clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of venous thromboembolism. The variables statistically significantly associated with pulmonary embolism in univariate analysis were included in a multivariate logistic regression model. Points were assigned according to the regression coefficients. The score was then externally validated in an independent cohort.

Results

The score comprised 8 variables (points): age older than 65 years (1 point), previous deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (3 points), surgery or fracture within 1 month (2 points), active malignant condition (2 points), unilateral lower limb pain (3 points), hemoptysis (2 points), heart rate of 75 to 94 beats/min (3 points) or 95 beats/min or more (5 points), and pain on lower-limb deep venous palpation and unilateral edema (4 points). In the validation set, the prevalence of pulmonary embolism was 8% in the low-probability category (0 to 3 points), 28% in the intermediate-probability category (4 to 10 points), and 74% in the high-probability category (≥ 11 points).

Limitations

Interobserver agreement for the score items was not studied.

Conclusions

The proposed score is entirely standardized and is based on clinical variables. It has sustained internal and external validation and should now be tested for clinical usefulness in an outcome study.

### Simplified diagnostic management of suspected pulmonary embolism (the YEARS study): a prospective, multicentre, cohort study [^0d6a0898]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Validated diagnostic algorithms in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism are often not used correctly or only benefit subgroups of patients, leading to overuse of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). The YEARS clinical decision rule that incorporates differential D-dimer cutoff values at presentation, has been developed to be fast, to be compatible with clinical practice, and to reduce the number of CTPA investigations in all age groups. We aimed to prospectively evaluate this novel and simplified diagnostic algorithm for suspected acute pulmonary embolism.

Methods

We did a prospective, multicentre, cohort study in 12 hospitals in the Netherlands, including consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary embolism between Oct 5, 2013, to July 9, 2015. Patients were managed by simultaneous assessment of the YEARS clinical decision rule, consisting of three items (clinical signs of deep vein thrombosis, haemoptysis, and whether pulmonary embolism is the most likely diagnosis), and D-dimer concentrations. In patients without YEARS items and D-dimer less than 1000 ng/mL, or in patients with one or more YEARS items and D-dimer less than 500 ng/mL, pulmonary embolism was considered excluded. All other patients had CTPA. The primary outcome was the number of independently adjudicated events of venous thromboembolism during 3 months of follow-up after pulmonary embolism was excluded, and the secondary outcome was the number of required CTPA compared with the Wells' diagnostic algorithm. For the primary outcome regarding the safety of the diagnostic strategy, we used a per-protocol approach. For the secondary outcome regarding the efficiency of the diagnostic strategy, we used an intention-to-diagnose approach. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Registry, number NTR4193.

Findings

3616 consecutive patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism were screened, of whom 151 (4%) were excluded. The remaining 3465 patients were assessed of whom 456 (13%) were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism at baseline. Of the 2946 patients (85%) in whom pulmonary embolism was ruled out at baseline and remained untreated, 18 patients were diagnosed with symptomatic venous thromboembolism during 3-month follow-up (0.61%, 95% CI 0.36–0.96) of whom six had fatal pulmonary embolism (0.20%, 0.07–0.44). CTPA was not indicated in 1651 (48%) patients with the YEARS algorithm compared with 1174 (34%) patients, if Wells' rule and fixed D-dimer threshold of less than 500 ng/mL would have been applied, a difference of 14% (95% CI 12–16).

Interpretation

In our study pulmonary embolism was safely excluded by the YEARS diagnostic algorithm in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. The main advantage of the YEARS algorithm in our patients is the absolute 14% decrease of CTPA examinations in all ages and across several relevant subgroups.

Funding

This study was supported by unrestricted grants from the participating hospitals.
