## Question

Qué características tendría el líquido cefalorraquídeo de un paciente con meningoencefalitis bacteriana

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what characteristics the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) would have in a patient with bacterial meningoencephalitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core CSF parameters that guidelines mandate measuring. Then, I should verify the typical pattern of abnormalities in bacterial disease. Next, I will consider special contexts that can alter CSF interpretation, such as neonates, healthcare-associated infections, and ventricular versus lumbar gradients. After that, I should review adjunctive CSF markers that help when Gram stain and culture are negative. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable summary with thresholds and caveats, ensuring I anchor each point to high-quality sources.

> Let me first confirm the essential CSF tests. The WHO recommends obtaining total and differential white blood cell (WBC) count, protein concentration, glucose concentration, and the CSF-to-blood glucose ratio in all suspected cases of acute bacterial meningitis, because these parameters form the foundation of diagnosis and monitoring [^cc3eb8e9].

> Now, I will examine the expected leukocyte pattern. In bacterial meningoencephalitis, CSF typically shows a neutrophilic pleocytosis, often with WBC counts exceeding 100 cells/mm³, although the absolute count varies with age and timing. Importantly, even when the total WBC is modest, the differential should be predominantly neutrophils, which supports a bacterial process rather than viral meningitis [^2b958e4b]. Wait, let me verify the neonatal caveat: in infants, CSF pleocytosis can be subtle or even absent early in disease, so a normal WBC does not exclude bacterial meningitis in this age group, which means I should not overinterpret a normal cell count in neonates [^5e577b24].

> Next, I should review protein. CSF protein is generally elevated in bacterial meningitis, frequently above 100–150 mg/dL in adults, reflecting increased capillary permeability and inflammation. However, I need to ensure I account for age, because neonates and young infants normally have higher protein levels, so "mild" elevations may be less specific in that group [^2b958e4b]. Hold on, I should verify that in healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis, CSF protein can be unreliable for ruling in or out infection, so isolated protein elevation must be interpreted in clinical context and alongside other parameters [^43f139dc].

> I will now examine glucose. Hypoglycorrhachia is a hallmark of bacterial meningitis. A CSF glucose less than about 40 mg/dL, or a CSF-to-blood glucose ratio less than 0.4–0.6, strongly supports a bacterial process, whereas viral meningitis typically preserves normal CSF glucose. I should double-check that this ratio is calculated using simultaneous blood and CSF glucose samples to avoid misclassification [^2b958e4b]. But wait, what if the patient is hyperglycemic? In that case, the absolute CSF glucose may appear "normal" even when the ratio is low, so the ratio remains more reliable than the absolute value alone [^notfound].

> Let me consider Gram stain and culture, because they directly address the question of "characteristics". Gram stain can rapidly identify the causative organism in roughly 60–90% of untreated cases, with higher sensitivity in pneumococcal disease and lower after antibiotics. Culture remains the gold standard but is less sensitive if antibiotics were given before LP, which is why timing matters for yield [^73fc99c0] [^c5a2307a]. I should confirm that in culture-negative scenarios, molecular testing (PCR) can increase pathogen detection and shorten time to diagnosis, which is particularly useful when antibiotics have already been started [^1582ed60] [^1899ce52].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions when the initial CSF is unrevealing. CSF lactate and serum procalcitonin can help distinguish bacterial from viral meningitis when Gram stain and culture are negative. CSF lactate above about 3.5–4.0 mmol/L has high sensitivity and specificity for bacterial disease, and serum procalcitonin above roughly 0.5 ng/mL similarly supports a bacterial etiology. I should confirm that these adjuncts complement, not replace, core CSF parameters [^e22ad3e4] [^c3be6439]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a CSF lactate threshold of 2.1 mmol/L might suffice, but that is too low for reliable discrimination; the better-supported cutoff is around 3.5–4.0 mmol/L, with some studies using 3.8 mmol/L as an optimal point [^e22ad3e4].

> Next, I should review special contexts that modify interpretation. In neonates and young infants, CSF parameters are less specific, and up to a quarter of confirmed cases may have normal CSF cell count, protein, and glucose; thus, clinical suspicion and bacterial identification methods become paramount in this age group [^5e577b24]. In healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis, CSF cell count, glucose, and protein may be unreliable for ruling in or out infection, so diagnosis must integrate clinical signs, cultures, and, when needed, repeat sampling or intraventricular therapy considerations [^43f139dc] [^b69fa75d]. I should also remember that ventricular CSF can show a rostrocaudal gradient with fewer cells and higher glucose than lumbar CSF, meaning lumbar samples better reflect meningeal inflammation during acute bacterial meningitis [^6d9ca4de] [^f52e3496].

> Let me synthesize the classic CSF profile succinctly. In bacterial meningoencephalitis, the CSF typically shows: a neutrophil-predominant pleocytosis, often > 100 cells/mm³ in adults; markedly elevated protein, frequently > 100–150 mg/dL; and hypoglycorrhachia with CSF glucose < 40 mg/dL or a CSF-to-blood glucose ratio < 0.4–0.6. Gram stain may reveal organisms, and culture can identify the pathogen if obtained before antibiotics, while CSF lactate and serum procalcitonin support the diagnosis when initial studies are nondiagnostic [^2b958e4b] [^cc3eb8e9] [^e22ad3e4]. I should double-check that I emphasized the ratio over the absolute glucose, because hyperglycemia can mask hypoglycorrhachia if only the absolute value is considered [^notfound].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical caveats are explicit. Pretreatment with antibiotics reduces culture yield but does not meaningfully alter cell count or protein in the first 24–48 hours, so CSF chemistry and cytology remain informative even if cultures are negative. If the patient is not improving after 48 hours of appropriate therapy, repeating the LP to document sterilization and reassess the CSF profile is reasonable, particularly in neonatal Gram-negative meningitis or refractory cases [^afff79b5] [^f77b1563] [^7e2b079e]. Hold on, I should verify that in suspected herniation risk or with concerning neurologic features, LP should be deferred and imaging considered, but antibiotics must not be delayed while awaiting imaging, as treatment timing is critical to outcomes [^c1416242] [^76d72b19].

En la meningoencefalitis bacteriana, el LCR típicamente muestra **pleocitosis neutrofílica** con más de 100 leucocitos/mm³, **proteínas elevadas** por encima de 100–150 mg/dL y **glucosa baja** con una relación LCR/glucosa sérica menor a 0.4. El Gram y cultivo pueden identificar el patógeno, y la presión de apertura suele estar elevada. Estos hallazgos, interpretados en contexto clínico, orientan el diagnóstico y guían el tratamiento antimicrobiano oportuno [^cc3eb8e9] [^2b958e4b].

## Características generales del LCR en meningoencefalitis bacteriana

### Apariencia y presión

El LCR suele estar **turbio o opaco** debido a la elevada carga celular y proteica, y la presión de apertura suele estar **elevada** (> 180 mm H₂O) como consecuencia de la inflamación meníngea y el aumento de la presión intracraneal [^15385f55].

---

### Parámetros celulares

- **Pleocitosis**: Aumento significativo de leucocitos, típicamente > 100 células/mm³, con predominio de neutrófilos (> 80%) [^2b958e4b].
- **Rango de pleocitosis**: Puede variar desde 100 hasta varios miles de células/mm³, según la fase de la enfermedad y el patógeno involucrado.
- **Reactivo de Pandy**: Positivo, indicando aumento de proteínas.

---

### Parámetros bioquímicos

| **Parámetro** | **Característica típica** |
|-|-|
| Proteínas | Elevadas, generalmente > 100–150 mg/dL (normal: 15–45 mg/dL) [^2b958e4b] |
| Glucosa | Disminuida (< 40 mg/dL) con relación LCR/glucosa sérica < 0.4 (normal: 0.6–0.8) [^2b958e4b] |
| Lactato | Elevado (> 3.5 mmol/L), útil para diferenciar meningitis bacteriana de viral [^e22ad3e4] |

---

### Pruebas microbiológicas

- **Gram**: Positivo en aproximadamente el 60–90% de casos no tratados, permitiendo la identificación rápida del patógeno [^notfound].
- **Cultivo**: Oro diagnóstico, con sensibilidad del 70–85% en ausencia de antibióticos previos [^notfound].
- **PCR**: Útil en casos con cultivo negativo o con tratamiento antibiótico previo, aumentando la sensibilidad diagnóstica [^1582ed60] [^1899ce52].

---

## Patogenía y fisiopatología

La meningoencefalitis bacteriana se origina por la invasión de bacterias al SNC a través de la barrera hematoencefálica, desencadenando una **respuesta inflamatoria intensa** que aumenta la permeabilidad vascular, la producción de proteínas y el consumo de glucosa, y eleva la presión intracraneal [^cb409469].

---

## Factores que modifican el perfil del LCR

- **Edad**: En neonatos y lactantes, la pleocitosis puede ser menos pronunciada y la glucosa menos alterada, dificultando el diagnóstico [^5e577b24].
- **Estado inmunológico**: Pacientes inmunocomprometidos pueden presentar respuestas atípicas en el LCR.
- **Tratamiento antibiótico previo**: Puede reducir la carga bacteriana y alterar los parámetros celulares y bioquímicos, disminuyendo la sensibilidad de cultivo y Gram [^afff79b5].

---

## Implicancias clínicas y diagnósticas

El análisis del LCR es esencial para confirmar el diagnóstico de meningoencefalitis bacteriana, orientar el tratamiento antimicrobiano y pronosticar la evolución. La **pleocitosis neutrofílica**, la **hiperproteinorraquia** y la **hipoglucorraquia** constituyen el triada clásica que, junto con la identificación del patógeno, permite un manejo oportuno y adecuado [^2b958e4b].

### Should we reconsider cefazolin for treating staphylococcal meningitis? A retrospective analysis of cefazolin and cloxacillin cerebrospinal fluid levels in patients treated for staphylococcal meningitis [^64b5c48b]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the meningeal penetration of cefazolin and cloxacillin in individuals treated for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcal meningitis.

Methods

We retrospectively identified individuals treated for Staphylococcus meningitis with measurements of cefazolin or cloxacillin concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using a validated assay of liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry at the Nantes University Hospital between January 2009 and October 2019. Staphylococcus meningitis was defined by a compatible clinical presentation and a microbiological confirmation (positive CSF culture or positive specific PCR). Medical charts were retrospectively reviewed to collect microbiological and clinical data, and to assess therapeutic success.

Results

Among the 17 included individuals, eight (47%) were treated with cefazolin and nine (53%) with cloxacillin. Median daily dosages of cefazolin and cloxacillin were 8 g (range 6–12 g) and 12 g (range 10–13 g), respectively. Cefazolin and cloxacillin were mainly administered by continuous infusion. Eleven individuals (65%) were men, median (interquartile range (IQR)) age was 54 years (50; 70), 14 (82%) had postoperative meningitis and 3 (18%) had haematogenous meningitis. Median (IQR) antibiotic CSF concentrations were 2.8 mg/L (2.1; 5.2) and 0.66 mg/L (0.5; 0.9) for cefazolin and cloxacillin groups, respectively. Cloxacillin was discontinued in two individuals for therapeutic failure.

Conclusions

Patients with staphylococcal meningitis treated with high-dose continuous intravenous infusion of cefazolin achieved therapeutic concentrations in CSF. Cefazolin appears to be a therapeutic candidate that should be properly evaluated in this indication.

Key messages

- 	The paper describes a patient that developed, after surgery for a chordoma of the clivus, three episodes of recurrent meningitis due to Ps. aeruginosa O12.

- 	Episodes were monitored by biochemical and bacteriological daily analysis of CSF withdrawn in parallel from lumbar space and ventricles by external lumbar and ventricular damamge.

### Case report: greater meningeal inflammation in lumbar than in ventricular region in human bacterial meningitis [^4ce51fc0]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Differences in the composition of ventricular and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) based on single pairs of samples have previously been described. We describe a patient that developed post-surgical recurrent meningitis monitored by daily biochemical and bacteriological CSF analysis, simultaneously withdrawn from lumbar space and ventricles. A 20-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to the ICU after a resection of a chordoma that extended from the sphenoidal sinus to the anterior face of C2. CSF was continuously leaking into the pharyngeal cavity after surgery, and three episodes of recurrent meningitis, all due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa O12, occurred. Our case showed permanent ventricular-to-lumbar CSF gradients of leukocytes, protein and glucose that were increased during the acute phase of meningitis, with the greatest amplitude being observed when bacteria were present in both ventricular and lumbar CSF. This might suggest a greater extent of meningeal inflammation in the lumbar than in the ventricular region. Our case also showed that the increase in intravenous antibiotics (cefepim from 8 to 12 g/day and ciprofloxacine from 1.2 to 2.4 g/day) led to an increase in concentration in plasma but not in CSF.

### Case report: greater meningeal inflammation in lumbar than in ventricular region in human bacterial meningitis [^f52e3496]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Recurrent meningitis led us to increase the antibiotic dosage to achieve a better concentration in CSF. Surprisingly, only a transient increase in CSF cefepim concentration and no change in CSF ciprofloxacine concentration were observed despite a more than 50% increase in plasma concentrations of both antibiotics. The transient increase in cefepim in CSF paralleled that of protein in CSF and could be related to the transient alteration in meningeal permeability.

In summary, this case report shows that the maximal rostrocaudal gradient of leukocytes, protein and glucose was seen in the very acute phase of meningitis. This strongly suggests a greater alteration in the meningeal barrier and very probably a greater meningeal inflammation in the lumbar than the ventricular regions.

Introduction

Bacterial meningitis and ventriculitis remain the most frequent complication in neurosurgery. Diagnosis is based almost exclusively on biochemical and bacteriological analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) withdrawn either by puncture in the lumbar space or through an external drain located either in the lumbar or ventricular space. It is established that CSF infection is strongly suspected in the presence of a positive CSF culture and/or of a CSF: serum glucose ratio of less than 0.6 and/or of a CSF leukocyte count of more than 11/mm³ in the lumbar space.

Differences in the composition of ventricular and lumbar CSF, based on single pairs of CSF samples, were previously described. These studies showed a rostrocaudal gradient of leukocytes and protein and an inverse gradient of glucose in the first CSF withdrawn in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of meningitis. However, the time course of a ventricular-to-lumbar gradient of leukocytes, glucose and protein, during the occurrence and the relief of meningitis, remains unknown.

Here we describe a patient who developed, after surgery for a chordoma of the clivus, three episodes of recurrent meningitis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa O12. The last two episodes were monitored by daily biochemical and bacteriological analysis of CSF withdrawn in parallel from the lumbar space and ventricles by external lumbar drainage (ELD) and external ventricular drainage (EVD).

### Severe community-acquired Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterial meningitis: clinical and prognostic picture from the intensive care unit [^ebf5f4aa]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data collection and review procedure

This retrospective, observational and multicenter study was endorsed by the Infection and Sepsis Working Group of the Spanish Society of Intensive Medicine. All S. pneumoniae meningitis episodes diagnosed from January 2010 to December 2018 at 16 Spanish ICUs were included. Demographic, clinical and microbiological variables were extracted from electronic medical records systems. The Hospital Ethics Committee reviewed and approved the project at each of the participating hospitals, as well as the Spanish Medicines Agency; informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study.

Meningitis was defined by the presence of a compatible clinical picture (headache, fever, stiff neck and/or alteration of mental status) and microbiologic confirmation reached by means of S. pneumoniae isolation in CSF, or S. pneumoniae antigen or DNA detection in CSF. All S. pneumoniae isolates were identified by standard laboratory methods in each hospital's clinical microbiology laboratory. Antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates was determined by disk diffusion test, automated systems, E-tests or microdilution tests. S. pneumoniae was considered susceptible to penicillin if the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 0.06 μg/mL or less, and resistant if the MIC was more than 0.06 μg/mL. Isolates were considered susceptible to third-generation cephalosporin if the cefotaxime or ceftriaxone MIC was ≤ 0.5 μg/mL, in accordance with the criteria of European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing.

### Meningitis in adult patients with a negative direct cerebrospinal fluid examination: value of cytochemical markers for differential diagnosis [^82726b67]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The emergency therapeutic management of meningitis involves rapid identification of the bacterial or viral nature of this disease, so that antibiotic treatment can be started without delay, even though the relation between prognosis and delay in starting antibiotic therapy has not been clearly established.

The immediate identification of bacterial meningitis (BM) is based on direct examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or the detection of bacterial antigens in the CSF. These tests have a low sensitivity, and in 30% to 50% of cases, they do not contribute to differential diagnosis.

A model for predicting the bacterial origin of meningitis was proposed by Hoen et al., but the results of external validation tests were not homogeneous.

The preliminary results of our study suggested that serum procalcitonin and CSF lactate levels were better markers than were those classically used with regard to differentiating between BM and viral meningitis (VM) in patients with meningitis and a negative direct CSF examination. The objective of this new analysis was to test the validity of these preliminary results.

### Chronic meningitis [^9d1b2f15]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges with subacute onset and persisting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities lasting for at least one month. Several non-infectious and infectious etiologies are known to be causative. The wide range of different etiologies renders the approach to patients with this syndrome particularly difficult. There is no standardized diagnostic procedure, thus, taking an in depth history combined with a complete physical examination is mandatory in every patient. This review aims to present the current knowledge on etiology, neurological course of disease, diagnostic and therapeutic management steps of patients presenting with clinical signs and symptoms of chronic meningitis and meningoencephalitis. Still, the etiology of one third of patients remains unclear, reflecting the diagnostic challenge of this syndrome for each physician or neurologist, respectively. However, most patients with idiopathic chronic meningitis have a relatively good outcome.

### Signs of meningeal irritation at the emergency department: how often bacterial meningitis? [^02667b00]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Although signs of meningeal irritation are highly indicative of meningitis, they are not pathognomonic. In this study, we described the final diagnoses in children with signs of meningeal irritation, and we assessed the frequency of bacterial meningitis related to specific signs of meningeal irritation.

Methods

Information was collected from records of 326 patients (aged 1 month to 15 years) who visited the emergency department of the Sophia Children's Hospital between 1988 and 1998 with signs of meningeal irritation, assessed by either the general practitioner or the pediatrician.

Results

Bacterial meningitis was diagnosed in 99 patients (30%), viral or aseptic meningitis in 43 (13%). Other diagnoses were pneumonia (8%), other serious bacterial infections (2%), and upper respiratory tract infections or other self-limiting diseases (46%). Presence of one of the signs of meningeal irritation assessed by the pediatrician was related to bacterial meningitis in 39%. Specific tests eliciting meningeal irritation, such as Brudzinski's and Kernig's signs, were not related to a higher frequency of bacterial meningitis than neck stiffness and the tripod phenomenon. In children ≤ 1 year, bacterial meningitis is more frequently related to presence of irritability and a bulging fontanel.

Conclusion

Bacterial meningitis is present in 30% of children with signs of meningeal irritation. Presence of meningeal irritation as assessed by the pediatrician is related to bacterial meningitis in 39%. A better prediction of bacterial meningitis was not achieved by using more specific tests for signs of meningeal irritation.

### Ceftizoxime (Cefizox) [^7a85920e]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Cefizox has also been used successfully in the treatment of a limited number of pediatric and adult cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Cefizox has been effective in the treatment of seriously ill, compromised patients, including those who were debilitated, immunosuppressed, or neutropenic.

Infections caused by aerobic gram‐negative and by mixtures of organisms resistant to other cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, or penicillins have responded to treatment with Cefizox.

Because of the serious nature of some urinary tract infections due to P. aeruginosa and because many strains of Pseudomonas species are only moderately susceptible to Cefizox, higher dosage is recommended. Other therapy should be instituted if the response is not prompt.

Susceptibility studies on specimens obtained prior to therapy should be used to determine the response of causative organisms to Cefizox. Therapy with Cefizox may be initiated pending results of the studies; however, treatment should be adjusted according to study findings. In serious infections, Cefizox has been used concomitantly with aminoglycosides (see PRECAUTIONS). Before using Cefizox concomitantly with other antibiotics, the prescribing information for those agents should be reviewed for contraindications, warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions. Renal function should be carefully monitored.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefizox and other antibacterial drugs, Cefizox should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Pathogen identification by multiplex lightMix real-time PCR assay in patients with meningitis and culture-negative cerebrospinal fluid specimens [^b7bb8a95]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Bacterial meningitis is the most common and notable infection of the central nervous system, leading to sudden onset of fever, headache, nausea, and altered mental status, and it can rapidly cause death. Although the majority of patients with bacterial meningitis survive, neurological sequelae or permanent debilitation persist in as many as one-third of all survivors, especially in newborns and children. Predisposing factors like deficiencies of the immune system (e.g. immunosuppressive medication, cancer, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, human immunodeficiency virus infection) increase the risk of bacterial meningitis.

Different bacterial pathogens cause meningitis. However, andwere the most prevalent pathogens in bacterial meningitis reported over the last years. The prevalence of bacterial pathogens in patients with meningitis also depends on the age of the patient.is the main cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in Western Europe and the United States and an emerging pathogen in immunocompromised adults., andare the leading causes of bacterial meningitis worldwide with more than 1.2 million cases each year, and neurological sequelae occurring in up to 50% of survivors. All three pathogens are carried asymptomatically in the human nasopharynx, and transmission occurs through respiratory droplets or saliva. The introduction of conjugated vaccines reduced the overall incidence of bacterial meningitis. Moreover, it affected the distributions of causative pathogens of bacterial meningitis and the age groups most often affected. Another important causative microorganism of meningitis is. It is spread by contaminated food, but it is also found in soil, water, and sewage.has been reported as a common cause of meningitis in young children, elderly patients (> 60 years), and patients with acquired immunodeficiency.

The initial approach to management in a patient with suspected bacterial meningitis includes lumbar puncture (LP) and microbiological examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimen. Empirical treatment with selected third-generation cephalosporins should be initiated as quickly as possible (i.e. ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) after LP. However, rapid identification ofis crucial for optimal outcome, since it is not eradicated by empirical therapy, requiring an additional antibiotic (e.g. ampicillin, amoxicillin, or meropenem) as part of the empirical regimen.

This study was designed as a prospective method evaluation study for rapid identification of bacterial pathogens causing meningitis, namely, and, using automated DNA extraction (QIAsymphony) from CSF specimens and multiplex real-time PCR (RT-PCR) (< 4 h).

### Detection and management of elevated intracranial pressure in the treatment of acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis: a systematic review [^15385f55]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) is a life-threatening, infectious disease that affects patients of all ages. Even with the best medical treatment, it is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. The classical symptoms include fever, headache, neck stiffness, and an altered level of consciousness. More than 95% of patients with ABM will present with at least two of these symptoms. The course of ABM is accompanied by an elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in up to 93% of patients. The rise in ICP is multifactorial, with major elements being cerebral edema of vasogenic, cytotoxic, or interstitial types. Other mechanisms contributing to elevated ICP include the loss of cerebrovascular autoregulation with increased vasodilation, venous thrombophlebitis producing venous congestion, and the development of hydrocephalus due to impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation and reabsorption.

### Ceftriaxone (Easy-ceft) [^1b0a0d37]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

PEDIATRIC PATIENTS:

PEDIATRIC PATIENTS:

For the treatment of skin and skin structure infections, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg given once a day (or in

equally divided doses twice a day). The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams. For the treatment of acute bacterial otitis media, a single intramuscular dose of 50 mg/kg (not to exceed 1 gram) is recommended (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). For the treatment of serious miscellaneous infections other than meningitis, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg, given in divided doses

every 12 hours. The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams. In the treatment of meningitis, it is recommended that the initial therapeutic dose be 100 mg/kg (not to exceed 4 grams). Thereafter, a total daily dose of 100 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 4 grams daily) is recommended. The daily dose may be administered once a day (or in equally divided doses every 12 hours). The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 14 days.

ADULTS:

ADULTS:

The usual adult daily dose is 1 to 2 grams given once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day) depending on the type and severity of infection. The total daily dose should not exceed 4 grams. If Chlamydia trachomatisis a suspected pathogen, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added, because ceftriaxone sodium has no activity against this organism. For the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections, a single intramuscular dose of 250 mg is recommended. For preoperative use (surgical prophylaxis), a single dose of 1 gram administered intravenously 1/2 to 2 hours before surgery is recommended. Generally, Ceftriaxone for Injection therapy should be continued for at least 2 days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared. The usual duration of therapy is 4 to 14 days; in complicated infections, longer therapy may be required.

When treating infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, therapy should be continued for at least 10 days. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with impairment of renal or hepatic function (see PRECAUTIONS).

The dosages recommended for adults require no modification in elderly patients, up to 2g per day, provided there is no severe renal and hepatic impairment (see PRECAUTIONS).

### Case report: greater meningeal inflammation in lumbar than in ventricular region in human bacterial meningitis [^6c9347bc]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Case report

A 20-year-old Caucasian man with no medical history was admitted for elective surgery of a chordoma that extended from the sphenoidal sinus to the anterior face of C2. The first surgical step consisted of a subtotal removal of the tumour by a transfrontal approach. An EVD was inserted at day 1 (D1) because of the appearance of hydrocephalia.

At D10, the second approach consisted in a transoral resection of the tumour with a reconstruction of the pharyngeal wall with skin taken from the arm. However, the wall was not totally occlusive, with a continuous CSF leak into the pharyngeal cavity. Seven days later (D17), the patient developed meningitis with fever and a white blood cell count of 13,800/mm³. CSF withdrawn through the ventricular drain showed CSF leukocytes at 830/mm³, a CSF protein concentration of 0.99 g/l and a CSF glucose concentration of 3 mmol/l (for a glycaemia of 6 mmol/l). A Ps. aeruginosa O12 resistant to almost all antibiotics except ceftazidime and polymyxin B, similar to that repeatedly found in the oral cavity, grew in CSF culture. It was therefore decided to replace the ventricular drain with another in the controlateral hemisphere for two purposes: first, to withdraw CSF to reduce CSF leakage by the fistula, and second, to perform a biochemical and bacteriological analysis. Antibiotherapy was started with intravenous (i.v.) ceftazidime (6 g/day for 2 days, followed by 8 g/day for 25 days) combined with amikacin and polymyxin B both in the ventricles.

### Primary (isolated) meningococcal pericarditis [^c3f393c1]. Clinical Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

A 19-year-old man was admitted with a history and examination findings of probable bacterial pericarditis. Blood cultures produced Neisseria meningitidis Group C, sensitive to penicillin. The patient was initially treated with intravenous benzylpenicillin. Echocardiogram demonstrated the development of a pericardial effusion which was tapped, and benzylpenicillin was instilled into the pericardial space. Because of failure of clinical resolution, cefotaxime was substituted for benzylpenicillin. Rapid clinical improvement then ensued. Repeat echocardiogram showed evidence of neither reaccumulation nor constrictive pericarditis. Primary (isolated) meningococcal pericarditis is a recognized though rare manifestation of meningococcal disease. It is most common in young adults and is associated with a good prognosis.

### The changing pattern of bacterial meningitis in adult patients at a large tertiary university hospital in barcelona, Spain (1982–2010) [^2cee3ffc]. The Journal of Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Background

We conducted a prospective, observational study in Barcelona (Spain) to determine changes in the spectrum of adult patients with bacterial meningitis (BM) over a 29-year period.

Methods

The observation was divided into two periods: 1982–1995 (I) and 1996–2010 (II). All patients underwent clinical examination on admission and at discharge following a predefined protocol.

Results

We evaluated 635 episodes of BM. The most frequent etiologic agents were Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae in periods I and II, respectively. Patients in period II were older (Median: 47.5 [95%CI: 23.0–64.5] vs. 58.0 [39.0–73.0] years, P < 0.0001), had a longer interval from admission to therapy (Median: 2.3 [95%CI: 1.0–5.0] vs. 4.0 [2.0–12.0] hours, P < 0.0001), and more frequently had co-morbid conditions (39.1% vs. 62%, P < 0.0001). Meningococcal meningitis decreased by 66% (P < 0.0001), whereas meningitis by Listeria monocytogenes increased by 110% (P = 0.0007) in period II. There were no differences in the overall case-fatality and post-meningitic sequelae rates between both periods.

Conclusions

BM in adult patients has substantially changed over 29 years in terms of population affected, aetiology, and management, but not in terms of its overall mortality rate and appearance of post-meningitic sequelae.

### Cefuroxime sodium [^cbab6c8e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Impaired Renal Function

A reduced dosage must be employed when renal function is impaired. Dosage should be determined by the degree of renal impairment and the susceptibility of the causative organism (see Table 2).

When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula1(based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to convert this value into creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.

NOTE: As with antibiotic therapy in general, administration of Cefuroxime for Injection should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours after the patient becomes asymptomatic or after evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained; a minimum of 10 days of treatment is recommended in infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes in order to guard against the risk of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis; frequent bacteriologic and clinical appraisal is necessary during therapy of chronic urinary tract infection and may be required for several months after therapy has been completed; persistent infections may require treatment for several weeks; and doses smaller than those indicated above should not be used. In staphylococcal and other infections involving a collection of pus, surgical drainage should be carried out where indicated.

Pediatric Patients Above 3 Months of Age

Administration of 50 to 100 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 6 to 8 hours has been successful for most infections susceptible to cefuroxime. The higher dosage of 100 mg/kg/day (not to exceed the maximum adult dosage) should be used for the more severe or serious infections.

In bone and joint infections, 150 mg/kg/day (not to exceed the maximum adult dosage) is recommended in equally divided doses every 8 hours. In clinical trials, a course of oral antibiotics was administered to pediatric patients following the completion of parenteral administration of Cefuroxime for Injection.

In cases of bacterial meningitis, a larger dosage of Cefuroxime for Injection is recommended, 200 to 240 mg/kg/day intravenously in divided doses every 6 to 8 hours.

In pediatric patients with renal insufficiency, the frequency of dosing should be modified consistent with the recommendations for adults.

### Targeting the complement system in bacterial meningitis [^cb409469]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening infection of the CNS. Bacteria enter the CSF in the subarachnoid space either by crossing the blood–CNS barrier (either the blood–brain barrier through the brain parenchymal microvasculature or the blood–CSF barrier through the choroid plexus or the pial or arachnoidal microvasculature) or from a contiguous site of infection. Bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns and the resulting damage-associated molecular patterns in the CSF provoke a massive and often uncontrolled inflammatory response leading to high rates of complications, morbidity, and mortality in patients.

Most common pathogens causing community-acquired bacterial meningitis are currently Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Listeria monocytogenes, accounting for 70%, 10%, and 5% of cases, respectively. Pneumococcal meningitis is also one of the most common forms, after listerial meningitis, the form with the highest mortality rate (12–18%). The introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination has resulted in a decline in incidence as reported by cohorts from several geographical areas. Nevertheless, reported effectiveness of the 7- and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines differed per region, and subsequent increase of invasive pneumococcal disease due to non-vaccine pneumococcal serotypes has been reported. It is therefore likely that pneumococcal meningitis will remain a major health challenge.

### Meningitis in adult patients with a negative direct cerebrospinal fluid examination: value of cytochemical markers for differential diagnosis [^e22ad3e4]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The objective of this study was to determine the ability of various parameters commonly used for the diagnosis of acute meningitis to differentiate between bacterial and viral meningitis, in adult patients with a negative direct cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination.

Methods

This was a prospective study, started in 1997, including all patients admitted to the emergency unit with acute meningitis and a negative direct CSF examination. Serum and CSF samples were taken immediately on admission. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of meningitis: bacterial (BM; group I) or viral (VM; group II). The CSF parameters investigated were cytology, protein, glucose, and lactate; the serum parameters evaluated were C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. CSF/serum glucose and lactate ratios were also assessed.

Results

Of the 254 patients with meningitis with a negative direct CSF examination, 35 had BM and 181, VM. The most highly discriminative parameters for the differential diagnosis of BM proved to be CSF lactate, with a sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of 92%, a negative predictive value of 99%, a positive predictive value of 82% at a diagnostic cut-off level of 3.8 mmol/L (area under the curve (AUC), 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.95 to 1), and serum procalcitonin, with a sensitivity of 95%, a specificity of 100%, a negative predictive value of 100%, and a positive predictive value of 97% at a diagnostic cut-off level of 0.28 ng/ml (AUC, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1).

Conclusions

Serum procalcitonin and CSF lactate concentrations appear to be the most highly discriminative parameters for the differential diagnosis of BM and VM.

### Severe community-acquired Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterial meningitis: clinical and prognostic picture from the intensive care unit [^f9568b48]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe community-acquired pneumococcal meningitis is a medical emergency. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the epidemiology, management and outcomes of this condition.

Methods

This was a retrospective, observational and multicenter cohort study. Sixteen Spanish intensive care units (ICUs) were included. Demographic, clinical and microbiological variables from patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis admitted to ICU were evaluated. Clinical response was evaluated at 72 h after antibiotic treatment initiation, and meningitis complications, length of stay and 30-day mortality were also recorded.

Results

In total, 255 patients were included. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture was positive in 89.7%; 25.7% were non-susceptible to penicillin, and 5.2% were non-susceptible to ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. The most frequent empiric antibiotic regimen was third-generation cephalosporin (47.5%) plus vancomycin (27.8%) or linezolid (12.9%). A steroid treatment regimen was administered to 88.6% of the patients. Clinical response was achieved in 65.8% of patients after 72 h of antibiotic treatment. Multivariate analysis identified two factors associated with early treatment failure: invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 10.74; 95% CI 3.04–37.95, p < 0.001) and septic shock (OR 1.18; 95% CI 1.03–1.36, p = 0.017). The 30-day mortality rate was 13.7%. Only three factors were independently associated with 30-day mortality: delay in start of antibiotic treatment (OR 18.69; 95% CI 2.13–163.97, p = 0.008), Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.12–1.66, p = 0.002) and early treatment failure (OR 21.75 (3.40–139.18), p = 0.001). Neurological complications appeared in 124 patients (48.63%).

Conclusions

Mortality rate in critically ill patients with pneumococcal meningitis is lower than previously reported. Delay in antibiotic treatment following admission is the only amendable factor associated with mortality.

### Predicting outcome of childhood bacterial meningitis with a single measurement of C-reactive protein [^47332d15]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Predictive Value of Initial CRP Measurement

The performance of CRP versus the presenting status, and the etiology of BM are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. During the first or second day of treatment CRP was determined from 285 patients in LatAm and 384 patients in Luanda, the median values being 159 (IQR, 107) mg/L and 161 (IQR, 62) mg/L, respectively. The level of CRP was not related to the child's age or gender but was influenced by etiology: in LatAm and Luanda, meningococcal meningitis produced the highest and lowest values (P = 0.03 vs. P = 0.004, respectively). In both places, higher CRP correlated with a lower cerebrospinal fluid glucose concentration (ρ, −0.13; P = 0.04 and ρ, −0.19; P = 0.0003 in LatAm and Luanda, respectively). In Angola, increased CRP also associated with the Glasgow Outcome Score (ρ, −0.11; P = 0.04), initial cerebrospinal fluid matrix metalloproteinase-9 concentration, (ρ, 0.15; P = 0.03), and recovery with neurological sequelae (P = 0.03).

### Accuracy of clinical and cerebrospinal fluid indicators in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in infants [^5e577b24]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of bacterial meningitis (BM) is problematic in young infants, as clinical features may be nonspecific or even absent. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis usually confirms the diagnosis, but the CSF parameters can be normal also in culture-proven BM. Our objective was to identify the clinical and CSF indices, that quickly and without laboratory likely lead to the diagnosis of confirmed of probable BM in young infants in Angola.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, observational, single-site study from February 2016 to October 2017 in the Pediatric Hospital of Luanda. All assessed infants showed symptoms and signs compatible of BM or neonatal sepsis and were < 90 days of age.

Results

Of the 1088 infants, 212 (19%) showed bacteria in CSF, while 88 (8%) had probable BM. Independent clinical indicators of BM were not-clear CSF, seizures, weight < 2500g and illness > 7 days. In infants with BM, CSF leukocytes were > 10 × 10⁶/L in 46%, CSF glucose < 25mg/dL in 43% and CSF protein > 120mg/dL in 58%. All measured parameters were in normal range in 25% of patients. In 515 infants with normal CSF parameters, bacteria were found in 74 (14%). In these infants, illness > 7 days, weight < 2500g and malnutrition increased the probability of BM.

Conclusions

Our study confirms and underlines the problems in diagnosing BM in young infants. While the CSF parameters were normal in 25% of infants, the easily recognizable unclear appearance of CSF was the single strongest predictor of BM.

### Meningitis bacteriana… [^ca4e1cde]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Las causas comunes de la meningitis bacteriana varían por grupo de edad: Recién nacidos: Streptococcusdel grupo B, S. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes, E. coli Bebés y niños: S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, H. influenzaetipo b. S. pneumoniae: N. meningitidis: Las personas transmiten estas bacterias a través de las secreciones respiratorias o de la garganta. Generalmente, esto ocurre al tener contacto cercano o de larga duración. E. coli: Las personas pueden contraer estas bacterias al comer alimentos preparados por alguien que no se lavó bien las manos después de ir al baño. Por lo general, las personas se enferman a causa de la E. coli y la L. monocytogenes al comer alimentos contaminados.

Los síntomas de la meningitis incluyen la aparición repentina de lo siguiente:

- Fiebre
- Dolor de cabeza
- **Rigidez de cuello A menudo hay otros síntomas, como los siguientes**:
- Náuseas
- Vómitos
- Fotofobia
- Estado mental alterado. Si piensa que su bebé o su niño tiene cualquiera de estos síntomas, llame al médico inmediatamente. Por lo general, los síntomas de la meningitis bacteriana se presentan de 3 a 7 días después de la exposición; tenga en cuenta que esto no es así para la meningitis tuberculosa, que puede presentarse mucho después de la exposición a la bacteria. Las personas con meningitis bacteriana pueden tener convulsiones, entrar en coma y hasta morir. Por esta razón, todas las personas que crean que pueden tener meningitis deben ver al médico lo antes posible.

Diagnóstico Si el médico sospecha que se trata de meningitis, tomará muestras de sangre o de líquido cefalorraquídeo. Se harán pruebas con las muestras en un laboratorio para ver qué está causando la infección. Es importante saber la causa específica de la meningitis para que los médicos sepan cómo tratarla.

### To LP or not to LP? Identifying the etiology of pediatric meningitis [^b9fb551f]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction of conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis has led to a substantial reduction in cases of acute bacterial meningitis in countries with high routine childhood immunization coverage. The majority of children hospitalized with meningitis in high-income countries have viral or aseptic meningitis and do not require antibiotic treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis is irreplaceable in appropriately diagnosing and treating bacterial meningitis and avoiding unnecessary antibiotics and prolonged hospitalizations in children with viral meningitis. New diagnostic tests have improved detection of bacterial and viral pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid, underscoring the importance of promptly performing lumbar puncture when meningitis is suspected. This article provides an overview of acute bacterial and viral meningitis in children, focusing on the changing epidemiology, the advantages and limitations of conventional and newer diagnostic methods, and considerations for clinical practice.

From 1994 through 2006, 434 N. meningitidis isolates were received by the Microbiology Group, from 22 of 35 departments (political divisions) and the Capital District: 119 (27.4%) from Antioquia, 117 (27.0%) from Bogotá, DC, 72 (16.6%) from Valle, 25 (5.8%) from Risaralda, 21 (4.8%) from Caldas, and 80 (18.4%) from 18 other departments. Distribution by department is published at the Institute's website. According to public health reports, the reference laboratory is receiving ≈27% of the clinical case isolates. A slight majority (53.8%) were cultured from male patients. The age of patients was available for 396 isolates: 254 (64.1%) were < 1–9 years of age, 71 (17.9%) 10–19 years, 41 (10.4%) 20–39 years, 21 (5.3%) 40–59 years, and 9 (2.3%) > 59 years. Three hundred ninety-two isolates (90.3%) were recovered from cerebrospinal fluid and 42 (9.7%) from blood cultures. The diagnosis for 420 (96.8%) patients was meningitis; 11 (2.5%) patients had sepsis or bacteremia, and 3 (0.7%) had other invasive diseases (pneumonia, encephalopathy, or cellulitis).

### Ceftobiprole medocaril sodium (Zevtera) [^e896b3ed]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Trial Design

The efficacy of ZEVTERA in the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multinational, multicenter study (Trial 3) (NCT00326287). 638 adults hospitalized with CABP and requiring IV antibacterial treatment for at least 3 days were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, comparing ZEVTERA 667 mg (equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole) IV every 8 hours to ceftriaxone (2 grams IV every 24 hours) with optional linezolid (600 mg IV every 12 hours) for the coverage of resistant gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Randomization was stratified by Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) classification I to III versus IV to V, and by the need for adjunctive treatment with linezolid or matching placebo. The treatment duration was 5–14 days. No adjunctive macrolide therapy was allowed. A switch to oral cefuroxime (500 mg every 12 hours) was allowed after at least 72 hours of IV study treatment for patients who met stringent protocol-specified criteria for improvement and were candidates for hospital discharge.

The study enrolled adult patients hospitalized with CABP based on clinical signs and symptoms, fever and/or leukocytosis/leukopenia, and new radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates. Patients with known bronchial obstruction, pulmonary malignancies, cystic fibrosis, lung abscess, pleural effusion as the primary source of infection, active tuberculosis, or pneumonia known or suspected to be caused by atypical bacteria, were excluded from study participation, as were patients with known or suspected extrapulmonary complications such as concomitant meningitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis, or osteomyelitis.

The ITT primary analysis population comprised all patients randomized. The clinically evaluable (CE) population comprised patients in the ITT population who received at least 48 hours of study medication and met protocol-defined criteria regarding clinical evaluability.

The protocol-specified primary efficacy analyses included clinical cure rates at TOC visit, 7 to 14 days after the end-of-treatment (EOT) in the co-primary ITT and CE populations. The ITT population comprised 638 patients (314 ZEVTERA, 324 ceftriaxone ± linezolid), in 103 centers in the USA, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The CE population comprised 469 patients, and the microbiological ITT (mITT) population comprised 184 patients with at least one valid baseline pathogen.

### Investigating chronic meningitis [^b5cfb5f3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic meningitis is a syndrome characterised by persistent and progressive signs and symptoms of meningitis along with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis and elevated protein that fail to improve over 4 weeks. A detailed and careful history and examination is required along with CSF parameters to guide a clinician towards the aetiology of the problem. Neuroimaging modalities have become a useful tool in the quest for a diagnosis in such cases. An interesting case is described in real time illustrating the process of making a diagnosis in chronic meningitis with an insight into investigations and subsequent management.

### Meningitis [^afff79b5]. Pediatrics in Review (2015). Low credibility.

Based on strong evidence, blood cultures usually recover the causative organism of bacterial meningitis in children not pretreated with antibiotics. Based on moderate evidence, pretreatment does not adversely affect the cerebrospinal fluid cell count, but it decreases the positive test result for cerebrospinal fluid culture, especially for meningococcal meningitis. Based on some research evidence as well as consensus, children with suspected bacterial meningitis and no clinical signs of brain herniation do not need neuroimaging as part of their initial clinical evaluation. Dexamethasone adjunctive therapy in children with pneumococcal meningitis is controversial. Some experts recommend neuroimaging toward the end of therapy for all neonates with bacterial meningitis. Based on some research evidence as well as consensus, home intravenous antimicrobial therapy may be an option in selected cases of pediatric bacterial meningitis.

Pathogen-directed therapy — gram-negative bacilli — For infection caused by gram-negative bacilli, therapy should be based on in vitro susceptibility testing with agents that achieve good CNS penetration (strong, moderate). For infection caused by gram-negative bacilli susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime is recommended (strong, moderate). For infection caused by Pseudomonas species, the recommended therapy is cefepime, ceftazidime, or meropenem (strong, moderate); recommended alternative regimens are aztreonam or a fluoroquinolone with in vitro activity (strong, moderate). For infection caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase–producing gram-negative bacilli, meropenem should be used if this isolate demonstrates in vitro susceptibility (strong, moderate). For infection caused by Acinetobacter species, meropenem is recommended (strong, moderate); for strains that demonstrate carbapenem resistance, colistin or polymyxin B (either agent administered by the intravenous and intraventricular routes) is recommended (strong, moderate). Prolonged infusion of meropenem (each dose administered over 3 hours) may be successful in treating resistant gram-negative organisms (weak, low).

Viral meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges associated with acute onset of meningeal symptoms and fever, pleocytosis of the cerebrospinal fluid, and no growth on routine bacterial culture. It is sometimes associated with viral encephalitis and meningoencephalitis. Viruses reach the central nervous system (CNS) hematogenously or in a retrograde manner from nerve endings. The viral etiology varies according to age and country. Molecular diagnostics technology has helped improve the rate of pathogen detection reducing unnecessary antibiotic use and length of hospitalization. Most of the viral infections detailed in this article have no specific treatment other than supportive care. Many of the viruses discussed are preventable by vaccination and proper skin protection against transmitting vectors.
