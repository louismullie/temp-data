## Question

Is daptomycin active against fusibacterium nucleatum?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether daptomycin is effective against Fusobacterium nucleatum and what the evidence shows. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about daptomycin's intrinsic spectrum and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify the microbiology and clinical relevance of Fusobacterium nucleatum. Next, I will check whether any authoritative sources list daptomycin as active against F. nucleatum. After that, I should review which agents are actually recommended for F. nucleatum infections. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and clinical recommendation, making sure I double-check for any exceptions or conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacology. Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide with rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against aerobic Gram-positive bacteria; it binds to the cell membrane and causes depolarization, which inhibits macromolecular synthesis and leads to cell death, and its labeled spectrum is essentially Gram-positive aerobes rather than anaerobes or Gram-negative organisms [^111Shm8m] [^112PuFM5].

> Now, I need to check the organism in question. Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobe commonly found in the oral cavity and implicated in polymicrobial infections; wait, let me verify the Gram stain characterization — yes, it is indeed Gram-negative and anaerobic, which already raises a mechanistic concern for daptomycin activity since daptomycin's membrane-targeting mechanism is optimized for Gram-positive cell envelopes and requires calcium-dependent membrane binding that is less compatible with typical Gram-negative outer membrane architecture [^117Sw54u] [^113JYkmW] [^111Shm8m].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should confirm whether any authoritative labeling or guidelines list daptomycin as active against F. nucleatum. I will now examine FDA daptomycin labels and major guidelines; I see no mention of F. nucleatum in daptomycin's spectrum, and instead the labels consistently emphasize activity against Gram-positive aerobes, with no anaerobic Gram-negative coverage claimed, which aligns with the expected mechanism mismatch for F. nucleatum [^111Shm8m] [^113LbZ7V].

> Next, I should review which agents are actually recommended for F. nucleatum infections to ensure I'm not missing a niche role for daptomycin. Multiple FDA labels and clinical guidance list clindamycin, beta-lactams such as cefotaxime or piperacillin, and carbapenems like imipenem/relebactam as active against F. nucleatum; notably, daptomycin is absent from these organism-specific listings, reinforcing that it is not a standard option for this pathogen [^113Eq5FZ] [^112gbK9Z] [^111Shm8m] [^117Sw54u] [^116cKWtB].

> But wait, what if there are case reports or in vitro data suggesting activity? I should double-check the provided documents for any such signals. I find no case reports, no in vitro susceptibility studies, and no guideline endorsements supporting daptomycin against F. nucleatum in this corpus; conversely, the consistent theme is daptomycin for Gram-positive infections and alternative agents for F. nucleatum, which supports the conclusion that daptomycin lacks reliable activity here.

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overlooking a niche scenario. Given daptomycin's Gram-positive–specific mechanism and the absence of supportive clinical or regulatory evidence for activity against F. nucleatum, daptomycin should not be considered active or appropriate therapy for F. nucleatum infections. Appropriate choices include clindamycin, beta-lactams with anaerobic coverage, or carbapenems depending on site and severity, guided by culture and susceptibility testing when available [^113DVnNY] [^113Eq5FZ] [^116cKWtB].

> Final answer: No, daptomycin is not active against Fusobacterium nucleatum. It lacks reliable in vitro or clinical activity against this Gram-negative anaerobe, and recommended therapy should employ agents with proven anaerobic Gram-negative coverage rather than daptomycin [^113DVnNY] [^113Eq5FZ] [^116cKWtB].

Daptomycin is **not active against Fusobacterium nucleatum** because it is a Gram-negative anaerobe and daptomycin requires a Gram-positive cell envelope for its membrane-disrupting mechanism [^111Shm8m]. There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** for daptomycin use against F. nucleatum; instead, use beta-lactams (e.g. penicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefotaxime, piperacillin/tazobactam) [^113Eq5FZ] [^117Sw54u], metronidazole, or clindamycin [^113DVnNY] based on susceptibility and clinical context.

---

## Microbiological rationale for inactivity

- **Cell envelope differences**: Daptomycin binds to Gram-positive membranes via calcium-dependent insertion, disrupting membrane potential and causing rapid bactericidal activity [^115UzWSX]; Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane that blocks this interaction, rendering daptomycin inactive [^notfound].

- **Fusobacterium nucleatum characteristics**: F. nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobe with a typical Gram-negative outer membrane, explaining intrinsic daptomycin resistance [^117Sw54u].

- **Lack of evidence**: There is no published in vitro or in vivo evidence of daptomycin activity against F. nucleatum, and no clinical trials or case series support its use for this organism.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend daptomycin** for F. nucleatum infections; instead, they endorse agents with proven anaerobic Gram-negative activity:

| **Antibiotic class** | **Recommended agents** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Beta-lactams | - Penicillin G <br/> - Amoxicillin/clavulanate <br/> - Cefotaxime <br/> - Piperacillin/tazobactam | First-line for many anaerobic infections; adjust based on susceptibility and site of infection [^113Eq5FZ] [^113vS5vE] |
| Nitroimidazoles | Metronidazole | Highly active against anaerobes; often used for intra-abdominal and deep-seated infections |
| Lincosamides | Clindamycin | Active against F. nucleatum; consider local resistance patterns and inducible resistance [^113DVnNY] [^112gbK9Z] |

---

## Clinical scenarios involving Fusobacterium nucleatum

F. nucleatum is implicated in **various infections**, including:

- **Lemierre's syndrome**: Jugular vein thrombophlebitis with metastatic infection [^114jCdTX].

- **Dental and periodontal infections**: Chronic periodontitis and endodontic infections [^1112Sxjf].

- **Intra-abdominal infections**: Appendicitis, diverticulitis, and abscesses.

- **Bone and joint infections**: Vertebral osteomyelitis and septic arthritis [^1177pJX4] [^1113GJcn].

- **Neurological infections**: Meningitis and brain abscesses [^11142DJR].

In these settings, **empiric therapy should include anaerobic coverage** — particularly for F. nucleatum — using agents such as beta-lactams, metronidazole, or clindamycin, guided by culture and susceptibility results [^113vS5vE].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Daptomycin is **inactive against Fusobacterium nucleatum** due to its Gram-negative outer membrane, and there is no supporting clinical evidence or guideline endorsement for its use. Clinicians should select agents with proven anaerobic Gram-negative activity — such as beta-lactams, metronidazole, or clindamycin — tailored to susceptibility and infection site [^111uLr8V].

### Inhibition of daptomycin by pulmonary surfactant: in vitro modeling and clinical impact [^114tYxDz]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The lipopeptide daptomycin has been approved for use in skin and skin-structure infections but has failed to meet statistical noninferiority criteria in a clinical trial for severe community-acquired pneumonia. Daptomycin exhibited an unusual pattern of activity in pulmonary animal models: efficacy in Staphylococcus aureus hematogenous pneumonia and inhalation anthrax but no activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae in simple bronchial-alveolar pneumonia. Daptomycin was shown to interact in vitro with pulmonary surfactant, resulting in inhibition of antibacterial activity. This effect was specific to daptomycin and consistent with its known mechanism of action. This represents the first example of organ-specific inhibition of an antibiotic.

### Treatment of staphylococcal infections with cyclic lipopeptides [^111cdFYN]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Daptomycin is the first of a new class of antibiotics, the cyclic lipopeptides, for which a novel mechanism of action is hypothesised. Owing to its mode of action, daptomycin is rapidly bactericidal without being bacteriolytic, is active against static- and growing-phase bacteria, and has a low resistance rate in vitro. Phase III clinical trials have demonstrated that daptomycin is as effective as standard therapy for the treatment of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections associated with Gram-positive infections, and daptomycin-treated patients benefited from a reduced time to clinical resolution. Daptomycin has also been shown to be as effective as standard therapy in the treatment of bacteraemia associated with Staphylococcus aureus, with or without endocarditis. These results indicate that daptomycin is a useful therapeutic option for treating Gram-positive infections, particularly those caused by S. aureus.

Staphylococcal shunt infections (including MRSA) — agent selection, alternatives by MIC, and penetration data are as follows: Vancomycin should be used if infection is caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). If MRSA strains have a vancomycin MIC of ≥ 1 μg/mL, linezolid, daptomycin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should be considered; if the organism is methicillin susceptible, therapy should be changed to either nafcillin or oxacillin, and addition of rifampin to an antistaphylococcal agent may augment treatment. Daptomycin has been used with rifampin, and in one study a single dose of daptomycin (10 mg/kg) led to an overall CSF penetration of 0.8%, which when corrected for protein binding was 11.5%; linezolid has been successfully used but is not considered first-line therapy for this infection.

### The efficacy and safety of daptomycin: first in a new class of antibiotics for Gram-positive bacteria [^115rikpt]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

In the face of increasing resistance to currently available antibiotics, there is a continued interest in the development of new drugs to treat Gram-positive infections. One such agent is the cyclic lipopeptide daptomycin-licensed in the USA for treatment of Gram-positive complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) in 2003 and currently awaiting European approval for a similar indication (complicated skin and soft tissue infections). Daptomycin exerts its rapid bactericidal effect through insertion into and subsequent depolarisation of the bacterial cell membrane, a mode of action unlike that of any other available antibiotic. This novel mechanism of action makes the development of cross-resistance between daptomycin and other antibiotic classes unlikely. Daptomycin is highly active in vitro against a range of Gram-positive pathogens, including both susceptible and multidrug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. Bactericidal activity has also been demonstrated against both growing and stationary-phase organisms, suggesting potential utility in the treatment of deep-seated infections. Two pivotal clinical studies comparing daptomycin 4 mg/kg per day intravenously with vancomycin or oxacillin-class antibiotics demonstrated the efficacy of daptomycin for treatment of cSSSIs. Daptomycin was well tolerated, with most adverse events considered to be unrelated to study medication, of mild-to-moderate intensity, and with a frequency and distribution similar to those associated with comparator antibiotics. The favourable clinical profile and low potential for development of resistance combine to make daptomycin a promising alternative to current agents for treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections.

1.5 Usage

Appropriate specimens for microbiological examination should be obtained in order to isolate and identify the causative pathogens and to determine their susceptibility to daptomycin.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of DAPZURA RT and other antibacterial drugs, DAPZURA RT should be used only to prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

When culture and susceptibility information is available, it should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Empiric therapy may be initiated while awaiting test results.

Treatment of Nonfermenters

For nonfermenters such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fluoroquinolones are not recommended as initial treatment after debridement because of the high rate of resistance that can develop. Although the bactericidal action of beta-lactams appears inferior to fluoroquinolones, beta-lactam antibiotics such as piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, or a carbapenem (except ertapenem) should be used as the initial therapy. There is some in vitro evidence of a decrease in the rate of bacterial killing with a high inoculum, and so, the addition of an aminoglycoside for 2–5 days can be considered.

If P. aeruginosa is resistant to fluoroquinolones, there are no other suitable oral agents and beta-lactams need to be continued intravenously according to susceptibility testing.

Pseudomonas spp. and other nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter spp. may be multiresistant but sensitive to colistin. Colistin should be used in combination therapy with careful monitoring of renal function and trough serum dosages, as it is associated with a high risk of nephrotoxicity. Tigecycline may be an alternative for some organisms, but not for P. aeruginosa because of intrinsic resistance to the agent. Expert microbiology advice should be sought for any of these infections.

Treatment of Anaerobes

In the group of Gram-positive anaerobes, Cutibacterium (previously Propionibacterium) acnes is most frequently isolated). Cutibacterium acnes is highly susceptible to a wide range of antibiotics except metronidazole; however, resistance is emerging against macrolides, clindamycin, doxycycline, or minocycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. – In biofilm-related infections, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and clindamycin are less effective, while rifampicin, daptomycin, and ceftriaxone have demonstrated biofilm activity in animal models. In combination, rifampicin and levofloxacin show good efficacy. We recommend starting with benzylpenicillin or ceftriaxone, followed by oral treatment of rifampicin in combination with amoxicillin, doxycycline, or quinolones. For other Gram-positive anaerobes (eg, Finegoldia magna, Peptostreptococcus species, and Clostridium species), there are no studies to guide treatment. Penicillin (or ceftriaxone) would be a good initial therapy, and treatment should be guided by speciation, susceptibilities, and microbiological advice.

Gram-negative anaerobes should be treated with IV ampicillin/sulbactam or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid based on availability, followed by oral metronidazole.

### Daptomycin plus fosfomycin versus daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis: a randomized clinical trial [^1136LXBB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Our randomized trial has several limitations. The study was not blinded for the investigators, and this might have impact decisions to discontinue the therapy due to clinical worsening or suspected AE. The effect of this potential bias was minimized by including microbiological analyses in the treatment success definition. Furthermore, the study was performed in a single country and this might have limited the generalizability of our results.

In conclusion, daptomycin plus fosfomycin provided a 12% higher rate of treatment success than daptomycin alone, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Our results suggest that this antibiotic combination could be more effective in younger patients and those with more severe disease. Daptomycin plus fosfomycin precluded microbiological failure and complicated bacteremia but was more often associated with AEs leading to treatment discontinuation.

Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection (cSSSI) Trials in Adults

The emergence of daptomycin non-susceptible isolates occurred in 2 infected patients across the set of Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of cSSSI in adult patients. In one case, a non-susceptible S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a Phase 2 trial who received daptomycin for injection at less than the protocol-specified dose for the initial 5 days of therapy. In the second case, a non-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from a patient with an infected chronic decubitus ulcer who was enrolled in a salvage trial.

S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis and Other Post-Approval Trials in Adults

In subsequent clinical trials in adult patients, non-susceptible isolates were recovered. S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a compassionate-use trial and from 7 patients in the S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. An E. faecium was isolated from a patient in a vancomycin-resistant enterococci trial.

Antimicrobial Activity

Daptomycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Gram-Positive Bacteria
Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only)
Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant isolates)

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for daptomycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of daptomycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

### Daptomycin in the treatment of enterococcal bloodstream infections and endocarditis: a EUCAST position paper [^115M47hV]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Scope

This position paper describes the view adopted by EUCAST on the role of daptomycin in the treatment of serious infections caused by Enterococcus species.

Background

High-dose daptomycin is considered effective in the treatment of enterococcal bloodstream infection (BSI) and endocarditis, although published clinical experience with the latter condition is limited.

Methods

EUCAST reviewed the available published data on pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD), resistance selection, clinical efficacy and safety for the use of 10–12 mg/kg/day of daptomycin for these conditions, noting that the doses licensed by the European Medicines Agency are only 4–6 mg/kg/day, and only for infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.

Findings and Recommendations

The PK-PD evidence shows that, even with doses of 10–12 mg/kg/day, it is not possible to treat infections caused by isolates at the upper end of the wild-type distributions of Enterococcus faecalis (with MICs of 4 mg/L) and E. faecium (with MICs of 4 or 8 mg/L). For this reason, and because there are ongoing issues with the reliability of laboratory testing, EUCAST lists daptomycin breakpoints for Enterococcus species as "IE"-insufficient evidence. EUCAST advises increased vigilance in the use of high-dose of daptomycin to treat enterococcal BSI and endocarditis. Additional PK-PD studies and prospective efficacy and safety studies of serious Enterococcal infections treated with high-dose daptomycin may permit the setting of breakpoints in the future.

### Acquisition of daptomycin resistance in patients results in decreased virulence in… [^116QRqN9]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

It remained possible that the daptomycin-susceptible strains could interfere with some aspect of the immune response other than antimicrobial peptide transcription. In this case, co-infection with daptomycin-susceptible and resistant strains would allow daptomycin-resistant strains to grow in vivo to a similar degree to their paired susceptible strain. Therefore, we co-infected Drosophila with 1:1 mixtures of susceptible and resistant bacteria, and we measured the numbers of viable susceptible and resistant bacteria 20 h after infection. This was explored for pairs A and D.

As before, in single-strain infections, daptomycin-susceptible strains grew in vivo, while daptomycin-resistant bacteria did not. In co-infection experiments, the presence of daptomycin-susceptible bacteria was not able to rescue the ability of daptomycin-resistant bacteria to grow in vivo (Fig. 5A and B).

### Clindamycin phosphate (Cleocin phosphate) [^112gbK9Z]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the ribosome. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic.

Resistance

Resistance to clindamycin is most often caused by modification of specific bases of the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete. Because the binding sites for these antibacterial drugs overlap, cross-resistance is sometimes observed among lincosamides, macrolides and streptogramin B. Macrolide-inducible resistance to clindamycin occurs in some isolates of macrolide-resistant bacteria. Macrolide-resistant isolates of staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci should be screened for induction of clindamycin resistance using the D-zone test.

Antimicrobial Activity

Clindamycin has been shown to be active against most of the isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage]:

Gram-positive bacteria

Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains)
Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains)
Streptococcus pyogenes

Anaerobic bacteria

Clostridium perfringens
Fusobacterium necrophorum
Fusobacterium nucleatum
Peptostreptococcus anaerobius
Prevotella melaninogenica

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for clindamycin against isolates of a similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of clindamycin in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Gram-positive bacteria

Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible strains)
Streptococcus agalactiae
Streptococcus anginosus
Streptococcus mitis

Pathogen-directed therapy — staphylococci and Propionibacterium acnes — For methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, nafcillin or oxacillin is recommended (strong, moderate); if the patient cannot receive beta-lactam agents, the patient can be desensitized or may receive vancomycin as an alternative agent (weak, moderate). For methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin is recommended as first-line therapy (strong, moderate), with consideration for an alternative antimicrobial agent if the vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is ≥ 1 µg/mL (strong, moderate). For coagulase-negative staphylococci, the recommended therapy should be similar to that for S. aureus and based on in vitro susceptibility testing (strong, moderate). If the staphylococcal isolate is susceptible to rifampin, this agent may be considered in combination with other antimicrobial agents for staphylococcal ventriculitis and meningitis (weak, low); rifampin is recommended as part of combination therapy for any patient with intracranial or spinal hardware such as a CSF shunt or drain (strong, low). For staphylococcal disease in whom beta-lactam agents or vancomycin cannot be used, linezolid (strong, low), daptomycin (strong, low), or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (strong, low) is recommended, with selection of a specific agent based on in vitro susceptibility testing. For infection caused by Propionibacterium acnes, penicillin G is recommended (strong, moderate).

### Data-driven prediction of colonization outcomes for complex microbial communities [^115mGafs]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Generation of human stool-derived in vitro microbial communities with diverse compositional profiles

To systematically study colonization outcomes in complex microbial communities, we used cultivation of human stool-derived in vitro communities in multi-well plates – (Fig. 2A, Methods). Briefly, we cultured gut microbial communities derived from 24 donors to reach steady states after five rounds of serial passaging in vitro. To increase the diversity in baseline communities, we treated each donor's sample with a single pulse of 12 antibiotics from different classes (Table S1). After 24 h of antibiotics treatment, in vitro microbial communities were passaged every 24 h with a 1:200 dilution into fresh medium (Fig. 2A). Overall, we obtained more than 300 baseline communities with substantial variation in the compositional profiles at the species level (Fig. 2B, Figs. S4, S5). The compositional profiles of the baseline communities were stable, with around 40 to 120 co-existing species in each community (Fig. S6).

All communities were passaged five times to reach a stable state, i.e. baseline community profiles (green dot, schematic cartoon below illustrated an example of in vitro baseline communities with diverse composition). B Exogenous species were introduced on Day 6. After 8–10 times of passaging, the end-point community profiles (red dot) were sequenced to determine the colonization outcome (C).

For the invasion experiments, we would introduce an exogenous species into the baseline communities and determine its colonization outcome after 8–10 rounds of serial passaging (Fig. 2C). We conducted a preliminary experiment to investigate the colonization outcome of different exogenous species (Fig. S7). We found that E. faecium, A. muciniphila, and Fusobacterium nucleatum could successfully colonize in some communities at varying levels of post-invasion abundance. In contrast, Streptococcus salivarius, Bifidobacterium breve, and Lactobacillus spp. could not colonize in nearly all the communities we tested. Moreover, vancomycin treatment significantly altered the colonization outcomes, rendering the gut microbial communities more susceptible to invasion (Fig. S7C). Overall, our results support the use of human stool-derived in vitro communities as a model experimental system for studying colonization outcomes.

### Data-driven prediction of colonization outcomes for complex microbial communities [^113LuZoG]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

From the fecal samples of SIAT cohort, we selected 24 donors in which E. faecium and A. muciniphila were not detected by metagenomic sequencing. To increase the diversity in baseline communities, we treated each donor's sample with 12 antibiotics from different classes(Fig. S4). Those stool-derived communities were treated with antibiotics for 24 h on Day 0 (i.e. a single pulse). Afterwards, the communities were passaged five times (from Day 1 to Day 6) in antibiotic-free medium to reach a stable state before introducing the exogenous species. Different antibiotic classes target distinct spectra of bacteria, leading to a remodeling of the community in different directions. We selected antibiotics from different classes as described in the EUCAST databases. The optimal concentrations of the antibiotics were determined based on a previous study that evaluated the activity spectrum of antibiotic classes on human gut commensals. We tested at least three different concentrations for each antibiotic and evaluated the optimized dose based on its ability to partially inhibit (50–80%) the overall growth of stool-derived bacteria as measured by OD 600 after 24 h of incubation. To ensure reproducibility, we screened at least three different stool aliquot stocks as biological duplicates for each antibiotic. We measured the OD 600 of each well every 30 min using an Epoch 2 plate reader (BioTek) and collected growth curves up to 24 h.

Bacterial strains

Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium symbiosum, Streptococcus salivarius, and Bifidobacterium breve strains were isolated from fecal samples of SIAT cohort. Taxonomy of isolates from SIAT cohort was confirmed by whole genome sequencing. Genome sequences have been deposited in PRJEB60398 (see "Data availability"). Lactobacillus plantarum HNU082, Lactobacillus paracasei HNU312 was provided by Prof. Jiachao Zhang from Hainan University. Akkermansia muciniphila (ATCC BAA-835) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC 25586) were purchased from ATCC.

### Daptomycin (Dapzura rt) [^113FeDt5]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.10 Decreased Efficacy in Patients with Moderate Baseline Renal Impairment

Limited data are available from the two Phase 3 complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI) trials regarding clinical efficacy of daptomycin for injection treatment in adult patients with creatinine clearance (CLCR) < 50 mL/min; only 31/534 (6%) patients treated with daptomycin for injection in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population had a baseline CLCR < 50 mL/min. Table 5 shows the number of adult patients by renal function and treatment group who were clinical successes in the Phase 3 cSSSI trials.

In a subgroup analysis of the ITT population in the Phase 3 S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial, clinical success rates, as determined by a treatment-blinded Adjudication Committee [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], in the daptomycin for injection-treated adult patients were lower in patients with baseline CLCR < 50 mL/min (see Table 6). A decrease of the magnitude shown in Table 6 was not observed in comparator-treated patients.

Consider these data when selecting antibacterial therapy for use in adult patients with baseline moderate to severe renal impairment.

5.11 Risk in Patients with Hereditary Fructose Intolerance (HFI)

DAPZURA RT contains sorbitol, an inactive ingredient, and may precipitate a metabolic crisis that may include, but is not limited to life-threatening hypoglycemia, hypophosphatemia, lactic acidosis, and hepatic failure in patients with HFI. The minimum amount of sorbitol at which serious adverse reactions may occur in these patients is not known.

Obtain a careful history of HFI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) with sorbitol/fructose/sucrose exposure prior to DAPZURA RT administration because a diagnosis of HFI may not yet be established in pediatric patients [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

5.12 Increased International Normalized Ratio (INR)/Prolonged Prothrombin Time

Clinically relevant plasma concentrations of daptomycin have been observed to cause a significant concentration-dependent false prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and elevation of International Normalized Ratio (INR) when certain recombinant thromboplastin reagents are utilized for the assay [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

5.13 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing DAPZURA RT in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### Breast cancer colonization by Fusobacterium nucleatum accelerates tumor growth and metastatic progression [^117M5igi]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fusobacterium nucleatum is an oral anaerobe recently found to be prevalent in human colorectal cancer (CRC) where it is associated with poor treatment outcome. In mice, hematogenous F. nucleatum can colonize CRC tissue using its lectin Fap2, which attaches to tumor-displayed Gal-GalNAc. Here, we show that Gal-GalNAc levels increase as human breast cancer progresses, and that occurrence of F. nucleatum gDNA in breast cancer samples correlates with high Gal-GalNAc levels. We demonstrate Fap2-dependent binding of the bacterium to breast cancer samples, which is inhibited by GalNAc. Intravascularly inoculated Fap2-expressing F. nucleatum ATCC 23726 specifically colonize mice mammary tumors, whereas Fap2-deficient bacteria are impaired in tumor colonization. Inoculation with F. nucleatum suppresses accumulation of tumor infiltrating T cells and promotes tumor growth and metastatic progression, the latter two of which can be counteracted by antibiotic treatment. Thus, targeting F. nucleatum or Fap2 might be beneficial during treatment of breast cancer.

### Clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride [^113DVnNY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the ribosome. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic.

Resistance

Resistance to clindamycin is most often caused by modification of specific bases of the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete. Because the binding sites for these antibacterial drugs overlap, cross-resistance is sometimes observed among lincosamides, macrolides and streptogramin B. Macrolide- inducible resistance to clindamycin occurs in some isolates of macrolide-resistant bacteria. Macrolide-resistant isolates of staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci should be screened for induction of clindamycin resistance using the D-zone test.

Antimicrobial Activity

Clindamycin has been shown to be active against most of the isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitroand in clinical infections, as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.

Gram-positive Bacteria

Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains)

Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains)

### Daptomycin (Cubicin RF) [^112PuFM5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4	Microbiology

Daptomycin belongs to the cyclic lipopeptide class of antibacterials. Daptomycin has clinical utility in the treatment of infections caused by aerobic, Gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro spectrum of activity of daptomycin encompasses most clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria.

Daptomycin exhibits rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria in vitro. This has been demonstrated both by time-kill curves and by MBC/MIC (minimum bactericidal concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration) ratios using broth dilution methodology. Daptomycin maintained bactericidal activity in vitro against stationary phase S. aureus in simulated endocardial vegetations. The clinical significance of this is not known.

Mechanism of Action

Daptomycin binds to bacterial cell membranes and causes a rapid depolarization of membrane potential. This loss of membrane potential causes inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death.

Resistance

The mechanism(s) of daptomycin resistance is not fully understood. Currently, there are no known transferable elements that confer resistance to daptomycin.

Interactions with Other Antibacterials

In vitro studies have investigated daptomycin interactions with other antibacterials. Antagonism, as determined by kill curve studies, has not been observed. In vitro synergistic interactions of daptomycin with aminoglycosides, β-lactam antibacterials, and rifampin have been shown against some isolates of staphylococci (including some methicillin-resistant isolates) and enterococci (including some vancomycin-resistant isolates).

Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection (cSSSI) Trials in Adults

The emergence of daptomycin non-susceptible isolates occurred in 2 infected patients across the set of Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of cSSSI in adult patients. In one case, a non-susceptible S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a Phase 2 trial who received CUBICIN at less than the protocol-specified dose for the initial 5 days of therapy. In the second case, a non-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from a patient with an infected chronic decubitus ulcer who was enrolled in a salvage trial.

S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis and Other Post-Approval Trials in Adults

In subsequent clinical trials in adult patients, non-susceptible isolates were recovered. S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a compassionate-use trial and from 7 patients in the S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. An E. faecium was isolated from a patient in a vancomycin-resistant enterococci trial.

Haemolysis assay

Haemolytic activity was measured as previously described with slight modifications. Fresh human venal blood was collected from healthy volunteers and pretreated with the anticoagulant sodium citrate. Serial twofold dilutions of each antibiotic, dissolved in 0.9% NaCl solution, were added to fresh human whole blood (50% final, vol:vol) to the final volume of 80 μL and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h on a horizontal shaker at 200 rpm. For negative and positive controls, human whole blood in 0.9% NaCl solution (A blank) and in sdH 2 O (A water) were used, respectively. After incubation, both test and A blank were mixed with 1 mL 0.9% NaCl solution, or sdH 2 O for the complete hydrolysis A water. After centrifugation of samples at 2500 rpm (700 × g) for 5 min, the release of haemoglobin was monitored by measuring the absorbance (A sample) of the supernatant at 540 nm using BMG Labtech PolarStar Omega multimode reader. The percentage of haemolysis was calculated according to the equation:

Critical micelle concentration assay

CMCs were determined as previously describedwith a higher throughput modification. Briefly, a cascade dilution of each antibiotic was performed in a low binding polypropylene V-bottom shaped 96-well plates in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl solution across 12 concentrations ranging from 1000 to 0.1 μM, except the control melittin (100 to 0.01 μM). An identical cascade dilution was performed for the neutral detergent Triton X-100 and the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) starting from 0.1% down to 0.00001% (vol:vol for Triton X-100 and wt:vol for SDS). An aliquot of 6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) in DMSO was added in each well to yield the final DPH concentration of 5 μM. The reaction mixtures were mixed for 30 s and transferred in horizontal triplicate (25 μL per well) into a black falcon 384-well plate. The 384-well plate was then sealed, wrapped up in aluminium foil and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The fluorescence intensity was monitored in real time using a BMG Labtech PolarStar Omega multimode reader fitted with 360–10 and 430–10 excitation and emission filters respectively, at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 430 nm.

### The need for new therapeutic agents: what is the pipeline? [^116rCuAg]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

There is a clinical need for new treatment options for serious Gram-positive infections. Recently introduced agents such as the newer fluoroquinolones and the ketolide telithromycin have limited use as they do not cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE). The clinical use of the streptogramin combination quinupristin/dalfopristin, which has activity against MRSA and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, is limited because administration is via a slow infusion of a large volume. The oxazolidinone linezolid is active against MRSA and GRE but resistant organisms and treatment failures have been reported. A number of compounds currently in development show promise, the new glycopeptides oritavancin, dalbavancin and the glycolipodepsipeptide ramoplanin, as well as the new tetracyclines tigecycline and BAY73–7388. However, in some cases, there is concern that resistance may develop quickly to new compounds that are based on existing antimicrobial agents. Therefore daptomycin, a novel lipopeptide with a unique mode of action, is of particular interest. Daptomycin is active against MRSA (including vancomycin-resistant strains) and GRE. Daptomycin displays rapid concentration-dependent killing and is bactericidal even in the stationary phase of growth. Daptomycin-resistant strains are very difficult to generate in vitro. A dosage of 4 mg/kg intravenous once a day has been shown to be efficacious in two evaluator-blinded trials of complicated skin and soft tissue infections with clinical success rates similar for daptomycin and comparators (vancomycin or penicillinase-resistant penicillins). With its activity against key Gram-positive pathogens, including resistant strains, daptomycin has potential as a valuable addition to the available treatment options for serious Gram-positive infections.

### Cefotaxime [^113Eq5FZ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Microbiology

Mechanism of Action Cefotaxime sodium is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cefotaxime has activity in the presence of some beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

Mechanism of Resistance Resistance to cefotaxime is primarily through hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and decreased permeability.

Susceptibility to cefotaxime will vary geographically and may change over time; local susceptibility data should be consulted, if available. Cefotaxime has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section:

### Recovery of gut microbiota of healthy adults following antibiotic exposure [^115Mgdiv]. Nature Microbiology (2018). Medium credibility.

To minimize the impact of antibiotics, gut microorganisms harbour and exchange antibiotics resistance genes, collectively called their resistome. Using shotgun sequencing-based metagenomics, we analysed the partial eradication and subsequent regrowth of the gut microbiota in 12 healthy men over a 6-month period following a 4-day intervention with a cocktail of 3 last-resort antibiotics: meropenem, gentamicin and vancomycin. Initial changes included blooms of enterobacteria and other pathobionts, such as Enterococcus faecalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, and the depletion of Bifidobacterium species and butyrate producers. The gut microbiota of the subjects recovered to near-baseline composition within 1.5 months, although 9 common species, which were present in all subjects before the treatment, remained undetectable in most of the subjects after 180 days. Species that harbour β-lactam resistance genes were positively selected for during and after the intervention. Harbouring glycopeptide or aminoglycoside resistance genes increased the odds of de novo colonization, however, the former also decreased the odds of survival. Compositional changes under antibiotic intervention in vivo matched results from in vitro susceptibility tests. Despite a mild yet long-lasting imprint following antibiotics exposure, the gut microbiota of healthy young adults are resilient to a short-term broad-spectrum antibiotics intervention and their antibiotics resistance gene carriage modulates their recovery processes.

### Profile of a novel anionic fluoroquinolone-delafloxacin [^116LvdGX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The in vitro activities of delafloxacin and a comprehensive panel of comparators (levofloxacin, ceftaroline, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, daptomycin, erythromycin, linezolid, oxacillin, tetracycline, tigecycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin) against 6485 isolates collected from multiple sites in Europe and the United States in 2014 have been evaluated (Table 1). This study applied 2016 interpretation criteria of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for comparator agents. Although there are neither CLSI nor EUCAST interpretive criteria (breakpoints) for delafloxacin, those set by the FDA for the United States in 2017 (see prescribing information and medication guide) have been listed below Table 1 for comparison. (Since 2006, the FDA has reasserted its rights to define breakpoints for antibiotics, which affects all new drugs registered in the United States since then. EUCAST breakpoints are set up during the registration process of new antibiotics with the European Medicine Agency [EMA], but this has not yet been finalized for delafloxacin at the time of the final writing and revision of this review [December 8, 2018].) Delafloxacin had the lowest MICs among agents tested against MSSA, MRSA, S. pneumoniae, and viridans group and beta-hemolytic Streptococci and MICs comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against some Enterobacteriaceae. Its low MICs against pathogens associated with ABSSSI as well as respiratory and urinary tract infections (UTIs) were confirmed. These findings have been corroborated by a more recent susceptibility analysis of 36 683 Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates (of which 10 153 were identified as associated with skin and skin structure infections [SSSI]) collected between 2014 and 2016 from sites in the United States and Europe. Application of the CLSI and EUCAST 2017 breakpoints for comparator agents and FDA breakpoints for delafloxacin from the 2017 package insert enabled confirmation of the broad-spectrum in vitro activity of delafloxacin against this contemporary panel of isolates. Delafloxacin demonstrates lower MICs than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against S. aureus (MIC 50 /MIC 90 0.008/0.5 mg/L, 0.25/ > 4 mg/L, and ≤ 0.06/4 mg/L for delafloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin, respectively), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (MIC 50 /MIC 90 0.015/0.5 mg/L, 0.25/ > 4 mg/L, and 0.12/4 mg/L, respectively), S. pneumoniae (MIC 50 /MIC 90 0.015/0.03 mg/L, 1/1 mg/L, and ≤ 0.12/0.25 mg/L, respectively), and S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae (MIC 50 /MIC 90 0.015/0.03 mg/L and 0.5/1 mg/L for delafloxacin and levofloxacin, respectively, against both pathogens). Other studies have shown lower MICs for delafloxacin than comparators against clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae and against isolates of S. aureus resistant to methicillin and other fluoroquinolones (eg, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin). The latter study examined the in vitro activity of delafloxacin against S. aureus isolates from participants in Phase 3 studies harboring mutations in the QRDR, including isolates with the most frequently encountered mutations in clinical trials — the S84L mutation at the gyrA locus and the S80Y mutation at the parC locus — and documented high rates of microbiological response against such isolates. Notably, the MIC values for isolates with single mutations were considerably larger than for susceptible isolates but did not exceed 0.5 mg/L (a value considered as "intermediate" by the FDA; see definition in). A sole isolate harboring both mutations showed an MIC of 4 mg/L (thus reported as resistant) but was presumed eradicated by delafloxacin treatment.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) after operations — initial management and when to use antibiotics — are outlined as follows: surveillance standards mandate 30 days of follow-up for operations without placement of prosthetic material and for 1 year for operations where a prosthesis was inserted; the most important therapy for an SSI is to open the incision, evacuate the infected material, and continue dressing changes until the wound heals by secondary intention; if there is < 5 cm of erythema and induration with minimal systemic signs (temperature < 38.5°C, white blood cell (WBC) count < 12 000 cells/μL, and pulse < 100 beats/minute), antibiotics are unnecessary; patients with temperature > 38.5°C or heart rate > 110 beats/minute or erythema extending beyond the wound margins for > 5 cm may require a short course (eg, 24–48 hours) of antibiotics and opening of the suture line; for intestinal or female genital tract operations with mixed flora, antibiotics considered suitable for treatment of intra-abdominal infection are appropriate, and when MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) risk is present the initial antibiotic should include vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, telavancin, or ceftaroline plus piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, or ceftriaxone and metronidazole for gram-negative and anaerobic coverage; for incision and drainage of superficial abscesses, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended.

### De novo daptomycin-nonsusceptible enterococcal infections [^11569mLK]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Four (44.4%) patients died while receiving therapy for DNSE (Table 1). Each patient had multiple concurrent conditions, and cause of death could not be attributed solely to DNSE. (Table 1). Of the 5 patients who survived, the clinical response to treatment of DNSE infection could not be determined for 3 patients because of multiple concurrent conditions and polymicrobial infection. However, 1 patient with cholangitis, from whom DNSE were isolated from a bile culture, improved clinically despite receiving antimicrobial agents that were inactive against DNSE. The second clinically evaluable patient had asymptomatic bacteriuria associated with DNSE, did not receive any antimicrobial therapy, and remained clinically stable. Follow-up urine samples were cultured for 1 of the 5 surviving patients (patient 5); the result was negative.

### Host dysbiosis negatively impacts IL-9-producing T-cell differentiation and antitumour immunity [^116wu7W6]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

The intestinal microbiota composition is fine-tuned and subjected to different perturbations that may result in a less-diverse and less-stable architecture known as dysbiosis, which is frequently associated with impaired local and systemic immune responses. – GF mice colonised with intestinal microbiota from animals with inflammation-associated colorectal cancer were shown to be more susceptible to tumorigenesis, and administration of Fusobacterium nucleatum was shown to promote a proinflammatory microenvironment, and to potentiate intestinal tumorigenesis in specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice. Systemically, it was demonstrated that a dramatic reduction of gut commensals via broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment resulted in increased susceptibility to melanoma and Lewis carcinoma development in mice, negatively impacting IL-17-producing γδ T cells. More recently, antibiotic-induced dysbiosis was shown to enhance distal tumour progression by altering host cytokine levels and endothelial adhesion molecules, resulting in a defective recruitment of effector CD8 + T cells into the tumour microenvironment. Many other studies have also indicated a fundamental role of the microbiota in regulating responses to cancer therapies, such as CpG-based immunotherapy, platinum-based chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1/PDL-1. –

### High-speed atomic force microscopy highlights new molecular mechanism of daptomycin action [^115UzWSX]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In summary, during the first minutes of exposure, Dap is able to insert the exposed lipid leaflet and once inserted, the monomers diffuse rapidly. The HS-AFM allowed us to confirm the formation of oligomers without the uncertainty – linked to label-based approaches. Here, we observed a slightly wider distribution than previous measurementsof the Dap stoichiometry by FRET that ranged from 1 to 6 monomers, but close to the estimations by electrophysiology. In addition, the extent of our size distribution could be partially issued from the uncertainties derived from process of AFM imaging of the fast moving (300 ± 200 µm/s) oligomers. Significantly, our data points to an oligomer-oligomer attraction for centre-to-centre distance below 20 nm in which a partially bi-stable energy well is present: circumstance that could cause the emergence particular supramolecular organisations on the membrane that could be relevant for Dap activity.

### Update on the taxonomy and clinical aspects of the genus Fusobacterium [^1112Sxjf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The genus Fusobacterium currently includes 13 species. Fusobacterium nucleatum, the most frequently encountered species in humans, is heterogeneous and currently includes 5 subspecies. A potentially new subspecies of F. nucleatum that is intrinsically quinolone-resistant and phylogenetically separate from the other 5 subspecies has been identified from dog and cat oral flora. Two subspecies have been described for Fusobacterium necrophorum, and a new species, Fusobacterium equinum, which is related to F. necrophorum, has been described from horse oral flora. Additional molecular studies have characterized Fusobacterium ulcerans as separate from the phenotypically similar Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium. Fusobacterium sulci and Fusobacterium alocis have been reclassified as Eubacterium sulci and Filifactor alocis, respectively. Fusobacterium prausnitzii is phylogenetically related to the Eubacterium-like organisms and will likely be reclassified in the future. The status of the remaining species is unchanged.

### Rifaximin prophylaxis causes resistance to the last-resort antibiotic daptomycin [^1177oPTP]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Coordinated global efforts are underway to preserve last-resort antimicrobials through stringent stewardship protocols, limiting the use of these critically important medicines. This strategy assumes that restricted antibiotic use correlates with reduced opportunities for pathogens to develop resistance. Our findings challenge this assumption, demonstrating that exposure to prophylactic rifaximin can lead to DAP-R VREfm emergence without direct DAP exposure.

Our data underscore the potential for unanticipated antimicrobial cross-resistance after the implementation of new treatment regimens, even those perceived to be low-risk and highlight the complex interplay between antimicrobial use and bacterial resistance mechanisms. The potential far-reaching impacts of seemingly benign antimicrobial regimens on AMR necessitates careful consideration, especially regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Our research reinforces the need for judicious use of all antibiotics, and emphasizes the delicate balance required in managing AMR while meeting clinical needs.

### Human serum triggers antibiotic tolerance in Staphylococcus aureus [^113y3LYd]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Whilst we identified two independent mechanisms by which serum triggered daptomycin tolerance, we do not yet know how serum adaptation confers tolerance to the other antimicrobials tested. The similarities of serum-adapted S. aureus to VISA isolates may explain vancomycin tolerance and we hypothesize that the thickened cell wall may exclude the AMPs nisin and gramicidin from reaching their membrane targets. Furthermore, the increased abundance of D-alanylated WTA in the walls of serum-adapted cells may contribute to gentamicin tolerance, since dltA has been shown to be required for survival of Streptococcus mutans biofilm exposed to this antibiotic. However, we do not currently have a hypothesis for the mechanism responsible for nitrofurantoin tolerance in serum-adapted cells.

Understanding the mechanisms behind daptomycin tolerance is important for developing a combination therapeutic approach using readily available drugs as a simple and effective way to improve treatment outcomes. Serum-induced tolerance occurred via two mechanisms: a GraRS-dependent accumulation of peptidoglycan and a GraRS-independent increase in CL. Inhibition of either of these processes significantly reduced the extent of daptomycin tolerance in vitro, indicating that targeting these processes may be a viable strategy to reduce tolerance. Unfortunately, although we demonstrated that inhibition of GraRS using verteporfin reduced daptomycin tolerance in serum, this drug is unsuitable for use systemically due to toxicity, and a second GraRS inhibitor, MAC-545496 cannot be used due to poor aqueous solubility. Therefore, although inhibition of GraRS may reduce daptomycin tolerance, a lack of suitable inhibitors currently precludes their testing in in vivo invasive disease models. Inhibition of CL accumulation is also not currently a viable approach as, to the best of our knowledge, no inhibitors of S. aureus Cls2 have been described. By contrast, the finding that peptidoglycan synthesis was essential for host-mediated daptomycin tolerance raises the possibility that combined use of daptomycin with an additional cell wall synthesis inhibitor may prevent tolerance. In support of this, supplementation of serum with fosfomycin prevented cell wall accumulation and significantly reduced the number of bacteria which survived subsequent daptomycin exposure. As well as preventing tolerance, a combination approach may also have other benefits as fosfomycin has been shown to synergise with daptomycin in in vitro and in vivo studies and to slow the development of daptomycin resistance –. The basis of this synergy is thought to be an increase in daptomycin binding, providing additional evidence that the wall acts as a significant barrier for daptomycin and that by reducing cell wall thickness daptomycin can reach its membrane target more easily.

### Protein-inspired antibiotics active against vancomycin-and daptomycin-resistant bacteria [^112nCFit]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The public health threat posed by a looming 'post-antibiotic' era necessitates new approaches to antibiotic discovery. Drug development has typically avoided exploitation of membrane-binding properties, in contrast to nature's control of biological pathways via modulation of membrane-associated proteins and membrane lipid composition. Here, we describe the rejuvenation of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin via selective targeting of bacterial membranes. Peptide libraries based on positively charged electrostatic effector sequences are ligated to N-terminal lipophilic membrane-insertive elements and then conjugated to vancomycin. These modified lipoglycopeptides, the 'vancapticins', possess enhanced membrane affinity and activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other Gram-positive bacteria, and retain activity against glycopeptide-resistant strains. Optimised antibiotics show in vivo efficacy in multiple models of bacterial infection. This membrane-targeting strategy has potential to 'revitalise' antibiotics that have lost effectiveness against recalcitrant bacteria, or enhance the activity of other intravenous-administered drugs that target membrane-associated receptors.

### Diagnosis and treatment of Fusobacterium nucleatum discitis and vertebral osteomyelitis: case report and review of the literature [^1177pJX4]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Objective

We present a case of vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis caused by Fusobacterium nucleatum in a 42-year-old female.

Summary Of Background Data

Infection of the vertebral bodies or disc space with this organism is rare. A review of the English literature disclosed 13 cases of vertebral osteomyelitis caused by Fusobacterium spp. Because of the negative impact of this condition on the affected patients' activities of daily living, it is important to understand the clinical character and effective management of the disease to improve quality of life. Fusobacterium is an anaerobic and gram-negative microbe that is part of the normal flora of the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and female genital tract. It is the main cause of Lemierre syndrome and has also been seen in septicemia.

Methods

The patient presented to our institution with a 3-month history of severe lower back pain. Her back pain was diagnosed as vertebral osteomyelitis. Magnetic resonance images of the lumbar spine revealed decreased T2 signal in the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies. Computed tomographic scan demonstrated asymmetrical disc height loss between vertebral bodies L3 and L4 and associated periosteal reaction.

Results

Computed tomography-guided biopsy of vertebral bodies L3 and L4 revealed microorganism Fusobacterium nucleatum with the following in vitro susceptibilities: clindamycin ≤ 0.5 S, metronidazole ≤ 0.5 S, penicillin ≤ 0.5 S, ertapenem ≤ 4 S. Parenteral ertapenem, at a dose of 1 g every 24 hours for 8 weeks in combination with oral amoxicillin and clavulanate as oral suppression was used as medical management. At 1-month follow-up after medical treatment, the patient's inflammatory markers returned to normal values, and the infection resolved with L3-L4 autofusion.

Conclusion

We report a rare case of Fusobacterium vertebral osteomyelitis. This condition is associated with several comorbid and concomitant conditions including gastrointestinal complications. Effective treatment includes thoracolumbar orthosis bracing and intravenous antibiotic therapy.

### Activity of fusidic acid against extracellular and intracellular Staphylococcus aureus: influence of pH and comparison with linezolid and clindamycin [^111nwsqs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Emergence of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has triggered a reassessment of fusidic acid (CEM-102, sodium fusidate).

Methods

Fusidic acid was examined for (1) activity against recent methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates; (2) modulation of activity by acidic pH; and (3) accumulation by phagocytic cells and intracellular activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA.

Results

About 96% of strains (N = 94) were susceptible (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing breakpoint [≤ 1 mg/L]). Activity was enhanced at pH 5.5 (6 dilutions decrease for minimum inhibitory concentration) in parallel with an increase of drug bacterial accumulation (opposite effects for clindamycin; linezolid remained unaffected). Fusidic acid accumulated in THP-1 cells (about 5.5 fold), with further accumulation at pH 5.5 vs pH 7.4. The intracellular activity of Fusidic acid was similar to that of clindamycin and linezolid (maximal relative activity, 0.4–0.6 log₁₀ colony-forming unit decrease). No cross-resistance to vancomycin or daptomycin was observed.

Conclusions

Fusidic acid is active against S. aureus in broth as well as intracellularly, with no cross-resistance to other antibiotics.

### A genome-wide atlas of antibiotic susceptibility targets and pathways to tolerance [^111My89n]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

cozEb encodes a cell division and peptidoglycan synthesis embedded membrane protein that can be critically targeted in vivo through an antibody-antibiotic strategy

By identifying targets that (re)sensitize bacteria against existing antibiotics, genome-wide antibiotic susceptibility data have the potential to guide the development of new antimicrobial strategies. One such strategy could be a combined therapeutic antibody-antibiotic approach; the antibody would target a gene product that is important for sensitivity to one or more antibiotics and ideally the product would be easily accessible for the antibody at the bacterial cell surface. To find suitable candidate targets, Tn-Seq data were filtered for gene products that, based on a known function or localization prediction, are likely to be present in the cell wall or membrane, and that when disrupted, increase sensitivity to one or more antibiotics. Moreover, it would likely be ideal if the gene is also important for survival in vivo. A strong candidate is SP_1505, which in the interaction network is most tightly linked to cell wall metabolism and cell-division genes (Fig. 4a). After we previously hypothesized that it may play a role in cell wall integrity, it was recently named cozEb, with a likely role in organizing peptidoglycan synthesis during cell division, which fits its interaction profile (Fig. 4a). Importantly, the antibiotic Tn-Seq data suggest that disruption creates increased sensitivity to vancomycin and rifampicin, while the product is critical in the presence of daptomycin, which was confirmed through individual growth curves (Fig. 4b). The protein has eight predicted membrane-spanning domains (Fig. 4c), and in vivo Tn-Seq predicts it is important for survival in both the nasopharynx and lungs (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Data 2). The gene was cloned into an expression plasmid generating an ~30kD product (Fig. 4c), which was used to raise rabbit anti-CozEb antibodies, which were confirmed to be specific for the cozEb gene product (Fig. 4c). Potential antibody in vitro activity was determined through a bacterial survival assay in the absence and presence of antibodies and either vancomycin or daptomycin. Incubating bacteria with antibodies or daptomycin has no significant effect on bacterial survival, while vancomycin alone at the concentration used slightly reduces the number of surviving bacteria. Moreover, combining the antibody with either vancomycin or daptomycin further reduces the number of surviving bacteria in vitro compared to any agent individually (Fig. 4d). To assess whether the antibody-antibiotic approach works in vivo, mice were intranasally challenged with a bacterial inoculum either containing WT or Δ cozEb. Two additional sets of mice were challenged with WT and 8 h post infection they were either treated with daptomycin and control IgG antibody or with daptomycin and CozEb-specific antibody. Mice were sacrificed 24 h post infection, and bacteria in the lungs were enumerated. As predicted by the in vivo Tn-Seq data the cozEb knockout has a significantly lower fitness in the lungs highlighted by an up to 2.5-log lower bacterial load compared to WT. Importantly, while the WT survives equally well in the presence of the low daptomycin concentration and the control IgG antibody, in the presence of daptomycin and the CozEb-targeting antibody, its survival in the lungs is significantly reduced and resembles that of the cozEb knockout (Fig. 4e). This shows that by combining antibiotic and in vivo Tn-Seq with gene annotation information, a gene product can be selected that is central and critical to cell-wall synthesis and cell-division processes. Importantly, due to its presence in the membrane, it is directly targetable with an antibody, thereby sensitizing the bacterium to an antibiotic concentration it is normally not sensitive to.

### Treatment failure resulting from resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to daptomycin [^115GSwAC]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Daptomycin, a new cyclic lipopeptide, was recently approved for the treatment of infections by gram-positive organisms, including infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A patient infected with infected with MRSA developed resistance to daptomycin after prolonged exposure, which resulted in clinical failure. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of daptomycin resistance and should consider routine testing for daptomycin susceptibility.

### Protein-inspired antibiotics active against vancomycin-and daptomycin-resistant bacteria [^1117UDg6]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

In this study, we designed and synthesised a series of vancomycin derivatives, designated vancapticins, by appending membrane targeting motifs onto the C -terminus of vancomycin. The vancapticins display Gram-positive activity, including activity against vancomycin-resistant strains. The vancapticins were highly efficacious in multiple infections models in mice, with a low propensity for innate and induced resistance, and a pharmacokinetic (PK) profile consistent with once daily dosing in humans. Taken together, these results suggest vancapticins could be candidates for further development as a promising new therapy for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacterial infections.

### Daptomycin (Dapzura rt) [^115PbAFJ]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive daptomycin for injection or a standard of care (SOC) comparator, which included intravenous therapy with either vancomycin, clindamycin, or an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin (nafcillin, oxacillin, or cloxacillin). Patients could switch to oral therapy after clinical improvement was demonstrated (no minimum IV dosing was required).

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of daptomycin for injection. The clinical outcome was determined by resolution or improvement of symptoms at the End-of-Treatment (EOT), 3 days after the last dose, and Test-of-Cure (TOC), 7–14 days after the last dose. Investigator observed outcomes were verified in a blinded fashion. Of the 396 subjects randomized in the study, 389 subjects were treated with daptomycin for injection or comparator and included in the ITT population. Of these, 257 subjects were randomized to the daptomycin for injection group and 132 subjects were randomized to the comparator group. Approximately 95% of subjects switched to oral therapy. The mean day of switch was day 4, and ranged from day 1 to day 14. The clinical success rates determined at 7–14 days after last dose of therapy (IV and oral) (TOC visit) were 88% (227/257) for daptomycin for injection and 86% (114/132) for comparator.

Infected animal bite–related wounds — treatment recommendations and options: An antimicrobial agent or agents active against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as amoxicillin-clavulanate (Table 5) should be used (strong, moderate). Purulent bite wounds and abscesses are more likely to be polymicrobial, whereas nonpurulent wounds commonly yield staphylococci and streptococci, and Pasteurella species are commonly isolated from both nonpurulent wounds with or without lymphangitis and from abscesses; nonpurulent wound infections may also be polymicrobial. Based on this bacteriology, amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate oral therapy that covers the most likely aerobes and anaerobes found in bite wounds. Alternative therapies could include second-generation cephalosporins (intravenously [IV] or by mouth [po]) (eg, cefuroxime), other second- or third-generation cephalosporins, plus anaerobic coverage (clindamycin or metronidazole) if required; a carbapenem, moxifloxacin, or doxycycline is also appropriate. If SMX-TMP or levofloxacin is used, anaerobic coverage with either clindamycin or metronidazole should be added. Unless no alternative agents are available, macrolides should be avoided due to variable activity against Pasteurella multocida and fusobacteria. Pregnancy is a relative contraindication for use of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, whereas SMX-TMP may be safely prescribed except in the third trimester of pregnancy.

RESULTS

From 16 December 2013 to 27 November 2017, we assessed 674 patients with MRSA bacteremia for eligibility, of whom 507 were not suitable for inclusion (Figure 1). A total of 167 patients were randomly assigned to receive daptomycin plus fosfomycin (82 patients) or daptomycin alone (85 patients). After excluding 12 patients who were randomized in error (5 patients) or did not receive the allocated study drug (7 patients) and consequently were excluded from the primary analysis population, the remaining 155 were included in the modified intention-to-treat population; 74 received daptomycin plus fosfomycin and 81 were given daptomycin alone.

### Daptomycin [^1129taHw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.5 Usage

Appropriate specimens for microbiological examination should be obtained in order to isolate and identify the causative pathogens and to determine their susceptibility to daptomycin.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of daptomycin for injection and other antibacterial drugs, daptomycin for injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

When culture and susceptibility information is available, it should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Empiric therapy may be initiated while awaiting test results.

### Local delivery of tobramycin and vancomycin in primary total knee arthroplasty achieves minimum inhibitory concentrations for common bacteria causing acute prosthetic joint infection [^113wo8V2]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

The aim of this study was to determine if the local delivery of vancomycin and tobramycin in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can achieve intra-articular concentrations exceeding the minimum inhibitory concentration thresholds for bacteria causing acute prosthetic joint infection (PJI).

Methods

Using a retrospective single-institution database of all primary TKAs performed between January 1 2014 and May 7 2019, we identified patients with acute PJI that were managed surgically within 90 days of the initial procedure. The organisms from positive cultures obtained at the time of revision were tested for susceptibility to gentamicin, tobramycin, and vancomycin. A prospective study was then performed to determine the intra-articular antibiotic concentration on postoperative day one after primary TKA using one of five local antibiotic delivery strategies with tobramycin and/or vancomycin mixed into the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) or vancomycin powder.

Results

A total of 19 patients with acute PJI after TKA were identified and 29 unique bacterial isolates were recovered. The mean time to revision was 37 days (6 to 84). Nine isolates (31%) were resistant to gentamicin, ten (34%) were resistant to tobramycin, and seven (24%) were resistant to vancomycin. Excluding one Fusobacterium nucleatum, which was resistant to all three antibiotics, all isolates resistant to tobramycin or gentamicin were susceptible to vancomycin and vice versa. Overall, 2.4 g of tobramycin hand-mixed into 80 g of PMMA and 1 g of intra-articular vancomycin powder consistently achieved concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentrations of susceptible organisms.

Conclusion

One-third of bacteria causing acute PJI after primary TKA were resistant to the aminoglycosides commonly mixed into PMMA, and one-quarter were resistant to vancomycin. With one exception, all bacteria resistant to tobramycin were susceptible to vancomycin and vice versa. Based on these results, the optimal cover for organisms causing most cases of acute PJI after TKA can be achieved with a combination of tobramycin mixed in antibiotic cement, and vancomycin powder.

### Dalbavancin (Dalvance) [^117Sqcph]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Dalbavancin, a semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide, interferes with cell wall synthesis by binding to the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of the stem pentapeptide in nascent cell wall peptidoglycan, thus preventing cross-linking. Dalbavancin is bactericidal in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes at concentrations similar to those sustained throughout treatment in humans treated according to the recommended dosage regimen.

Resistance

The development of bacterial isolates resistant to dalbavancin has not been observed, either in vitro, in studies using serial passage, or in animal infection experiments.

Interaction with Other Antimicrobials

When tested in vitro, dalbavancin demonstrated synergistic interactions with oxacillin and did not demonstrate antagonistic or synergistic interactions with any of the following antibacterial agents of various classes: gentamicin, vancomycin, levofloxacin, clindamycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, linezolid, aztreonam, rifampin or daptomycin. The clinical significance of these in vitro findings is unknown.

Antimicrobial Activity

Dalbavancin has been shown to be active against the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [s ee Indications and Usage (1)].

Aerobic bacteria

Gram-positive bacteria

Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant isolates)

Streptococcus pyogenes

### Next-generation rapid phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing [^113JYkmW]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Beyond direct measurement of MIC, translation of MIC values into categorical interpretation for clinicians (i.e. reporting whether bacteria A is "susceptible" or "resistant" to antimicrobial B) is based on susceptibility breakpoints that are designated for individual species of related groups of bacteria. This means that mature direct-from-specimen rapid AST platforms must be combined with a method for bacterial identification if they do not provide it inherently.

Finally, several testing parameters require optimization for application of such methods to the full range of antimicrobials of interest and the spectrum of pathogenic bacteria that may be encountered in clinical use. The testing medium must be shown to support the growth of both common and fastidious organisms (such as Haemophilus sp. Neisseria sp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae). For antimicrobials that require non-standard concentrations of divalent cations (eg daptomycin) or other physicochemical requirements (e.g. dalbavancin), dedicated AST cassettes or media are likely required.

### Development of daptomycin susceptibility breakpoints for Enterococcus faecium and revision of the breakpoints for other enterococcal species by the clinical and laboratory standards institute [^112WWEx9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Daptomycin is one of the few treatment options for infections caused by enterococci that are resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin, such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The emergence and clinical significance of daptomycin-resistant enterococci and evolving microbiologic, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic, and clinical data indicated that the pre-2019 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) susceptible-only breakpoint of ≤ 4 μg/mL for daptomycin and enterococci was no longer appropriate. After analyzing data that are outlined in this article, the CLSI Subcommittee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing established new breakpoints for daptomycin and enterococci. For E. faecium, a susceptible dose-dependent (SDD) breakpoint of ≤ 4 μg/mL was established based on an increased dosage of 8–12 mg/kg/day (≥ 8 μg/mL-resistant). CLSI suggests infectious diseases consultation to guide daptomycin use for the SDD category. For Enterococcus faecalis and other enterococcal species, revised breakpoints of ≤ 2 μg/mL-susceptible, 4 μg/mL-intermediate, and ≥ 8 μg/mL-resistant were established based on a standard dosage of 6 mg/kg/day.

### Successful treatment of Corynebacterium striatum endocarditis with daptomycin plus rifampin [^11643Jkg]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of Corynebacterium striatum endocarditis that was treated successfully with daptomycin plus rifampin following an unsuccessful attempt at vancomycin desensitization and failure of linezolid therapy.

Case Summary

A 46-year-old woman with hemodialysis-dependent chronic renal failure was admitted for a graft-related infection. She presented with C. striatum endocarditis that was treated with daptomycin plus rifampin due to a history of allergies to vancomycin and beta-lactam antibiotics and failure of linezolid therapy. The patient received daptomycin and rifampin for a total of 6 weeks. Three months after completion of treatment, no recurrence of endocarditis was evident.

Discussion

Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic, with rapid bactericidal activity. It has demonstrated efficacy in animal models of staphylococcal, streptococcal, and enterococcal endocarditis. Case reports of its activity in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis have also been documented.

Conclusions

Daptomycin, which has shown in vitro activity against C. striatum, may be a viable treatment option for patients with C. striatum endocarditis who are either allergic or refractory to traditional antibiotics.

### The new, new daptomycin breakpoint forspp [^116rXrUF]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

In 2019, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute revised the daptomycin breakpoints for Enterococcus spp. twice in rapid succession. Analyses leading to these revisions included review of testing issues, murine and human in vivo pharmacodynamics, safety of off-label doses, and treatment outcomes. The data review brought up a dilemma that is encountered with increasing frequency: a breakpoint supported by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling that bisected the wild-type Enterococcus faecium MIC distribution. In such instances, not only does the probability of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets need to be taken into account but also the probability that the laboratory can generate an accurate MIC that is reproducible within one interpretive category.

### Human serum triggers antibiotic tolerance in Staphylococcus aureus [^115xNsxW]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Although daptomycin resistance (typically referred to as non-susceptibility) can occur during therapy, it is not the only explanation for treatment failure and in many patients failure occurs despite the infecting strain being classed as susceptible by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. In these cases, a possible explanation for treatment failure is antibiotic tolerance, where a bacterial population survives exposure to a normally lethal concentration of an antibiotic without an increase in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). This tolerance can be due to mutations – or phenotypic adaptation, a transient phenotype which is thought to be induced by the environment conditions, especially those found in the host, As the population returns to a susceptible state when it is removed from the host environment, this tolerance is difficult to detect in vitro but may play an important role clinically. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that tolerance is a precursor to the acquisition of antibiotic resistance.

The mechanisms responsible for antibiotic tolerance are poorly understood, although it is frequently ascribed to slow rates of bacterial growth and/or low metabolic activity. These are thought to compromise the activity of antibiotics that require bacterial division for full activity, such as β-lactams and quinolones. However, as daptomycin is effective against non-growing bacteria, this is unlikely to be the basis of the reduced efficacy of daptomycin in vivo and the mechanisms of tolerance towards daptomycin remain unknown.

Although the causes of antibiotic tolerance are not fully understood, there is growing evidence that it can be transiently induced by the host environment during infection. For example, the numerous stresses found in the host, such as nutrient limitation, low pH, pyrexia, oxidative and/or nitrosative stress, antimicrobial peptides and proteases, mean that bacteria are rarely in a rapidly replicating state. These stresses may restrict bacterial growth directly, for example hypoxia leading to a switch to anaerobic metabolism, which produces less energy than the TCA cycle, or indirectly, for example nutrient limitation activating the stringent response –. This response results in downregulation of expression of genes required for growth, leading to a reduction in protein synthesis and a slower bacterial growth rate. This has been linked to the development of tolerance towards a range of antimicrobials including penicillin, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.

Native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) — timing and content of empiric antimicrobial therapy: In patients with a normal and stable neurologic examination and stable hemodynamics, we suggest holding empiric antimicrobial therapy until a microbiologic diagnosis is established (weak, low), and establishing the diagnosis prior to empiric therapy would improve the sensitivity of culture results. When empiric therapy is deemed appropriate, physicians should use regimens that would include coverage against staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), streptococci, and gram-negative bacilli; such regimens might include vancomycin plus a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin, with alternatives in allergy or intolerance including daptomycin plus a quinolone.

### Protein-inspired antibiotics active against vancomycin-and daptomycin-resistant bacteria [^115XpM7e]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The remarkably potent activity possessed by these antibiotics is most likely due to a membrane anchoring chelate effect that enhances antibiotic binding to cell wall precursors at the cell surface. In effect, intra-molecular binding is achieved as both the antibiotic and its target are attached via membrane anchors to the same template. Examining peptidoglycan synthesis in a cell-free system demonstrated that the vancapticins caused greater inhibition of biosynthetic activity than vancomycin, corresponding with much greater quantities of Ac-Lys(Ac) — Ala — Ala ligand in free solution required to antagonise vancapticin antimicrobial activity against live bacteria (Fig. 6).

The enhanced ability to inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis is accompanied by membrane binding and disruption (Fig. 7). SPR studies demonstrated a greater propensity for binding to an anionic lipid bilayer compared to vancomycin. A diSC3(5) dye-based assay in live bacteria showed that vancapticins induced membrane depolarisation to a similar extent to that seen with oritavancin, with minimal activity observed with vancomycin or dalbavancin. In contrast, a membrane permeabilisation assay (propidium iodide dye) gave variable results for the same vancapticins, with 17 and 24 eliciting a comparable response as oritavancin, but fourfold to sixfold less than daptomycin. Vancapticin 19 and dalbavancin were much less active, while vancomycin had no effect. The increased membrane activity of the vancapticins appears to enhance their potency, but does not translate into increased killing kinetics: compound 24 shared a similar slowly bactericidal profile with vancomycin (Fig. 2).

In summary, we report the design and development of promising new semisynthetic lipoglycopeptides intended to selectively interact with bacterial membranes. Further improvements and additional studies are ongoing to assess the potential to advance the vancapticins as a new clinical candidate for the treatment of drug-resistant Gram-positive infections.

### Activities of antistaphylococcal antibiotics towards the extracellular and intraphagocytic forms of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from a patient with persistent bacteraemia and endocarditis [^111YysQ7]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Decreased susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to antistaphylococcal agents may be associated with inability to eradicate intracellular forms, which could explain therapeutic failures. This hypothesis was tested using clinical isolates obtained from a patient with persistent staphylococcal bacteraemia under therapy. Four isogenic isolates (three from tissue, one from blood) with increased MICs for vancomycin (1–4 mg/L) and for daptomycin (1–4 mg/L) were collected after an initial 16-day treatment with vancomycin-rifampicin-gentamicin, followed by 13–20 days of treatment with daptomycin-rifampicin-gentamicin. Isolates were tested for MICs and for: (i) vancomycin (BODIPY-FL-vancomycin) and daptomycin binding; (ii) cell wall turnover (loss of N-acetyl-d-[1-(14)C]glucosamine in 30 min after 1 h of labelling); and (iii) Triton X-100-induced autolysis. Extracellular (broth) and intracellular (THP-1 macrophages) activities of rifampicin, linezolid and fusidic acid at C(max), and of vancomycin, daptomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin and oritavancin over a wide range of extracellular concentrations (with pharmacological modelling to determine E(max)), were measured at 24 h. Increases in vancomycin MICs correlated with increased drug binding, and decreased cell wall turnover and detergent-induced autolysis. Increases in daptomycin MICs correlated with decreased daptomycin binding. Intracellular activity was weak (E(max) < 1 log(10) CFU decrease) for vancomycin against all isolates, and for daptomycin against isolates with MICs > 1 mg/L. Among all antibiotics tested, only quinupristin-dalfopristin and oritavancin provided close to bactericidal intracellular activities (1.6–2.5 log₁₀ CFU decreases at C(max)). Determination of the intracellular susceptibility of S. aureus, combined with improved methods of diagnosis, could be useful when dealing with persistent staphylococcal infections and could improve therapy.

### Clinical experience with daptomycin treatment of foot or ankle osteomyelitis: a preliminary study [^112RLFex]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

We retrospectively reviewed 25 patients with foot or ankle osteomyelitis reported to a registry who were treated with daptomycin. The patients' clinical experience was analyzed and described at a median dose of 6 mg/kg (range, 4–6.2 mg/kg) and a median duration of 38 days (range, 6–59 days). Twenty-three patients received daptomycin as secondary or tertiary therapy, primarily for not responding to their prior antibiotic therapy (n = 15). Concomitant antibiotics were given to 11 patients, mostly for Gram-negative and/or anaerobic coverage. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen overall (15 of 25 patients). The median followup interval was 9 weeks (range, 0.5–77 weeks). Outcomes at the end of therapy were 16 patients' symptoms resolved, eight patients improved, and one patient did not respond to therapy; at followup, 19 patients' symptoms resolved, three patients improved, and three patients did not respond to therapy. Ongoing antibiotics were given to 52% of patients for a minimum of 8 days (median, 30 days; range, 8–232 days). Four patients with an implant (all removed) were successfully treated. Daptomycin appears promising for foot and ankle osteomyelitis caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Prospective, controlled clinical trials of daptomycin for osteomyelitis are warranted.

### Daptomycin: another novel agent for treating infections due to drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens [^115f19kg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Daptomycin is a novel cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic that provides rapid bactericidal activity against gram-positive pathogens in vitro, including methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and ampicillin- and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. The United States Food and Drug Administration recently approved daptomycin for treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections. Its efficacy in the treatment of more-serious infections (e.g., staphylococcal bacteremia) is under investigation. As an intravenous agent that is administered once per day, it offers a convenient regimen for therapy that is continued after discharge, with a side effect profile that appears minimal and manageable. Spontaneous acquisition of resistance in vitro is rare, and hopefully this characteristic will extrapolate into the clinical setting. The rapid bactericidal activity, low potential for resistance, and promising safety profile associated with this agent will make it a useful addition to our growing armamentarium of antibiotics active against gram-positive pathogens.

### Fusobacterium nucleatum reduces METTL3-mediated mA modification and contributes to colorectal cancer metastasis [^112AzcHw]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Although the NF-κB pathway was activated by F. nucleatum, similar to a previous report, we observed that knockdown of NF-κB did not influence METTL3 expression (Supplementary Fig. 2e). Furthermore, we treated HCT116 cells with an inhibitor of NF-κB, BAY11–7082, and discovered that BAY11–7082 inhibited the activation of NF-κB signaling, but not reversed the F. nucleatum -induced downregulation of METTL3 (Supplementary Fig. 2f). Collectively, our data suggest that F. nucleatum activates YAP signaling by blocking the Hippo cascade, leading to reduced METTL3 levels in CRC cells.

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: a consensus from an international expert group [^111Jpnv9]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Enterococcus Species

If enterococci (especially Enterococcus faecalis) are sensitive to ampicillin or amoxicillin, this should be the initial agent of choice, with up to a week intravenous therapy followed by oral amoxicillin.

For ampicillin-resistant enterococci, vancomycin and daptomycin are the first choices. Resistance to vancomycin is increasing (vancomycin-resistant enterococci). Apart from daptomycin or oral linezolid, often no other alternative options are available. Pristinamycin may be considered for treatment of E. faecalis, although evidence supporting this is limited for enterococcal implant-related infections.,

IV fosfomycin has extensive tissue penetration in inflamed tissue and bone. In an experimental model of foreign-body infection, the combination of fosfomycin and gentamicin showed good biofilm activity against E. faecalis. Further studies are needed before IV fosfomycin can be recommended as a standard therapy in enterococcal FRI, although it may be considered in selected cases. No safety data exist on long-term oral administration of fosfomycin. This route of administration is therefore not recommended for bone and joint infections.

Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection (cSSSI) Trials in Adults

The emergence of daptomycin non-susceptible isolates occurred in 2 infected patients across the set of Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of cSSSI in adult patients. In one case, a non-susceptible S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a Phase 2 trial who received daptomycin at less than the protocol-specified dose for the initial 5 days of therapy. In the second case, a non-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from a patient with an infected chronic decubitus ulcer who was enrolled in a salvage trial.

### Clinical experience with daptomycin for the treatment of patients with documented gram-positive septic arthritis [^116EQRN3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Septic arthritis is considered a rheumatologic emergency that can lead to joint destruction and long-term impairment of joint function. Daptomycin is bactericidal in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus, the primary pathogen associated with septic arthritis.

Objective

To describe the use of daptomycin in patients with septic arthritis.

Methods

Data were collected as part of the Cubicin Outcomes Registry and Experience (CORE) program, a retrospective, observational, multicenter study, to describe the clinical use of daptomycin. Efficacy at the end of daptomycin therapy was determined by each center's investigator(s) as cure, improved, failure, or nonevaluable. Patients who had a diagnosis of septic arthritis, excluding concomitant osteomyelitis, as well as a positive culture by needle aspirate or deep tissue biopsy, were selected from the combined 2005 and 2006 CORE database.

Results

Twenty-two patients were included in this analysis. S. aureus was the most common pathogen isolated, with the majority resistant to methicillin. All patients received an antibiotic prior to daptomycin; in 7 patients, at least one of the prior antibiotics was continued with daptomycin. Almost two-thirds of patients received an antibiotic with daptomycin; rifampin was the most common. The median final dose and duration of daptomycin therapy were 5 mg/kg (range 3–6.3) and 22 days (range 3–52), respectively. Eighty-two percent of patients received daptomycin while admitted to a hospital; however, 68% received at least part of their daptomycin therapy as an outpatient. The outcomes of cure or improved were reported in 41% and 50% of the patients, respectively. Two adverse events were reported; neither was considered to be related to daptomycin.

Conclusions

Daptomycin appeared to be effective when used as part of a treatment regimen for septic arthritis. These results require verification via a prospective clinical trial.

### Antibiotic therapy in necrotizing soft tissue infections: a narrative review of the greater paris SURFAST consortium [^116EW6b4]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Key concepts

Intravenous antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of medical management of NSTIs and must be combined with early surgical debridement of all infected tissue.
Antibiotic therapy should be initiated without delay upon suspicion of NSTIs without waiting for surgical debridement or intraoperative samples.
The initial empiric antibiotic regimen should be broad-spectrum, targeting gram-positive (including streptococci and staphylococci), anaerobic bacteria and, depending on the location of the NSTI, gram-negative bacteria including Enterobacterales.
Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is often involved in NSTIs, and its toxin-mediated virulence warrants the early addition of an antibiotic with anti-toxin activity when GAS infection is suspected or confirmed by early microbiological findings. We recommend a combination of β-lactam and anti-toxin antibiotics for the first 48–72 h of treatment. Linezolid is non-inferior to clindamycin as adjunctive therapy for invasive GAS infection. To date, there is no evidence supporting the use of daptomycin or vancomycin as antitoxin agents.
The high incidence of septic shock at presentation (over 50% of cases) combined with the extensive tissue necrosis at the site of infection leads to significant pharmacokinetic alterations such as increased volume of distribution, hypoalbuminemia and impaired tissue diffusion in the necrosis. Therefore, we favor (i) high-dose antibiotic regimens, (ii) prolonged β-lactam infusion (extended or continuous) and (iii) therapeutic drug monitoring to optimize efficacy.
Aminoglycosides may be added to the antibiotic therapy of patients with sepsis/septic shock to broaden its spectrum. The choice of drug (e.g. amikacin or gentamicin) should be based on local epidemiology and the targeted pathogens (i.e. Gram-negative versus Gram-positive).
Although no studies have specifically addressed this issue in NSTIs, it seems safe to recommend antibiotic de-escalation based on the site of infection, blood cultures and/or per operative sample cultures.
Antibiotic treatment until clinical improvement, including apyrexia, and for 48–72 h after the last surgical debridement is likely to be sufficient.

### Daptomycin plus fosfomycin versus daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis: a randomized clinical trial [^1113EZjG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Primary endpoint.

Subgroup analyses suggested that patients aged < 73 years and those with a Pitt score > 1 could particularly benefit from receiving the combination of daptomycin plus fosfomycin to achieve treatment success at TOC. No differences were observed in patients with or without endocarditis (Figure 2).

The results for secondary endpoints are shown in Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 3. At day 3 of follow-up, daptomycin plus fosfomycin was significantly associated with lower rates of positive blood cultures than daptomycin alone (2 of 74 patients [2.7%] vs 15 of 81 [18.5%], respectively). At day 7, 0 of 74 patients (0%) who received daptomycin plus fosfomycin vs 5 of 81 patients (6.2%) who received daptomycin alone had persistent bacteremia. Recurrent bacteremia from EOT to the TOC visit occurred in 0 of 74 (0%) patients receiving daptomycin plus fosfomycin vs 4 of 81 (3.7%) who received daptomycin alone. The final microbiological evaluation at TOC found that no patient treated with daptomycin plus fosfomycin had microbiological failure compared with 9 patients treated with daptomycin alone, among whom bacteremia was considered persistent in 5, and recurrent in 4 patients (P = 0.003).

Development of resistance to daptomycin during treatment was documented in 1 patient with persistent bacteremia in the daptomycin alone group; the minimum inhibitory concentration increased from 0.5 mg/L to 2 mg/L. Among the 9 patients with microbiological failure, 6 had consecutive isolates available for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing. All pairs of isolates obtained from the same patient showed the same band pattern, and so microbiological failure was considered as a relapse.

Complicated bacteremia at TOC was observed in 12 of 74 patients (16.2%) who had received daptomycin plus fosfomycin and in 26 of 81 (32.1%) who had received daptomycin alone (relative risk, 0.51 [95% CI,.28–.94]; χ² test P = 0.022). No significant differences in overall mortality were observed at TOC between patients receiving daptomycin plus fosfomycin and those receiving daptomycin alone (24.3% vs 27.2%; p = 0.687).
