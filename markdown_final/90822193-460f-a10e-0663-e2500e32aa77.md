## Question

Andexanet reversal of factor Xa inhibitor-associated ICH

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about andexanet alfa for reversal of factor Xa inhibitor–associated intracranial hemorrhage, including its efficacy, safety, comparison with 4-factor PCC, guideline positioning, and practical implementation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and why reversal matters. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics. Next, I will appraise the pivotal efficacy data from ANNEXA-4 and ANNEXA-I. After that, I need to examine safety signals, especially thrombotic events. Then, I will compare andexanet with 4-factor PCC using randomized and observational data. I should confirm guideline recommendations and weigh cost and access. Finally, I will translate this into a practical, time-sensitive algorithm and highlight uncertainties and future directions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and its stakes. Factor Xa inhibitor–associated ICH carries high early mortality and a substantial risk of hematoma expansion, which is tightly linked to worse outcomes; this is why rapid, effective reversal is prioritized in hyperacute care pathways [^8ce199a5] [^a9957d50]. Historically, nonspecific options like 4-factor PCC were used off-label, but the availability of a specific reversal agent changes the calculus, though I need to ensure we do not overstate benefits without data [^8ce199a5].

> I will now examine the mechanism to ensure biological plausibility. Andexanet alfa is a recombinant, enzymatically inactive factor Xa decoy that binds factor Xa inhibitors and restores thrombin generation; clinically, it produces a rapid and profound reduction in anti–factor Xa activity, typically around 90–95% within minutes, which should translate into improved hemostasis if sustained, though I should confirm durability and correlate with clinical outcomes [^65c6c9c0] [^234418f4] [^3fdf1018].

> Next, I should review the pivotal efficacy evidence. In ANNEXA-4, a prospective single-arm study of 352 patients with major bleeding, 82% achieved excellent or good hemostasis at 12 hours, with 79% in the ICH subgroup, and median anti–factor Xa activity fell by about 92–94% depending on the agent. However, without a control arm, I must be cautious about attribution and generalizability [^65c6c9c0] [^a95d7053]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the randomized ANNEXA-I trial in 530 patients with FXa inhibitor–associated ICH showed superior hemostatic efficacy with andexanet versus usual care (mostly PCC), with 67.0% vs 53.1% meeting the composite hemostasis endpoint and a 94.5% vs 26.9% reduction in anti–factor Xa activity, confirming a clinically meaningful pharmacodynamic and hemostatic effect [^b5075857] [^745dd246].

> Wait, let me verify the safety profile because efficacy without safety context is insufficient. Across ANNEXA-4 and ANNEXA-I, thrombotic events occurred in roughly 10% of patients, with ischemic stroke comprising a substantial fraction, and the randomized ANNEXA-I specifically showed a higher thrombotic event rate with andexanet than usual care (10.3% vs 5.6%), including more ischemic strokes; mortality was not significantly different in ANNEXA-I, underscoring that the net clinical benefit hinges on balancing hemostasis against thrombosis risk [^65c6c9c0] [^b5075857] [^745dd246]. I should double-check that this signal is consistent with meta-analyses; yes, pooled analyses also show higher thrombotic events with andexanet versus comparators, reinforcing the need for careful patient selection and post-reversal thromboprophylaxis planning [^e3764af7] [^42e5b200].

> Now, I need to compare andexanet with 4-factor PCC, and I should confirm whether head-to-head randomized data exist. ANNEXA-I is the only RCT to date, and it establishes superiority of andexanet over usual care (predominantly PCC) for hemostatic efficacy, albeit with more thrombotic events; direct head-to-head RCTs versus PCC alone are still lacking, so indirect comparisons and meta-analyses must be interpreted cautiously [^b5075857] [^745dd246]. Observational propensity-weighted analyses suggest better hemostatic effectiveness and possibly lower mortality with andexanet versus PCC, but these are vulnerable to confounding and should be triangulated with RCT data and cost-effectiveness modeling before making definitive claims [^a8736664] [^5c962b9f] [^ab5ea4b8].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline positions to ensure alignment. The 2022 AHA/ASA guideline recommends considering andexanet alfa to reverse direct factor Xa inhibitors in spontaneous ICH, reflecting the ANNEXA-4 data and the anticipated RCT confirmation, which materialized with ANNEXA-I. The European Stroke Organisation similarly recommends andexanet when available for apixaban or rivaroxaban–associated ICH, acknowledging the evidence base and the need to balance benefits and risks [^a332887f] [^8ce199a5] [^9cab7dfc]. More recent ESO/EANS guidance refines use to patients within 15 hours of the last dose or with proven anti–factor Xa activity above 100 ng/mL and within 12 hours of symptom onset, which operationalizes selection and timing in practice [^3f298039].

> I need to check cost and access because these materially influence bedside decisions. Andexanet is substantially more expensive than 4-factor PCC, with estimates often in the $20,000–$50,000 range per treatment, and availability varies by region; this cost differential, coupled with the thrombotic risk signal, means that some centers still default to PCC, particularly when andexanet is unavailable or when the bleeding risk is deemed manageable with nonspecific reversal, though emerging data may shift this balance in favor of andexanet in selected patients [^ab5ea4b8] [^db700241] [^e3764af7]. But wait, what if the patient is unstable and time to reversal is the critical determinant? Delays to hemostatic therapy are associated with worse outcomes, so systems that slow andexanet administration could negate benefits; operational readiness and protocolized pathways are essential [^5fc49f89].

> Let me translate this into a practical approach, and I should confirm dosing and timing. For suspected FXa inhibitor–associated ICH, obtain rapid confirmation of anticoagulant use and last dose, initiate strict blood pressure control, and give andexanet as soon as feasible if within the therapeutic window and the patient is a candidate; dosing is low- or high-dose based on agent and time since last dose, typically a bolus followed by a 2-hour infusion, with the goal of administration well within 6 hours of onset when possible to mitigate hematoma expansion risk [^8ce199a5] [^65c6c9c0] [^b5075857]. I should confirm that anti–factor Xa activity reduction correlates with hemostasis; in ICH subgroups, greater anti–factor Xa reduction modestly predicts hemostatic success, supporting the pharmacodynamic rationale for timely therapy [^65c6c9c0] [^0f0c24f9].

> Next, I should review post-reversal management to mitigate thrombotic risk. Hold anticoagulation and reassess thrombotic risk daily; consider pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis as soon as bleeding risk permits, and plan resumption of anticoagulation individualized to the indication, bleeding severity, and timing, recognizing that early re-anticoagulation may be feasible in selected patients after neurosurgical consultation and repeat imaging stability, though evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized [^2834f29f] [^8ce199a5]. I need to ensure we monitor for thrombotic events in the first 5–7 days, when the risk appears highest, and maintain a low threshold to evaluate new neurologic deficits or ischemic symptoms [^b5075857] [^65c6c9c0].

> But wait, what about special situations and uncertainties. Edoxaban and betrixaban are not FDA-labeled for andexanet, though mechanistic and limited clinical data suggest activity; use should be individualized and ideally guided by anti–factor Xa levels when available, acknowledging the off-label status and the weaker evidence base [^65dd88b6] [^234418f4]. I should also confirm that andexanet can cause heparin resistance due to anti–factor Xa assay interference; avoid concurrent heparin when possible or interpret labs cautiously if heparin is necessary, and communicate with the procedural team if interventions are planned [^11928f3b]. Finally, I need to ensure we counsel that while hemostatic efficacy is improved, functional outcomes and mortality may not necessarily improve in all patients, reinforcing the need for comprehensive ICH care bundles and early neurocritical care involvement [^b5075857] [^a9957d50].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. Andexanet alfa is the first specific reversal agent for apixaban and rivaroxaban–associated ICH and, in the ANNEXA-I randomized trial, improved hemostatic efficacy versus usual care at the cost of more thrombotic events; guidelines endorse its consideration in appropriate patients, but cost, access, and patient selection must be weighed carefully, and systems should be built to deliver it rapidly alongside aggressive blood pressure control and structured post-reversal thrombosis prevention plans [^b5075857] [^a332887f] [^9cab7dfc] [^3f298039].

Andexanet alfa is the **specific reversal agent** for factor Xa inhibitor–associated intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), providing rapid, sustained reversal of anti-Xa activity and superior hemostatic efficacy versus usual care (primarily PCC) in the ANNEXA-I RCT [^b5075857] [^745dd246]. It reduces hematoma expansion [^0b8ecf16] but increases **thrombotic events** (notably ischemic stroke) [^b5075857], with no mortality benefit in ANNEXA-I [^b5075857]. Current guidelines recommend andexanet for life-threatening FXa inhibitor–associated ICH when available [^a332887f] [^9cab7dfc], balancing hemostatic benefit against thrombotic risk and cost [^ab5ea4b8]. PCC remains an alternative when andexanet is unavailable or contraindicated [^8ce199a5] [^3f298039].

---

## Mechanism of action

Andexanet is a **recombinant, inactive factor Xa decoy** that binds and sequesters factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, enoxaparin), restoring thrombin generation and hemostasis [^9e11ea75] [^a586c62d]. It produces a rapid (> 90%) reduction in anti-Xa activity within minutes, with a half-life of ~1 hour, necessitating a bolus plus 2-hour infusion to maintain reversal [^65c6c9c0] [^234418f4].

---

## Clinical evidence

### ANNEXA-4 trial

- **Design**: Prospective, single-arm, multicenter study of 352 patients with acute major bleeding within 18 hours of FXa inhibitor use [^65c6c9c0].
- **Efficacy**: Excellent/good hemostasis at 12 hours in 82% overall; 79% in ICH subgroup [^a95d7053].
- **Safety**: 30-day mortality 14%; thrombotic events 10% (4% ischemic stroke) [^65c6c9c0].

---

### ANNEXA-I trial

- **Design**: Randomized, open-label trial of 530 patients with FXa inhibitor–associated ICH; andexanet vs usual care (primarily PCC) [^b5075857].
- **Efficacy**: Superior hemostatic efficacy (67.0% vs 53.1%; adjusted difference 13.4%; P = 0.003) [^b5075857].
- **Safety**: Higher thrombotic events (10.3% vs 5.6%; P = 0.048), especially ischemic stroke (6.5% vs 1.5%); no mortality difference (23% vs 21%; P = 0.51) [^b5075857].

---

## Comparative effectiveness with PCC

Observational and meta-analytic data suggest andexanet achieves higher hemostatic efficacy than PCC but at the cost of **more thrombotic events** and substantially higher cost (~ $25,000–$50,000 vs ~ $5,000–$10,000) [^a8736664] [^42e5b200] [^ab5ea4b8]. Head-to-head RCTs are limited; ANNEXA-I's usual-care arm was predominantly PCC, but direct comparisons remain sparse [^b5075857].

---

## Clinical guidelines

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| AHA/ASA 2022 | Consider andexanet for direct FXa inhibitor–associated spontaneous ICH [^a332887f] |
| ESO 2019 | Use andexanet for ICH on rivaroxaban/apixaban if available [^9cab7dfc] |
| ESO/EANS 2025 | Consider andexanet within 15 hours of last dose or anti-Xa > 100 ng/mL and within 12 hours of symptom onset to reduce hematoma expansion [^3f298039] |

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Thrombotic risk**: Higher ischemic stroke rates mandate careful selection and post-reversal anticoagulation planning [^b5075857].
- **Cost**: Significantly higher than PCC, limiting access and raising cost-effectiveness questions [^ab5ea4b8].
- **Evidence gaps**: Long-term functional outcomes and mortality benefits remain unproven; ongoing research is needed [^37bdbe13].

---

## Practical clinical implications

- **Patient selection**: Use in life-threatening FXa inhibitor–associated ICH, especially with large hematomas or high anti-Xa activity [^3f298039].
- **Timing**: Early administration (ideally within 6–12 hours) maximizes hemostatic benefit [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for thrombotic events and plan anticoagulation resumption cautiously [^b5075857].
- **Alternatives**: Use PCC when andexanet is unavailable or contraindicated [^8ce199a5] [^3f298039].

---

Andexanet alfa is the **specific reversal agent** for FXa inhibitor–associated ICH, offering superior hemostatic efficacy at the expense of increased thrombotic events and cost. It is recommended by guidelines for life-threatening cases, with PCC as an alternative when andexanet is not available [^a332887f] [^9cab7dfc] [^3f298039].

### Efficacy and safety of andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitor-associated intracranial haemorrhage [^a3d578fa]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Current international guidelines suggest andexanet alfa (AA) for the management of factor Xa inhibitor-associated intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). However, those recommendations are based on low-quality evidence and there is uncertainty regarding the net clinical benefit of AA.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis including available randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies that investigated efficacy and safety of AA compared with usual care for the treatment of factor Xa inhibitor-associated ICH. Good haemostatic efficacy, defined as haematoma expansion of ≤ 35%or ≤ 6mL, was the primary outcome. Secondary efficacy outcomes were excellent haemostatic efficacy (≤ 20% haematoma expansion) and good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale scores 0–3) at follow-up, while safety outcomes were mortality and thrombotic events at follow-up.

Results

Eighteen studies (1 RCT) were included comprising a total of 1567 patients treated with AA versus 1969 patients receiving usual care. AA was associated with a higher likelihood of good haemostatic efficacy (RR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.26) compared with usual care, while excellent haemostatic efficacy (RR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.85 to 1.26) and good functional outcome (RR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.53 to 1.62) were similar between the two groups. Regarding safety outcomes, similar rates of mortality (RR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.56 to 1.04) and thrombotic events (RR = 1.20; 95% CI = 0.81 to 1.78) were documented.

Conclusions

The present meta-analysis suggests AA is associated with improved haemostatic efficacy compared with usual care, with no significant differences observed in functional and safety outcomes. These findings indicate that AA may have a role in the management of factor Xa inhibitor-associated ICH, although further high-quality studies are needed to better define its net clinical benefit.

### Modeling the clinical implications of andexanet alfa in factor Xa inhibitor-associated intracerebral hemorrhage [^ab5ea4b8]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Andexanet alfa was recently approved as a reversal agent for the factor Xa inhibitors (FXais) apixaban and rivaroxaban, but its impact on long-term outcomes in FXai-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is unknown. We aimed to explore potential clinical implications of andexanet alfa in FXai-associated ICH in this simulation study.

Methods

We simulated potential downstream implications of andexanet alfa across a range of possible hemostatic effects using data from a single center that treats FXai-associated ICH with prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). We determined baseline probabilities of inadequate hemostasis across patients taking FXai and those not taking FXai via multivariable regression models and then determined the probabilities of unfavorable 3-month outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 4–6) using models comprising established predictors and each patient's calculated probability of inadequate hemostasis. We applied bootstrapping with model parameters from this derivation cohort to simulate a range of hemostatic improvements and corresponding outcomes and then calculated absolute risk reduction (relative to PCC) and projected number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent 1 unfavorable outcome.

Results

Training models using real-world patients (n = 603 total, 55 on FXai) had good accuracy in predicting inadequate hemostasis (area under the curve [AUC] 0.78) and unfavorable outcome (AUC 0.78). Inadequate hemostasis was strongly associated with unfavorable outcome (odds ratio 4.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0–9.9) and occurred in 11.4% of patients taking FXai. Across simulated patients taking FXai comparable to those in A Study in Participants With Andexanet Alfa, a Novel Antidote to the Anticoagulation Effects of Factor Xa Inhibitors (ANNEXA-4) study, predicted absolute risk reduction of unfavorable outcome was 4.9% (95% CI 1.3%-7.8%) when the probability of inadequate hemostasis was reduced by 33% and 7.4% (95% CI 2.0%-11.9%) at 50% reduction, translating to projected NNT of 21 (cumulative cost $519,750) and 14 ($346,500), respectively.

Discussion

Even optimistic simulated hemostatic effects suggest that the costs and potential benefits of andexanet alfa should be carefully considered. Placebo-controlled randomized trials are needed before its use can definitively be recommended.

### Hemostatic efficacy and anti-FXa (factor Xa) reversal with andexanet alfa in intracranial hemorrhage: ANNEXA-4 substudy [^a95d7053]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Andexanet alfa is a recombinant modified human FXa (factor Xa) developed to reverse FXa inhibition from anticoagulants. Hemostatic efficacy and reversal of anti-FXa activity with andexanet were assessed in patients from the ANNEXA-4 study (Andexanet Alfa, a Novel Antidote to the Anticoagulation Effects of FXa Inhibitors) with intracranial hemorrhage (ICrH).

Methods

ANNEXA-4 was a single-arm study evaluating andexanet in patients presenting with major bleeding ≤ 18 hours after taking an FXa inhibitor. Patients received a bolus plus 2-hour infusion of andexanet. Brain imaging in patients with ICrH was performed at baseline and at 1 and 12 hours postandexanet infusion. Coprimary efficacy outcomes were change in anti-FXa activity and hemostatic efficacy at 12 hours (excellent/good efficacy defined as ≤ 35% increase in hemorrhage volume/thickness). Safety outcomes included occurrence of thrombotic events and death at 30 days.

Results

A total of 227 patients with ICrH were included in the safety population (51.5% male; mean age 79.3 years) and 171 in the efficacy population (99 spontaneous and 72 traumatic bleeds). In efficacy evaluable patients, excellent/good hemostasis 12 hours postandexanet occurred in 77 out of 98 (78.6%) and in 58 out of 70 (82.9%) patients with spontaneous and traumatic bleeding, respectively. In the subanalysis by FXa inhibitor treatment group in the efficacy population, median of percent change in anti-FXa from baseline to nadir showed a decrease of 93.8% for apixaban-treated patients (n = 99) and by 92.6% for rivaroxaban-treated patients (n = 59). Within 30 days, death occurred in 34 out of 227 (15.0%) patients and thrombotic events occurred in 21 out of 227 (9.3%) patients (safety population).

Conclusions

Andexanet reduced anti-FXa activity in FXa inhibitor-treated patients with ICrH, with a high rate of hemostatic efficacy. Andexanet may substantially benefit patients with ICrH, the most serious complication of anticoagulation.

### Final study report of andexanet alfa for major bleeding with factor Xa inhibitors [^234418f4]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Andexanet alfa is a modified recombinant inactive factor Xa (FXa) designed to reverse FXa inhibitors. ANNEXA-4 (Andexanet Alfa, a Novel Antidote to the Anticoagulation Effects of Factor Xa Inhibitors) was a multicenter, prospective, phase-3b/4, single-group cohort study that evaluated andexanet alfa in patients with acute major bleeding. The results of the final analyses are presented.

Methods

Patients with acute major bleeding within 18 hours of FXa inhibitor administration were enrolled. Co-primary end points were anti-FXa activity change from baseline during andexanet alfa treatment and excellent or good hemostatic efficacy, defined by a scale used in previous reversal studies, at 12 hours. The efficacy population included patients with baseline anti-FXa activity levels above predefined thresholds (≥ 75 ng/mL for apixaban and rivaroxaban, ≥ 40 ng/mL for edoxaban, and ≥ 0.25 IU/mL for enoxaparin; reported in the same units used for calibrators) who were adjudicated as meeting major bleeding criteria (modified International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis definition). The safety population included all patients. Major bleeding criteria, hemostatic efficacy, thrombotic events (stratified by occurring before or after restart of either prophylactic [ie, a lower dose, for prevention rather than treatment] or full-dose oral anticoagulation), and deaths were assessed by an independent adjudication committee. Median endogenous thrombin potential at baseline and across the follow-up period was a secondary outcome.

Results

There were 479 patients enrolled (mean age, 78 years; 54% male; 86% White); 81% were anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation, and the median time was 11.4 hours since last dose, with 245 (51%) on apixaban, 176 (37%) on rivaroxaban, 36 (8%) on edoxaban, and 22 (5%) on enoxaparin. Bleeding was predominantly intracranial (n = 331 [69%]) or gastrointestinal (n = 109 [23%]). In evaluable apixaban patients (n = 172), median anti-FXa activity decreased from 146.9 ng/mL to 10.0 ng/mL (reduction, 93% [95% CI, 94–93]); in rivaroxaban patients (n = 132), it decreased from 214.6 ng/mL to 10.8 ng/mL (94% [95% CI, 95–93]); in edoxaban patients (n = 28), it decreased from 121.1 ng/mL to 24.4 ng/mL (71% [95% CI, 82–65); and in enoxaparin patients (n = 17), it decreased from 0.48 IU/mL to 0.11 IU/mL (75% [95% CI, 79–67]). Excellent or good hemostasis occurred in 274 of 342 evaluable patients (80% [95% CI, 75–84]). In the safety population, thrombotic events occurred in 50 (10%) patients; in 16 patients, these occurred during treatment with prophylactic anticoagulation that began after the bleeding event. No thrombotic episodes occurred after oral anticoagulation restart. Specific to certain populations, reduction of anti-FXa activity from baseline to nadir significantly predicted hemostatic efficacy in patients with intracranial hemorrhage (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.54–0.70]) and correlated with lower mortality in patients < 75 years of age (adjusted P = 0.022; unadjusted P = 0.003). Median endogenous thrombin potential was within the normal range by the end of andexanet alfa bolus through 24 hours for all FXa inhibitors.

Conclusions

In patients with major bleeding associated with the use of FXa inhibitors, treatment with andexanet alfa reduced anti-FXa activity and was associated with good or excellent hemostatic efficacy in 80% of patients.

### Full study report of andexanet alfa for bleeding associated with factor Xa inhibitors [^65c6c9c0]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Andexanet alfa is a modified recombinant inactive form of human factor Xa developed for reversal of factor Xa inhibitors.

Methods

We evaluated 352 patients who had acute major bleeding within 18 hours after administration of a factor Xa inhibitor. The patients received a bolus of andexanet, followed by a 2-hour infusion. The coprimary outcomes were the percent change in anti-factor Xa activity after andexanet treatment and the percentage of patients with excellent or good hemostatic efficacy at 12 hours after the end of the infusion, with hemostatic efficacy adjudicated on the basis of prespecified criteria. Efficacy was assessed in the subgroup of patients with confirmed major bleeding and baseline anti-factor Xa activity of at least 75 ng per milliliter (or ≥ 0.25 IU per milliliter for those receiving enoxaparin).

Results

Patients had a mean age of 77 years, and most had substantial cardiovascular disease. Bleeding was predominantly intracranial (in 227 patients [64%]) or gastrointestinal (in 90 patients [26%]). In patients who had received apixaban, the median anti-factor Xa activity decreased from 149.7 ng per milliliter at baseline to 11.1 ng per milliliter after the andexanet bolus (92% reduction; 95% confidence interval [CI] 91 to 93); in patients who had received rivaroxaban, the median value decreased from 211.8 ng per milliliter to 14.2 ng per milliliter (92% reduction; 95% CI, 88 to 94). Excellent or good hemostasis occurred in 204 of 249 patients (82%) who could be evaluated. Within 30 days, death occurred in 49 patients (14%) and a thrombotic event in 34 (10%). Reduction in anti-factor Xa activity was not predictive of hemostatic efficacy overall but was modestly predictive in patients with intracranial hemorrhage.

Conclusions

In patients with acute major bleeding associated with the use of a factor Xa inhibitor, treatment with andexanet markedly reduced anti-factor Xa activity, and 82% of patients had excellent or good hemostatic efficacy at 12 hours, as adjudicated according to prespecified criteria.

### Andexanet for factor Xa inhibitor-associated acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^b5075857]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage who are receiving factor Xa inhibitors have a risk of hematoma expansion. The effect of andexanet alfa, an agent that reverses the effects of factor Xa inhibitors, on hematoma volume expansion has not been well studied.

Methods

We randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients who had taken factor Xa inhibitors within 15 hours before having an acute intracerebral hemorrhage to receive andexanet or usual care. The primary end point was hemostatic efficacy, defined by expansion of the hematoma volume by 35% or less at 12 hours after baseline, an increase in the score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale of less than 7 points (scores range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating worse neurologic deficit) at 12 hours, and no receipt of rescue therapy between 3 hours and 12 hours. Safety end points were thrombotic events and death.

Results

A total of 263 patients were assigned to receive andexanet, and 267 to receive usual care. Efficacy was assessed in an interim analysis that included 452 patients, and safety was analyzed in all 530 enrolled patients. Atrial fibrillation was the most common indication for factor Xa inhibitors. Of the patients receiving usual care, 85.5% received prothrombin complex concentrate. Hemostatic efficacy was achieved in 150 of 224 patients (67.0%) receiving andexanet and in 121 of 228 (53.1%) receiving usual care (adjusted difference, 13.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.6 to 22.2; P = 0.003). The median reduction from baseline to the 1-to-2-hour nadir in anti-factor Xa activity was 94.5% with andexanet and 26.9% with usual care (P < 0.001). Thrombotic events occurred in 27 of 263 patients (10.3%) receiving andexanet and in 15 of 267 (5.6%) receiving usual care (difference, 4.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.1 to 9.2; P = 0.048); ischemic stroke occurred in 17 patients (6.5%) and 4 patients (1.5%), respectively. There were no appreciable differences between the groups in the score on the modified Rankin scale or in death within 30 days.

Conclusions

Among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage who were receiving factor Xa inhibitors, andexanet resulted in better control of hematoma expansion than usual care but was associated with thrombotic events, including ischemic stroke.

### Efficacy and safety of andexanet alfa versus four factor prothrombin complex concentrate for emergent reversal of factor Xa inhibitor associated intracranial hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^42e5b200]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Factor Xa inhibitors (FXaI) are increasingly used for anticoagulation therapy, yet their association with intracranial hemorrhage poses a significant challenge. Although andexanet alfa (AA) and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) have shown promise in reversing FXaI effects, their comparative efficacy and safety remain uncertain. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a literature search on electronic databases to obtain the relevant studies until May 16, 2024. Our primary outcomes were successful anticoagulation reversal, overall mortality (including 30-day and in-hospital mortality), and thromboembolic events. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital and intensive care unit stay and hematoma volume expansion. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. We included 16 eligible studies with a total of 2,977 patients. A statistically significant improvement in hemostatic efficacy rates was in favor of the AA group (risk ratio [RR] 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.20, P = 0.02). Lower overall mortality rates were found in the AA group (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51–0.88, P = 0.004). However, no difference was found in 30-day mortality rates (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.58–1.16, P = 0.26). In terms of thromboembolic events, more events were found in the AA group (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.01–2.15, P = 0.046). AA was associated with a longer duration of hospital stay compared to 4F-PCC (mean difference [MD] 0.64, 95% CI 0.07–1.22, P = 0.03). Neither a significant difference in length of intensive care unit stay (MD 0.25, 95% CI-0.36 to 0.86, P = 0.41) nor a significant difference in hematoma volume expansion was reported (MD-0.89, 95% CI-3.11 to 1.34, P = 0.435). Our results suggest that AA is superior to 4F-PCC in enhancing the hemostatic efficacy and reducing the overall and in-hospital mortality rates. More thromboembolic events are thought to be associated with the use of AA. However, more studies are required to validate whether the better results of AA in improving hemostatic efficacy are enough to make up for their higher cost and their possible risk of thromboembolic events.

### Hemostatic efficacy and anti-FXa (factor Xa) reversal with andexanet alfa in intracranial hemorrhage: ANNEXA-4 substudy [^2834f29f]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Given that the anticoagulant reversal effect of andexanet begins to wane once treatment is completed, the prospect of rebleeding presents a potential concern, especially in patients with higher baseline anti-FXa activity. Although it is appreciated that the risk of hematoma expansion decreases over time, the presence of therapeutic FXa inhibition likely prolongs the duration of this risk (though the magnitude of the effect is not precisely known). Nevertheless, the observation that volume expansion occurred in only 2 of 90 patients after the 1-hour postandexanet scan is reassuring.

The frequency of thrombotic events among all ICrH was similar to the 30-day thrombotic rate observed in the overall ANNEXA-4 population as well as in recent studies of bleeding occurring during FXa inhibitor treatment. – The observed rate is not unexpected given the abrupt reversal of chronic anticoagulation, the high background thrombotic risk, and the physical immobility resulting from a substantial neurological insult. Many patients received reanticoagulation, with a median time to initiation of any anticoagulant of 3 days. Our data suggest that early resumption of anticoagulation to prevent thrombotic events may be performed safely in this population, albeit in selected patients.

In our study, mortality within 30 days was 18.8% in patients with spontaneous ICrH, 10.1% in traumatic ICrH, and 15.0% overall. In pivotal stroke prevention studies of oral FXa inhibitors in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, 30-day mortality rates of 27% to 48% in patients with ICrH have been reported, although the patients in these studies were unselected and ANNEXA-4 excluded patients with the most severe bleeds. In patients with traumatic ICrH, the mortality rate (10.1%) is not inconsistent with existing literature. That said, the patients evaluated in these analyses consisted of all-comers populations, with few selection criteria around baseline characteristics, extent of FXa inhibition, and severity. As with hemostatic efficacy, a properly controlled evaluation of andexanet that accounts for these factors would likely yield a meaningful understanding of mortality in this population.

### Hemostatic efficacy and anti-FXa (factor Xa) reversal with andexanet alfa in intracranial hemorrhage: ANNEXA-4 substudy [^ee82657a]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Because of the recent adoption of direct FXa inhibitors, the literature describing the natural history of ICrH in patients treated with this class of anticoagulants remains modest. In a mainly nonanticoagulated population, the risk of hematoma expansion of an intracerebral bleed has been reported to be 12% to 32%, depending on definition. Treatment with a vitamin K antagonist markedly augments this risk, with as much as a 60% incidence of hematoma expansion at 24 hours in a population of patients with intracerebral bleeding. In patients taking FXa inhibitors, the risk of expansion is less well characterized. However, preliminary reports have indicated a risk of 25% to 40% in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. – In patients with traumatic brain injury, the risk of hematoma expansion is reported to be 16% to 42%. – It is difficult, however, to interpret these findings given differences in the definition, nature (contusion versus bleed), involved compartments, and assessment of injury in the traumatic setting. In the ANNEXA-4 efficacy population, using poor/none hemostatic efficacy as a surrogate for hematoma expansion, the risk of expansion was 21% and 17% in patients with spontaneous and traumatic ICrH, respectively. These results should be considered within the context of the relative severity of bleeding in the respective study cohorts; in particular, differences between the respective studies for various parameters (eg, age, hematoma size, intraventricular involvement, GCS, time of symptom onset) could have resulted in differences in expansion rates. Any meaningful comparison between andexanet and usual care must take these factors into account.

### Direct oral anticoagulant reversal in intracranial hemorrhage… [^1341d65b]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

In a meta-analysis of 32 studies including 1832 patients with ICH, 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate, andexanet alfa, and idarucizumab were associated with a successful anticoagulation reversal in 77%, 75%, and 82% of patients, respectively; all-cause mortality rates were 26%, 24%, and 11%, respectively; and thromboembolic event rates were 8%, 14%, and 5%, respectively. A direct retrospective comparison of 4F-PCC with AA showed no differences in successful anticoagulation reversal, all-cause mortality, or thromboembolic events. Meaning In this study, factor Xa inhibitor reversal agents for ICH had similar safety profiles and outcomes, but the lack of head-to-head comparison warrants cautious interpretation. In 2018, andexanet alfa was approved to reverse factor Xa inhibitors.

13 While the safety data from these landmark trials were promising, head-to-head trials have not compared the safety and outcomes of idarucizumab or andexanet alfa with traditional nonspecific reversal agents. Such comparisons are limited to data generated from case series and cohort studies. This systematic review summarizes the safety and anticoagulation reversal success of non-specific and targeted DOAC reversal agents in patients with DOAC-related ICH. AA received FDA approval in 2018. ANNEXA-4 was a multicentered, prospective study13 that enrolled 171 patients with FXaI-associated ICH and reported an anticoagulation reversal rate of
80. 7%, a mortality rate of 14%, and a thromboembolic complication rate of 10%. An ongoing randomized clinical trial compares AA with usual care in patients with acute ICH associated with FXaI.

Enrolling since January 2019, this study is expected to complete in 2023 and enroll approximately 900 participants. The primary outcome includes hemostatic efficacy at 12 hours. The secondary outcome comprises a change in baseline anti–factor Xa activity. This trial will provide more robust evidence of the relative benefit of the 2 DOAC reversal strategies for ICH.

### Hemostatic efficacy and anti-FXa (factor Xa) reversal with andexanet alfa in intracranial hemorrhage: ANNEXA-4 substudy [^1d902161]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

For this substudy, the safety population consisted of all patients receiving any dose of andexanet. Patients were included in the efficacy population if they had a baseline anti-FXa activity of ≥ 75 ng/mL (≥ 0.25 IU/mL for enoxaparin) and had confirmed major bleeding at presentation, as determined by the adjudication committee. If the baseline anti-FXa activity was missing, the patient was excluded from the efficacy analysis. Percent change in anti-FXa activity was evaluated using a distribution-free 2-sided 95% CI for the median. Percentages of patients with excellent/good hemostasis were presented as 95% CIs calculated with the exact binomial test. In the subpopulation of patients with intracerebral/intraventricular bleeds, hemostasis and hematoma volume expansion were evaluated in the safety population to maximize sample size.

For the primary hemostatic efficacy analysis, missing values due to nonadministrative reasons were imputed as treatment failure, whereas those missing due to administrative reasons were excluded from the analysis. For postbaseline anti-FXa activity assessments, if either the end-of-bolus and end-of-infusion assessments were missing, nadir was set to the one available; if both were missing, the maximum change from baseline to nadir was replaced with zero. For the NIHSS, patients were only included in the 12-hour NIHSS evaluation if data were available at baseline and post-treatment (at 1 hour or 12 hours). If the 12-hour NIHSS was missing, the value was imputed with the 1-hour post-treatment NIHSS score, if available. If no postbaseline NIHSS score was available, the NIHSS score was treated as missing at 12 hours. For postbaseline GCS and modified Rankin Scale score, missing values were not imputed.

### Hemostatic efficacy and anti-FXa (factor Xa) reversal with andexanet alfa in intracranial hemorrhage: ANNEXA-4 substudy [^34e8d101]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present analysis describes the efficacy and safety of andexanet in ANNEXA-4 patients with ICrH, the most serious complication of anticoagulation. Consistent with results from the overall population, andexanet rapidly and potently decreased anti-FXa activity and resulted in effective hemostasis in 79% of patients with spontaneous ICrH and in 83% of patients with traumatic ICrH. These findings were in concert with observations that hematoma volumes and thicknesses were largely preserved over the 12 hours following andexanet treatment. Finally, the safety of andexanet, as exemplified by the 30-day rates of thrombotic events (9%) and mortality (15%), appears consistent with the bleed severity and acuteness of the study population.

Importantly, the interpretation of these data should be tempered by the study's single-arm, uncontrolled design. One cannot evaluate the clinical benefit of andexanet in the absence of a comparator. That said, a controlled clinical trial in patients with ICrH is ongoing and will provide additional insight (ANNEXA-I study; Unique identifier: NCT03661528). Furthermore, although all symptomatic ICrH bleeding (spontaneous or traumatic) is considered major bleeding by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, the trial enrollment favored smaller hemorrhages especially in trauma patients. Patients scheduled for surgery (involving any part of the body) within 12 hours were excluded from the study as surgery limits the ability to assess for hemostatic efficacy. Nevertheless, this analysis demonstrates that the efficacy and safety findings in patients with ICrH are similar to results for the overall population (including patients without ICrH) reported in the primary ANNEXA-4 article.

### Efficacy and safety of andexanet alfa versus four factor prothrombin complex concentrate for emergent reversal of factor Xa inhibitor associated intracranial hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c9c9d06e]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Before the approval of andexanet alfa (AA) in May 2018 by the FDA as a specific reversal agent for FXaI, the reliance on nonspecific agents, such as fresh frozen plasma, activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC), and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC), was a considerable viable option, although their efficacy was not well established. AA has received accelerated approval after the results of two phase III trials from the ANNEXA program, which demonstrated a significant decrease in anti-factor Xa activity from baseline. However, factors such as medication cost and safety concerns were considered limitations for the use of AA. It is estimated that the national average hospital reimbursement per patient will be exceeded by more than $7,500/hospitalization for up to 75% of patients who receive AA for oral FXaI reversal. Clinical outcome reviews associated with the therapy in clinical practice are necessary to determine whether the higher cost of AA therapy compared to 4F-PCC is justified by its greater effectiveness. These reviews should also investigate whether the choice of drug should be tailored based on risk factors for poor outcomes and hematoma expansion in patients experiencing major bleeding. There have been differing reports regarding the safety profiles of AA and 4F-PCC in reversing FXaI, particularly concerning mortality rates and thromboembolic events. However, these comparisons are restricted to data from cohort studies. ANNEXA-1 is the first randomized trial to assess the safety and efficacy of AA compared with usual care, mostly prothrombin complex concentrate in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. To the best of our knowledge, only one previous meta-analysis compared AA with 4F-PCC, in which all the included studies were limited to cohort studies and no significant difference was found between both groups. To overcome these limitations, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis, including the results of the ANNEXA-1 trial, to better guide clinical decision making and provide insights into the comparative efficacy and safety of AA and 4F-PCC in the emergent reversal of FXaI-associated ICH.

### Evaluation of oral factor Xa inhibitor-associated extracranial bleeding reversal with andexanet alfa [^a566b47c]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Reversal with andexanet alfa has not been compared to standard of care or alternative treatment options, such as 4‐factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F‐PCC), yet it has become the first‐line agent in many institutions and in national organization guidance documents. 13, 14, 15 Moreover, the cost of andexanet alfa currently exceeds the national average hospital reimbursement per patient in nearly 75% of patients in the United States. 16 Due to the limited clinical evidence and cost concerns, patient selection for andexanet alfa reversal requires a careful assessment of the patient's hemodynamic stability, time since last dose of FXa inhibitor, the location and severity of bleeding, and the potential effectiveness compared to the incidence of ischemic complications. Patient selection for andexanet alfa reversal in intracranial versus extracranial bleeding is based on different factors, as patient presentation is highly variable. Reversal with andexanet alfa for intracranial hemorrhage at our institutions has been previously described. 17, 18 In this study, we aimed to describe patient selection, clinical effectiveness, and safety of oral FXa inhibitor reversal with andexanet alfa in patients presenting with extracranial bleeding.

Mortality and Thromboembolic Events

Fourteen studies including 2,908 patients compared the safety of AA and 4F-PCC in terms of mortality rate. Death occurred in 243 of 1,384 and 385 of 1,524 patients treated with AA and 4F-PCC, respectively. There was a significant reduction in the overall mortality rate for AA versus 4F-PCC (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54–0.95, P = 0.02). However, this pooled effect was subject to uncertainty in estimation because of the presence of high heterogeneity between the studies (P = 0.002, I² = 61%) (Fig. 2 b). In attempt to resolve this heterogeneity and to ensure the robustness of our results, we conducted a subgroup analysis assessing 30-day mortality and in-hospital mortality individually. In the in-hospital mortality subgroup, lower mortality rates were found in the AA group (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45–0.99, P = 0.047). Significant heterogeneity was found in this subgroup (P = 0.009, I² = 63%). To resolve this heterogeneity, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in multiple scenarios, excluding one study in each scenario. Heterogeneity was best resolved by excluding the study by Pham et al. (P = 0.17, I² = 34%). After removing this study from the meta-analysis model, the results of the in-hospital mortality analysis were still in favor of the AA group (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43–0.81, P = 0.001), and the results of the overall mortality analysis were still in favor of the AA group (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51–0.88, P = 0.004) (Fig. 2 c). In the 30-day mortality subgroup, no significant difference was found between AA and 4F-PCC (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.58–1.16, P = 0.26). No heterogeneity was found between the studies in this subgroup (P = 0.18, I² = 34%). Twelve studies including 1,178 patients assessed the incidence of thromboembolic events, and more events were found in the AA group; however, the results were marginally significant (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.01–2.15, P = 0.046). No heterogeneity was found between the studies (P = 0.62, I² = 0%) (Fig. 2 d).

### Andexanet alfa for acute major bleeding associated with factor Xa inhibitors [^3fdf1018]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Andexanet alfa (andexanet) is a recombinant modified human factor Xa decoy protein that has been shown to reverse the inhibition of factor Xa in healthy volunteers.

Methods

In this multicenter, prospective, open-label, single-group study, we evaluated 67 patients who had acute major bleeding within 18 hours after the administration of a factor Xa inhibitor. The patients all received a bolus of andexanet followed by a 2-hour infusion of the drug. Patients were evaluated for changes in measures of anti-factor Xa activity and were assessed for clinical hemostatic efficacy during a 12-hour period. All the patients were subsequently followed for 30 days. The efficacy population of 47 patients had a baseline value for anti-factor Xa activity of at least 75 ng per milliliter (or ≥ 0.5 IU per milliliter for those receiving enoxaparin) and had confirmed bleeding severity at adjudication.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 77 years; most of the patients had substantial cardiovascular disease. Bleeding was predominantly gastrointestinal or intracranial. The mean (± SD) time from emergency department presentation to the administration of the andexanet bolus was 4.8 ± 1.8 hours. After the bolus administration, the median anti-factor Xa activity decreased by 89% (95% confidence interval [CI] 58 to 94) from baseline among patients receiving rivaroxaban and by 93% (95% CI, 87 to 94) among patients receiving apixaban. These levels remained similar during the 2-hour infusion. Four hours after the end of the infusion, there was a relative decrease from baseline of 39% in the measure of anti-factor Xa activity among patients receiving rivaroxaban and of 30% among those receiving apixaban. Twelve hours after the andexanet infusion, clinical hemostasis was adjudicated as excellent or good in 37 of 47 patients in the efficacy analysis (79%; 95% CI, 64 to 89). Thrombotic events occurred in 12 of 67 patients (18%) during the 30-day follow-up.

Conclusions

On the basis of a descriptive preliminary analysis, an initial bolus and subsequent 2-hour infusion of andexanet substantially reduced anti-factor Xa activity in patients with acute major bleeding associated with factor Xa inhibitors, with effective hemostasis occurring in 79%. (Funded by Portola Pharmaceuticals; ANNEXA-4 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02329327 .).

### Hemostatic efficacy and anti-FXa (factor Xa) reversal with andexanet alfa in intracranial hemorrhage: ANNEXA-4 substudy [^a586c62d]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

See related article, p

FXa (factor Xa) inhibitors have become widely used for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism, stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and management of patients with coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease. Large clinical trials have demonstrated that FXa inhibitors are as effective and safer than warfarin – and are now widely recommended by guidelines. Despite their superior safety, ≈0.3% to 0.5% of patients receiving FXa inhibitors suffer intracranial hemorrhage (ICrH) annually, – which is associated with 30-day mortality rates of 27% to 48%.

Andexanet alfa (US adopted name: coagulation factor Xa [recombinant] inactivated-zhzo) is a specific reversal agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding related to the oral FXa inhibitors apixaban and rivaroxaban. Andexanet is a modified, recombinant, enzymatically inactive form of FXa, which binds and sequesters FXa inhibitors, thereby neutralizing their anti-FXa activity. Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that administration of andexanet resulted in a median > 92% reduction from baseline in anti-FXa activity of apixaban and rivaroxaban, with a rapid onset of effect within minutes after the start of administration. This was associated with a similarly rapid increase in thrombin generation that persisted up to 22 hours after the completion of andexanet.

In the ANNEXA-4 study (Andexanet Alfa, a Novel Antidote to the Anticoagulation Effects of FXa Inhibitors), patients with acute major bleeding (ICrH and gastrointestinal bleeding primarily) received andexanet. In a recent report on 352 patients of all bleed types in the full study population, treatment was associated with substantial reductions from baseline in anti-FXa activity. Furthermore, 82% of patients were judged by independent adjudication to have effective hemostasis (80% in patients with ICrH and 85% in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding). The results presented herein describe detailed efficacy and safety data from ANNEXA-4 patients with spontaneous and traumatic ICrH. These findings are important in that they summarize the bleed subtype with the greatest enrollment in the study, as well as the most severe manifestation of acute major bleeding.

### Hemostatic efficacy and anti-FXa (factor Xa) reversal with andexanet alfa in intracranial hemorrhage: ANNEXA-4 substudy [^20bfb323]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Design

ANNEXA-4 was a prospective, open-label, single-arm study. Upon enrollment, andexanet was administered to all patients, with a low or high dose depending on the identity, amount, and timing of the last dose of FXa inhibitor. For patients with ICrH, a computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan was obtained within 2 hours before andexanet was initiated, and then at 1 hour and 12 hours after the end of treatment. Anatomic analysis of the hemorrhage (eg, volume, thickness, midline shift) using Quantomo software (Cybertrials, Inc, Calgary, Canada)was performed at a dedicated imaging core lab to support the assessment of hemostatic efficacy.

Blood samples were taken to measure anti-FXa activity and thrombin generation before and through 12 hours after andexanet administration. Analysis of blood samples (particularly with anti-FXa assays, which require specific methodology to properly analyze in the presence of andexanet) has been reported previously.

Outcomes

The coprimary end points of the study were (1) the percent change from baseline to the lowest level in anti-FXa activity measured between the start of andexanet treatment and 10 minutes after the end of the infusion (change from baseline to nadir) and (2) the proportion of patients who achieved excellent or good hemostatic efficacy at 12 hours after treatment, based on criteria established in Sarode et al(detailed in Table I in the) and assessed by an independent Endpoint Adjudication Committee. These criteria were used in the original trial because they facilitated the assessment of hemostasis of a variety of bleed types into a single metric. For patients with ICrH, a ≤ 20% increase in hematoma volume at both 1 and 12 hours after the end of andexanet treatment versus baseline was considered excellent hemostasis, whereas good hemostasis was defined as an increase of > 20% and ≤ 35% in hematoma volume at 12 hours compared with baseline. Patients with a > 35% increase in volume relative to baseline had poor/none hemostasis. Safety outcomes included mortality and occurrence of thrombotic events adjudicated by the Endpoint Adjudication Committee over 30 days.

National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), GCS, and modified Rankin Scale scores were assessed at baseline, 1 hour, 12 hours, and 30 days postandexanet treatment.

### Andexanet alfa versus four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for the reversal of apixaban-or rivaroxaban-associated intracranial hemorrhages [^2a400ddf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Existing research recommends either andexanet alfa (AA) or four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) as an antidote for major bleeding events due to apixaban or rivaroxaban. Currently, there is limited published research that directly compares the risks and benefits of the two agents in patients with oral factor Xa inhibitor related traumatic and spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages. Additional head-to-head data is needed to support favoring either AA or 4F-PCC when it comes to efficacy, safety, and cost.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted to assess patients admitted to a multi-center healthcare system and a stand-alone teaching hospital in central Florida from June 2016 to December 2020. Patients included in the study were at least 18 years of age, taking apixaban or rivaroxaban prior to admission, had radiographical evidence of an intracranial hemorrhage, and received either AA or 4F-PCC as a reversal agent. The primary outcome analyzed was the level of excellent hemostasis achieved, based on a standardized rating system for effective hemostasis defined by the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH), after administration of AA or 4F-PCC. Secondary outcomes analyzed included changes in the initial hemorrhage volume as reported on computed tomography (CT) scan and at 12 to 24 h post treatment, rate of thromboembolic events, rate of inpatient mortality, and total cost of treatment after AA or 4F-PCC administration.

Results

A total of 109 patients were included in the study with 47 in the AA group (43.1%) and 62 in the 4F-PCC group (56.9%). There were no statistically significant differences between AA and 4F-PCC in terms of the primary and secondary outcomes with the exception of total cost of treatment. The level of excellent hemostasis achieved after reversal administration of AA was seen in 27 patients (71.1%) and 41 patients (70.7%) after 4F-PCC administration (p = 1, p adjusted = 0.654 after controlling for age, ICH score, regional mass effect, and midline shift). There was no statistically significant difference in the median percentage change in hemorrhagic volume from baseline to 12–24 h after reversal treatment (0 [-0.17–0.24] vs. 0 [-0.021–0.29], p = 0.439, adjusted p = 0.601) in the AA and 4F-PCC groups, respectively. The total incidence of thromboembolic events (4 [8.5%] vs. 6 [9.7%], p = 1, adjusted p = 0.973) and rate of inpatient mortality was similar between the two groups (16 [34.0%] vs. 13 [21.0%], p = 0.134, adjusted p = 0.283). A statistically significant difference was observed with the total cost of reversal treatment: $23,602 for treatment with AA and $6692 for treatment with 4F-PCC.

Conclusions

No statistically significant differences were identified in primary or secondary outcomes between the two agents with the exception of total treatment cost. There is insufficient evidence based on this study to recommend AA over 4F-PCC for patients with intracranial hemorrhages associated with the use of apixaban or rivaroxaban.

### Evaluation of oral factor Xa inhibitor-associated extracranial bleeding reversal with andexanet alfa [^3f0a4c29]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A reversal agent for factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors, andexanet alfa, was Food and Drug Administration approved without extensive study of clinical effectiveness, due to an overwhelming demand for FXa inhibitor reversal. In this study, we aimed to describe patient selection, clinical effectiveness, and safety of FXa inhibitor reversal with andexanet alfa in patients presenting with extracranial bleeding.

Methods

Consecutive patients who received andexanet alfa for reversal of FXa inhibitor-associated extracranial hemorrhage were identified. The primary outcome of interest was hemostatic efficacy, assessed using the Sarode et al criteria. Secondary outcomes of interest included incidence of thrombotic episodes post-reversal until discharge and in-hospital mortality.

Results

Twenty-one patients met the inclusion criteria (61.9% male, mean age: 73 years). Anticoagulation reversal with andexanet alfa was deemed effective (excellent [n = 3], good [n = 7]) in 10 (47.6%) patients, and poor in 11 patients (52.4%). Eight (38.1%) patients died, of which three were surgically managed, with all causes of death attributed to hemorrhage. Six ischemic complications occurred in four patients (19.0%); ischemic stroke (n = 2], pulmonary embolism (n = 1), deep vein thrombosis (n = 1), liver ischemia (n = 1), and bowel ischemia (n = 1).

Conclusion

We report poor overall outcomes, a low rate of hemostatic effectiveness, and a high rate of ischemic complications and mortality in this retrospective analysis of oral FXa inhibitor reversal with andexanet alfa for extracranial bleeds. More rigorous epidemiological, and ideally randomized studies, are needed to determine the role of andexanet alfa for FXa inhibitor-associated bleeding for extracranial hemorrhages, where large variation in severity and presentation exists.

### Andexanet-alfa-associated heparin resistance in the context of hemorrhagic stroke [^11928f3b]. Neurocritical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

With a growing number of patients on new oral anticoagulants, interest in reversal agents is rising. Andexanet alfa is used for reversal of factor Xa inhibitors in intracranial hemorrhage.

Methods

We provide a brief review on andexanet-alfa-associated heparin resistance and discuss potentially critical situations from different clinical perspectives.

Results

Case reports point out that andexanet alfa can cause unresponsiveness to heparin, leading to catastrophic events. As a result, regulatory bodies have issued warning notices to avoid heparinization parallel to the use of andexanet alfa.

Conclusions

Although well known to hematologists, the phenomenon is underrecognized among stroke clinicians. However, patients with intracranial hemorrhage frequently undergo endovascular or surgical interventions that require periprocedural administration of heparin.

### Andexanet alfa versus four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for the reversal of apixaban-or rivaroxaban-associated intracranial hemorrhage: a propensity score-overlap weighted analysis [^a8736664]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Andexanet alfa is approved (FDA "accelerated approval"; EMA "conditional approval") as the first specific reversal agent for factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor-associated uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding. Four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (4F-PCC) are commonly used as an off-label, non-specific, factor replacement approach to manage FXa inhibitor-associated life-threatening bleeding. We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of andexanet alfa versus 4F-PCC for management of apixaban- or rivaroxaban-associated intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).

Methods

This two-cohort comparison study included andexanet alfa patients enrolled at US hospitals from 4/2015 to 3/2020 in the prospective, single-arm ANNEXA-4 study and a synthetic control arm of 4F-PCC patients admitted within a US healthcare system from 12/2016 to 8/2020. Adults with radiographically confirmed ICH who took their last dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban < 24 h prior to the bleed were included. Patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score < 7, hematoma volume > 60 mL, or planned surgery within 12 h were excluded. Outcomes were hemostatic effectiveness from index to repeat scan, mortality within 30 days, and thrombotic events within five days. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using propensity score-overlap weighted logistic regression.

Results

The study included 107 andexanet alfa (96.6% low dose) and 95 4F-PCC patients (79.3% receiving a 25 unit/kg dose). After propensity score-overlap weighting, mean age was 79 years, GCS was 14, time from initial scan to reversal initiation was 2.3 h, and time from reversal to repeat scan was 12.2 h in both arms. Atrial fibrillation was present in 86% of patients. Most ICHs were single compartment (78%), trauma-related (61%), and involved the intracerebral and/or intraventricular space(s) (53%). ICH size was ≥ 10 mL in volume (intracerebral and/or ventricular) or ≥ 10 mm in thickness (subdural or subarachnoid) in 22% of patients and infratentorial in 15%. Andexanet alfa was associated with greater odds of achieving hemostatic effectiveness (85.8% vs. 68.1%; OR 2.73; 95% CI 1.16–6.42) and decreased odds of mortality (7.9% vs. 19.6%; OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.13–0.98) versus 4F-PCC. Two thrombotic events occurred with andexanet alfa and none with 4F-PCC.

Conclusions

In this indirect comparison of patients with an apixaban- or rivaroxaban-associated ICH, andexanet alfa was associated with better hemostatic effectiveness and improved survival compared to 4F-PCC. Trial registration NCT02329327; registration date: December 31, 2014.

### Reversal of factor Xa inhibitor-related intracranial hemorrhage: a multicenter, retrospective, observational study comparing the efficacy and safety of andexanet and prothrombin complex concentrates [^44618eb1]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness and safety of andexanet and prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) when administered after intracranial hemorrhage (ICrH) associated with direct oral anticoagulants, specifically apixaban or rivaroxaban.

Design

A multicenter, retrospective, observational study of patients with apixaban or rivaroxaban-related ICrH who received andexanet or PCCs between January 1, 2015, and March 31, 2023. A predefined sensitivity analysis excluding patients with an admission Glasgow Coma Scale score of less than 7 was also performed.

Setting

Forty-two stroke centers in the United States.

Patients

A total of 1133 patients.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary efficacy outcome was the percentage of patients with excellent or good hemostasis as defined by the modified Sarode criteria. The primary safety outcome was the occurrence of a thrombotic event (TE) during their hospital stay. Of the 1133 patients evaluated, 1096 were included. In the full hemostatic efficacy analysis, patients receiving andexanet (87.8%) had higher odds of achieving excellent or good hemostasis (odds ratio [OR] 1.60; 95% CI, 1.00–2.56; p = 0.048) compared with PCCs (81.8%). Patients treated with andexanet (7.9%) had higher odds of a TE (OR 1.91; 95% CI, 1.13–3.20; p = 0.014) compared to those treated with PCCs (4.2%). No differences in hemostatic or thrombotic outcomes were observed when the sensitivity analysis was applied.

Conclusions

Despite statistically higher odds of achieving hemostatic efficacy with andexanet, we also observed higher odds of a TE with no difference in discharge outcomes observed between groups. When those with more severe neurologic injuries were excluded, efficacy and safety outcomes were similar between treatments.

### Andexanet alfa for the reversal of factor Xa inhibitors [^6bbc1973]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Andexanet alfa is a recombinant modified factor Xa protein that has been developed to reverse factor Xa inhibitors. Since May 2018, the FDA has approved its utilization in patients treated with apixaban and rivaroxaban in case of life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. On 28 of February 2019, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a conditional marketing authorization for andexanet alfa in Europe. Area covered: The authors provide an overview of andexanet alfa development and its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The results of the clinical phase III trial ANNEXA as well as current limitations related to andexanet alfa are also discussed. Expert opinion: Although phase I and II studies have proven that andexanet alfa can be effective in reversing the effect of factor Xa inhibitors, its efficacy in major bleeding patients has only been shown for apixaban and rivaroxaban, without any comparator group. Well-designed studies comparing the efficacy and safety of andexanet alfa to other reversal strategies are required to confirm preliminary data. The benefit of andexanet alfa in specific settings needs to be investigated and its use in clinical practice needs to be facilitated by the implementation of international guidelines.

### Evaluation of oral factor Xa inhibitor-associated extracranial bleeding reversal with andexanet alfa [^91cfcb1e]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Experience with andexanet alfa reversal for FXa inhibitor‐associated extracranial bleeding in an urban, academic health system indicates poor overall outcome and a low rate of hemostatic effectiveness, but similarly high rates of ischemic complications and mortality compared with previously published data. Use of andexanet alfa must be controlled and monitored using strict guidelines for use and updated as more data on (cost‐)effectiveness and safety becomes available. More rigorous epidemiological, and ideally randomized, studies are needed to determine the role of andexanet alfa within management protocols for FXa inhibitor‐associated bleeding for all indications, but especially extracranial bleeding for which more variation in severity and presentation exists.

Statistical Analysis

Risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed for dichotomous variables (e.g. successful anticoagulation reversal, in-hospital thrombotic events during reversal therapy, and mortality). For continuous variables (e.g. length of hospital and ICU stay and hematoma volume expansion), the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI were computed to pool effect estimates. The method by Wan et al. was used to convert any outcome reported in the form of median and interquartile range (IQR) to mean and standard deviation. We used a random-effects model because of the expected heterogeneity between studies. Higgins I 2 test was used to measure heterogeneity, in which a range of 0–40% was deemed insignificant, a range of 30–60% was considered moderate, a range of 50–90% represented substantial, and a range of 75–100% represented considerable heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses were employed to evaluate the result's robustness and to assess the contribution of each study by excluding studies each at a time. We conducted our statistical analysis using Review Manager V.5.3 and Open Meta-Analyst software.

Efficacy in Spontaneous ICrH Cohort

Of the 98 evaluable patients with spontaneous ICrH, 77 (78.6% [95% CI, 69.1%–86.2%]) were adjudicated to have excellent (n = 70) or good (n = 7) hemostasis at 12 hours following andexanet. Subgroup analyses showed a consistent effect of andexanet treatment according to the type of FXa inhibitor received and bleeding compartment (Figure 2 A).

Figure 2.
Subgroup analysis of patients achieving excellent or good hemostasis 12 h after andexanet treatment. Spontaneous (A) and traumatic (B) ICrH populations reported separately. *Evaluable patients. In A, 1 patient from the efficacy cohort of 99 patients was not evaluable. In B, 2 patients from the efficacy cohort of 72 patients were not evaluable. Sizes of squares indicate relative numbers of patients. ICH indicates intracerebral hemorrhage; ICrH, intracranial hemorrhage; IVH, intraventricular hemorrhage; SAH, subarachnoid hemorrhage; and SDH, subdural hemorrhage.

Among the 91 patients who presented with a single-compartment intracerebral/intraventricular hemorrhage (safety population-data missing for 8 patients), intracerebral/intraventricular hematoma volume expansion ≤ 35% between baseline and 1 hour was apparent in 75 (82.4%) patients; 73 (97.3%) of these patients maintained this status at the 12-hour scan, suggesting durability of hemostasis despite the completion of andexanet before full clearance of the FXa inhibitor (Figure II in the).

Median hematoma volume did not change noticeably between baseline and 12 hours in patients with single-compartment intracerebral/intraventricular bleeds (Table 2). In patients with subdural or subarachnoid bleeding, median hematoma thickness at 12 hours was modestly lower than at baseline, although the number of patients with these bleed types was limited.

Table 2.
Change in Hematoma Characteristics*

Median (IQR) GCS and NIHSS scores at 12 hours in the efficacy population were 15.0 ([12.5–15.0]; n = 40) and 5.5 ([1.0–15.0]; n = 38), respectively, and the median (IQR) modified Rankin Scale score at 30 days was 4.0 ([1.0–5.0]; n = 33).

### Efficacy and safety of andexanet alfa versus four factor prothrombin complex concentrate for emergent reversal of factor Xa inhibitor associated intracranial hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1b74a7e9]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 studies with 2,977 patients demonstrated that AA is superior to 4F-PCC in reversing anticoagulation in patients with ICH on FXaI. Lower mortality rates were significantly found following AA administration, with more thromboembolic events in the AA group. Our findings suggest the potential use of AA as a preferred reversal agent in acute ICH. However, its use as a reversal agent may be limited because of its cost and low availability in low-resource hospitals, which potentially influences treatment decisions for ICH associated with FXaI.

### Reversal of oral anticoagulation in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^9e11ea75]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Andexanet alfa for factor-Xa-inhibitor-associated ICH

Specific reversal of factor-Xa-inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban) can be accomplished with andexanet alfa (Andexxa®) which has been approved in May 2018 by the FDA. Andexanet alfa has been designed to reverse the anticoagulant activity of both direct and indirect factor-Xa-inhibitors. Andexanet alfa acts as a human decoy receptor binding to the active site of factor-Xa inhibitors with high affinity and possesses no catalytic activity. Therefore, factor-Xa activity is supposedly restored and effect of anticoagulation attenuated. Several studies in healthy subjects have been conducted to evaluate the potential of reversing anticoagulation. More specifically, a two-part randomized controlled phase 3 trial (ANNEXA-A and ANNEXA-R) evaluated effectiveness of andexanet alfa in healthy older volunteers taking either apixaban (ANNEXA-A, n = 24) or rivaroxaban (ANNEXA-R, n = 27) comparing different dosing (400–960 mg) and application regimes (single bolus and bolus followed by 2-h infusion). Study results showed that in over 90% anti-Xa activity was reduced during time of treatment with andexanet alfa followed by a rebound after end of infusion.

Efficacy in Traumatic ICrH Cohort

Of the 70 evaluable patients with traumatic ICrH at 12 hours following andexanet, 58 (83% [95% CI, 72%–91%]) were adjudicated to have excellent (n = 47) or good (n = 11) hemostasis. As with spontaneous bleeds, subgroup analyses showed a consistent effect of andexanet treatment according to the FXa inhibitor agent and bleeding compartment (Figure 2 B).

In patients with traumatic single-compartment intracerebral/intraventricular bleeding (efficacy population), median hematoma volume remained constant between baseline and 12 hours (Table 2). In patients with subdural and subarachnoid bleeding, median hematoma thickness was modestly lower at 12 hours compared with baseline, similar to patients with spontaneous ICrH.

Median (IQR) GCS and NIHSS scores at 12 hours in the efficacy population were 15.0 ([14.0–15.0]; n = 29) and 1.0 ([0.0–3.5]; n = 32), respectively; and the modified Rankin Scale score at 30 days was 1.0 ([0.0–4.0]; n = 31).

Conclusions

Our indirect comparison analysis of ANNEXA-4-derived andexanet alfa patients and a synthetic control arm of 4F-PCC patients (~ 80% at 25 units/kg) from a US healthcare system showed that andexanet alfa was associated with better hemostatic effectiveness and reduced odds of all-cause mortality at 30 days. Our findings support current consensus guidelines published by international/national medical societies, which preferentially recommend the use of andexanet alfa over 4F-PCC for the management of apixaban- or rivaroxaban-associated life-threatening bleeds (including intracranial hemorrhage). Randomized controlled trials, such as the ANNEXA-I trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03661528), are ongoing in large and diverse populations comparing andexanet alfa to usual care.

### Efficacy and safety of andexanet alfa versus four factor prothrombin complex concentrate for emergent reversal of factor Xa inhibitor associated intracranial hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^edb1cdf5]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The ANNEXA-1 trial was the first randomized controlled trial to compare AA with usual care (including 4F-PCC in 87% of patients) in 530 patients receiving oral FXaI with ICH (mostly intracerebral). The primary outcome measured was hemostatic efficacy, defined as an expansion of hematoma volume by 35% or less at 12 h, an increase of less than 7 points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and no receipt of rescue therapy. The results showed that hemostatic efficacy was achieved in 67.0% of patients in the AA group compared to 53.1% in the usual care group (P = 0.003). However, 30-day mortality rates were balanced between the treatment groups (P = 0.51). Thromboembolic events were more frequent in the AA group (10.3% versus 5.6% in the usual care group) (P = 0.048), with ischemic stroke occurring in 6.5% versus 1.5% of patients, respectively. When viewed together, the strong internal validity of the ANNEXA-1 trial for its primary end point and our pooled results suggests that AA is superior to usual care, including prothrombin complex concentrate, for improving hemostasis in patients with FXaI-associated ICH. Although the ANNEXA-1 trial was not designed to assess mRS scores and mortality rates, our results of 30-day mortality rates and mRS scores ≤ 3 showed no significant difference between the two groups, which was consistent with the ANNEXA-1 trial. However, our analysis favored AA in lowering the overall mortality rate (P = 0.02) and the in-hospital mortality rate, which was marginally significant (P = 0.047). Further randomized controlled trials powered to assess in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates and change in mRS scores from baseline as a primary end point are required to address this gap. Finally, the ANNEXA-1 trial found a marginally significant increase in thromboembolic events in the AA group (P = 0.048), which was consistent with our pooled overall effect (P = 0.046). The mechanism of thrombotic events in AA is still uncertain.

The age distribution across the included studies shows that most patients were elderly, with a mean age of 77 years. Advanced age is a known risk factor for both ICH and adverse outcomes following anticoagulation reversal. The comorbidities commonly observed in this population, such as hypertension, may have exacerbated the severity of hemorrhage and influenced the response to reversal agents. Additionally, the time from anticoagulation reversal to intervention (door-to-reversal time) was a significant variable. The shorter reversal time observed in the 4F-PCC group compared to the AA group may have contributed to differences in outcomes, particularly in the context of acute ICH management. In our analysis, hypertension was one of the most common comorbidities among patients with ICH, as also observed in the studies by Dobesh et al. and Oh et al. Elevated systolic blood pressure at baseline, particularly in patients treated with AA, was associated with higher hemostatic challenges, given that hypertension is a critical factor in both the risk and management of hemorrhagic events. In the study by Dobesh et al. patients in the AA group had a higher mean systolic blood pressure (147.6 mm Hg) compared to those in the 4F-PCC group (139.9 mm Hg), which may have influenced the efficacy outcomes favoring AA. Similarly, Oh et al. reported that despite higher baseline systolic pressures, AA demonstrated effective hemostatic control, which was crucial for patient survival and reduced mortality rates.

The ANNEXA-1 trial, which constitutes a substantial portion of the patient population in our meta-analysis, had specific inclusion criteria that could have influenced the outcomes observed. The trial included patients with relatively high baseline systolic blood pressure (mean 161.2 ± 27.0 mm Hg in the andexanet group) and higher initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, with a median GCS score of 15 in both treatment groups. Additionally, the trial excluded patients with a GCS score < 7 and those with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score > 35, thereby selecting a cohort with potentially less severe neurological deficits at baseline. Furthermore, the strict time criteria, such as the requirement for the time from the onset of bleeding symptoms to the baseline imaging scan to be within 6 h, may have led to earlier intervention and better outcomes compared to other studies with more time windows. These criteria and the relatively favorable baseline characteristics could have contributed to the more pronounced efficacy observed in the ANNEXA-1 trial, thereby impacting the overall outcomes of our meta-analysis.

Discussion

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of AA versus 4F-PCC as a reversal agent for ICH in patients on FXaI. Our analysis of 16 studies with 2,977 patients revealed that the AA group had higher efficacy in successful anticoagulation reversal than the 4F-PCC group (P = 0.02). Also, AA has been associated with lower overall and in-hospital mortality rates. However, no difference was found in 30-day mortality rates between the two groups. In terms of thromboembolic events, more events were found in the AA group, although our results were marginally significant (P = 0.046). Although secondary outcomes, such as the length of ICU stay and hematoma volume expansion, did not significantly differ between the two groups, patients treated with AA tended to have a slightly longer hospital stay.

Comparing our study with the study conducted by Chaudhary et al. we compared the efficacy and safety of 4F-PCC and AA in reversing anticoagulation in patients with ICH. Our findings showed a higher success rate of AA in reversing anticoagulation (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01–1.20, P = 0.02) than that reported by Chaudhary et al. (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85–1.06), which did not reach a statistically significant difference between both groups. Also, our analysis showed a statistically significant difference for AA in lowering overall mortality rates (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51–0.88, P = 0.004), whereas the results from the study by Chaudhary et al. failed to note this difference (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.68–2.86). Finally, regarding the safety outcome, thromboembolic events were marginally significant between the two agents in our study (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.01–2.15, P = 0.046), whereas in the study by Chaudhary et al. no significant difference was found.

### Evaluation of oral factor Xa inhibitor-associated extracranial bleeding reversal with andexanet alfa [^322c7adf]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

A reversal agent for factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors, andexanet alfa, was Food and Drug Administration approved without extensive study of clinical effectiveness, due to an overwhelming demand for FXa inhibitor reversal. In this study, we aimed to describe patient selection, clinical effectiveness, and safety of FXa inhibitor reversal with andexanet alfa in patients presenting with extracranial bleeding.

Methods

Consecutive patients who received andexanet alfa for reversal of FXa inhibitor‐associated extracranial hemorrhage were identified. The primary outcome of interest was hemostatic efficacy, assessed using the Sarode et al criteria. Secondary outcomes of interest included incidence of thrombotic episodes post‐reversal until discharge and in‐hospital mortality.

Results

Twenty‐one patients met the inclusion criteria (61.9% male, mean age: 73 years). Anticoagulation reversal with andexanet alfa was deemed effective (excellent [n = 3], good [n = 7]) in 10 (47.6%) patients, and poor in 11 patients (52.4%). Eight (38.1%) patients died, of which three were surgically managed, with all causes of death attributed to hemorrhage. Six ischemic complications occurred in four patients (19.0%); ischemic stroke (n = 2], pulmonary embolism (n = 1), deep vein thrombosis (n = 1), liver ischemia (n = 1), and bowel ischemia (n = 1).

Conclusion

We report poor overall outcomes, a low rate of hemostatic effectiveness, and a high rate of ischemic complications and mortality in this retrospective analysis of oral FXa inhibitor reversal with andexanet alfa for extracranial bleeds. More rigorous epidemiological, and ideally randomized studies, are needed to determine the role of andexanet alfa for FXa inhibitor‐associated bleeding for extracranial hemorrhages, where large variation in severity and presentation exists.

### Efficacy and safety of andexanet alfa versus four factor prothrombin complex concentrate for emergent reversal of factor Xa inhibitor associated intracranial hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e827c29f]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Factor Xa inhibitors (FXaI), such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban, are types of non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved these agents for the prevention of many thromboembolic diseases, such as stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, prophylaxis after major orthopedic surgeries, and treatment of venous thromboembolism, whereas some of them have more specific indications. DOACs are increasingly used nowadays in clinical practice because they have proven in several studies to provide comparable efficacy and superior safety in lowering the risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) when compared to traditional agents, such as warfarin. However, the management of a life-threatening ICH in patients receiving oral FXaI is a critical challenge in emergency medicine because rapid and effective reversal is required to help stop or reduce the bleeding.

### Andexanet alfa versus four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for the reversal of apixaban-or rivaroxaban-associated intracranial hemorrhage: a propensity score-overlap weighted analysis [^fd384db0]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Andexanet alfa is approved (FDA "accelerated approval"; EMA "conditional approval") as the first specific reversal agent for factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor-associated uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding. Four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (4F-PCC) are commonly used as an off-label, non-specific, factor replacement approach to manage FXa inhibitor-associated life-threatening bleeding. We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of andexanet alfa versus 4F-PCC for management of apixaban- or rivaroxaban-associated intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).

Methods

This two-cohort comparison study included andexanet alfa patients enrolled at US hospitals from 4/2015 to 3/2020 in the prospective, single-arm ANNEXA-4 study and a synthetic control arm of 4F-PCC patients admitted within a US healthcare system from 12/2016 to 8/2020. Adults with radiographically confirmed ICH who took their last dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban < 24 h prior to the bleed were included. Patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score < 7, hematoma volume > 60 mL, or planned surgery within 12 h were excluded. Outcomes were hemostatic effectiveness from index to repeat scan, mortality within 30 days, and thrombotic events within five days. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using propensity score-overlap weighted logistic regression.

Results

The study included 107 andexanet alfa (96.6% low dose) and 95 4F-PCC patients (79.3% receiving a 25 unit/kg dose). After propensity score-overlap weighting, mean age was 79 years, GCS was 14, time from initial scan to reversal initiation was 2.3 h, and time from reversal to repeat scan was 12.2 h in both arms. Atrial fibrillation was present in 86% of patients. Most ICHs were single compartment (78%), trauma-related (61%), and involved the intracerebral and/or intraventricular space(s) (53%). ICH size was ≥ 10 mL in volume (intracerebral and/or ventricular) or ≥ 10 mm in thickness (subdural or subarachnoid) in 22% of patients and infratentorial in 15%. Andexanet alfa was associated with greater odds of achieving hemostatic effectiveness (85.8% vs. 68.1%; OR 2.73; 95% CI 1.16–6.42) and decreased odds of mortality (7.9% vs. 19.6%; OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.13–0.98) versus 4F-PCC. Two thrombotic events occurred with andexanet alfa and none with 4F-PCC.

Conclusions

In this indirect comparison of patients with an apixaban- or rivaroxaban-associated ICH, andexanet alfa was associated with better hemostatic effectiveness and improved survival compared to 4F-PCC.

### Efficacy and safety of andexanet alfa versus four factor prothrombin complex concentrate for emergent reversal of factor Xa inhibitor associated intracranial hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^264ea77a]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations. One limitation is the geographical uniformity of the included studies, as all these studies were conducted in the USA, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Moreover, the baseline blood pressure and door-to-reversal time were not reported in most studies, which could limit the robustness of the conclusions drawn. Also, although the majority of the included studies employed the criteria established by the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis to evaluate the efficacy of managing significant bleeding events, few studies used predetermined adjudication criteria or failed to describe the specific criteria used to determine the stability of ICH on repetitive imaging (eAppendix 4). In addition, it is important to note that all the comparisons are restricted to data from cohort studies, except for the ANNEXA-1 trial. Additionally, the ANNEXA-1 trial, which contributed a significant proportion of the patients included in our analysis, was not designed with sufficient power to detect differences in mortality and mRS outcomes. This limitation may affect the generalizability of our results. Finally, the inclusion of only a limited number of studies reporting mRS and GOS outcomes restricts our ability to fully assess the short-term and long-term clinical impact of the interventions studied. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, our meta-analysis is the first to conclude significant results favoring AA over 4F-PCC in the context of reversing anticoagulation in FXaI-associated ICH.

Factor Xa inhibitor–associated ICH — andexanet alfa data and use: Andexanet alfa is a recombinant coagulation factor that reverses the inhibition of factor Xa; in a large multicenter open-label study of major bleeding within 18 hours after a factor Xa inhibitor, andexanet alfa significantly reduced anti–factor Xa activity, with a 10% VTE rate and 15% mortality rate, and in a subgroup with ICH, excellent or good hemostatic outcome, defined as < 35% increase in hematoma volume after 12 hours, was seen in 79% of patients. Small single-center comparisons reported higher rates of hemostatic efficacy and thromboembolism and significantly higher cost versus PCC, while another small comparison found similar stability of hematoma on CT at 6 and 24 hours; hence, although andexanet alfa can be effective to reverse anti–factor Xa activity, data on safety and clinical outcomes from a randomized trial are awaited, and the recommended dosing depends on the specific factor Xa inhibitor and the time since last dose.

### Hemostatic efficacy and anti-FXa (factor Xa) reversal with andexanet alfa in intracranial hemorrhage: ANNEXA-4 substudy [^92d74041]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Before the development of andexanet, providers were left with few options to manage bleeding patients taking FXa inhibitors. Therapeutic strategies have included supportive care, antifibrinolytic agents (aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid), and coagulation factor therapies (prothrombin complex concentrates, plasma, factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity). Recent reports have described the use of these agents in patients with ICrH, although the mechanistic basis for their effectiveness is controversial. Furthermore, their efficacy may be restricted in the presence of higher anti-FXa levels, and the reports provide limited or no information regarding baseline anti-FXa activity. Relative to previously available therapies, andexanet represents a therapeutic advance given its specific, rapid, and biologically relevant mechanism of action.

In summary, results of this subgroup analysis of ANNEXA-4 provide support that andexanet provides effective and safe reduction of FXa anticoagulant activity for up to 12 hours after treatment in patients with intracranial bleeding. Given its unique and specific mechanism of action in reversing the anticoagulant effects of FXa inhibitors, andexanet may confer a benefit for this severely ill and highly vulnerable population.

### Hemostatic efficacy and anti-FXa (factor Xa) reversal with andexanet alfa in intracranial hemorrhage: ANNEXA-4 substudy [^67f0da57]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Two hundred twenty-seven patients with ICrH were included in ANNEXA-4 and constitute the safety cohort for this analysis (Figure 1). The efficacy population included 171 patients, including 99 patients with spontaneous ICrH and 72 patients with traumatic ICrH. Three patients (1 in the spontaneous ICrH group and 2 in the trauma ICrH group) were excluded from the population evaluable for hemostatic efficacy for administrative reasons.

Flow chart. ANNEXA-4 indicates Andexanet Alfa, a Novel Antidote to the Anticoagulation Effects of FXa Inhibitors; and anti-FXa, anti-factor Xa activity. *Patients not evaluable due to administrative reasons were excluded: n = 1 for the spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICrH) population; n = 2 for the traumatic ICrH population.

All 227 patients in the safety population received at least a partial dose of andexanet. Three patients were redosed with andexanet, 3 received a coagulation factor concentrate, and 2 received an antifibrinolytic (eg, tranexamic acid).

Baseline Characteristics

In the overall safety population, the mean age was 79.3 years, 117 (51.5%) patients were male, and 193 (85.0%) patients were receiving FXa inhibitor therapy for atrial fibrillation (Table 1). Most patients had received either apixaban (140 [61.7%]) or rivaroxaban (69 [30.4%]) before andexanet. Bleeding was spontaneous in 128 patients and the result of trauma in 99 patients. The median (IQR) time from onset of symptoms or trauma to baseline scan was 3.3 (1.4–6.8) hours, whereas the median (IQR) time from baseline scan to initiation of andexanet was 2.0 (1.3–3.3) hours (Table 1).

### Andexanet alfa versus 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for reversal of factor Xa inhibitors in intracranial hemorrhage [^931a6379]. Neurocritical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Objective

There are limited data on the risks and benefits of using andexanet alfa (AA) in comparison with four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) to reverse factor Xa inhibitors (FXi) associated intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). We sought to describe our experience with AA or 4F-PCC in patients with oral FXi-related traumatic and spontaneous ICH.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of consecutive adult patients with FXi-related ICH who received AA or 4F-PCC. FXi-related ICH cases included traumatic and spontaneous intracranial hemorrhages. Our primary analysis evaluated ICH stability on head computed tomography scan (CT), defined as a similar amount of blood from the initial scan at the onset of ICH to subsequent scans, at 6-h and 24-h post-administration of AA or 4F-PCC. For the subset of spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhages, volume was measured at 6-h and 24-h post-reversal. In secondary analyses, we evaluated good functional outcome at discharge, defined as a Modified Rankin Score of less than 3, and the incidence of thrombotic events after AA or 4F-PCC adminstration, during hospitalization.

Results

A total of 44 patients (16 traumatic and 28 spontaneous ICH) with median age of 79 years [72–86], 36% females, with a FXi-related ICH, were included in this study. The majority of spontaneous ICHs were intraparenchymal 19 (68%). Twenty-eight patients (64%) received AA and 16 patients (36%) received 4F-PCC. There was no difference between AA and 4F-PCC in terms of CT stability at 6 h (21 [78%] vs 10 [71%], p = 0.71) and 24 h (15 [88%] vs 6 [60%], p = 0.15). In a subgroup of patients with spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage, there was no difference in the degree of achieved hemostasis based on hematoma volume between AA and 4F-PCC at 6 h (9.3 mL [6.9–26.4] vs 10 mL [9.4–22.1], adjusted p = 0. 997) and 24-h (9.2 mL [6.1–18.8] vs 9.9 [9.4–21.1], adjusted p = 1). The number of patients with good outcome based on mRS on discharge were 10 (36%) and 6 (38%) in the AA and 4F-PCC groups, respectively (adjusted p = 0.81). The incidence of thromboembolic events was similar in the AA and 4F-PCC groups (2 [7%] vs 0, p = 0.53).

Conclusion

In this limited sample of patients, we found no difference in neuroimaging stability, functional outcome and thrombotic events when comparing AA and 4F-PCC in patients with FXi-related ICH. Since our analysis is likely underpowered, a multi-center collaborative network devoted to this question is warranted.

### Real-world utilization of andexanet alfa [^3b9f5ec8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

In 2018, the FDA approved andexanet alfa for the reversal of life-threatening hemorrhages in patients anticoagulated with apixaban or rivaroxaban. Yet, cost-effective factor Xa inhibitor reversal remains controversial. The objective of this study was to describe real world utilization of andexanet alfa.

Methods

This was a retrospective case series of patients receiving andexanet alfa between July 28, 2018 and April 29, 2019 at a large academic health system. Baseline demographics, anticoagulant type and reversal, as well as brain imaging were collected. Primary endpoints were stability of hematoma for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and hemostatic effectiveness for patients undergoing surgical procedures. Secondary endpoints were thromboembolism and 30 day mortality.

Results

Of the 25 patients evaluated, 13 received andexanet alfa for ICH. Eleven of the 13 had follow-up imaging available and stability was observed in 90.9%. Three patients received andexanet alfa for reversal prior to surgical procedures, and 100% hemostatic effectiveness was achieved. Nine patients received andexanet alfa for reversal of extracranial bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleed (n = 4). There were no thrombotic events in our cohort, and 30 day mortality was 24%. Sixty-four percent of patients would have met exclusion criteria for the ANNEXA-4 trial.

Conclusion

This is the largest series to date describing real-world utilization of andexanet alfa. Our series showed hemostatic efficacy in 90.9% of patients with ICH, and 100% in patients undergoing surgical procedures. There were no thrombotic complications. Yet, larger and comparative studies are needed to clarify the optimal agent and patient selection for reversal of factor Xa inhibitors.

### Efficacy of 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates in factor Xa inhibitor-associated intracranial bleeding [^8221b7ea]. Neurocritical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Objective

Intracranial bleeding (ICB) is a feared complication of systemic anticoagulation. Factor Xa inhibitors (FXaI) are used frequently due to their improved safety profile and predictable kinetics. Andexanet alfa was recently approved for emergent reversal of FXaI agents but was not compared formally to 4-Factor Prothrombin Complex Concentrates (4FPCC) which are the current standard of care in many centers. The objective of this study is to formally evaluate the hemostatic efficacy of 4FPCC in patients with FXaI-associated ICB.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients receiving 4FPCC for the reversal of a FXaI in the setting of acute ICB. Hemostatic efficacy was adjudicated via evaluation of post-4FPCC CT scan using the criteria closely mirroring those outlined in Annexa-4 (excellent < 20% expansion, good > 20% but ≤ 35% expansion, poor > 35% expansion). Each image was reviewed by two neurointensivist attendings for grading. Mortality was assessed until date of discharge. Charts were screened for thrombotic events out to 30 days post-4FPCC administration.

Results

A total of 59 patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age in years was 78.5 ± 10.9 and 56% were male. Apixaban was the most common FXaI prescribed at the time of presentation (67.8%). Most patients were on FXaI therapy for stroke prevention in the setting of atrial fibrillation (81.3%). Median Glasgow Coma Scale at presentation was 15(IQR 12–15), with the most frequently presenting ICB type being intracerebral hemorrhage (52.5%). The mean dose of 4FPCC prescribed was 46.6 (± 8.2) units/kg. Of those receiving 4FPCC for FXaI ICB, 88% were graded as having an excellent or good hemostatic outcome with excellent interrater reliability. Survival was high at 89.8%, and thrombotic events were seen in seven patients (11.9%).

Conclusion

4FPCC appears to be an effective and safe option for FXaI-associated ICB with outcomes comparable to andexanet alfa. A formal prospective evaluation of this strategy versus andexanet alpha including cost analysis is warranted.

### Evaluation of direct oral anticoagulant reversal agents in intracranial hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e3764af7]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)-associated intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) has high morbidity and mortality. The safety and outcome data of DOAC reversal agents in ICH are limited.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and outcomes of DOAC reversal agents among patients with ICH.

Data Sources

PubMed, MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, Embase, EBSCO, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases were searched from inception through April 29, 2022.

Study Selection

The eligibility criteria were (1) adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with ICH receiving treatment with a DOAC, (2) reversal of DOAC, and (3) reported safety and anticoagulation reversal outcomes. All nonhuman studies and case reports, studies evaluating patients with ischemic stroke requiring anticoagulation reversal or different dosing regimens of DOAC reversal agents, and mixed study groups with DOAC and warfarin were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines were used for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity. Two reviewers independently selected the studies and abstracted data. Data were pooled using the random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was proportion with anticoagulation reversed. The primary safety end points were all-cause mortality and thromboembolic events after the reversal agent.

Results

A total of 36 studies met criteria for inclusion, with a total of 1832 patients (967 receiving 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate [4F-PCC]; 525, andexanet alfa [AA]; 340, idarucizumab). The mean age was 76 (range, 68–83) years, and 57% were men. For 4F-PCC, anticoagulation reversal was 77% (95% CI, 72%-82%; I2 = 55%); all-cause mortality, 26% (95% CI, 20%-32%; I2 = 68%), and thromboembolic events, 8% (95% CI, 5%-12%; I2 = 41%). For AA, anticoagulation reversal was 75% (95% CI, 67%-81%; I2 = 48%); all-cause mortality, 24% (95% CI, 16%-34%; I2 = 73%), and thromboembolic events, 14% (95% CI, 10%-19%; I2 = 16%). Idarucizumab for reversal of dabigatran had an anticoagulation reversal rate of 82% (95% CI, 55%-95%; I2 = 41%), all-cause mortality, 11% (95% CI, 8%-15%, I2 = 0%), and thromboembolic events, 5% (95% CI, 3%-8%; I2 = 0%). A direct retrospective comparison of 4F-PCC and AA showed no differences in anticoagulation reversal, proportional mortality, or thromboembolic events.

Conclusions and Relevance

In the absence of randomized clinical comparison trials, the overall anticoagulation reversal, mortality, and thromboembolic event rates in this systematic review and meta-analysis appeared similar among available DOAC reversal agents for managing ICH. Cost, institutional formulary status, and availability may restrict reversal agent choice, particularly in small community hospitals.

### Andexanet-alfa-associated heparin resistance in the context of hemorrhagic stroke [^c8ea0b3a]. Neurocritical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

With a growing number of patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants, general interest in reversal agents in patients with hemorrhagic stroke is rising. Andexanet alfa (AA) is the only reversal agent approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration for oral direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban in situations when reversal of anticoagulation is needed because of life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Safety and efficacy were evaluated in two prospective randomized placebo-controlled studies. Both studies analyzed anti-FXa activity in healthy volunteers receiving either apixaban (ANNEXA-A) or rivaroxaban (ANNEXA-R). This was followed by the ANNEXA-4 study published in 2019 on 352 patients who had acute major bleeding within 18 h after administration of an FXa inhibitor. Just recently, the post hoc ANNEXA-4 substudy on hemostatic efficacy and anti-FXa reversal in intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) was published. The authors conclude that AA reduced anti-FXa activity in FXa-inhibitor-treated patients with traumatic as well as spontaneous ICH with high rates of hemostatic efficacy. Results of the ongoing ANNEXA-I trial (NCT03661528), a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of AA versus usual care in patients with ICH on FXa inhibitors, are excitedly awaited. In the absence of such a randomized controlled trial, safety and efficacy are being questioned by different groups of health care professionals, especially when considering the high cost of therapy with AA.

### Evaluation of oral factor Xa inhibitor-associated extracranial bleeding reversal with andexanet alfa [^4b897657]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly being utilized as alternatives to coumarin derivatives for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) as well as prevention of stroke in patients with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation, due to improved effectiveness, safety, and cost‐effectiveness. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Additional advantages include more predictable pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, less need for laboratory monitoring, and less drug‐drug interactions. 9, 10 Uniquely, a potential reversal agent for the factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors, andexanet alfa, was Food and Drug Administration‐approved in 2018 without extensive study of clinical effectiveness, due to an overwhelming demand for a specific FXa inhibitor reversal agent.

The available evidence on andexanet effectiveness came from the ANNEXA‐ A and ANNEXA‐R trials, which showed a significant reduction in anti‐FXa levels in healthy volunteers anticoagulated with either apixaban or rivaroxaban who were subsequently administered andexanet alfa. 11 The ANNEXA‐4 trial was a single‐arm, open‐label prospective cohort study of clinical effectiveness, and enrolled adult patients presenting with acute major bleeding, defined as potentially life‐threatening, bleeding in a critical organ/area, or bleeding associated with a drop in hemoglobin of > 2 g/dL. 12 This study found a rate of effective hemostasis of 82% following reversal with andexanet alfa. Potential complications of andexanet alfa reversal are thrombosis, embolism, or ischemic stroke. In the ANNEXA‐4 trial, the incidence of thrombotic events was reported to be 10% with a 30‐day mortality rate of 14%, and at least 71% of these patients died due to cardiovascular causes.

### Efficacy and safety of andexanet alfa versus four factor prothrombin complex concentrate for emergent reversal of factor Xa inhibitor associated intracranial hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^db700241]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Several international and national medical associations have established recommendations on the optimal management of ICH associated with FXaI. The current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology, European Society of Cardiology, European Stroke Organization, American College of Emergency Physicians, and the American Society of Hematology all advocate for the use of AA in addressing severe life-threatening bleeding associated with apixaban or rivaroxaban use. Some of them suggest the use of 4F-PCC as an alternative when AA is not available or for non-life-threatening bleeds, although this recommendation is not universally supported.

Previous studies showed conflicting results of cost-effectiveness models to assess whether the better results of AA in improving hemostatic efficacy are enough to make up for their higher cost and low availability. The study by Keinath et al. underscores the financial aspect of choosing between AA and 4F-PCC for reversing FXaI-associated bleeds. Their findings indicate no significant difference in clinical outcomes between AA and 4F-PCC. However, AA's cost was notably higher, approximately four times the cost per deterioration-free discharge compared to 4F-PCC. The cost per deterioration-free discharge was $20,773.62 in the AA group versus $5,230.32 in the 4F-PCC group. The study by Pham et al. found a statistically significant difference in the total cost of treatment between the two agents: $23,602 for treatment with AA and $6,692 for treatment with 4F-PCC. This economic disparity is a pivotal factor in our discussion, highlighting the necessity of weighing both clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness in treatment decisions. Another challenge associated with the use of AA is the long time from door to reversal administration compared to 4F-PCC. This may be attributed to the increased medication compounding complexity outside the emergency department setting. However, because of its short duration of action compared to 4F-PCC, periprocedural use must be optimized carefully to promote intraoperative and postoperative hemostasis.

### Andexanet alfa versus four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for the reversal of apixaban-or rivaroxaban-associated intracranial hemorrhage: a propensity score-overlap weighted analysis [^73d5db0e]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

30-day mortality and thromboembolic events

Prior to propensity score-overlap weighting, 24 patients died during follow-up. Of the 10 andexanet alfa patients who died within 30-days, two (20%) were due to worsening intracranial hemorrhage, whereas seven of 14 (50%) patients administered 4F-PCC died due to worsening intracranial hemorrhage. Weighted incidence of 30-day all-cause mortality was 7.9% (95% CI 3.6–13.8) for patients in the andexanet alfa arm and 19.6% (95% CI 12.1–24.0) among patients in the 4F-PCC arm (Fig. 3) in the overall cohort analysis (weighted OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.13–0.98). The weighted incidence and weighted ORs for 30-day mortality were not impacted by the sensitivity analysis, wherein patients without a repeat scan within 24 h had their hemostatic effectiveness adjudicated based on clinical judgement. In the subgroup analysis of patients with intracerebral and/or intraventricular hemorrhage, weighted incidence of 30-day mortality rates was similar to the overall cohort analysis, although differences across groups were not statistically significant (7.5% [95% CI 3.3–14.2] for andexanet alfa and 26.7% [95% CI 18.2–36.7] for 4F-PCC; weighted OR 0.22 [95% CI 0.04–1.41]).

### Evaluation of direct oral anticoagulant reversal agents in intracranial hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a4e6cf30]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What outcomes are associated with direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) reversal agents in intracranial hemorrhage (ICH)?

Findings

In a meta-analysis of 32 studies including 1832 patients with ICH, 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC), andexanet alfa (AA), and idarucizumab were associated with a successful anticoagulation reversal in 77%, 75%, and 82% of patients, respectively; all-cause mortality rates were 26%, 24%, and 11%, respectively; and thromboembolic event rates were 8%, 14%, and 5%, respectively. A direct retrospective comparison of 4F-PCC with AA showed no differences in successful anticoagulation reversal, all-cause mortality, or thromboembolic events.

Meaning

In this study, factor Xa inhibitor reversal agents for ICH had similar safety profiles and outcomes, but the lack of head-to-head comparison warrants cautious interpretation.

### Evaluation of oral factor Xa inhibitor-associated extracranial bleeding reversal with andexanet alfa [^c559c10a]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, its retrospective design and the heterogeneity of the described patient population impeded matching of an appropriate comparison group of patients reversed with 4F‐PCC, or those for whom andexanet was considered but not administered. The retrospective design also limited our ability to determine the rationale for the use of andexanet alfa. Despite detailed prescribing documents, selection bias is present in this study. Therefore, the hemostatic effectiveness found in our study potentially reflects prescribing practice at our institutions, and not necessarily a generalizable effectiveness of andexanet alfa. Second, retrospective collection of data introduces risk of bias in reporting outcomes. However, due to the clear variables and cut‐off values at predetermined time‐points used in determining hemostatic efficacy, and the available imaging and progress reports for ischemic events, we expect the influence of outcome reporting bias to be limited. Third, the use of a 24‐hour timeframe potentially influenced our results. The Sarode et al criteria consider a 24‐hour timeframe, whereas the ANNEXA‐4 study measured hemostatic effectiveness at 12 hours. 19, 20 Normalization of Hgb and Hct is expected to occur more often during a 24‐hour window, compared to a 12‐hour window, whereas the incidence of continued bleeding or re‐bleeding and associated interventions is to be expected more often during a 24‐hour window. Weighing these outcomes, we expect that hemostatic effectiveness measured using a 24‐hour timeframe will be slightly higher, compared to using a 12‐hour timeframe. Fourth, our study is limited by sample size, which does not allow for statistical testing of hypotheses, and risks over‐ and underestimation of true ischemic event rates. Caution in interpretation of our results is advised as further experience with andexanet alfa in larger cohorts will increase our understanding of the effectiveness and risks. Last, differences in the prescribing guidelines for andexanet alfa existed between the participating hospitals. However, because no comparison was performed, the impact of these differences is limited. Based on our institutional experience, we intend to continue our prescribing practice, while continually evaluating individual patient outcomes, and published data of more rigorous, ideally randomized studies to refine our guidelines and practice.

### Andexanet alfa versus four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for the reversal of apixaban-or rivaroxaban-associated intracranial hemorrhage: a propensity score-overlap weighted analysis [^c20b641e]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Since their approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) in 2010, direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and in particular the factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors apixaban and rivaroxaban have been increasingly utilized to treat or prevent various thrombotic disease states. While DOACs are associated with a decreased risk of intracranial hemorrhage compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), these life-threatening bleeds were observed in DOAC-treated patients at a rate of approximately 0.7%/year in randomized trials. The previous literature has shown that antithrombotic-related intracranial hemorrhages can result in a high clinical burden, with in-hospital mortality rates of 12.4% for traumatic and 29% for non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Research in the American Heart Association's Get with the Guidelines Stroke registry also found a high burden of in-hospital mortality of 27% for patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in the presence of FXa inhibitors, with odds of mortality being significantly higher for patients taking FXa inhibitors compared to those who do not take anticoagulants, but significantly lower compared to those taking warfarin.

In 2018 and 2019 (respectively), the first specific FXa inhibitor reversal agent, coagulation FXa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo (US adopted name: andexanet alfa), was approved through an accelerated pathway by FDA and conditionally approved by EMA for patients treated with rivaroxaban or apixaban when reversal of anticoagulation is needed for those experiencing life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Andexanet alfa is a modified, recombinant, inactive form of human FXa developed to serve as a decoy to bind FXa inhibitor molecules and reduce anti-FXa activity. In the single-arm prospective Andexanet Alfa, a Novel Antidote to the Anticoagulation Effects of Factor Xa Inhibitors (ANNEXA-4) study, treatment with andexanet resulted in a reduction of 92% in anti-FXa activity and 82% of patients were adjudicated as having effective hemostasis. Factor concentrates, most notably four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC), have been used as alternative off-label strategies for the management of major bleeding despite an absence of prospective clinical trial data.

### Evaluation of oral factor Xa inhibitor-associated extracranial bleeding reversal with andexanet alfa [^c85c4c87]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

The prescribing information published by the manufacturer (Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc, South San Francisco, CA, USA) specify that life‐threatening or uncontrolled bleeding constitutes an appropriate indication to prescribe andexanet alfa. The MGH protocol further stipulates life‐threatening bleeding in three specific bleeding sites or to exsanguinating hemorrhage warranting surgical intervention (Figure 1). Indications not specifically mentioned in the MGH protocol require hematology consult and approval. Clinician judgment of what constitutes life‐threatening bleeding forms the basis for patient selection at BWH and other centers that described their protocol, which more closely mirror the prescribing information published by the manufacturer (Figure 2). 17, 21, 22 All discussed protocols stated that indications not specified in the protocol may qualify for use of andexanet alfa after hematology or pharmacy consult and approval.

Another argument surrounding the use of andexanet alfa for FXa inhibitor‐associated bleeding is whether it is superior to 4F‐PCC, which has been utilized and studied more widely in clinical practice as a potential reversal agent for the FXa inhibitors. Considering the paucity of data and the high baseline risk of poor outcome and complications in this patient population, comparative studies of andexanet alfa and other reversal agents or usual care are urgently needed. To our knowledge, there has been one head‐to‐head comparison of these two reversal strategies, but statistical analysis was not performed to compare effectiveness due to a limited sample size. 18 A plethora of single‐arm cohort studies of 4F‐PCC reversal for FXa‐associated bleeding have reported effectiveness rates of 69%‐95%, defined using the Sarode et al criteria or significant intracranial hemorrhage progression. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 The Sarode et al criteria were also used by most studies on real‐world use of andexanet alfa reversal. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 However, these criteria require standardized patient selection to be able to compare the hemostatic effectiveness of andexanet and 4F‐PCC, as selection bias is present otherwise.

### Andexanet for factor Xa inhibitor-associated acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^745dd246]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study ANNEXA-I was published by Stuart J Connolly and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Intracerebral hemorrhage. In the ANNEXA-I study, the trial question was: what is the role of andexanet in patients with factor Xa inhibitor-associated intracerebral hemorrhage? In the ANNEXA-I study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ANNEXA-I study, the population was: 452 patients (207 female, 245 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage receiving factor Xa inhibitors. The key exclusion criteria were GCS score < 7; surgery planned within 12 hours after enrollment; thrombotic event within 2 weeks before enrollment. In the ANNEXA-I study, the interventions were: n = 224 andexanet (high-dose bolus or low-dose bolus over 15–30 minutes, followed by continuous infusion over 2 hours) n = 228 usual care (determined by local physicians at their discretion including prothrombin complex concentrate). In the ANNEXA-I study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in hemostatic efficacy (67% vs. 53.1%; AD 13.4%, 95% CI 4.6 to 22.2). In the ANNEXA-I study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in hematoma volume shrinkage ≤ 35% (76.7% vs. 64.6%; AD 12.1%, 95% CI 3.6 to 20.5) No significant difference in NIHSS score change < 7 (87.9% vs. 83%; AD 4.6%, 95% CI -2 to 11.2) No significant difference in hematoma volume expansion ≥ 12.5 mL (11.1% vs. 16.8%; ARD -5.6, 95% CI -12 to 0.8). In the ANNEXA-I study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in death. significant difference in thrombotic events (10.3% vs. 5.6%). In the ANNEXA-I study, the conclusion was: in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage receiving factor Xa inhibitors, andexanet was superior to usual care with respect to hemostatic efficacy.

### The use of andexanet alfa and 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate in intracranial hemorrhage [^2cb1177c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

to describe the clinical and safety outcomes between andexanet alfa (AA) and 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) for the reversal of apixaban or rivaroxaban in the setting of an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).

Methods

A retrospective, multicentered descriptive study was conducted in hospitalized patients 18 years of age or older from June 2018 to October 2019 who received AA or 4F-PCC for the reversal of apixaban or rivaroxaban in the setting of ICH. Patients were excluded if they had received 4F-PCC prior to AA after its addition to the institution wide formulary. Other exclusion criteria were history or presence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or disseminated intravascular coagulation, estimated hematoma volume of > 60 mL, Glasgow Coma Scores < 7, or no repeat CT head scan. Information was collected from the electronic medical records. The primary outcome was the achievement of excellent or good hemostatic efficacy upon the repeat computer tomography (CT) scan performed after the infusion of study drugs. Secondary outcomes included disposition, survival to hospital discharge, 30-day readmission, length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, incidence of thromboembolic events.

Results

A total of 24 patients were included in the study, of which 9 received AA and 15 received 4F-PCC. The achievement of excellent or good hemostatic efficacy upon repeat CT scan occurred in 7 (77.8%) patients in the AA group and in 14 (93.3%) patients in the 4-F PCC group. All patients in the AA group survived to hospital discharge with no 30-day morality and 86.7% patients in the 4F-PCC group.

Conclusion

This study suggests that real-world clinical and safety outcomes between andexanet alfa and 4F-PCC for the reversal of factor Xa inhibitors in the setting of ICH are similar to ones reported in clinical trials.

### Reversal of anticoagulation in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage related to oral anticoagulants: state of the evidence [^37bdbe13]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

About 20%-25% of all intracerebral haemorrhages are associated with oral anticoagulation therapy. Reflecting changings prescription patterns in the general population, the spectrum of oral anticoagulation-associated intracerebral haemorrhage has substantially changed in the last decade. In many European countries, direct oral anticoagulant-associated intracerebral haemorrhage is now more frequent than vitamin K antagonist-associated intracerebral haemorrhage. Outcome in patients with anticoagulation-associated intracerebral haemorrhage is poor, likely mediated by a high incidence of haematoma expansion. Reversal of anticoagulation is an essential part of current care pathways for hyperacute treatment of intracerebral haemorrhage aiming to limit haematoma expansion and thereby improving outcome.

Methods

In this review, we summarise the latest evidence regarding reversal therapy for vitamin K antagonist-, direct thrombin inhibitor- and factor Xa inhibitor-associated intracerebral haemorrhage.

Findings

Two randomised controlled trials have shown that the use of prothrombin complex concentrate (compared to fresh frozen plasma) for reversing vitamin K antagonist-associated intracerebral haemorrhage and andexanet alfa (compared to usual care, mainly prothrombin complex concentrate) for factor Xa inhibitor-associated intracerebral haemorrhage had superior haemostatic efficacy. However, the incidence of thromboembolic complications was high in both trials. For reversal of Vitamin K antagonist-associated intracerebral haemorrhage, the overall rate was 18% but due to crossovers, it is impossible to determine the rate for any specific treatment. For factor-Xa inhibitor associated intracerebral haemorrhage, andexanet alfa led to an increase in the incidence of thromboembolic events. Moreover, these two randomised controlled trials were not powered to detect differences in mortality or functional outcomes and lacked long-term follow-up. Idarucizumab has shown promising results in a single-arm case series of patients with intracerebral haemorrhage associated with the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, yet no randomised controlled trial is available to support these findings.

Conclusion

Given that haematoma expansion is strongly associated with poor outcome, current evidence underlines the importance of rapid, targeted and effective reversal of anticoagulation in patients with anticoagulation-associated intracerebral haemorrhage. While haematoma expansion is a key prognostic factor, no randomised controlled trial has demonstrated a clear improvement in functional outcome. Future research should weigh the advantages of preventing haematoma expansion against the risks of increased thromboembolic events, and aim to identify the patients who would derive the most benefit from reversal treatments.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes associated with oral anticoagulant use among patients hospitalized with intracerebral hemorrhage [^ded3a081]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Unlike warfarin-related ICH, the best management strategy for FXa inhibitor–associated ICH remains uncertain. The 2019 European Stroke Organisation Guidelines, recommend andexanet-α in ICH with rivaroxaban or apixaban or prothrombin complex concentrate to normalize coagulation tests if specific reversal agents are not available. However, the quality of evidence is low because of a lack of randomized clinical trials and uncertainty regarding the benefit and harm of the reversal treatment. Comparing the impact of various reversal strategies can be difficult because of selection bias and concomitant medication use in ICH, making it hard to disentangle the effectiveness of various treatments. Furthermore, because anticoagulant levels are rarely captured, further research is required to measure clinical outcomes in the context of anticoagulant levels in addition to bleeding size and severity. In the subgroup of patients from hospitals reporting comprehensive stroke center data elements, we found that 53.4% of patients with FXa inhibitors received some form of reversal or replacement agent. Despite the high missing rates and no specific information regarding the reversal strategy, this finding suggests that reversal treatment was not uncommon among patients with ICH occurring during use of FXa inhibitors. Because our study was conducted before the approval of andexanet-α in the US, in the absence of head-to-head clinical trials, these data may be used as a historical control for future research to compare the efficacy and safety of andexanet-α vs nonspecific reversal treatment in patients with FXa inhibitor–associated ICH.

### Andexanet alfa versus four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for the reversal of apixaban-or rivaroxaban-associated intracranial hemorrhage: a propensity score-overlap weighted analysis [^61d80202]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The co-primary outcomes for this study were hemostatic effectiveness (excellent/good vs. poor/none) and 30-day all-cause mortality. Excellent/good hemostasis was defined as ≤ 35% increase in hematoma size from index to repeat scan at approximately 12 h after reversal administration. The repeat scan closest to 12 h was utilized whenever possible. If no repeat scan was available within 12 ± 5 h of reversal administration, then the worst scan within 24 h was used. If no repeat scan was available within 24 h, the patient was assumed to have had poor hemostatic effectiveness. Patients whose index or a repeat scan could not be accessed due to administrative reasons were excluded from this study (andexanet alfa: n = 7, 4F-PCC: n = 5). Volume was calculated for intracerebral and intraventricular bleeds using the abc/2 method while thickness was measured for subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhages.

Adjudicated hemostatic efficacy determinations from ANNEXA-4 were used for all andexanet alfa patients included in this study. A similar process was used to determine hemostatic effectiveness for patients treated with 4F-PCC, where an adjudication committee determined hemostatic efficacy in patients with ambiguous outcomes. Patients receiving 4F-PCC had their index and repeat scans read by two independent investigators. Hemostatic effectiveness for 4F-PCC patients was then adjudicated by investigator consensus using the published ANNEXA-4 criteria. If a patient had a multicompartmental bleed with contradictory hematoma size change, hemostatic efficacy was determined by achieving consensus between two independent investigators.

Secondary outcomes included thrombotic event occurrence during the first five days after reversal agent administration. The five-day time frame for thrombotic events was selected as it was a time point specifically reported in ANNEXA-4 and it reduced potential surveillance bias (which can occur when outcomes are sought with differential intensity across populations or over time, or according to care setting and/or patient characteristics) associated with post-discharge thrombotic events.

### Reversal of oral anticoagulation in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^dea31bcf]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and future directions

Significant progress has been achieved recently in large studies for the acute management of patients with OAC-ICH. All these therapeutic interventions mainly focus on reducing the occurrence and extent of hematoma enlargement (please see Fig. 1). On the one hand, blood pressure management targeting systolic levels of 140 mmHg has been verified to limit hematoma expansion and thus should be maintained attentively. On the other hand, optimal hemostatic management significantly restricts hemorrhage progression in all types of OAC-ICH. Specifically, in patients with VKA-ICH, complete reversal of elevated INR levels using prothrombin complex concentrates needs to be initiated immediately to stabilize the intracerebral hematoma. In patients with dabigatran-related ICH, prompt administration of the antidote idarucizumab achieves rapid hemostasis. Although clinical data of minimizing hematoma enlargement by idarucizumab are pending, the likelihood thereof results in a clear recommendation for idarucizumab in dabigatran-ICH. For patients with factor-Xa-inhibitor-associated ICH, andexanet alfa has been demonstrated to provide sufficient hemostasis and first unpublished data suggest effects on reducing hematoma progression in these patients. However, andexanet alfa currently is approved by the FDA only, whereas it is not available elsewhere in the world, and moreover has not been verified for treatment of all factor-Xa-inhibitors. Hence, hemostatic reversal management for factor-Xa-inhibitor-associated ICH remains challenging. Although not sufficiently backed by hemostasiological data, and no formally verified safety analysis, International Guidelines recommend prothrombin complex concentrates administration in dosages of 50 IU/kg bodyweight. Observational analysis on prothrombin complex concentrates administration in factor-Xa-inhibitor-associated ICH showed conflicting data on whether or not there are associations with reduced hemorrhage progression. Two major aspects need to be resolved in timely fashion: firstly, it requires a verification that antidotes, or other prothrombotic drugs respectively, significantly limit hematoma expansion and impact clinical outcomes, and secondly, the all over availability of those drugs needs to be ensured given an increasing worldwide demand.

### Acute care bundles should be used for patients with intracerebral haemorrhage: an expert consensus statement [^a9957d50]. European Stroke Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Components of a care bundle for ICH

Once the patient has been stabilised and diagnosis confirmed, ICH-specific care should be rapidly initiated (Table 1).

Table 1.
Individual interventions for possible inclusion in an acute, ICH-specific bundle of care.

Anticoagulation reversal

Haematoma expansion (HE) is associated with worse outcomes after ICH and occurs in around 30% of all ICH patients within 3 h of onset. The likelihood of HE increases to 54%in anticoagulated patients; thus, a critical component of any ICH care bundle is early anticoagulation reversal.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs): Rapid VKA reversal requires Vitamin K administration in addition to coagulation factor repletion. Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) reduce the INR quickly and efficiently, and are recommended by the European Stroke Organization and the American Heart Association. The benefit of this agent may be time dependent; in a large multicentre retrospective study of VKA-ICH, those receiving PCCs within 4 h (and had a systolic blood pressure [SBP] < 160 mmHg) had a rate of HE of 18%, compared to 44% in patients not achieving these values.

DOACs have become the first line anticoagulant for most patients, transforming the approach to anticoagulation reversal in ICH.

Factor IIa inhibitors (dabigatran): For this agent, there is a highly specific reversal agent, idarucizumab, a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds dabigatran and appears to be effective for haemostasis.
Factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban): The specific reversal agent available is andexanet alfa, a recombinant modified version of human Factor X. Of note, the use of andexanet alfa to reverse edoxaban is currently off-label in many countries. Andexanet alfa binds Factor Xa inhibitors and appears to be effective for haemostasis in patients within 18 h of their last DOAC dose. The ANNEXa-I randomised controlled trial (NCT03661528) has compared andexanet alfa with standard care (mainly PCC) in ICH patients within 6 h of symptom onset. Although not yet published, it has been presented at a major international conference and superior haemostatic efficacy with andexanet alfa is reported, at the cost of an increase in thrombotic complications, especially in those with a prior history of stroke or myocardial infarction.

### Andexanet alfa: a novel factor Xa inhibitor reversal agent [^e484818f]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: The purpose of this article is to review the available clinical trial data for andexanet alfa and its role in clinical practice. Data Sources: A MEDLINE/PubMed search was conducted (January 2000 to January 2019) using the keyword andexanet alfa for clinical trials. References of identified articles were searched by hand for additional citations. Study Selection and Data Extraction: We included English-language articles related to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of andexanet alfa or provided novel information regarding this drug entity. Data Synthesis: The findings of the review show that andexanet alfa may be a safe and effective option for the reversal of apixaban and rivaroxaban. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: With the approval of this reversal agent, patients and providers can feel safer when using apixaban and rivaroxaban, which in turn may increase the use of these anticoagulant agents. Conclusions: The new FDA approval of andexanet alfa will allow safer use of oral anticoagulants and will likely further the use of direct oral anticoagulants for anticoagulant needs. Reversing enoxaparin-/edoxaban-induced bleeding with this agent should be limited because there is no FDA approval owing to the fact that only phase II trial data available.

### Evaluation of andexanet alfa and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) for reversal of rivaroxaban-and apixaban-associated intracranial hemorrhages [^72898d60]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/Objective

Before approval of andexanet alfa, off-label treatment with 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) was often utilized for the management of life-threatening hemorrhages associated with oral factor Xa inhibitors. We evaluated the operational processes and outcomes of patients with oral factor Xa inhibitor-associated intracranial hemorrhages (ICH) treated with andexanet alfa or 4F-PCC.

Methods

We performed a retrospective, single-center case series of rivaroxaban or apixaban-associated ICH between 2016–2019 treated with andexanet alfa or 4F-PCC. Good or excellent hemostatic effectiveness, good functional outcome (Glasgow Outcome Score [GOS] > 3) at hospital discharge, and incidence of thrombosis within 30 days were reported.

Results

Eighteen patients were included in the andexanet alfa cohort and 11 in the 4F-PCC cohort. Excellent or good hemostasis occurred in 88.9% of andexanet alfa-treated patients and 60% of 4F-PCC-treated patients. Good functional outcome on discharge occurred in 55.6% of andexanet alfa-treated patients and 9.1% of 4F-PCC-treated patients. Thrombotic complications occurred in 16.7% of andexanet alfa-treated patients and 9.1% of 4F-PCC-treated patients. Median order-to-administration time was 1.1 hours [0.8–1.4] versus 0.5 hours [0.1–0.8] in the andexanet alfa and 4F-PCC group, respectively. The median cost of therapy was $29970/patient versus $6925/patient in the andexanet alfa and 4F-PCC group, respectively.

Conclusions

We observed higher rates of occurrence of good or excellent hemostasis and GOS > 3 on hospital discharge and increased incidence of thrombosis in patients who received andexanet alfa compared to 4F-PCC for oral factor Xa inhibitor reversal. However, patients receiving 4F-PCC had lower pre-reversal Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)score and larger pre-reversal ICH volume.

### Hematoma expansion and clinical outcomes in patients with factor-Xa inhibitor-related atraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage treated within the ANNEXA-4 trial versus real-world usual care [^0b8ecf16]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

It is unestablished whether andexanet alfa, compared with guideline-based usual care including prothrombin complex concentrates, is associated with reduced hematoma expansion (HE) and mortality in patients with factor-Xa inhibitor-related intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We compared the occurrence of HE and clinical outcomes in patients treated either with andexanet alfa or with usual care during the acute phase of factor-Xa inhibitor-related ICH.

Methods

Data were extracted from the multicenter, prospective, single-arm ANNEXA-4 trial (Andexanet Alfa, a Novel Antidote to the Anticoagulation Effects of Factor Xa Inhibitors) and a multicenter observational cohort study, RETRACE-II (German-Wide Multicenter Analysis of Oral Anticoagulant-Associated Intracerebral Hemorrhage - Part Two). HE was based on computed tomography scans performed within 36 hours from baseline imaging. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was performed to adjust for baseline comorbidities and ICH severity. Patients presenting with atraumatic ICH while receiving apixaban or rivaroxaban within 18 hours of admission were included. Patients with secondary ICH or not fulfilling the inclusion criteria for the ANNEXA-4 trial were excluded. We compared ANNEXA-4 patients, who received andexanet alfa for hemostatic treatment, with RETRACE-II patients who were treated with usual care, primarily administration of prothrombin complex concentrates. Primary outcome was rate of HE defined as relative increase of ≥ 35%. Secondary outcomes comprised mean absolute change in hematoma volume, as well as in-hospital mortality and functional outcome.

Results

Overall, 182 patients with factor-Xa inhibitor-related ICH (85 receiving andexanet alfa versus 97 receiving usual care) were selected for analysis. There were no relevant differences regarding demographic or clinical characteristics between both groups. HE occurred in 11 of 80 (14%) andexanet alfa patients compared with 21 of 67 (36%) usual care patients (adjusted relative risk, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.20–0.78]; P = 0.005), with a reduction in mean overall hematoma volume change of 7 mL. There were no statistically significant differences among in-hospital mortality or functional outcomes. Sensitivity analysis including only usual care patients receiving prothrombin complex concentrates demonstrated consistent results.

Conclusions

As compared with usual care, andexanet alfa was associated with a lower rate of HE in atraumatic factor-Xa inhibitor-related ICH, however, without translating into significantly improved clinical outcomes. A comparative trial is needed to confirm the benefit on limiting HE and to explore clinical outcomes across patient subgroups and by time to treatment.

### Andexanet alfa versus four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for the reversal of apixaban-or rivaroxaban-associated intracranial hemorrhage: a propensity score-overlap weighted analysis [^e3ff4bf7]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Baseline characteristics were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Categorical variables were reported as percentage and continuous variables as means ± standard deviations. Propensity score model–eligible variables with < 10% missing data had missing values imputed using a multiple imputation approach based on a fully conditional specification linear regression model including all available covariates and outcomes. Absolute standardized differences (ASDs) were calculated for each variable prior to propensity score-overlap weighting to illustrate the magnitude of imbalance between arms at baseline (an ASD > 0.1 was considered to represent a relevant difference).

For hemostatic effectiveness, mortality, and thrombotic events, propensity score-overlap weighted binomial (logit) generalized estimating equations with a robust estimator were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

We performed a sensitivity analysis whereby attainment of hemostatic effectiveness (or lack thereof) for patients without a repeat scan within 24 h was adjudicated based on clinical judgement by two independent investigators after a review of outcomes (e.g. need for unplanned surgery, subsequent administration of reversal agent, mortality) rather than being assumed to represent poor/no effectiveness. Propensity scores were re-calculated for the sensitivity analysis.

A subgroup analysis of patients with only an intracerebral and/or intraventricular hemorrhage and available pre- and post-scans evaluated the above-mentioned outcomes and the absolute change in hematoma volume in mL from index to repeat scan. The subgroup analysis used propensity scores based on a logistic regression model where total bleed volume in mL on index scan (continuous) was substituted for bleed size ≥ 10 mL/mm. A propensity score-overlap weighted linear generalized estimating equation with a robust estimator was used to determine the mean difference between andexanet alfa and 4F-PCC in hematoma volume from index to repeat scan.

In all cases, a P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All database management and statistical analysis were performed using IBM SPSS version 27.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY). This report was written to comply with the Reporting of Studies Conducted Using Observational Routinely Collected Health Data for Pharmacoepidemiology (RECORD-PE) statement.

### Evaluation of oral factor Xa inhibitor-associated extracranial bleeding reversal with andexanet alfa [^d97666fd]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Quantifying the reduction in anti‐FXa activity in blood was used as the outcome to register andexanet alfa as a reversal agent. 11 The ANNEXA‐4 trial demonstrated that a reduction in anti‐FXa activity in blood correlates poorly to hemostatic effectiveness in extracranial bleeding. 20 In our cohort, pre‐ and post‐reversal drug‐specific anti‐FXa levels were not routinely ordered, nor were they reported in the other real‐world studies of andexanet alfa reversal. 17, 18, 21, 22 Moreover, results of the rivaroxaban and apixaban‐anti‐FXa assays may not be available until after the time window in which decisions must be made concerning management of life‐threatening bleeding, limiting their clinical applicability. Considering the yet unknown cost‐effectiveness of both reversal strategies, prospective randomized studies are needed to determine the position of 4F‐PCC and andexanet alfa within management protocols for FXa inhibitor‐associated bleeding for both intracranial and extracranial bleeding.

We discuss the impact of this licensure on current practice and review in detail the problems of a neglected and growing clinical area: reversing the anticoagulation effect of factor Xa inhibitors in bleeding trauma patients. We identify areas of practice that need research so that care of bleeding trauma patients receiving direct factor Xa inhibitors can be improved.

### Andexanet alpha versus four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate in DOACs anticoagulation reversal: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^3c828284]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

The rate of ICH due to factor Xa inhibitors is believed to be about one in 500–1000 per patient-year and the rate of non-intracranial haemorrhages is near 19 per 100 patient-year. Although DOACs seem at least as safe as the old Vitamin K antagonists in terms of the incidence of ICH (7% vs 11%), evidence for the best reversal strategy for the anticoagulant effect is still lacking. Recently, the first (and so far, unique) RCT that directly compares Andexanet alpha to the usual therapy (i.e. 4F-PCC) was published, called ANNEXA-I. The expectation of the results of this study was proportional to the controversies arising from its publication. The main criticisms were the primary outcome and the high patient rate in the control group without any treatment. The primary outcome of the trial was the expansion of intracerebral hematoma less than 35% of the volume at 12 h after administration of the drug. There was a statistically significant difference for the group of patients who were given Andexanet alpha (67.0% vs 53.1%) in this regard. However, the 30-day mortality rate was not statistically significant between the two groups. This result was achieved even though approximately 15% of patients in the control group did not receive any treatment (the so-called "passive reversal" strategy). In addition, the intervention group showed a higher rate of thromboembolic events (i.e. myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, etc.) than the control group (10.3% vs 5.6%). Our meta-analysis confirms that there are no significant differences in short-term all-cause mortality between the two groups, which is consistent with the results of most of the studies (both controlled and retrospective). However, the ANNEXA-I study, like most of the studies included in this meta-analysis, was not designed to address mortality as a primary outcome. In fact, mortality is influenced by the location of bleeding, the patient's clinical condition, as well as the extent of bleeding. In addition, ANNEXA-I is the only trial that has set inclusion criteria that exclude GCS score < 7 or NHISS score > 35, as well as scheduled surgery less than 12 h. Due to their retrospective nature, other studies on ICH patients do not have any specific exclusion criteria for severity of bleeding. However, ANNEXA-I did not demonstrate any significant advantage in using Andexanet-alpha over 4F-PCC in terms of short-term mortality. Although in this study patients were theoretically less severe than other studies, the overall mortality rate in the ANNEXA-I study was not significantly different from other studies on patients with ICH (23% for ANNEXA-I vs 27%, median value in the other studies). In this respect, the mortality rate was homogeneous (i.e. around 20%) for studies on non-ICH patients, while in studies on ICH population, the mortality rate varied from 8%, as reported by Oh et al. to 47% of Milioglou et al. (Table 2 S in Supplemental Material).

### Evaluation of direct oral anticoagulant reversal agents in intracranial hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7269a5de]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Andexanet Alfa

AA received FDA approval in 2018. ANNEXA-4 was a multicentered, prospective studythat enrolled 171 patients with FXaI-associated ICH and reported an anticoagulation reversal rate of 80.7%, a mortality rate of 14%, and a thromboembolic complication rate of 10%. Since then, multiple small retrospective studies in patients with ICH, have reported rates of anticoagulation reversal between 50% and 91%; mortality, between 9% and 39%; and thrombotic complications, between 0% and 31%. Our meta-analysis showed a combined proportion of anticoagulation reversal of 75%, a mortality rate of 24%, and thromboembolic event rate of 14% (Figures 1–3).

The lack of control group data in most studies limits our understanding of AA's comparative effectiveness and safety profile relative to 4F-PCC. The subanalysis of 8 studies, that compared 4F-PCC with AA for DOAC reversal in patients with ICH showed no differences in safety or proportion of anticoagulation reversed between the reversal agents (Figure 4).

### Andexanet alfa versus four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for the reversal of apixaban-or rivaroxaban-associated intracranial hemorrhage: a propensity score-overlap weighted analysis [^ef33b6ee]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The results of this analysis also align with other indirect comparison studies for andexanet alfa versus usual care-treated patients with FXa inhibitor bleeding in the UK and Germany. Cohen and colleagues compared propensity score (model based on age, bleed location, history of atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, stroke, renal dysfunction, and cancer)–adjusted cohorts of andexanet alfa- and PCC-managed FXa inhibitor major bleeding patients. As in our study, the andexanet alfa cohort was derived from ANNEXA-4, while a synthetic control arm of PCC patients was drawn from the prospective, observational ORANGE study (which assessed the presentation and clinical outcomes of major bleeding episodes associated with oral anticoagulant use in the UK between October 2013 and August 2016). Among patients presenting with intracranial hemorrhage from either study (total n = 258), andexanet alfa use was associated with a 67% relative risk (RR) reduction in 30-day mortality (p < 0.001). Cohen and colleagues did not report data on hemostatic effectiveness or thrombotic outcomes. Huttner et al. compared an andexanet alfa cohort from ANNEXA-4 to a synthetic control arm of patients treated with "usual care" in patients with FXa inhibitor–related intracerebral hemorrhage derived from the German RETRACE II study. Like our study, their analysis found a lower risk of poor/none hemostasis with andexanet alfa versus usual care (unadjusted incidences: 14% vs. 36%; adjusted RR = 0.40; 95% CI 0.20–0.78), however, there was no statistically significant difference in in-hospital mortality between the two treatments (unadjusted incidence: 16.5% vs. 20.6%; adjusted HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.24–1.04). The present analysis builds on these indirect comparisons by measuring outcomes within a large population of patients with intracranial hemorrhage within the USA.

### Time to hemostatic agent administration increases mortality in veterans with factor Xa inhibitor-related intracranial hemorrhage [^5fc49f89]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The two hemostatic agents utilized for reversal of life-threatening hemorrhage associated with Factor Xa (fXa) inhibition are andexanet alfa (AA) and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC). In May 2018, AA was approved with possible superior short-term hemostatic efficacy but has been linked with higher rates of thrombotic events. Considering these concerns, the absence of high-quality comparative studies, and the higher cost compared to other agents, four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate remained the more utilized agent. There is a critical need for real-world data from large-scale databases describing the reversal of fXa inhibitors using AA compared to 4F-PCC to determine their time to hemostatic treatment and its effect on patient outcomes and mortality.

Methods

This was a national retrospective cohort from the Veteran Health Administration of AA or 4 F-PCC usage between January 1, 2018 to January 1, 2024. The primary endpoint was time to hemostatic treatment. The secondary endpoints were 30-day thrombotic events and 90-day mortality, which were validated through manual chart review. Demographic and treatment variables were summarized using descriptive statistics. The two sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test was utilized on the primary endpoint. A multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between 90-day mortality and time to hemostatic treatment.

Results

There were 19,015 Veterans with ICH; 246 (AA n = 89; 4F-PCC n = 157) of the Veterans that received an fXa inhibitor within 180 days in the emergency department were included in the study. Most Veterans were male (96.4%) and elderly. Apixaban was the most utilized anticoagulant, and intracerebral hemorrhage was the most common type of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). There was no difference in the primary endpoint of time to hemostatic treatment between the groups (AA group median: 203 min (IQR 140–283) vs. 4F-PCC median: 200 min (IQR 137–299), p = 0.70). 90-day mortality was 19.1% where the odds of 90-day mortality increased by 0.4% for each additional minute of time to hemostatic agent administration (odds ratio [OR] 1.004, 95% confidence interval ([CI] 1.001–1.006).

Conclusion

In Veterans with fXa inhibitor-related ICH receiving AA or 4F-PCC, there was no difference between AA and 4F-PCC in time to hemostatic treatment. Time to hemostatic agent administration increased odds of 90-mortality by 0.4% for every minute, but did not differ depending on the hemostatic agent used.

### Association of biomarkers with intracerebral hematoma expansion and arterial thromboembolic events in patients with acute intracranial hemorrhage: the ANNEXA-I biomarker substudy [^e48d96e7]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is the most feared complication of anticoagulant treatment and associated with major morbidity and mortality. The ANNEXA-I trial (Andexanet Alfa, a Novel Antidote to the Anticoagulation Effects of FXA Inhibitors) demonstrated that in patients who experienced acute ICH during treatment with an FXa (factor Xa) inhibitor, reversal of anticoagulation with andexanet compared with usual care reduced hematoma expansion. Andexanet was also associated with an increase in arterial thromboembolic events, including ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction.

Andexanet reverses the anticoagulant effect of FXa inhibitors, including apixaban, rivaroxaban, or edoxaban, and in the ANNEXA-I trial, the relative effect of andexanet compared with usual care on hematoma expansion appeared to be consistent irrespective of baseline risk. Previous reports have demonstrated that time between symptom onset and presentation, as well as baseline hematoma volume, and time to treatment predict hematoma expansion. The mechanism by which andexanet reduces the risk of hematoma expansion and increases risk of arterial thrombosis remains incompletely understood.

The aim of this article was to explore in the ANNEXA-I data set whether change from baseline in anti-FXa activity or endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) is associated with outcome and thereby might explain the effects of andexanet on hematoma expansion or risk of arterial thromboembolic events.

### Andexanet alfa versus four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for the reversal of apixaban-or rivaroxaban-associated intracranial hemorrhage: a propensity score-overlap weighted analysis [^c3a8a6f6]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Upon subgroup analysis restricted to patients with a single compartment, intracerebral, and/or intraventricular hemorrhage, 47 andexanet alfa and 37 4F-PCC patients were available for analysis. Baseline characteristics of these patients after propensity score (re-calculated for the subgroup)–overlap weighting are provided in Table 3. Hemostatic effectiveness results were similar in direction and magnitude to those observed in the full analysis population with 78.2% (95% CI 69.1–85.6) of the andexanet alfa-treated and 67.7% (95% CI 57.4–76.9) of the 4F-PCC-treated population achieving hemostatic effectiveness, though differences in hemostatic effectiveness were not statistically significant in this subgroup analysis (OR 1.71 [95% CI 0.36–8.11] for achieving hemostatic effectiveness for andexanet alfa vs. 4F-PCC). Baseline total intracerebral and/or intraventricular hematoma volume was 7.3 mL in both arms. At the repeat scan, the increase in hematoma volume was 0.83 mL with andexanet alfa and 4.73 mL with 4F-PCC, a difference that was not statistically significant (Table 4).

### Evaluation of direct oral anticoagulant reversal agents in intracranial hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f59e74f5]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) to prevent stroke and systemic embolism and for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) for coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral artery disease to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events. Over the last decade, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have become preferred over warfarin. At the time of their approval, there were no specific antidotes to reverse DOAC-related bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Annually, 0.1% to 0.2% of patients receiving DOACs experience ICH. This group's risk factors for morbidity and mortality include older age, higher hematoma volumes, and hematoma expansion.

Initially, nonspecific DOAC reversal agents such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (A-PCC), and 4-factor PCC (4F-PCC) showed promising safety and anticoagulation reversal in DOAC-related bleeding. In 2015, the FDA approved the use of idarucizumab to reverse the effects of dabigatran, which marked the introduction of the first specific reversal agent for DOACs. In 2018, andexanet alfa was approved to reverse factor Xa inhibitors (FXaI). While the safety data from these landmark trials were promising, head-to-head trials have not compared the safety and outcomes of idarucizumab or andexanet alfa (AA) with traditional nonspecific reversal agents (FFP, 4F-PCC, or A-PCC). Such comparisons are limited to data generated from case series and cohort studies. This systematic review summarizes the safety and anticoagulation reversal success of non-specific and targeted DOAC reversal agents in patients with DOAC-related ICH.

Prothrombin Complex Concentrate in Intracranial Bleeding

Numerous investigations have focused on intracerebral hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury to prevent further hemorrhagic progression in anticoagulated patients receiving oral anticoagulants including VKAs and DOACs. Despite the heterogeneity of study designs, the use of 4F-PCCs for intracerebral hemorrhage in anticoagulated patients is reported with favorable outcomes in terms of INR reversal for VKA-treated patients as well as 30-day mortality and thromboembolic events in oral anticoagulated patients. – A propensity score–weighted analysis of patients with apixaban- or rivaroxaban-associated intracerebral hemorrhage found that andexanet alfa demonstrated superior hemostatic efficacy and survival compared to 4F-PCC. However, this effect was not observed in retrospective cohorts of similar patients. Other systematic reviews, lacking randomized clinical trials, have failed to demonstrate significant differences in the effectiveness of DOAC reversal in cases of intracerebral hemorrhage. However, a recent randomized controlled trial involving 530 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage on factor Xa inhibitors found that andexanet alfa resulted in better control of hematoma expansion (67% vs. 53.1%; adjusted difference, 13.4; 95% CI, 4.6 to 22.2; P = 0.003) compared to usual care, which included PCC, emphasizing that both groups achieved effective hemostasis. Nevertheless, andexanet alfa was associated with an increased incidence of thrombotic events (10.3% vs. 5.6%; adjusted difference, 4.6; 95% CI, 0.1 to 9.2; P = 0.048), including ischemic stroke (6.5% vs. 1.5%). In cases of mild traumatic brain injury, the use of 4F-PCC for factor Xa inhibitor–associated intracerebral hemorrhage did not affect the incidence or degree of hemorrhage progression and did not result in an increased rate of thromboembolic events based on retrospective observational data. The efficacy of 4F-PCC in reversing factor Xa inhibitor–related intracerebral hemorrhage was comparable to its efficacy in warfarin-related intracerebral hemorrhage, as demonstrated in a meta-analysisand a subsequent multicenter retrospective cohort study.

### Reversal of oral anticoagulation in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^f344b1dc]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Specifically, focusing on patients with ICH, study results are not published but have been reported at the International Stroke Conference 2019. In 71 ICH patients eligible for efficacy analyses, HE was reported in 15 patients assessed at 1 h and in 1 patient assessed at 12 h. Therefore, the HE rate can be considered to be at 22% (n = 16/71) in ICH patients after andexanet infusion, theoretically again comparable to dabigatran-associated and VKA-associated ICH patients receiving reversal treatment. Interestingly, for the entire cohort, no correlation between hemostatic efficacy and decreased anti-factor-Xa activity was noted, but in ICH patients, a moderate correlation could be shown as area under the curve of 0.64, 95% CI (53–74). A debated matter of concern for this study was the reported thrombotic event rate of 10% (n = 34/352) including 4% (n = 15) with ischemic stroke and 4% (n = 13%) with deep vein thrombosis in light of elevated laboratory surrogates (d-dimer, prothrombin fragments 1 and 2). ANNEXA-4 is still ongoing to further evaluate also patients with edoxaban associated hemorrhages and for more detailed analyses of ICH patients. However, comparing the estimated treatment cost (based on US data) of reversal agents suggests a large discrepancy between idarucizumab (5495 USD) or 4-factor PCC (4000 IU, 5080 USD) and andexanet alfa ranging between 24,000 and 48,000 USD. So far, andexanet alfa is only approved in the USA. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has agreed to consider andexanet alfa (Ondexxya®) for fast track approval provided results of the ongoing trial. Outside the USA, andexanet alfa can (theoretically already now) be purchased through international pharmacies at extremely expensive costs.

### Reversal of oral anticoagulation in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^5ac924ea]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

In summary, for factor-Xa inhibitor-related ICH, through providing fast and sufficient effect on hemostasis, andexanet alfa harbors several limitations which make administration more complex as compared to idarucizumab. The hemostatic rebound, the need for continuous infusion, the reported prothrombotic complications, and the financial aspects bare the risk that andexanet alfa will ultimately not be used as frequently as necessary. In addition, similar to idarucizumab, data on HE rates and clinical outcomes are necessary in order to verify clinical relevance of andexanet alfa in ICH patients.

Unspecific reversal approaches

PCC for factor-Xa inhibitor-associated ICH

Three categories of human plasma compounds — prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) — are currently available to restore altered coagulation, i.e. 3-factor PCC (II, IX, X), 4-factor PCC (II, VII, IX, X), and activated PCC (activated VII, II, IX, X, FEIBA). Experimental data and mostly phase I randomized data have suggested that PCC may have potential to reverse anticoagulation induced by factor-Xa inhibitors. For direct comparisons of these factor concentrates, most data is present for anticoagulation treatment with rivaroxaban and edoxaban suggesting effects of 4-factor PCC over 3-factor PCC and FEIBA being comparable if not superior to 4-factor PCC to reverse coagulation. A small cross-over study in 10 healthy volunteers, treated with dabigatran and rivaroxaban, suggested that thrombin generation was improved best by activated 4-factor PCC measured by ex vivo hemostatic testing of PCC derivatives in rivaroxaban-treated but not in dabigatran-treated patients. Direct human in vivo comparisons between FEIBA and 4-factor PCC are not available. Clinically more convincing are data investigated in 35 healthy individuals receiving PCC, comparing 3-factor with 4-factor PCC, which showed for both agents possible reversal properties after rivaroxaban treatment. The largest randomized study was conducted in 110 healthy edoxaban-treated (single dose 60 mg) individuals and compared dosing regimens using 4-factor PCC (50 IU/kg BW, 25 IU/kg BW, 10 IU/kg BW) and determined effect based on bleeding duration and volume after dermal punch biopsy. Results provided that PCC administered only at 50 IU per kg body weight influenced both bleeding endpoints supporting a potential role for in unspecific reversal. No adverse events occurred that were adjudicated to be related to the study medication.

### Tranexamic acid for intracerebral hemorrhage in patients on non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (TICH-NOAC): a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^9d9fd0c4]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Although TICH-NOAC did not reach its target sample size, which precludes any definitive conclusions, there was no clear signal for potential efficacy in any of the predefined outcomes. The rate of HE, which we chose as our primary dichotomous outcome based on considerations discussed elsewhere, was high in both treatment groups, and only 7% — nonsignificantly — lower with TXA compared with placebo. The rate of death by 90 days was also quite similar in both treatment arms at over 40%. This high rate of poor outcomes is consistent with previous observational data on NOAC-associated ICH – and underlines the pressing unmet need for effective treatments. Of note, our subgroup analysis showed no signal for a synergistic effect between TXA and 4fPCC, which might have been expected considering their distinct hemostatic mechanisms (the former blocking fibrinolysis and the latter counteracting the anticoagulant effect of the NOAC by replenishing coagulation factors). Whether NOAC-specific hemostatic treatments might be more effective than nonspecific ones, such as TXA or even its combination with 4fPCC, remains to be determined. The ongoing ANNEXa-I trial will provide evidence about the efficacy of specific reversal of factor Xa inhibitors with andexanet alfa in NOAC-associated ICH. In the meantime, our finding of a potential beneficial effect of TXA in the subgroup of participants who would have qualified for ANNEXa-I strengthens confidence in the appropriateness of this trial's selection criteria.

### Andexanet alfa versus four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for the reversal of apixaban-or rivaroxaban-associated intracranial hemorrhage: a propensity score-overlap weighted analysis [^dbac619a]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite these strengths, our study has some limitations. First, we did not have data on incidence of early (within 24 h) do not resuscitate orders (DNR) or withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy. Patients receiving andexanet alfa and 4F-PCC were well-balanced on identified predictors of mortality (including baseline GCS score, infratentorial bleeding, larger hematoma volumes, and multicompartment bleeding) making a difference in the incidence of DNR orders and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy between groups less likely. Second, we only reported thromboembolic events occurring in the first five days after reversal administration. While ANNEXA-4 prospectively followed andexanet alfa patients for thrombotic events through 30 days, our dependence on EHR data (and not scheduled follow-up) for 4F-PCC patients made identification and verification of thrombotic events after 4F-PCC administration post-hospital discharge less reliable. Moreover, investigators in the prospective ANNEXA-4 study actively surveilled for thrombotic events, whereas clinicians in routine practice were less likely to do so, which could have biased the detection of thrombotic events against andexanet alfa. Of note, the five-day time point for thrombotic events utilized in our study was based on the time stratifications reported within the ANNEXA-4 study (< 6, 6–14, and 15–30 days after andexanet alfa administration) and a recent study by Miao and colleagues, which demonstrated that five to six days is the median hospital length of stay for atrial fibrillation patients experiencing an intracranial hemorrhage. Third, based upon our study's inclusion criteria, our findings are most applicable to an apixaban- or rivaroxaban-associated intracranial hemorrhage population with baseline GCS scores ≥ 8 and hematoma volumes ≤ 60 mL managed in the USA. Even though ANNEXA-4 included patients from the USA, Canada, and Europe, our analysis restricted inclusion in both arms to intracranial hemorrhage patients treated at a US hospital. This was deemed necessary to avoid potential confounding due to discrepancies in treatment practices from country to country (e.g. reversal agent dosing, time of repeat scans, etc.). Since 100% of 4F-PCC patients for this study were treated in the USA, "country" could not be included in our propensity score model (and weighted for). Additionally, the external validity of our results should be viewed in context of 4F-PCC dosing utilized in our study (which was at prescribers' discretion). Approximately three out of every four patients in the 4F-PCC cohort of our study received a 25 u/kg dose of 4F-PCC. Some guidelines have recommended higher doses of 4F-PCC (37.5–50 u/kg) to reverse FXa inhibitor-associated uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding, while others have endorsed low, fixed doses of 2,000 units or doses ranging between 10 and 25 units/kg with a repeated dose in 1 to 2 h if needed. The level of evidence supporting these 4F-PCC dosing recommendations are generally acknowledged as low (based on studies assessing the correction of anticoagulant-induced laboratory abnormalities or punch biopsy studies) and the strength of recommendations deemed weak. Multiple studies comparing the hemostatic effectiveness of lower (25 u/kg, < 30 u/kg, or < 35 u/kg) and higher (≥ 30 u/kg, ≥ 35 u/kg, or 50 u/kg) 4F-PCC doses have failed to show significant differences between dosing strategies. Fourth, as this was not a randomized controlled trial, the risk of confounding bias exists. We attempted to mitigate this risk by implementing propensity score-overlap weighting; however, residual confounding due to unobserved or unmeasured covariates cannot be ruled out. Fifth, anti-FXa assays were not available in most 4F-PCC patients in the synthetic control arm since obtaining these levels was not standard practice. As a result, anti-FXa levels could not be adjusted for or used to assess effectiveness in the present study, and it is not known if patients in the 4F-PCC arm had similar levels of anticoagulation to those in the ANNEXA-4 trial. Next, our 4F-PCC arm included three patients with moderate to severe dementia. Due to the need to provide informed consent by patients or their medical proxies (unless an exception for informed consent for emergency procedures was obtained), such patients may have been excluded in ANNEXA-4. It is unclear what impact the inclusion of moderate to severe dementia patients may have had on our study's results. Finally, due to insufficient sample size, our ability to perform subgroup and sensitivity analyses was limited. We performed a sensitivity analysis limited to a single compartment, intracerebral/intraventricular bleeds only. While this subanalysis was likely underpowered, the results were directionally consistent with the overall population analysis.

### Reversal of oral anticoagulation in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^820f88f2]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

In light of an aging population with increased cardiovascular comorbidity, the use of oral anticoagulation (OAC) is steadily expanding. A variety of pharmacological alternatives to vitamin K antagonists (VKA) have emerged over recent years (direct oral anticoagulants, DOAC, i.e., dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) which show a reduced risk for the occurrence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Yet, in the event of ICH under OAC (OAC-ICH), hematoma characteristics are similarly severe and clinical outcomes likewise substantially limited in both patients with VKA- and DOAC-ICH, which is why optimal acute hemostatic treatment in all OAC-ICH needs to be guaranteed. Currently, International Guidelines for the hemostatic management of patients with OAC-ICH are updated as several relevant large-sized observational studies and recent trials have established treatment approaches for both VKA- and DOAC-ICH. While the management of VKA-ICH is mainly based on the immediate reversal of elevated levels of international normalized ratio using prothrombin complex concentrates, hemostatic management of DOAC-associated ICH is challenging requiring specific antidotes, notably idarucizumab and andexanet alfa. This review will provide an overview of the latest studies and trials on hemostatic reversal agents and timing and summarizes the effects on hemorrhage progression and clinical outcomes in patients with OAC-ICH.

### Evaluation of oral factor Xa inhibitor-associated extracranial bleeding reversal with andexanet alfa [^16c475a6]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

We report a 19% incidence of ischemic complications, which falls within the 0% to 31% range reported in previous andexanet alfa reversal studies. 17, 18, 20, 21, 22 Importantly, andexanet alfa is not a procoagulant agent, but a decoy molecule that temporarily impairs anti‐FXa activity. The patient's baseline risk of ischemic complications reconstitutes by withholding anticoagulant medication. It is therefore important to continually assess if it is medically appropriate to restart anticoagulation in the setting of bleeding complications.

Designing clinical guidelines for use of andexanet alfa is particularly challenging, given the paucity of clinical evidence on its effectiveness and safety. Further difficulty arises from the inability to ascertain the degree of oral FXa inhibitor‐exposure in a timely and accurate manner, as the time since last oral FXa administration is often unknown and apixaban‐ and rivaroxaban‐specific anti‐FXa assays may not be available or processed immediately by an institution's laboratory. At one of our institutions, cut‐off points were determined to allow for rapid decision making by front line clinicians. Using a heparin‐calibrated anti‐FXa assay, levels of < 0.1 IU/mL were interpreted as clinically irrelevant levels of Xa inhibitor, whereas for levels > 1.0 IU/mL a reasonable impact of FXa inhibitors on bleeding was to be expected, and reversal agents could be used. 23, 24 For values in between, a hematology consult was required, as factors such as renal function and time since last dose should be weighed by an expert provider. Comorbidities and frailty of patients with FXa inhibitor‐associated bleeding may additionally impact the efficacy and safety of andexanet alfa therapy; however, this association could not be confirmed in our study. Furthermore, ethical and economic considerations should be considered, which are not addressed in this article.

2.1 Outcomes

The primary outcome of interest was hemostatic effectiveness within 24 hours after bolus infusion, assessed using the criteria set by Sarode et al, and used in the ANNEXA‐4 study. 12, 19, 20 Serial Hct and Hgb values, additional coagulation interventions and transfusion requirement, and objective clinical signs of continued bleeding were collected from the patients' medical records, as well as the timepoints associated with these findings. Thereafter, two authors (CN, LN) independently classified the hemostatic effectiveness for each patient based on the cut‐off values set out by Sarode et al, followed by comparison of both authors' assessments. Secondary outcomes of interest were the in‐hospital incidence of clinically important thrombotic and ischemic episodes post‐reversal, ICU and hospital length of stay, and in‐hospital mortality. Ischemic events were reported if they were confirmed on radiographic imaging or by an attending surgeon during a procedure; a "suspected" ischemic event was therefore not included as an ischemic complication.

### Evaluation of oral factor Xa inhibitor-associated extracranial bleeding reversal with andexanet alfa [^af3d2340]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

We found andexanet alfa reversal for FXa inhibitor‐associated extracranial bleeding had a lower rate of hemostatic effectiveness compared with previous studies on DOAC‐associated bleeding. In prior studies evaluating reversal of FXa inhibitor‐associated bleeding with andexanet alfa, hemostatic effectiveness ranged from 57% to 91%, compared to 48% in our cohort. 17, 18, 20, 21, 22 The relatively low rate of hemostatic effectiveness found in our study is potentially explained through differences in patient selection, as patients requiring surgical intervention were excluded in the ANNEXA‐4 trial. 20 Moreover, the timing of reversal, as well as surgical and other hemostatic interventions, potentially influenced the hemostatic effectiveness. In our study we report a median 106 minutes between admission and antidote administration, and 64 minutes between antidote administration and surgical intervention on those patients who required it. Both the time to reversal and the time to surgery fall within the ranges of previous studies that reported it. 17, 18, 22 Considering the short half‐lives of FXa inhibitors, a delay in administering andexanet alfa will mean a slight reduction of anti‐FXa plasma levels, which also depends on the patient's ability to clear the drug. It remains to be studied if this delay influences the effectiveness of andexanet alfa in this population.

### Association of biomarkers with intracerebral hematoma expansion and arterial thromboembolic events in patients with acute intracranial hemorrhage: the ANNEXA-I biomarker substudy [^0f0c24f9]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

ANNEXA-I (Andexanet Alfa, a Novel Antidote to the Anticoagulation Effects of FXA Inhibitors) was a randomized trial that demonstrated that andexanet compared with usual care in patients with intracranial hemorrhage associated with FXa (factor Xa) inhibitor treatment reduces the risk of hematoma expansion and increases the risk of arterial thromboembolic events.

Methods

In a secondary analysis of the ANNEXA-I trial, we compared the effects of andexanet with usual care on change in anti-FXa activity and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We examined the associations between 1-hour reduction in anti-FXa and 1-hour increase in ETP and hematoma expansion at 12 hours (≥ 12.5 mL or percentage volume change ≥ 35%) using logistic regression, both unadjusted and adjusted for time from symptom onset to baseline scan, baseline diastolic blood pressure, hematoma volume, baseline biomarker level and time from baseline scan to treatment, and association with arterial thromboembolic events (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and systemic embolism) during 30 days of follow-up using Cox regression, both unadjusted and adjusted for age, baseline biomarker level, prior MI, and eligibility for treatment with high-dose andexanet.

Results

ANNEXA-I enrolled 530 patients. Among 438 patients with baseline anti-FXa results, andexanet compared with usual care reduced anti-FXa activity at 1 hour (median, 8.6 versus 97.5 ng/mL; median reduction from baseline, 98.3 versus 10.9 ng/mL; P < 0.001). Among 328 patients with baseline ETP data, andexanet compared with usual care increased ETP at 1 hour (median, 1573.5 versus 874.5 nmol/L-min; median increase, 753.1 versus 126.6 nmol/L-min; P < 0.001). In adjusted analyses, reduction in anti-FXa at 1 hour was associated with reduced hematoma expansion (per 100 ng/mL: odds ratio, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.53–0.92]; P = 0.010), and increase in ETP at 1 hour was associated with reduced hematoma expansion (per 100 nmol/L-min: odds ratio, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.90–0.99]; P = 0.019) and risk of thromboembolic events (per 100 nmol/L-min: odds ratio, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.00–1.16]; P = 0.047).

Conclusions

In patients with apixaban- or rivaroxaban-associated intracranial hemorrhage, andexanet compared with usual care produces greater reduction in anti-FXa and greater increase in ETP at 1 hour. Reduction in anti-FXa from baseline to 1 hour is independently associated with reduced hematoma expansion, and increase in ETP from baseline to 1 hour is independently associated with both reduced hematoma expansion and increase of thromboembolic events.

In adjusted analyses, reduction in anti-FXa at 1 hour was associated with reduced hematoma expansion (per 100 ng/mL: odds ratio, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.53–0.92]; P = 0.010), and increase in ETP at 1 hour was associated with reduced hematoma expansion (per 100 nmol/L-min: odds ratio, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.90–0.99]; P = 0.019) and risk of thromboembolic events (per 100 nmol/L-min: odds ratio, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.00–1.16]; P = 0.047).

CONCLUSIONS:

In patients with apixaban- or rivaroxaban-associated intracranial hemorrhage, andexanet compared with usual care produces greater reduction in anti-FXa and greater increase in ETP at 1 hour. Reduction in anti-FXa from baseline to 1 hour is independently associated with reduced hematoma expansion, and increase in ETP from baseline to 1 hour is independently associated with both reduced hematoma expansion and increase of thromboembolic events.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) in bleeding patients receiving ANDEXXA were urinary tract infections and pneumonia.

In Study 3 (ANNEXA-4), four hundred and seventy-seven patients with acute major bleeding were enrolled and received ANDEXXA. Of these 477 patients, 419 patients were treated with apixaban (245/419; 58.5%) or rivaroxaban (174/419; 41.5%). Most patients had received apixaban or rivaroxaban as anticoagulation treatment for atrial fibrillation (348/419; 83%) or venous thromboembolism (65/419; 16%). In the majority of patients, ANDEXXA was used to reverse anticoagulant therapy following either an intracranial hemorrhage (289/419; 69%) or a gastrointestinal bleed (95/419; 23%), with the remaining patients (35/419; 8.4%) experiencing bleeding at other sites. Patients were assessed at a Day 30 follow-up visit following infusion with ANDEXXA.

immediate risk of death from the life-threatening bleeding event. Andexanet alfa, inactivated-zhzo]), hereafter referred to as andexanet, is an effective and safe specific antidote that rapidly reverses the anticoagulation effects of direct FXa inhibitors, restores hemostasis, and is an important. potent reversal of FXa inhibition in healthy volunteers and preliminary data in patients experiencing life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. As a condition of Accelerated Approval, a post-marketing requirement was issued to verify the hemostatic effect of andexanet as described in the May 2018 Approval letter. To address this PMR, a Phase 4 study, ANNEXA-I, was designed in collaboration with the FDA and undertaken to provide confirmatory evidence of hemostasis to confer traditional approval of andexanet and verify the clinical benefit.

FXa: activated factor X. Evidence from the first randomized, controlled study, ANNEXA-I, demonstrates that andexanet provides superior hemostatic efficacy compared to usual care in patients with a life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding event after receiving a direct oral FXa inhibitor. The final results from the ANNEXA-I trial are both statistically significant and.

clinically meaningful and confirmed andexanet's ability to rapidly reverse the anticoagulation effects of FXa inhibitors. The supplemental Biologics License Application for full approval of andexanet was submitted in January 2024 with results from ANNEXA-I.

Background

With respect to reversal of life threatening bleeds associated with the use of oral factor Xa inhibitors, current guidelines provide few recommendations for a preferred reversal agent. When the initial reversal agent fails to achieve the desired hemostatic response, there is little to no recommendations for the use of additional reversal agents.

Case Report

An 86-year-old female on apixaban (ELIQUIS) for atrial fibrillation, presented from an outside hospital due to a spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multifocal left sided sICH. Due to use of apixaban in the setting to sICH, patient received andexanet alfa (AA) for reversal. Patient was then transferred and upon arrival to receiving emergency department (ED), repeat CT scans showed an expanding sICH, progression of midline shift, and low-molecular weight heparin levels that were ≥ 2 international units (IU) per milliliter (mL), indicating therapeutic apixaban activity. The patient was subsequently given four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC). WHY AN EMERGENCY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING KEY POINTS.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our study shows that the landscape of anticoagulation-associated ICH changed dramatically during the last years with DOAC-associated ICH largely replacing VKA-associated ICH. However, compared with patients without prior anticoagulation, both prior VKA and DOAC treatment were independently associated with lower odds of favourable outcome and higher mortality at 3 months. Given that the majority of patients in our study used factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban) and the specific reversal agent andexanet alfa was not available during the study period, future research needs to focus on specific reversal treatments (ie, andexanet alfa), which have superior hemostatic efficacy. Future research is also needed to determine the individual contribution of anticoagulant activity of DOACs measured with calibrated coagulation assays, haematoma volume and secondary expansion on outcomes to further refine our knowledge on DOAC-associated ICH.
