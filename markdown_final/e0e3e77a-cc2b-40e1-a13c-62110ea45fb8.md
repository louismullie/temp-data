## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an assessment and plan with differential diagnosis for a patient with isolated exertional cough after a viral URI, focusing on whether this is exercise‑induced bronchoconstriction versus underlying asthma and how to evaluate and manage it stepwise. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key clinical features and how they map to guideline criteria. Then, I should verify the differential and avoid premature closure. Next, I will review evidence‑based initial therapy, both pharmacologic and non‑pharmacologic. After that, I need to outline objective testing to confirm the diagnosis and guide escalation. Finally, I will specify follow‑up, safety counseling, and documentation elements aligned with current guidelines [^115ppn5R] [^1152GLxv].

> Let me first confirm the salient clinical pattern: an exertion‑only, nonproductive cough that began 2.5–3 weeks after a self‑limited URI, without nocturnal symptoms or baseline dyspnea, and with cough paroxysms severe enough to cause gagging or occasional emesis; there is a history of colds "lingering", but no known asthma or atopy. Wait, let me verify the timing relative to exercise — symptoms triggered only with higher heart rates strongly suggest post‑exercise phenomena rather than persistent daily or nocturnal asthma symptoms. This pattern is compatible with exercise‑induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), which may be the initial manifestation of asthma and is often precipitated or unmasked by viral infections that transiently increase airway hyperresponsiveness [^1152GLxv] [^115ppn5R].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should frame the diagnostic question precisely: is this isolated EIB after a viral illness, previously unrecognized asthma with an exercise‑induced component, or a non‑asthmatic cause of exertional cough such as upper airway cough syndrome or reflux. I need to ensure that the asthma diagnosis — if made — meets both prongs of GINA's definition: variable respiratory symptoms and confirmed variable expiratory airflow limitation, which still requires objective testing in this case. I should also consider other causes of acute and subacute cough while noting the absence of nocturnal cough, fever, sputum, chest pain, or systemic red flags at present [^115ppn5R] [^114quYjx].

> Let me think about the differential diagnosis in order of likelihood. EIB triggered by a recent viral URI is most likely given the exertion‑only timing, post‑viral onset, and lack of nocturnal symptoms; vomiting with coughing can occur with forceful paroxysms. Wait, I almost downplayed asthma because there is no nocturnal cough, but I should double‑check: exercise is a typical trigger and some patients present predominantly with exertional symptoms, so previously unrecognized asthma with an exercise‑induced component remains plausible. Upper airway cough syndrome from residual post‑viral rhinitis is possible but usually worse at night, which the patient denies; GERD‑related cough can be provoked by exertion but the absence of heartburn/regurgitation and nocturnal symptoms reduces its likelihood, and routine GERD screening is not advised in uncontrolled asthma anyway. Severe cardiopulmonary pathology is unlikely in a young adult without red flags, and medication‑induced cough is not supported by the history [^115ppn5R] [^116SRwRS] [^114quYjx].

> Next, I should review guideline evidence that shapes assessment and early management. GINA recognizes that EIB presents with cough, chest tightness, or wheeze that typically appear after exercise, can occur without nocturnal symptoms, and may be the first clue to asthma; viral infections commonly precipitate or worsen symptoms. Pre‑exercise pharmacologic prevention with a short‑acting beta‑agonist (SABA) or, in patients with frequent or persistent symptoms, low‑dose ICS‑formoterol is recommended. Warm‑up strategies and environmental modifications are also advised to reduce EIB severity and frequency [^1152GLxv] [^116nqCiR].

> I should confirm immediate pharmacologic steps. The first‑line is albuterol 2 puffs via MDI with spacer 5–10 minutes before exertion, with use as rescue if symptoms break through; if symptoms persist despite correct SABA use and technique, stepping up to low‑dose ICS‑formoterol taken before exercise is reasonable per GINA. But wait, I need to ensure we do not inadvertently recommend LABA monotherapy; formoterol must be combined with an ICS in asthma to avoid the increased risk of serious asthma‑related events associated with LABA alone. I will emphasize correct device technique and reassess response, as repeated need signals the need for controller therapy and further evaluation [^116nqCiR] [^1152GLxv] [^117WDmMX] [^111yaacZ].

> Now, non‑pharmacologic measures deserve attention because they can meaningfully reduce EIB burden. Let me verify the practical steps: a structured warm‑up, avoiding cold and dry air exposures during vigorous activity, and optimizing hydration are advised; in cold environments, a mask or scarf can temper airway cooling and drying. I need to check inhaler technique and spacer use carefully, as suboptimal technique can mimic treatment failure. Exercise should be encouraged overall, with tailored strategies to enable participation while minimizing EIB, aligning with pragmatic EAACI recommendations integrated alongside pharmacotherapy [^116nqCiR] [^1168vufX] [^112UddXG].

> I will now examine the objective testing required to confirm or refute asthma/EIB. I should first obtain spirometry with bronchodilator testing; a post‑bronchodilator FEV1 increase of at least 12 percent and 200 mL supports variable airflow limitation. If baseline spirometry is normal, I should consider documenting variability with a two‑week peak flow diary or proceed to an exercise challenge aiming for ≥ 85 percent of predicted heart rate with serial post‑exercise spirometry, where a fall in FEV1 of at least about 10 percent supports EIB. FeNO can be adjunctive; an elevated value supports eosinophilic inflammation but is not diagnostic by itself. But wait, I should verify safety: bronchial challenge testing can provoke severe bronchospasm, so it must be performed with appropriate monitoring, precautions, and avoidance during active respiratory infections or recent surgery as outlined in mannitol challenge labeling [^115ppn5R] [^116oH3ep].

> Let me reconsider the step‑up strategy and follow‑up. If pre‑exercise albuterol alone controls symptoms and activity is unhindered, I would continue this approach and reassess in 4–6 weeks. If symptoms persist despite correct SABA prophylaxis, or if testing demonstrates variable airflow limitation, I should initiate a low‑dose ICS controller or adopt an ICS‑formoterol–based reliever/maintenance strategy per step‑wise GINA recommendations, with re‑evaluation after around two weeks to adjust dosing. Persistent or unclear cases warrant formal exercise or bronchial challenge and consideration of alternative diagnoses if objective variability is not demonstrated [^1152GLxv] [^115ppn5R].

> I need to ensure patient education and safety are addressed. I will explain that EIB is common after viral infections and typically reversible, clarify the difference between rescue and controller therapy, and provide a simple written action plan that includes when to escalate therapy and when to seek urgent care for red flags such as resting dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, or fever. I should also emphasize trigger management and encourage continued physical activity with appropriate prophylaxis and warm‑up, consistent with guideline recommendations for exercise and exacerbation preparedness in asthma. I should avoid routine GERD screening unless clinical features strongly suggest it, consistent with guidance to consider but not routinely test for GERD in uncontrolled asthma without suggestive symptoms [^11247AmX] [^112UddXG] [^116SRwRS].

> Finally, let me synthesize the assessment succinctly for documentation. Assessment: likely EIB precipitated by a recent viral URI in a young adult with exertion‑only cough, with differential including early asthma with exercise‑induced component, UACS, and GERD, none of which is supported strongly by nocturnal symptoms or classic features today. Plan: initiate pre‑exercise albuterol with technique teaching and non‑pharmacologic strategies; obtain spirometry with bronchodilator response and consider peak flow monitoring; escalate to pre‑exercise low‑dose ICS‑formoterol or daily low‑dose ICS if symptoms persist or objective variability is confirmed; provide an action plan and arrange follow‑up in 4–6 weeks, with testing safety precautions observed if bronchial challenge is pursued [^115ppn5R] [^1152GLxv] [^116nqCiR] [^116oH3ep].

The most likely diagnosis is **post-viral cough-variant asthma** (CVA) [^115ppn5R] given exertion-triggered cough with gag/vomiting, no nocturnal or productive cough, and no systemic symptoms. The top differentials are exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) [^1152GLxv], upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) [^114quYjx], and GERD [^116SRwRS]. Initial workup should include **spirometry with bronchodilator response**, FeNO [^115ppn5R], and a trial of inhaled corticosteroids; if spirometry is normal, consider methacholine challenge. Start ICS [^115ppn5R], use albuterol before exercise [^1152GLxv], and **reassess in 2–4 weeks** [^115ppn5R]; if no improvement, broaden evaluation to include chest imaging and ENT/GI referral [^114quYjx].

## Recommended diagnostic workup

- **Spirometry with bronchodilator response**: Assess for reversible airflow obstruction consistent with asthma/CVA [^115ppn5R].
- **Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)**: Evaluate eosinophilic airway inflammation supporting asthma/CVA [^115ppn5R].
- **Methacholine challenge test**: If spirometry is normal, assess airway hyperresponsiveness.
- **Chest X-ray**: Rule out structural lung disease if symptoms persist or worsen [^114quYjx].
- **ENT evaluation**: Consider if UACS suspected [^114quYjx].
- **Gastroenterology evaluation**: Consider if GERD suspected [^116SRwRS].

---

## Initial management plan

- **Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)**: Initiate daily ICS for suspected CVA [^115ppn5R].
- **Albuterol inhaler**: Use 2 puffs 15 minutes before exercise to prevent EIB symptoms [^1152GLxv].
- **Patient education**: Teach inhaler technique, adherence, and symptom monitoring [^115ppn5R].
- **Follow-up**: Reassess in 2–4 weeks to evaluate response and adjust therapy [^115ppn5R].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate evaluation

- **Hemoptysis**: Coughing up blood.
- **Severe dyspnea**: Difficulty breathing.
- **Chest pain**: Persistent or severe.
- **Fever**: Temperature > 38°C (100.4°F).
- **Weight loss**: Unintentional.
- **Night sweats**: Persistent [^114quYjx].

---

## Patient counseling and education

Explain that the cough most likely reflects **post-viral cough-variant asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction** [^1152GLxv], and set expectations for a short-term response. Emphasize **strict adherence to daily inhaled corticosteroids** and pre-exercise albuterol use, and encourage tracking triggers and responses to therapy. Advise avoiding airway irritants and maintaining hydration, and reinforce the need for **follow-up** [^115ppn5R] to ensure control and adjust treatment.

---

## Follow-up plan

Arrange short-term follow-up in **2–4 weeks** to reassess symptoms and lung function [^115ppn5R]. Continue long-term reassessment every 3–6 months or as needed. If there is no improvement, escalate care with **specialist referral** and advanced diagnostics [^114quYjx].

---

The patient's exertion-triggered cough following a recent URI most likely reflects **post-viral cough-variant asthma** [^115ppn5R] or EIB [^1152GLxv]. Initial evaluation with spirometry, FeNO, and a therapeutic ICS trial is appropriate [^115ppn5R]; if spirometry is normal, proceed to methacholine challenge. Start ICS, use albuterol before exercise [^1152GLxv], and reassess in 2–4 weeks [^115ppn5R]; if symptoms persist, expand the workup and consider specialist referral.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115ppn5R]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for asthma, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend diagnosing asthma in adult, adolescent, and pediatric (aged 6–11 years) patients based on typical variable respiratory symptoms and confirmed variable expiratory airflow:

- **Wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough**: Symptoms occurring variably over time and varying in intensity. Symptoms are often worse at night or on waking and are often triggered by exercise, laughter, allergens, and cold air. A very distinctive pattern is symptoms worsening after the end of exercise. Symptoms often appear or worsen with viral infections.

- **Confirmed excessive variability in lung function (≥ 1 of the following)**: Positive bronchodilator responsiveness test with spirometry (or peak expiratory flow); excessive variability in twice-daily peak expiratory flow over 2 weeks; increase in lung function after 4 weeks of ICS-containing treatment; positive bronchial challenge test; excessive variation in lung function between visits.

Clinical success at the early clinical response (ECR) timepoint, 72 to 120 hours after the first dose, was defined as survival with improvement in at least two of four symptoms (cough, sputum production, chest pain, dyspnea) without deterioration in any of these symptoms in the intent to treat population (ITT), which consisted of all randomized patients.

- **Clinical success rates**: Present at the ECR timepoint (ITT population).

Clinical response was also assessed by the investigator at the post-therapy evaluation visit (PTE), 5 to 10 days after the last dose of the study drug, and was defined as survival and improvement in signs and symptoms of CABP. This assessment was based on the clinician's judgment to the extent that further antibacterial therapy was not necessary.

- **Clinical response evaluation**: Results from the PTE visit for both the ITT population and the Clinically Evaluable (CE) population, which consisted of all ITT patients with a diagnosis of CABP, who received a minimum number of expected doses of the study drug, did not have any protocol deviations that could affect the assessment of efficacy, and had investigator assessment at the PTE visit.

- **Clinical response rates by baseline pathogen**: Presented for the microbiological ITT (micro-ITT) population, defined as all randomized patients with a baseline pathogen.

Warnings and precautions: Risk associated with exercise or pharmacologic stress may lead to serious adverse reactions such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, hypotension, bronchoconstriction, stroke, and seizures. It is crucial to perform stress testing where cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained staff are immediately available. When opting for pharmacologic stress, the procedure must adhere to the prescribing information of the chosen pharmacologic stress agent. Radiation risks require ensuring safe handling to limit radiation exposure to both patients and healthcare providers.

- **Risks associated with exercise or pharmacologic stress**: Patients undergoing exercise or pharmacologic stress evaluation may experience serious adverse reactions such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, hypotension, bronchoconstriction, stroke, and seizure. Stress testing should be conducted in an environment where cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained staff are readily available. If pharmacologic stress is used as an alternative to exercise, the procedure must follow the pharmacologic stress agent's prescribing information.

- **Radiation risks**: Flyrcado contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure, which is associated with an increased risk of cancer. It is imperative to ensure safe handling to minimize radiation exposure to both patients and healthcare providers. Advise patients to hydrate before and after administration and to void frequently after administration.

### Public perspectives on healthcare professional-directed communication of hereditary genetic risks: a mixed-method systematic review [^1167VxDC]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Low credibility.

Genetic testing has revolutionized the identification of individuals at increased risk for various hereditary conditions, enabling early intervention and preventive measures. However, effective cascade counseling and testing depends on successful intra-familial communication. This mixed-method systematic review aimed to explore the general population's perspectives and preferences regarding the communication of potential genetic risk information by healthcare professionals. This study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews database (CRD42024532829). A comprehensive search of six databases yielded 17,292 records. After removing duplicates and screening for relevance, nine studies were included in the final analysis, conducted across diverse Western countries using both qualitative and quantitative designs.

Results indicated a preference for healthcare-mediated communication, particularly through formal methods such as letters, which are valued for their clarity and reliability. The role of family-mediated communication is nuanced, influenced by interpersonal relationship quality and the emotional burden of disclosing sensitive information. Ethical and legal considerations highlighted public support for overriding confidentiality in treatable conditions while emphasizing respect for individual privacy and autonomy in untreatable conditions. This review underscores the importance of understanding public preferences to develop tailored communication strategies.

### Fotivda [^114C7pX9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.10) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)].

Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Fotivda and for one month after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Fotivda and for one month after the last dose [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1) and (8.3) and NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.1)].

Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Fotivda and for one month after the last dose [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.2)].

Advise males and females of reproductive potential that Fotivda can impair fertility [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.3)].

Fotivda 0.89 mg capsule contains FD&C Yellow No.5 (tartrazine) as an imprint ink, which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible patients. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No.5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.12)].

Advise patients that other adverse reactions with Fotivda treatment may include diarrhea, vomiting, dysphonia (hoarseness of voice), fatigue, asthenia, and stomatitis.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^11247AmX]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of asthma, specifically in relation to exacerbation management in primary care settings, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend the following actions when dealing with patients presenting with asthma exacerbation:

- **History**: Elicit a brief, focused history, including:
	- Timing of onset and cause (if known) of the present exacerbation
	- Severity of asthma symptoms, particularly any that limit exercise or disturb sleep
	- Any symptoms of anaphylaxis
	- Any risk factors for asthma-related death
	- All reliever and maintenance medications, including prescribed doses and devices, adherence pattern, recent dose changes, and response to therapy

- **Physical examination**: Conduct a relevant physical examination to assess:
	- **Exacerbation severity and vital signs**: Level of consciousness, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, ability to complete sentences, use of accessory muscles, wheezing
	- **Complicating factors**: Anaphylaxis, pneumonia, pneumothorax
	- **Alternative conditions**: Cardiac failure, inducible laryngeal obstruction, inhaled foreign body, pulmonary embolism

- **Objective measurements**: Obtain objective measurements, including:
	- Pulse oximetry for saturation levels
	- Peak expiratory flow in patients older than 5 years

### Fentanyl transdermal [^1153jn2i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Avoid strenuous exertion that can increase body temperature while wearing the patch. Avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources, including heating pads, electric blankets, sunbathing, heat or tanning lamps, saunas, hot tubs, hot baths, and heated waterbeds.

- **Important discontinuation instructions**: In order to avoid developing withdrawal symptoms, instruct patients not to discontinue the fentanyl transdermal system without first discussing a tapering plan with the prescriber [see Dosage and Administration (2.9)].

- **Driving or operating heavy machinery**: Inform patients that the fentanyl transdermal system may impair their ability to perform potentially hazardous activities, such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery. Advise patients not to perform such tasks until they know how they will react to the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.22)].

- **Constipation**: Advise patients of the potential for severe constipation, including management instructions and when to seek medical attention [see Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Inform patients that opioids could cause adrenal insufficiency, a potentially life-threatening condition. Adrenal insufficiency may present with non-specific symptoms and signs, such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience a constellation of these symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

### Comparing priority received by global health issues: A measurement framework applied to tuberculosis, malaria, diarrhoeal diseases and dengue fever [^111MFTt3]. BMJ Global Health (2024). Low credibility.

We then conducted a literature and database search to identify an exhaustive set of measurements for all six arenas. We did open Google searches and searched the potential databases (this exercise was not a systematic search or review) with a combination of keywords applicable to potential indicators for each arena. For example, for the international aid arena, we used terms such as DAH and global spending on health issues or diseases, among others. At this stage, we included numerical and narrative measures for existing and proposed arenas.

- **Defining potential indicators**: Second, we listed potential indicators for each measure and sources for capturing data and/or information against each indicator. This process provided us with a broader set of measurements, which may or may not apply to all health conditions, all arenas, and all country contexts. For example, for the international aid arena, we initially identified DAH, inclusion in aid priority strategies, availability of aid impact data, and availability of aid effectiveness studies as potential measures.

- **Types of indicators identified**: We identified numerical indicators for the first two measures and narrative indicators for the last two measures, respectively. This included US dollars spent (for measuring DAH), the number of strategic aid documents pledging commitments to selected disease conditions (for inclusion in aid priority strategies), analytical insights from outcome/impact narratives related to the aid for a particular disease (for aid impact data), and availability and quality of cost-effectiveness data linked to aid (for aid effectiveness measure).

### Tremfya [^115c6ED3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with post-market use of Tremfya. Some cases required hospitalization. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Tremfya and initiate appropriate therapy.

- **Infections**: Tremfya may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials involving subjects with plaque psoriasis, infections occurred in 23% of subjects in the Tremfya group versus 21% in the placebo group through 16 weeks of treatment. Upper respiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis, tinea infections, and herpes simplex infections occurred more frequently in the Tremfya group than in the placebo group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The rate of serious infections for both the Tremfya group and the placebo group was ≤ 0.2%. A similar risk of infection was observed in placebo-controlled trials among subjects with psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. Treatment with Tremfya should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.

	- In patients with a chronic infection or a history of reinfection, consider the risks and benefits prior to prescribing Tremfya. Instruct patients to seek medical help if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops a clinically important or serious infection or is not responding to standard therapy, monitor the patient closely and discontinue Tremfya until the infection resolves.

### AirDuo RespiClick [^112rZruV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Transferring patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy**: Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic‑pituitary‑adrenal (HPA) function.

- **HPA suppression/adrenal insufficiency**: Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although AirDuo RespiClick may improve control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of corticosteroid systemically and does not provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.

During periods of stress or a severe asthmatic attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physician for further instruction.

### Cannabis consumption and risk of asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1143zTBR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Various possible mechanisms have been suggested to clarify the connection between cannabis use and the risk of asthma. First, the presence of irritants and toxic substances in cannabis smoke can cause direct damage to the respiratory epithelium, leading to increased airway reactivity and susceptibility to asthma. Second, cannabis may have immunomodulatory effects, potentially altering the balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, which could contribute to airway inflammation and hyper-reactivity. Furthermore, the co-use of tobacco and cannabis, a common pattern among users, could confound the observed associations, making it difficult to delineate the specific role of cannabis in respiratory health.

The link between cannabis use and the risk of asthma has been examined in multiple observational studies. However, the findings have been varied. Some research suggests that cannabis consumption is linked to a higher risk of asthma, while others have found no significant correlation. These mixed results emphasize the necessity for a more thorough evaluation to consolidate the existing evidence. Although there have been systematic reviews on various aspects of respiratory-related issues and cannabis use, none have specifically explored the association between cannabis use and greater odds of having asthma. As a result, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the precise nature of the relationship between cannabis use and asthma. With the growing prevalence of cannabis use and its potential impact on respiratory health, a systematic review and meta-analysis is crucial to address these gaps.

The findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis provide compelling evidence indicating a significant association between cannabis use and greater odds of having asthma. The pooled OR of 1.31 (95% CI: 1.19–1.44) suggests that individuals who use cannabis are at 31% greater odds of having asthma compared to non-users. These results indicate a concerning public health issue as cannabis use continues to rise globally, and highlight the potential respiratory complications associated with its consumption. The finding is consistent with prior research linking cannabis use to respiratory inflammation. Inhalation of cannabis smoke, much like tobacco smoke, is thought to contribute to an increased risk of asthma diagnosis. The OR across studies ranged from 1.03 to 2.13, showing a consistent pattern of elevated odds of having asthma among cannabis users. The studies included in this analysis adjusted for potential confounders such as smoking. Our subgroup analysis based on study design resolved the source of heterogeneity, with both cross-sectional studies and cohort studies showing a significant association between cannabis use and asthma.

In comparison to previous meta-analyses, our study provides focused insights into the association between cannabis use and greater odds of having asthma. While earlier studies primarily examined respiratory symptoms like cough, sputum production, wheezing, and dyspnea, our research specifically investigates asthma as a clinical outcome. Previous analyses linked cannabis use to these symptoms but did not address asthma directly.

### Gohibic [^111231ZL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. You can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus.

COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, serious illness can happen and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. People of all ages with severe, long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.

- **Symptoms of COVID-19**: The symptoms of COVID-19 may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness, including breathing problems, can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse.

- **Gohibic**: Gohibic is an investigational medicine used for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults when initiated within 48 hours of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Gohibic is investigational because it is still being studied. It is not FDA-approved to treat COVID-19.

### Inhalation of multiple pen caps causing bronchial foreign bodies: a rare case in an older child [^113FzySc]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

A twelve-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital with a chief complaint of coughing for over two months, accompanied by fever and yellow, foul-smelling sputum at the onset of his illness. According to the patient's account, they had been diagnosed with pneumonia at a local hospital and treated with oral Cefdinir (0.1 g, three times daily) and inhaled Budesonide Suspension. However, these treatments provided minimal relief, and the symptoms, including persistent cough and fever, frequently recurred, with the cough progressively worsening over time. The patient did not report hemoptysis, chest pain, dyspnea, or night sweats.

Upon examination at admission, the child appeared generally well, with no signs of cyanosis, respiratory distress, or the three-concave signs during inspiration. The respiratory rate ranged from 21 to 26 breaths per minute, and the SpO2 on room air was consistently between 97% and 99%. Auscultation revealed decreased respiratory sounds in the right lower lung. The chest X-ray showed evidence of pneumonia and partial atelectasis in the lower lobe of the right lung. To further evaluate the patient's pulmonary condition, a subsequent chest CT scan was performed, demonstrating multiple columnar cystic transparent shadows in the lower lobe of the right lung, suggestive of bronchiectasis, with obstruction noted in the distal end of the right middle segment bronchus and the bronchial lumens of the middle and lower lobes of the right lung.

### Ofev [^1133Pdgr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The clinical efficacy of nintedanib has been studied in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (Study 4 [NCT02597933]). A total of 580 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either OFEV 150 mg twice daily or matching placebo for at least 52 weeks, of which 576 patients were treated. Randomization was stratified by anti-topoisomerase antibody (ATA) status. Individual patients remained on blinded trial treatment for up to 100 weeks.

The primary endpoint was the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) over 52 weeks. The absolute change from baseline in the modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) at Week 52 was a key secondary endpoint. Mortality over the whole trial was an additional secondary endpoint.

Patients were diagnosed with SSc-ILD based upon the 2013 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria for SSc, with the onset of disease (first non-Raynaud symptom) of less than 7 years and greater than or equal to 10% fibrosis on a chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan conducted within the previous 12 months. Patients were required to have an FVC greater than or equal to 40% of predicted and a DLCO 30–89% of predicted. Patients with relevant airways obstruction (i.e. pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC less than 0.7) or previous or planned hematopoietic stem cell transplant were excluded from the trial. Patients with greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) of ALT, AST, or bilirubin, and patients with a known risk or predisposition to ble…

### Endogenous glucose production in patients with glycogen storage disease type Ia estimated by oral D-[6,6–2H2]-glucose [^116SZoRr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The trial was conducted at the UMCG between October 2020 and July 2021. Patients with glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa) and an equal number of age-, gender-, and BMI–matched healthy volunteers (HVs) were recruited at the UMCG.

- **Inclusion criteria**:
	(1) Age > 16 years;
	(2) Stable medical condition before the start of the test procedures;
	(3) For patients with GSDIa, confirmation with enzyme assay and/or G6PC1 variation analysis.

- **Exclusion criteria**:
	(1) Pregnancy;
	(2) Recent fever (38.5 °C) in the week prior to the study visit;
	(3) For HVs, confirmed diagnosis or history suggestive of diabetes mellitus;
	(4) First-grade family member with a confirmed diagnosis associated with fasting intolerance;
	(5) Symptoms or signs suggestive of fasting intolerance, metabolic instability, or gastrointestinal complaints.

Based on their G6PC1 genotype (or clinical features if the genotype was not available), patients with GSDIa were classified as "severe" (two nonsense or active site variants or clinical ascertainment before the age of two years) or "attenuated" (two missense variants not in the active site or one nonsense or active site variant and one missense variant not in the active site or clinical ascertainment after the age of two years). Variants were reported according to ClinVar, or based on published literature in case a mutation was not published/deposited on ClinVar. Each participant was assigned a code.

### Striverdi Respimat [^117WDmMX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use).

- **Serious asthma-related events**: Inform patients that LABA, such as Striverdi Respimat, when used as monotherapy (without an inhaled corticosteroid), increases the risk of serious asthma-related events, including asthma-related death. Striverdi Respimat is not indicated for the treatment of asthma.

- **Not for acute symptoms**: Striverdi Respimat is not meant to relieve acute asthma symptoms or exacerbations of COPD, and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist such as albuterol. The healthcare provider should provide the patient with such medication and instruct the patient in how it should be used.

- **Patient notification**: Instruct patients to notify their physician immediately if they experience any of the following:
	- Worsening of symptoms
	- Decreasing effectiveness of inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists
	- Need for more inhalations than usual of inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists
	- Significant decrease in lung function as outlined by the physician

Instruct patients not to stop therapy with Striverdi Respimat without physician/provider guidance since symptoms may recur after discontinuation.

- **Do not use additional long-acting beta-agonists**: Patients who have been taking inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these products and use them only for the symptomatic relief of acute symptoms.

### Caverject [^115B8784]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of Caverject was investigated in men with a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction due to psychogenic, vasculogenic, neurogenic, and/or mixed etiology in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Study 1 and Study 2) and in one 6-month open-label study (Study 3). In clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 3), over 80% of patients experienced an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse after the intracavernosal injection of Caverject.

- **Study 1**: A total of 153 men with erectile dysfunction (ED), with a mean age of 53 years (range 23–69 years), were enrolled. The study had three phases: a 2.5-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover phase in which each man received in-office injections of placebo or 2.5 mcg, 5 mcg, 7.5 mcg, or 10 mcg of Caverject; a 2-week, open-label, in-office dose-titration phase to identify the optimum home-use dose (defined as a dose inducing an erection sufficient for intercourse and lasting ≤ 60 minutes); and a 4-week open-label, at-home phase.

In the double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover phase, each dose of Caverject was significantly more effective than placebo by clinical evaluation ("full penile rigidity") and by RigiScan criteria (≥ 70% rigidity for at least 10 minutes); there was no response to placebo. The percentage of responders increased with increasing doses of Caverject. The overall response rates in the crossover and dose-titration phases were 76% (117/153) by clinical evaluation and 51% (78/152) by RigiScan criteria. Seventy-three percent of the injections in 102 men who used Caverject in the…

### Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies: A scoping review and overview of currently available rehabilitation strategies [^115wkW2f]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) constitute a diverse group of inherited disorders primarily affecting skeletal muscle. Despite the absence of cures, rehabilitative treatments offer potential for preventing and mitigating loss of muscle strength. However, the role of exercise training in LGMD patients remains contentious. This review aims to provide an overview of the currently available motor rehabilitation strategies for the most common subtypes of LGMD.

To identify relevant articles, we performed a systematic search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, focusing on muscular and respiratory interventions. The search resulted in 560 potentially relevant articles, of which 16 were included in the review.

- **Neuromuscular functional rehabilitation therapy programs**: Eight studies concentrated on these programs.
- **Combined interventions**: Seven studies combined both neuromuscular rehabilitation and interventions to maintain or enhance respiratory functionality.
- **Respiratory intervention only**: One study focused solely on respiratory intervention.

Altogether, the papers examined offered a comprehensive view on the rehabilitative strategies available and provided an indication of the most valuable practices to deal with patients' health and needs. Upon analysis, we conclude that, when tailored to individual needs, muscle training can enhance strength and functional abilities, positively impacting psychological well-being. However, generic protocols may lead to limited benefits, fatigue, pain, and compliance issues. Moreover, early management of respiratory symptoms and personalized respiratory physiotherapy can enhance patients' well-being.

### Breo ellipta [^116uFqL9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) due to the risk of deaths from adrenal insufficiency. This risk occurs during and after the transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available ICS. Recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function may take a number of months after withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids.

Patients who were previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, especially when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, infection (particularly gastroenteritis), or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although Breo Ellipta may control chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically. Moreover, it does not provide the mineralocorticoid activity necessary for coping with these emergencies.

During periods of stress, such as a severe COPD exacerbation or a severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and contact their healthcare practitioner for further instruction.

### Krazati [^115cnvvL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Krazati can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, which may be fatal. In a pooled safety population, [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] patients receiving single-agent Krazati experienced ILD/pneumonitis in 4.1% of cases. Of these, 1.4% were Grade 3 or 4, and one case was fatal. The median time to onset for ILD/pneumonitis was 12 weeks (range: 5 to 31 weeks). Adagrasib was discontinued in 0.8% of patients due to ILD/pneumonitis.

In patients receiving Krazati in combination with cetuximab, [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] Grade 1 ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 1.1% of patients, with a time to onset of 38 weeks.

Monitor patients for new or worsening respiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g. dyspnea, cough, fever) during Krazati treatment. Withhold Krazati in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis, and permanently discontinue the treatment if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Tzield [^111FovtE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Patient selection**: Select adult patients and pediatric patients 8 years of age and older for TZIELD treatment who have a diagnosis of Stage 2 type 1 diabetes. Confirm Stage 2 type 1 diabetes by documenting at least two positive pancreatic islet cell autoantibodies and dysglycemia without overt hyperglycemia using an oral glucose tolerance test. If an oral glucose tolerance test is not available, an alternative method for diagnosing dysglycemia without overt hyperglycemia may be appropriate. Ensure the clinical history of the patient does not suggest type 2 diabetes.

- **Laboratory evaluation and vaccination prior to initiation**: Prior to initiating TZIELD, obtain a complete blood count and liver enzyme tests. The use of TZIELD is not recommended in patients with:
	- Lymphocyte count less than 1,000 lymphocytes/mcL
	- Hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL
	- Platelet count less than 150,000 platelets/mcL
	- Absolute neutrophil count less than 1,500 neutrophils/mcL
	- Elevated ALT or AST greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or bilirubin greater than 1.5 times ULN
	- Laboratory or clinical evidence of acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV)
	- Active serious infection or chronic active infection other than localized skin infections

	- Administer all age-appropriate vaccinations prior to starting TZIELD [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]:
	- Administer live-attenuated (live) vaccines at least 8 weeks prior to treatment.
	- Administer inactivated (killed) vaccines or mRNA vaccines at least 2 weeks prior to treatment.

### The physiologic benefits of optimizing cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity - From the cell to systems level in a post-pandemic world [^115LCJcS]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) is a leading cause of premature death and hospitalization, which places a significant strain on health services and economies around the world. Evidence from decades of empirical and observational research demonstrates clear associations between physical activity (PA) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), which can offset the risk of mortality and increase life expectancy and the quality of life in patients.

While well-documented, the narrative of increased CRF remained pertinent during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, where individuals with lower levels of CRF had more than double the risk of dying from COVID-19 compared to those with moderate or high CRF. The need to better understand the mechanisms associated with COVID-19, and those that continue to be affected with persistent symptoms following infection (Long COVID), and CV health is key if we are to effectively target the use of CRF and PA to improve the lives of those suffering its afflictions.

While there is a long way to go to optimize PA and CRF for improved health at a population level, particularly in a post-pandemic world, increasing the understanding using a cellular-to-systems approach may provide further insight into the benefits of engaging in PA.

### Exercise recommendations and practical considerations for asthma management-an EAACI position paper [^1168vufX]. Allergy (2025). High credibility.

Exercise is an important treatment for people with asthma and should be considered alongside pharmacological therapy when developing personalized asthma management plans. Despite this, there remains limited guidance concerning the practicalities of asthma-specific exercise prescription. This European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology task force was therefore established to achieve three fundamental aims:

- **To provide an up-to-date perspective**: Concerning the role of exercise for asthma management, describing the disease-modifying potential of exercise and its associated impact on asthma-related extrapulmonary comorbidities.
- **To develop pragmatic recommendations**: To facilitate safe and effective exercise prescription.
- **To identify key unmet needs and provide direction for future research**: This includes focused guidance for future research.

The position paper is structured as a practically focused document, with recommendations formulated according to the best available scientific evidence and expert opinion, emphasizing providing healthcare providers with pragmatic advice that can be implemented during routine asthma reviews.

### Pentazocine and naloxone [^111cmjUh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

This section discusses the considerations around lactation when using pentazocine and naloxone.

- **Risk summary**: Pentazocine is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets are administered to a nursing woman. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.

- **Clinical considerations**: Infants exposed to pentazocine and naloxone through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped or when breastfeeding is stopped.

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established.

- **Geriatric use**: Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range. This approach reflects the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and it has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets carefully.

### Tamiflu [^117D7Y1F]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)

One double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trial was conducted in pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years (median age 5 years) who had fever (at least 100ºF) plus one respiratory symptom (cough or coryza) when influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Of 698 subjects enrolled in this trial, 452 (65%) were influenza-infected (50% male; 68% Caucasian). Of the 452 influenza-infected subjects, 67% were infected with influenza A and 33% with influenza B.

Efficacy in this trial was determined by the time to alleviation or resolution of influenza signs and symptoms, measured by a composite endpoint that required the following four individual conditions be met: i) alleviation of cough, ii) alleviation of coryza, iii) resolution of fever, and iv) parental opinion of a return to normal health and activity. Tamiflu treatment of 2 mg per kg twice daily, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, reduced the total composite time to freedom from illness by 1.5 days compared to placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of Tamiflu in male and female pediatric subjects.

Pediatric subjects (2 weeks to less than 1 year of age)

Two open-label trials evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in influenza-infected pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post-conceptional age). Subjects received Tamiflu at doses ranging from 2 to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days depending.

### Omvoh [^117QtbVZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis during intravenous infusion, have been reported with OMVOH administration. Infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions, such as mucocutaneous erythema and pruritus, were reported during induction [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue OMVOH immediately and initiate appropriate treatment.

- **Infections**: OMVOH may increase the risk of infection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Do not initiate treatment with OMVOH in patients with a clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. In patients with a chronic infection or a history of reinfection, consider the risks and benefits prior to prescribing OMVOH. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important acute or chronic infection occur. If a serious infection develops or an infection is not responding to standard therapy, monitor the patient closely and do not administer OMVOH until the infection resolves.

- **Tuberculosis**: Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with OMVOH. Do not administer OMVOH to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering OMVOH. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of OMVOH in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after OMVOH treatment.

### Midazolam hydrochloride [^1124BzaZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Midazolam injection is a potent sedative agent that requires slow administration and individualization of dosage. Clinical experience has demonstrated that midazolam hydrochloride is 3 to 4 times as potent per mg as diazepam.

- **Serious and life-threatening cardiorespiratory adverse events**: Provision for monitoring, detection, and correction of these reactions must be made for every patient to whom midazolam injection is administered, regardless of age or health status. Excessive single doses or rapid intravenous administration may result in respiratory depression, airway obstruction, and/or arrest. The potential for these effects is increased in debilitated patients, those receiving concomitant medications capable of depressing the CNS, and patients without an endotracheal tube but undergoing a procedure involving the upper airway, such as endoscopy or dental procedures.

- **Reactions such as agitation, involuntary movements, hyperactivity, and combativeness**: These have been reported in adult and pediatric patients. Should such reactions occur, caution should be exercised before continuing administration of midazolam hydrochloride.

Midazolam injection should only be administered intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV). Care should be taken to avoid intra-arterial injection or extravasation.

Midazolam injection may be mixed in the same syringe with the following frequently used premedications: morphine sulfate and meperidine.

### Taltz [^114KPhfa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Infections**:
	- Taltz may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials involving adult patients with plaque psoriasis, the Taltz group experienced a higher rate of infections compared to the placebo group (27% vs. 23%). Specifically, upper respiratory tract infections, oral candidiasis, conjunctivitis, and tinea infections occurred more frequently in the Taltz group. A similar rise in infection risk was observed in placebo-controlled trials with patients suffering from pediatric psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

	- In the postmarketing context, serious bacterial, viral, and fungal opportunistic infections have been reported in patients receiving IL-17 inhibitors, including Taltz. Patients treated with Taltz should be instructed to seek medical advice if any signs or symptoms of a clinically significant chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops a serious infection or does not respond to standard therapy, monitor the patient closely and discontinue Taltz until the infection resolves.

- **Pre-treatment evaluation for tuberculosis**:
	- Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Taltz. Do not administer the medication to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment for latent TB before administering Taltz. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to starting Taltz in patients with a past history of latent or active TB when an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Patients on Taltz should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of active TB during treatment.

### Tamiflu [^114RAKxY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

One double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trial was conducted in pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years (median age 5 years) who had a fever (at least 100ºF) plus one respiratory symptom (cough or coryza) when the influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Of the 698 subjects enrolled in this trial, 452 (65%) were influenza-infected (50% male; 68% Caucasian). Of those 452 influenza-infected subjects, 67% were infected with influenza A and 33% with influenza B.

Efficacy in this trial was determined by the time to alleviation or resolution of influenza signs and symptoms, measured by a composite endpoint that required the following four individual conditions to be met: i) alleviation of cough, ii) alleviation of coryza, iii) resolution of fever, and iv) parental opinion of a return to normal health and activity. Tamiflu treatment of 2 mg per kg twice daily, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, reduced the total composite time to freedom from illness by 1.5 days compared to placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of Tamiflu in male and female pediatric subjects.

Two open-label trials evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in influenza-infected pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post-conceptional age). Subjects received Tamiflu at doses ranging from 2 to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days.

### Exercise recommendations and practical considerations for asthma management-an EAACI position paper [^117TUTq6]. Allergy (2025). High credibility.

Exercise is an important treatment for people with asthma and should be considered alongside pharmacological therapy when developing personalized asthma management plans. Despite this, there remains limited guidance concerning the practicalities of asthma-specific exercise prescription. This European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology task force was therefore established to achieve three fundamental aims:

- **To provide an up-to-date perspective**: concerning the role of exercise for asthma management (i.e. describe the disease-modifying potential of exercise and associated impact on asthma-related extrapulmonary comorbidities).
- **To develop pragmatic recommendations**: to facilitate safe and effective exercise prescription.
- **To identify key unmet needs** and provide focused direction for future research.

The position paper is structured as a practically focused document, with recommendations formulated according to the best available scientific evidence and expert opinion, emphasizing providing healthcare providers with pragmatic advice that can be implemented during routine asthma review.

### Developing effective strategies to optimize physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness in the long Covid population- The need for caution and objective assessment [^1179mBrb]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

The Post Covid-19 Condition, commonly known as Long Covid, has been defined by the World Health Organisation as occurring in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually within three months from the onset of acute Covid-19 infection, with symptoms lasting for at least two months that cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Long Covid is associated with over two hundred recognized symptoms and affects tens of millions of people worldwide. Widely reported reductions in quality of life (QoL) and functional status are caused by extremely sensitive and cyclical symptom profiles that are augmented following exposure to physical, emotional, orthostatic, and cognitive stimuli.

This manifestation prevents millions of people from engaging in routine activities of daily living (ADLs) and has important health and well-being, social, and economic impacts. Post-exertional symptom exacerbation (PESE), also known as post-exertional malaise, is an exacerbation in the severity of fatigue and other symptoms following physical, emotional, orthostatic, and cognitive tasks. Typically, this will occur 24–72 hours after "over-exertion" and can persist for several days and even weeks. It is a hallmark symptom of Long Covid with a reported prevalence of 86%. The debilitating nature of PESE prevents patients from engaging in physical activity, which impacts functional status and QoL.

In this review, the authors present an update to the literature relating to PESE in Long Covid and make the case for evidence-based guidelines that support the design and implementation.

### Airdou digihaler [^112k8D4F]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Transferring patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy**: Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.

Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although Airdou Digihaler may improve control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of corticosteroid systemically and does not provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.

During periods of stress or a severe asthmatic attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physician for further instruction.

### Using cardiorespiratory fitness assessment to identify pathophysiology in long COVID - Best practice approaches [^1126pVwv]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is well-established in clinical domains as an integrative measure of the body's physiological capability and capacity to transport and utilize oxygen during controlled bouts of physical exertion. Long COVID is associated with over 200 different symptoms and is estimated to affect approximately 150 million people worldwide. The most widely reported impact is reduced quality of life and functional status due to highly sensitive and cyclical symptoms that manifest and are augmented following exposure to physical, emotional, orthostatic, and cognitive stimuli. This is more commonly known as post-exertional symptom exacerbation (PESE), which prevents millions from engaging in routine daily activities.

Use of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is commonplace in the assessment of integrated physiology. CPET will undoubtedly play an integral role in furthering the pathophysiology and mechanistic knowledge that will inform bespoke Long COVID treatment and management strategies. An inherent risk of previous attempts to utilize CPET protocols in patients with chronic disease is that these are compounded by PESE and have induced a worsening of symptoms for patients that can last for days or weeks.

To do this effectively and meet the global need, the complex multi-system pathophysiology of Long COVID must be considered to ensure the design and implementation of research that is both safe for participants and capable of advancing mechanistic understanding.

### Stiolto Respimat [^111yaacZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use).

- **Serious asthma-related events**: Inform patients that LABA, such as Stiolto Respimat, when used as monotherapy (without an inhaled corticosteroid), increase the risk of serious asthma-related events, including asthma-related death. Stiolto Respimat is not indicated for the treatment of asthma.

- **Not for acute symptoms**: Stiolto Respimat is not meant to relieve acute asthma symptoms or exacerbations of COPD, and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist such as albuterol. The healthcare provider should provide the patient with such medication and instruct the patient on how it should be used.

	- **Important patient actions**: Instruct patients to notify their physician immediately if they experience any of the following:
		- Worsening of symptoms
		- Decreasing effectiveness of inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists
		- Need for more inhalations than usual of inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists
		- Significant decrease in lung function as outlined by the physician

	- Instruct patients not to stop therapy with Stiolto Respimat without physician/provider guidance since symptoms may recur after discontinuation.

- **Do not use additional long-acting beta-agonists**: Patients who have been taking inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these products and use them only for the symptomatic relief of acute symptoms.

### Pediatric chronic cough: Allergies, environmental factors, and asthma-associated inflammation [^1171d8U8]. The Journal of Asthma (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic cough (CC) is a common respiratory symptom in children, often linked to allergic conditions, environmental exposures, and potentially indicative of underlying asthma.

- **Objective**: To investigate the relationships of CC in children with allergic predispositions, environmental exposures, and airway inflammatory markers.

- **Methods**: A case-control study was conducted at a tertiary hospital. Data on cough duration, personal and family allergic histories, and environmental exposures were collected. Airway inflammation was assessed using fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO 50), and lung function was evaluated via spirometry.

- **Results**: Children with CC showed a higher prevalence of allergic conditions, including rhinitis (74.77% vs. 24.13%, OR = 9.312, p < 0.0001), food allergy (59.81% vs. 27.59%, OR = 3.907, p = 0.0017), eczema (55.14% vs. 31.03%, OR = 2.731, p = 0.0213), and family history of allergies (71.96% vs. 27.59%, OR = 6.738, p < 0.001). Environmental exposures, such as household smoking (55.14% vs. 20.69%, OR = 4.712, p = 0.001) and mold exposure (28.68% vs. 7.35%, OR = 3.442, p = 0.0251), were more common in the CC group. CC children exhibited elevated FeNO 50 (median: 18 vs. 14 ppb, p = 0.0153) and impaired small airway function (FEF75% pred: 53.84 ± 20.21 vs. 65.07 ± 28.52, p = 0.0170).

- **Conclusions**: Pediatric CC is strongly associated with allergic predispositions, environmental exposures, and eosinophilic airway inflammation, potentially reflecting an asthma-related phenotype.

### An update of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of leprosy: A narrative review [^114V24gv]. Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on leprosy:

- **Definition**: Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by *Mycobacterium leprae*. It primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and eyes.

- **Pathophysiology**: *Mycobacterium leprae*, a non-spore-forming acid-fast bacillus (AFB), primarily invades via the respiratory route through the nasal mucosa, though other transmission routes may also occur. It thrives in cooler regions of the body, particularly the skin, with a preference for macrophages, keratinocytes, and Schwann cells. Armadillos may serve as a zoonotic reservoir.

- **Epidemiology**: Leprosy was globally eliminated as a public health problem in 2000, defined by a prevalence of < 1 case per 10,000 population. However, it remains endemic in certain parts of the world. Clinical diagnosis may include signs of nerve damage such as more than five skin lesions with nerve involvement or detectable bacilli in a slit-skin smear, regardless of the number of skin lesions. Peripheral nerve damage in leprosy results in sensory and motor function impairment.

### Enspryng [^1136tXaV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Infections**: An increased risk of infections, including serious and potentially fatal infections, has been observed in patients treated with IL-6 receptor antagonists, including Enspryng.

	- The most common infections reported in a randomized clinical trial of patients treated with Enspryng who were not on other chronic immunosuppressant therapies (Study 1), and that occurred more often than in patients receiving placebo, were nasopharyngitis (12%) and cellulitis (10%). The most common infections in patients who were on an additional immunosuppressant, and that occurred more often than in patients receiving placebo, were nasopharyngitis (31%), upper respiratory infection (19%), and pharyngitis (12%).

	- Delay Enspryng administration in patients with an active infection, including localized infections, until the infection is resolved.

- **Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation**: Risk of HBV reactivation has been observed with other immunosuppressant therapies. Patients with chronic HBV infection were excluded from clinical trials. Perform HBV screening in all patients before initiation of treatment with Enspryng. Do not administer Enspryng to patients with active hepatitis. For patients who are chronic carriers of HBV [HBsAg+] or are negative for HBsAg and positive for HB core antibody [HBcAb+], consult liver disease experts before starting and during treatment with Enspryng.

- **Tuberculosis**: Tuberculosis has occurred in patients treated with other interleukin-6 receptor antagonists. Patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors and tested for latent infection.

### Exercise recommendations and practical considerations for asthma management-an EAACI position paper [^115o6Xtt]. Allergy (2025). High credibility.

The importance of exercise and physical activity in asthma management has been previously described and endorsed in the GINA report. However, there remains limited guidance concerning the practicalities of exercise prescription. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) task force was established to achieve three fundamental aims:

- **Provide an up-to-date perspective**: Concerning the role of exercise for asthma management, highlighting the disease-modifying potential of exercise and its impact on asthma-related extrapulmonary comorbidities.

- **Develop pragmatic recommendations**: Facilitate safe and effective exercise prescription.

- **Identify key unmet needs**: Provide focused direction for future research.

- **Figures**:
	- Impact of exercise training on asthma-related outcomes and extrapulmonary comorbidities (summary of evidence from recent RCTs).
	- Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction contributing to exercise avoidance in pre-existing asthma.

This position paper aims to bridge the gap in current guidelines and support personalized exercise interventions for asthma patients.

### Elevidys [^111AdjFt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Inform patients or caregivers that infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, have occurred during and after Elevidys infusion. Possible symptoms of infusion-related reactions include a fast heart rate, fast breathing, swollen lips, being short of breath, widening of the nostrils, hives, red and blotchy skin, itchy or inflamed lips, rash, vomiting, nausea, chills, and fever. Contact a healthcare provider immediately if the patient experiences such a reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Elevidys can increase certain liver enzyme levels and cause acute serious liver injury. Patients will receive oral corticosteroid medication before and after the infusion with Elevidys. Weekly blood tests will be required to monitor liver enzyme levels for 3 months after treatment. Contact a healthcare provider immediately if the patient's skin and/or whites of the eyes appear yellowish, or if the patient misses a dose of corticosteroid or vomits it up [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Immune-mediated myositis (an immune response affecting muscles) was observed in patients with a deletion mutation in the DMD gene that is contraindicated. Contact a physician immediately if the patient experiences any unexplained increased muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, including difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, or difficulty speaking, as these may be symptoms of myositis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) has been observed within days following Elevidys infusion. Weekly monitoring of troponin-I levels is recommended for the first month.

### Klonopin [^115QZGq8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Klonopin is used to treat several different types of seizure disorders. However, it may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal), requiring the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Klonopin may produce absence status.

In some studies, up to 30% of patients who initially responded to Klonopin have shown a loss of anticonvulsant activity, often within three months of administration. In some cases, dosage adjustment may reestablish efficacy.

Periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable during long-term therapy with Klonopin. Paradoxical reactions, such as agitation, irritability, aggression, anxiety, anger, nightmares, hallucinations, and psychoses, are known to occur with benzodiazepines. If paradoxical reactions occur, the use of the drug should be gradually discontinued. These reactions are more likely to occur in children and the elderly.

- **Caution in renally impaired patients**: Metabolites of Klonopin are excreted by the kidneys, so caution should be exercised to avoid their excess accumulation in patients with impaired renal function.

- **Hypersalivation**: Klonopin may produce an increase in salivation, and this should be considered prior to administration.

### The effect of intrapulmonary percussive ventilation on clinical parameters and the deposition of inhalation products in patients with stable COPD [^111ife7h]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

In addition to their treatment plan, which remained unchanged, each subject received treatment with intra-pulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV) "MODEL IPV-2 C" three times a week for four consecutive weeks. The exact settings of the pressure amplitude depended on the flow amplitude and impedance of the respiratory system. The patient was given two sessions of 15 minutes of IPV with a 2-minute rest in between.

IPV is a technique in which small bursts of air with a high flow and frequency are added to spontaneous breathing. This causes the air pressure in the airways to oscillate between 5 and 35 cmH2O. These high-frequency pressure differences cause the airway walls to vibrate along with these oscillations. A constant pressure is maintained during the percussions of air in the lungs while percussions of air are given. As a result, the airways are kept open during the percussions. This technique aims to loosen mucus and secretions in the lungs and mobilize them into the large airways to be coughed out.

The IPV treatment was personalized and adjusted to the patient's feedback and mucus movement. The initial pressure and flow were set to feel and see a chest wiggle and to sense the feedback of the percussion at the chest. The starting frequency was set at 260 cycles per minute. Patients were instructed to breathe at different breathing levels during the treatment according to the principles of autogenic drainage, though the treatment was not categorized as autogenic drainage.

High frequencies were used to loosen mucus, whereas lower frequencies were used to sustain the process effectively.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling, which includes the medication guide and patient instructions for use.

- **Important instructions for administration of Arikayce**: Instruct patients to read the instructions for use before starting Arikayce. They should use only the Lamira® Nebulizer System to administer Arikayce and should not use it with any other medicine.

- **Hypersensitivity pneumonitis and bronchospasm (difficulty breathing)**: Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they experience shortness of breath or wheezing after administration of Arikayce. Patients with a history of reactive airway disease, asthma, or bronchospasm should administer Arikayce after using a short-acting bronchodilator [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)].

- **Hemoptysis or cough**: Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they cough up blood or experience episodic cough either during or after Arikayce administration, particularly in the first month after starting Arikayce [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease**: Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they experience worsening of their lung disease after starting Arikayce [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Dysphonia or difficulty speaking**: Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they have difficulty speaking. Difficulty speaking or loss of ability to speak has been reported with Arikayce [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Long-term pulmonary sequelae 5–14 years after protracted bacterial bronchitis in early childhood [^113VDZ5T]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

Cough is the most commonly reported symptom in children and adults, and it is the primary reason for consulting a healthcare provider. Chronic cough is defined as frequent coughing for more than 8 weeks in adults or more than 4 weeks in children. While chronic dry cough in childhood is often associated with asthma, protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is the most common cause of chronic wet cough in children, accounting for almost all cases of chronic wet cough in preschool age. The burden of chronic cough is high for both children and their families. PBB was first described in 2006 and is characterized by a wet cough that persists for at least 4 weeks without evidence of a specific cause, resolving after 2–4 weeks of antibiotic treatment. Some of the most common pathogens involved are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. PBB is characterized by neutrophilic inflammation of the airways and activation of the innate immune system, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. PBB is thought to be a major cause of non-CF bronchiectasis, so early identification of children at risk is a high priority.
