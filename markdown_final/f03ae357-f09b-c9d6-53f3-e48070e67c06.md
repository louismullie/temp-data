## Question

galactorrhea in post menopausal woman

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing galactorrhea in a postmenopausal woman. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing physiologic from pathologic nipple discharge. Then, I should verify the initial laboratory workup and how to interpret prolactin results, including macroprolactin. Next, I will consider medication-induced causes and when to image the pituitary. After that, I need to outline management pathways for normoprolactinemic, medication-induced, and tumor-related galactorrhea, including special considerations in menopause. Finally, I should address follow-up, bone health, and when to refer, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and classify the discharge, because I need to ensure we are not missing a pathologic process. Galactorrhea is milky, non-bloody, and often bilateral; pathologic discharge is spontaneous, bloody, unilateral, or associated with a mass, and requires surgical evaluation rather than an endocrine workup, so I should not jump to conclusions before categorizing the discharge correctly [^a199e883] [^4b774910].

> Wait, let me verify the initial laboratory approach in a postmenopausal woman with suspected galactorrhea. Even though pregnancy is unlikely, I should still obtain a pregnancy test because false negatives can occur and pregnancy remains a physiologic cause of galactorrhea; concurrently, I should measure serum prolactin and TSH, and assess renal function if hyperprolactinemia is confirmed, since hypothyroidism and renal insufficiency are established secondary causes [^a199e883] [^a199e883] [^3e6ce58f].

> I need to check how to interpret prolactin results, especially in the mild range. Mild elevations between 20–40 ng/mL should be repeated to confirm persistence, and if they remain mildly elevated without symptoms, I should consider macroprolactin testing to avoid unnecessary imaging; macroprolactin is biologically inactive and present in up to 20% of cases labeled hyperprolactinemic, so confirming it prevents overtreatment and MRI overuse [^bd04b4c6] [^b5205e3b].

> Hold on, I should verify medication causation before labeling a patient as having a pituitary disorder. I will now examine all prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal agents, with particular attention to antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiemetics like metoclopramide, and verapamil; if a culprit is identified, the preferred approach is to discontinue or switch to a lower-risk alternative when feasible, and then recheck prolactin in 4–6 weeks to document resolution [^a199e883] [^f282e1d9] [^513ce74f].

> Next, I should review when to image the pituitary. If prolactin is persistently elevated above about 150–200 ng/mL, or if there are red flags such as headache, visual symptoms, or a mass effect, I should order a pituitary MRI with gadolinium; conversely, if prolactin is normal or only mildly elevated and a medication cause is likely, imaging can be deferred while I address the drug exposure first [^d5f58516] [^a199e883].

> Let me consider the differential in postmenopause, because the pattern differs from premenopausal patients. In menopause, estrogen's stimulatory effect on lactotrophs wanes, so microprolactinomas are less likely to be symptomatic and macroprolactinomas are more often discovered due to mass effect; thus, I should maintain a high index of suspicion for larger tumors when headaches or visual complaints accompany galactorrhea in this age group [^notfound] [^2e1e3a64].

> I should double-check management when prolactin is normal. If galactorrhea is normoprolactinemic and not bothersome, reassurance and observation are appropriate; if bothersome, a short trial of a low-dose dopamine agonist such as cabergoline can suppress lactation, and I need to counsel the patient to avoid repeated nipple stimulation that perpetuates prolactin release [^a199e883] [^3e6ce58f].

> For medication-induced hyperprolactinemia, I need to ensure the plan prioritizes switching or tapering the offending agent when clinically safe, then reassessing prolactin; if the psychiatric indication is strong and switching is not possible, cautious use of a dopamine agonist may be considered, balancing symptom relief against potential psychiatric activation, and adjunctive aripiprazole can be a strategy in antipsychotic-induced cases, though evidence quality varies and polypharmacy risks must be weighed [^a199e883] [^f3af7aa8].

> For prolactinoma, I should confirm tumor size and visual status before deciding on therapy. Cabergoline is first-line due to superior efficacy and tolerability, with bromocriptine as an alternative; in postmenopausal women, microadenomas can often be observed if asymptomatic, whereas macroadenomas generally warrant treatment to prevent mass effect, and menopause may facilitate dopamine agonist withdrawal in selected patients with sustained remission after stringent criteria are met [^a199e883] [^2e1e3a64] [^0973ac22].

> But wait, what if the patient is on hormone therapy — could that be causal or contributory. Exogenous estrogen can prime breast tissue and unmask galactorrhea in someone with borderline prolactin, and rare case reports describe prolactinoma growth after hormone therapy; therefore, I should reassess the necessity of hormone therapy, monitor prolactin closely if it is continued, and consider concomitant dopamine agonist therapy if hyperprolactinemia persists or a tumor is present [^32f0cbfb] [^2fc27a19].

> I need to ensure I address long-term risks and follow-up. Hyperprolactinemia accelerates bone loss, so I should assess bone density and calcium/vitamin D status, and if a dopamine agonist is used, I should recheck prolactin in about 4–6 weeks, titrate to normalize, and repeat MRI in 6–12 months for macroadenomas or if symptoms recur; in microadenomas, less frequent imaging is acceptable once stability is established [^e360c0fd] [^a199e883].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure nothing is missing. Confirm milky, non-bloody discharge; obtain pregnancy test, prolactin, and TSH; if prolactin is mildly elevated, repeat and consider macroprolactin; review medications comprehensively; image if prolactin is significantly elevated or mass-effect symptoms are present; manage based on cause with observation, medication adjustment, or dopamine agonist therapy; and arrange follow-up for symptom control, tumor surveillance, and bone health, tailoring decisions to patient preferences and comorbidities [^513ce74f] [^a199e883] [^d5f58516].

Galactorrhea in postmenopausal women is **never normal** and warrants evaluation for underlying causes, most commonly **medications** (especially antipsychotics, antidepressants, and hormone therapy), **pituitary adenomas**, or **hypothyroidism** [^a199e883] [^3279f53b]. Initial workup should include a **focused history**, exam, and labs (prolactin, TSH, renal function) [^513ce74f]; if prolactin is elevated or no medication cause is found, obtain a **pituitary MRI** [^d5f58516]. Management targets the cause: stop offending drugs when possible, treat hypothyroidism, and use dopamine agonists (cabergoline preferred) for prolactinomas [^a199e883] [^e360c0fd]. Even if asymptomatic, persistent galactorrhea needs follow-up to monitor for tumor growth, bone loss, and recurrence after therapy [^e360c0fd].

---

## Physiological and pathological mechanisms

Galactorrhea arises from **hyperprolactinemia**, which in postmenopausal women is often due to:

- **Medications**: Antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone), antidepressants (e.g. SSRIs, TCAs), and hormone therapy can elevate prolactin via dopamine blockade or stimulation of lactotrophs [^f282e1d9] [^513ce74f].

- **Pituitary adenomas**: Prolactinomas are the most common pituitary tumors and can cause significant hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea [^d5f58516].

- **Hypothyroidism**: Elevated TRH increases prolactin secretion [^d5f58516].

- **Chest wall injury or irritation**: Rarely, nerve injury or irritation can stimulate prolactin release [^7d6b821f].

---

## Clinical evaluation

A thorough evaluation includes:

- **History**: Onset, duration, medication use, symptoms of mass effect (headache, visual changes), and systemic symptoms (weight gain, fatigue) [^d5f58516].

- **Physical examination**: Breast exam, visual fields, and signs of hypothyroidism or mass effect [^d5f58516].

- **Laboratory tests**: Prolactin, TSH, renal function, and pregnancy test if applicable [^a199e883].

- **Imaging**: Pituitary MRI if prolactin is elevated or no medication cause is identified [^d5f58516].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** of galactorrhea in postmenopausal women includes:

| **Category** | **Causes** |
|-|-|
| Medications | - Antipsychotics (risperidone, haloperidol) <br/> - Antidepressants (SSRIs, TCAs) <br/> - Hormone therapy <br/> - Antiemetics (metoclopramide) [^f282e1d9] [^513ce74f] |
| Pituitary disorders | - Prolactinomas <br/> - Non-functioning pituitary adenomas (stalk effect) <br/> - Hypothalamic lesions [^d5f58516] |
| Endocrine disorders | - Primary hypothyroidism <br/> - Chronic renal failure [^d5f58516] |
| Chest wall injury | - Surgical trauma <br/> - Zoster <br/> - Nerve injury [^7d6b821f] |
| Idiopathic | - Unknown causes after exhaustive evaluation [^a199e883] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Medication-induced**: Discontinue or switch offending drugs when feasible; consider dopamine agonists if symptoms persist [^a199e883] [^f282e1d9].

- **Prolactinomas**: Dopamine agonists (cabergoline preferred) are first-line; surgery or radiotherapy for refractory cases or intolerance [^a199e883] [^e360c0fd].

- **Hypothyroidism**: Treat with levothyroxine to normalize prolactin [^notfound].

- **Idiopathic**: Observation with periodic prolactin monitoring; treat if symptomatic or prolactin rises [^a199e883].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with appropriate treatment, but persistent hyperprolactinemia can cause osteoporosis, sexual dysfunction, and tumor growth. Regular follow-up is essential to monitor for recurrence and complications [^e360c0fd].

---

Galactorrhea in postmenopausal women is **abnormal and requires evaluation** for medications, pituitary disease, or hypothyroidism. Management targets the cause, with dopamine agonists for prolactinomas and close follow-up to prevent complications [^a199e883].

### Evaluation and treatment of galactorrhea [^abd361b7]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Galactorrhea, or inappropriate lactation, is a relatively common problem that occurs in approximately 20 to 25 percent of women. Lactation requires the presence of estrogen, progesterone and, most importantly, prolactin. Stress, suckling, sleep, sexual intercourse and medications may increase prolactin levels, whereas dopamine inhibits its release. The differential diagnosis of galactorrhea includes pituitary adenomas, neurologic disorders, hypothyroidism, numerous medications, breast stimulation, chest wall irritation and physiologic causes. The evaluation includes a thorough history and physical examination, as well as selected laboratory and imaging studies to rule out secondary causes such as an intracranial mass or a tumor. Diagnostic studies include a pregnancy test, a prolactin level, renal and thyroid function tests and, if indicated, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Treatment options for prolactinomas include observation, dopamine agonists, surgery and radiation therapy, depending on tumor size and associated symptoms. Fortunately, the prognosis for patients with prolactinomas is good: most prolactinomas remain stable or regress. In pregnant women, prolactinomas must be observed closely because the lesions may greatly increase in size.

### An unusual case of galactorrhea in a postmenopausal woman complicating breast reduction [^7d6b821f]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Galactorrhea is a relatively common condition, but has rarely been seen following breast reduction surgery. To date there are only seven cases reported in the literature, all in premenopausal women. Postsurgical galactorrhea is a diagnosis of exclusion and differential diagnosis is extensive. Common causes should be excluded first. We present the case of a 56-year-old postmenopausal woman who underwent bilateral breast reduction and developed galactorrhea 2 months postoperatively. MRI scan of the skull as well as Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH), prolactin levels were normal. She was on long-term hormonal replacement therapy. Because of suspected nerve-related pain in her right breast she was commenced on amitriptyline. We hypothesise that galactorrhea may have been caused by underlying neuroma or irritation of the anterior branch of the T4 intercostal nerve or hormonal replacement therapy or a combination of both.

### Galactorrhea with menstrual irregularity: something other than a prolactinoma? [^98347112]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Galactorrhea and menstrual irregularity are typical manifestations of hyperprolactinemia. In the absence of a demonstrable pituitary mass on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the condition is usually labeled as idiopathic hyperprolactinemia and presumed to be due to microadenomas too small to visualize. As our case will demonstrate, however, there are a number of other causes that should be considered in any patient with otherwise unexplained hyperprolactinemia.

### Galactorrhea: rapid evidence review [^a199e883]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Galactorrhea is the production of breast milk that is not the result of physiologic lactation. Milky nipple discharge within one year of pregnancy and the cessation of breastfeeding is usually physiologic. Galactorrhea is more often the result of hyperprolactinemia caused by medication use or pituitary microadenomas, and less often hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, cirrhosis, pituitary macroadenomas, hypothalamic lesions, or unidentifiable causes. A pregnancy test should be obtained for premenopausal women who present with galactorrhea. In addition to prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, renal function should also be assessed. Medications contributing to hyperprolactinemia should be discontinued if possible. Treatment of galactorrhea is not needed if prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are normal and the discharge is not troublesome to the patient. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland should be performed if the cause of hyperprolactinemia is unclear after a medication review and laboratory evaluation. Cabergoline is the preferred medication for treatment of hyperprolactinemia. Transsphenoidal surgery may be necessary if prolactin levels do not improve and symptoms persist despite high doses of cabergoline and in patients who cannot tolerate dopamine agonist therapy.

Diagnosis at Menopausal Age

Menopause is associated with a physiologic decline of the stimulatory effects of estrogens on PRL secretion and lactotroph cell proliferation and a physiological reduction in circulating PRL levels. Therefore, in postmenopausal women, when fertility does not represent a foremost concern, the lack of the classical amenorrhea–galactorrhea syndrome from PRL excess may result in the underestimation of the exact prevalence of prolactinomas. This is particularly true for women with microprolactinomas, although at least one-third of those diagnosed at menopausal age have reported secondary amenorrhea in their medical history, suggesting that a scrupulous investigation of these symptoms during fertile age might prompt an earlier diagnosis. Most patients (92%) with prolactinomas diagnosed after menopause have been found to harbor a pituitary macroadenoma, or even a giant pituitary tumor, leading predominantly to signs and symptoms of mass effect, such as headache and visual loss, with pituitary apoplexy occurring in approximately 5% of cases. The evidence of large tumor size and frequent invasiveness of prolactinomas in postmenopausal women has raised the question of whether these tumors are biologically comparable with those of male patients, likewise characterized by rapid growth rate and increased markers of cellular proliferation. However, a lower estrogen receptor α expression, together with low estrogen production, may per se promote lactotroph cell proliferation and trigger the development of large, invasive pituitary tumors in postmenopausal women.

### Evaluation and management of galactorrhea [^3e6ce58f]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Galactorrhea is commonly caused by hyperprolactinemia, especially when it is associated with amenorrhea. Hyperprolactinemia is most often induced by medication or associated with pituitary adenomas or other sellar or suprasellar lesions. Less common causes of galactorrhea include hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency, pregnancy, and nipple stimulation. After pathologic nipple discharge is ruled out, patients with galactorrhea should be evaluated by measurement of their prolactin level. Those with hyperprolactinemia should have pregnancy ruled out, and thyroid and renal function assessed. Brain magnetic resonance imaging should be performed if no other cause of hyperprolactinemia is found. Patients with prolactinomas are usually treated with dopamine agonists (bromocriptine or cabergoline); surgery or radiation therapy is rarely required. Medications causing hyperprolactinemia should be discontinued or replaced with a medication from a similar class with lower potential for causing hyperprolactinemia. Normoprolactinemic patients with idiopathic, nonbothersome galactorrhea can be reassured and do not need treatment; however, those with bothersome galactorrhea usually respond to a short course of a low-dose dopamine agonist.

### Galactorrhea / galactocele after breast augmentation: a systematic review [^9456ee62]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

To review cases of galactorrhea and galactocele postbreast augmentation, determine possible risk factors and consider management strategies of this rare complication.

Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted in July 2019 searching Pubmed, Embase, and Google Scholar.

Results

The searches revealed 19 articles (17 case reports/series and 2 retrospective chart reviews) collectively comprising 38 women. The average age was 28 years, 42% were on oral contraceptives, whereas a quarter were nulliparous. The most common incision was periareolar (48%) followed by transaxillary (24%). The most common implant location was subglandular (57%) followed by subpectoral (37%). The average time to symptom onset was 61 days (range, 3–912 days) but only 3 cases presented more than a month after implant insertion. Twenty-one patients had galactorrhea, 7 had galactocele, whereas 10 women had both. Bilateral symptoms were present in 72% of cases, whereas hyperprolactinemia was present in only 62%. Management strategies included simple surveillance, antibiotics, dopamine agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, estrogenic agents, surgical washout, and implant removal (8 patients). The mean time to symptom resolution was 22.6 days.

Conclusions

The numbers are too small for definitive conclusions but there is a weak suggestion that periareolar incisions, subglandular implants, prior hormonal contraceptive use, gravidity, and recent history of breastfeeding (< 1 year) may be risk factors for galactorrhea/galactocele. Symptom onset is usually within 3 months. Treatments providing the fastest response (2 days) comprised of a composite approach (antibiotics, dopamine agonist, surgical drainage, and implant removal), whereas the use of estrogenic medications appeared to confer little benefit.

### Euprolactinemic galactorrhea associated with use of imipramine and escitalopram in a postmenopausal woman [^8a23525c]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Hormonal side effects of antidepressants are infrequent, and galactorrhea is seldom mentioned among tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-related side effects. Antidepressants can directly stimulate postsynaptic 5-HT receptors in the hypothalamus or indirectly inhibit the tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons through 5-HT, which may increase prolactin levels and later cause galactorrhea. We describe a case of euprolactinemic galactorrhea in a postmenopausal woman, induced by imipramine and escitalopram. This report highlights the presence of unidentified novel mechanisms of antidepressant-induced galactorrhea and other possible contributors.

### Approach to the patient with dopamine-resistant microprolactinoma [^4a590d4f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Prolactinoma is a significant cause of hyperprolactinemia and the most common type of pituitary tumor. Women of fertile age are most commonly affected, and the clinical picture is characterized by galactorrhea, oligo-amenorrhea and, infertility. In microprolactinomas, which represent more than 60% of cases in women before menopause, there is usually no concern about the mass effect. Therefore, the management can be expectant if there are no symptoms or in a patient in the post-menopause period; oral contraceptive in the presence of hypogonadism and no desire for pregnancy; dopamine agonist (DA) in the presence of bothersome galactorrhea, hypogonadism, and the desire for fertility; and neurosurgery in selected non-invasive cases. Resistance to dopamine agonists occurs in less than 10% of cases. Although the reduction in D2R expression is considered the primary cause of DA resistance, the underlying mechanisms are not yet completely elucidated. The main concern in resistant cases is the risk of symptomatic tumor growth during assisted reproduction techniques and pregnancy. Other conditions in which hyperprolactinemia could be implicated, such as metabolic parameters, osteoporosis, and breast cancer risk are also discussed. Understanding the mechanisms of DA resistance can lead to the opening of new treatment strategies.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^bd04b4c6]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Hyperprolactinemia evaluation — hyperprolactinemia may be associated with decreased E2 concentrations and amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, yet only approximately 1/3 of women with hyperprolactinemia will have galactorrhea; prolactin concentrations are higher in women with amenorrhea than in those with oligomenorrhea, and prolactin levels < 15–20 ng/mL in most clinical laboratories will exclude hyperprolactinemia, whereas mildly elevated values (20–40 ng/mL) should be repeated and confirmed, and if they remain mildly elevated (and the patient is otherwise asymptomatic), a macroprolactin level should be considered; macroprolactin has been reported to have a prevalence as high as nearly 20% of patients diagnosed with hyperprolactinemia, is biologically inactive compared with the predominant circulating form of prolactin (80%–95%) called monomeric prolactin, and macroprolactinemia is confirmed by having the laboratory pretreat the patient's serum with polyethylene glycol to precipitate macroprolactin; establishing this diagnosis avoids unnecessary and costly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging.

### Surgery as first-line treatment for prolactinoma? Discussion of the literature and results of a consecutive series of surgically treated patients [^74552a49]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prolactinomas or lactotrophic adenomas are the most common pituitary adenomas, accounting for approximately 50% of all pituitary adenomas and are characterized by excessive prolactin secretion (levels > 150–200 ng/mL). These high levels of prolactin can cause decreased fertility, decreased energy and libido, and galactorrhea in men and premenopausal women. Headache is a common symptom in men, pre- and postmenopausal women while hypogonadism is seen exclusively in men, and oligo- or amenorrhea is seen exclusively in premenopausal women. Visual field deficits and visual acuity deficits can result from compression of the optic nerves and chiasm.

While elevated prolactin levels (hyperprolactinemia) can also be caused by other pituitary adenomas through increased intrasellar pressure, known as the stalk effect, or by hypothalamic dysfunction, medications, or various conditions such as pregnancy, liver cirrhosis, and hypothyroidism, these levels are usually well below the prolactin serum levels caused by prolactinomas.

### Ovarian function in girls and women with GALT-deficiency galactosemia [^b5193e83]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

What is primary or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)?

Primary or premature ovarian insufficiency is a spectrum disorder of ovarian dysfunction that differs considerably among women. In its mildest form, POI may present as diminished ovarian reserve with subfertility and often an elevated FSH level in a woman's fourth decade of life. However, more severe forms of POI will present with primary amenorrhea in the young adolescent with absent sex steroid production and a complete lack of secondary sexual characteristics. Many women with POI have an intermediate phenotype, with normal progression through puberty and later onset of irregular to absent menstrual cycles and/or infertility. Proposed clinical criteria for the diagnosis of intermediate POI include secondary amenorrhea for at least 4 consecutive months or more, prior to the age of 40, in the setting of low estradiol and elevated FSH (Goswami and Conway; Welt).

The term "primary ovarian insufficiency" was first used in the literature more than 60 years ago (Albright) and was re-introduced recently as a more appropriate term to replace less encompassing, compassionate, and descriptive terms such as "premature ovarian failure" or "premature menopause" that had come into use (Welt). POI is not, in fact, the early onset of natural menopause. Many women with POI experience irregular ovarian function after their diagnosis, with months of regular menses and ovulation alternating with intervals of amenorrhea and hypoestrogenism. Antral follicle counts, determined by ultrasound, and serum FSH levels may vary considerably. This fluctuating course of ovarian function is seldom seen once a woman has experienced natural menopause and amenorrhea at a more typical age. Of note, 5–10% of women given a diagnosis of POI may still spontaneously conceive, and there is very little evidence that any current treatment increases this rate (Van Kasteren and Schoemaker).

### Diagnosis and management of galactorrhea [^e60c260b]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

After infancy, galactorrhea usually is medication-induced. The most common pathologic cause of galactorrhea is a pituitary tumor. Other causes include hypothalamic and pituitary stalk lesions, neurogenic stimulation, thyroid disorders, and chronic renal failure. Patients with the latter conditions may have irregular menses, infertility, and osteopenia or osteoporosis if they have associated hyperprolactinemia. Tests for pregnancy, serum prolactin level and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and magnetic resonance imaging are important diagnostic tools that should be employed when clinically indicated. The underlying cause of galactorrhea should be treated when possible. The decision to treat patients with galactorrhea is based on the serum prolactin level, the severity of galactorrhea, and the patient's fertility desires. Dopamine agonists are the treatment of choice in most patients with hyperprolactinemic disorders. Bromocriptine is the preferred agent for treatment of hyperprolactin-induced anovulatory infertility. Although cabergoline is more effective and better tolerated than bromocriptine, it is more expensive, and treatment must be discontinued one month before conception is attempted. Surgical resection rarely is required for prolactinomas.

### Management of nipple discharge [^4b774910]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Nipple discharge is the third most common breast-related complaint but is rarely the presenting symptom of breast cancer. Distinguishing patients with physiologic versus pathologic nipple discharge, and treating the later according to the underlying pathologic condition is of utmost importance. Nipple discharge is categorized as lactational, physiologic, or pathologic. Physiologic nipple discharge (galactorrhea) is typically caused by hyperprolactinemia due to medications (ie, antipsychotics), pituitary tumors, and endocrine disorders. When a suspicious radiologic lesion is identified, pathologic assessment of the lesion is indicated. Patients with pathologic nipple discharge should be referred to a breast surgeon for definitive treatment and follow-up.

### Fertility evaluation of infertile women: a committee opinion [^be5a67ac]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Infertility evaluation — other endocrine systems: Prolactin is indicated in women with galactorrhea, or oligomenorrhea, and if the thyroid-stimulating hormone is abnormal, assessment of free T4 and thyroid autoantibodies is warranted. If signs of androgen excess or oligomenorrhea, check serum total and free testosterone, and 17 hydroxyprogesterone; if testosterone is > 200 ng/ml, ultrasound of the ovaries and computed tomography of the adrenal glands to exclude androgen-secreting neoplasm, and if 17 hydroxyprogesterone is > 200 ng/dl, perform an acute adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test to exclude 21-hydroxylase deficient nonclassical adrenal hyperplasia.

### Common breast problems [^881ada1a]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

A palpable mass, mastalgia, and nipple discharge are common breast symptoms for which patients seek medical attention. Patients should be evaluated initially with a detailed clinical history and physical examination. Most women presenting with a breast mass will require imaging and further workup to exclude cancer. Diagnostic mammography is usually the imaging study of choice, but ultrasonography is more sensitive in women younger than 30 years. Any suspicious mass that is detected on physical examination, mammography, or ultrasonography should be biopsied. Biopsy options include fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, and excisional biopsy. Mastalgia is usually not an indication of underlying malignancy. Oral contraceptives, hormone therapy, psychotropic drugs, and some cardiovascular agents have been associated with mastalgia. Focal breast pain should be evaluated with diagnostic imaging. Targeted ultrasonography can be used alone to evaluate focal breast pain in women younger than 30 years, and as an adjunct to mammography in women 30 years and older. Treatment options include acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The first step in the diagnostic workup for patients with nipple discharge is classification of the discharge as pathologic or physiologic. Nipple discharge is classified as pathologic if it is spontaneous, bloody, unilateral, or associated with a breast mass. Patients with pathologic discharge should be referred to a surgeon. Galactorrhea is the most common cause of physiologic discharge not associated with pregnancy or lactation. Prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels should be checked in patients with galactorrhea.

### Ovulation in a postmenopausal woman [^94de44d1]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the first documented case of ovulation in a postmenopausal woman.

Design

Case study.

Setting

University reproductive endocrinology and infertility clinic.

Patient(S)

A 57-year-old woman, who had been postmenopausal for 3 years and presented with breast tenderness and was found to have laboratory and ultrasound evidence of ovulation.

Intervention(S)

Laboratory evaluation and transvaginal ultrasound.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Ovulation in a postmenopausal woman.

Result(S)

Laboratory evaluations revealed estrogen and progesterone consistent with an ovulatory pattern. Ultrasound revealed a thickened endometrium and a corpus luteum, both of which resolved after menses.

Conclusion(S)

This is the first report of ovulation in a postmenopausal woman. This observation opens the door to new questions about the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in menopause as well as about ovarian senescence.

Prolactin excess results in a syndrome that is more often obvious in younger women due to amenorrhea and galactorrhea but can be subtle, especially in older patients who manifest loss of libido, and osteoporosis. Hyperprolactinemia in a patient with a pituitary mass can be the result of tumor production but also occurs in patients with masses that do not produce PRL but interrupt the tonic hypothalamic inhibition of PRL secretion by dopamine, including even inflammatory disorders. In patients with clear tumor masses, which are often dismissed clinically as "PRLomas", it is critically important for the diagnostician to analyze PRL levels in the context of tumor size. In general, large tumors that do not produce PRL result in PRL levels that do not exceed 150 ug/L (mIU/L, where normal is < 40 in nonpregnant females). Among tumors that produce PRL, the vast majority are sparsely granulated lactotroph tumors that show a very strong correlation between tumor size and degree of hyperprolactinemia. These highly differentiated PitNETs are exquisitely susceptible to dopamine agonist therapies that result in tumor shrinkage and normalization of PRL levels, and over the past 40 years the availability of novel dopamine agonists has resulted in a significant reduction of patients requiring surgery and some ultimately resolve with medical therapy alone. Those that come to surgery are either very large "giant" tumors or other tumor types that produce PRL, including the rare densely granulated lactotroph tumors, acidophil stem cell tumors and immature PIT1-lineage tumors (formerly known as silent subtype 3 pituitary adenomas or poorly differentiated PIT1-lineage tumors). Hyperprolactinemia is also a feature of mammosomatotroph and mature plurihormonal PIT1-lineage tumors but these are almost always associated with GH excess that dominates the clinical scenario.

### Current guidelines and their recommendations for prolactin monitoring in psychosis [^88cd7ec1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Guidelines on the use of second-generation antipsychotics and physical health monitoring have begun to include information on hyperprolactinemia, and generally recommend that patients should be queried about possible symptoms related to elevated prolactin: menstrual abnormalities, galactorrhea and sexual dysfunction. However, with only two exceptions, none of the guidelines suggest performing baseline plasma prolactin levels. Although several of the guidelines mention the potential for hyperprolactinemia to be associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis, there is no guidance how to monitor for this. Product labeling for the different antipsychotics inform the clinician about potential risks but are not helpful with precise monitoring recommendations. The internal medicine literature contains important information regarding the pulsatile secretion of prolactin, differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia, and plasma levels of prolactin usually associated with certain symptoms that would be useful for the prescriber of antipsychotics to be aware of. The prudent clinician should consider obtaining a baseline plasma prolactin level and at least one follow-up measurement when starting any patient on a new antipsychotic. This will help guide clinical decisions about antipsychotic dosage, switching antipsychotic medications, or considering ancillary treatments to protect bone mass. These decisions would be within the context of considering other adverse events as well as the overall effectiveness of the antipsychotic medication being used.

### Emotionally induced galactorrhoea in a non-lactating female – "Pseudo-lactation"? [^a165ee0a]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Though a rare incident, we believe emotionally induced pseudo lactation may be an important secondary cause for transient hyperprolactinaemia in a non-lactating female. Consideration of this as a cause of galactorrhoea may lead to find similar cases in the future. This case illustrates the importance of a thorough clinical history in arriving at a diagnosis.

### Galactorrhea with menstrual irregularity: something other than a prolactinoma? [^7cca9cce]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Although hyperprolactinemia is known to occur in patients with cirrhosis, it is most often asymptomatic. We suggest that this paradox might be due to the preponderance of male patients included in such studies. It is well known that the physiologic action of prolactin is potentiated by the presence of high levels of estrogen and progesterone. Therefore, for a given degree of hyperprolactinemia, a female subject is more likely to develop symptoms such as galactorrhea than a male patient. In particular, endocrine manifestations of Wilson's disease remain poorly understood. Gonadal dysfunction can produce amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea and recurrent abortions in females, although true infertility is rare. Similarly, there have been case reports of hypoparathyroidism, possibly secondary to copper deposition within the parathyroid glands.

It is pertinent to note that there is no clear relationship between the severity of liver disease and the degree of hyperprolactinemia. As shown in our case, as a direct consequence of this discrepancy, hyperprolactinemia can manifest well before other more classical complications of cirrhosis, such as variceal bleeding and ascites, appear. This is especially important in the context of patients with a potentially treatable cause of cirrhosis, such as Wilson's disease, where the rapid and timely institution of appropriate therapy can significantly alter the natural history of the disease.

In conclusion, unexplained hyperprolactinemia can be a marker for underlying systemic disease, and therefore warrants careful investigation before being labeled as idiopathic.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^dddbea37]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopause diagnosis and definitions — In a woman with an intact uterus, menopause is a clinical diagnosis based upon cessation of menses for at least 12 months, and sex steroids, gonadotropins, inhibin B, or anti-Mullerian hormone measurements do not further inform the diagnosis, do not indicate precisely when the final menstrual period will occur, and will not influence management unless a woman is seeking fertility. Table definitions specify that spontaneous menopause occurs at an average age of 51 y, early menopause is cessation of ovarian function between ages 40 and 45, and POI is loss of ovarian function before the age of 40 y with the prevalence of POI is approximately 1%.

### Common breast problems [^d69d7e6b]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Palpable breast masses, mastalgia, and nipple discharge are commonly encountered symptoms in outpatient practice, causing significant patient anxiety and precipitating medical consultation. The initial workup includes a detailed clinical history and physical examination. Women presenting with a breast mass will require imaging and further assessment to exclude cancer. Diagnostic mammography is usually preferred, but ultrasonography is more sensitive in women younger than 30 years. Any suspicious mass detected on physical examination, mammography, or ultrasonography should undergo biopsy. In most cases, a core needle biopsy should be performed with imaging guidance for evaluation of a suspicious mass. Mastalgia is usually not an indication of underlying malignancy. Oral contraceptives, hormone therapy, some psychotropic drugs, and some cardiovascular agents have been associated with mastalgia. Focal breast pain should be evaluated with diagnostic imaging. Targeted ultrasonography localized to discrete areas of the breast can be used alone to evaluate focal breast pain in women younger than 30 years, and as an adjunct to mammography in women 30 years and older. Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as diclofenac, are a first-line treatment option. The first step in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with nipple discharge is classification of the discharge as pathologic or physiologic. Nipple discharge is classified as pathologic if it is spontaneous, bloody, unilateral, or associated with a breast mass. Patients with pathologic discharge should undergo diagnostic imaging. Galactorrhea is the most common cause of physiologic discharge not associated with pregnancy or lactation. It occurs as a result of an endocrinopathy (hyperprolactinemia or thyroid dysfunction) or from the use of dopamine-inhibiting medications.

### Emotionally induced galactorrhoea in a non-lactating female – "Pseudo-lactation"? [^cbc1a432]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Causes for hyperprolactinaemia are numerous; nipple stimulation, chest wall injury, breast feeding, co-morbid psychiatric disorders and treatment with dopamine antagonists are some of them. In addition direct stimulation of lactotrophs by oestrogen (during pregnancy, oestrogen containing contraceptive pills) also causes hyperprolactinaemia. In our patient all above causes except pregnancy have been excluded by a comprehensive history. Pregnancy was excluded by normal ultra sound scan of the abdomen.

Commonest pathological cause for galactorrhoea is a pituitary tumour. Prolactin secreting adenomas or other functional tumours co-secreting prolactin or any form of macroadenoma that is large enough to cause pituitary stalk compression (i.e. disconnection hyperprolactinaemia) may result in hyperprolactinaemia. In this patient MRI scan of the pituitary gland did not reveal any evidence of micro or macroadenoma. Although our patient underwent the MRI scan 4 months after the initial presentation it is highly unlikely for a pituitary tumour to undergo spontaneous regression even without any drugs such as dopamine receptor agonists.

Hypothyroidism removes the negative feedback on hypothalamic TRH and subsequently may cause an increase in prolactin secretion. Nearly 30% of patients with chronic kidney disease have high serum prolactin levels probably secondary to impaired renal excretion of prolactin. In our patient hypothyroidism was excluded by normal range of TSH and T 4. Although our patient has been diagnosed to have type 1 diabetes mellitus her renal function tests were normal including urine albumin creatinine ratio, serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate.

Stress is known to cause hyperprolactinaemia. In our patient venipuncture and psychological stressors are important to consider. When withdrawing venous blood for measurement of prolactin levels our patient was subjected to non-stress venipuncture and had only a single prolactin value. Endocrine society clinical practice guidelines also recommend single measurement of serum prolactin without excessive stress for diagnosis of hyperprolactinaemia.

### Clinical questions and uncertainty – prolactin measurement in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [^11639cfc]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Many antipsychotic medications have the potential to raise prolactin levels leading to a range of negative consequences. In addition to symptoms such as gynaecomastia, galactorrhoea, menstrual irregularities and sexual dysfunction it is becoming clear that there are a number of important and potentially serious long-term consequences, including a loss of bone mineral density and a possible association with the development of breast cancer. It is clear, therefore, that the tendency to raise prolactin should be an important consideration in the use of antipsychotics but, to a large degree, this area has been neglected in clinical practice and research when compared with other potential adverse effects. We consider some of the practical clinical issues in prolactin measurement and the management of high results. We will identify the areas of uncertainty that remain for clinicians and consider the practical questions that future research should address.

### Do nothing but observe microprolactinomas: when and how to replace sex hormones? [^980845ca]. Pituitary (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyperprolactinemia is associated with suppression of the hypothalamic- pituitary-gonadal axis and consequent hypogonadism, manifesting loss of libido, infertility and osteoporosis long-term in both male and female patients, with associated menstrual irregularities, amenorrhea and galactorrhea in women and erectile dysfunction in men. The primary goals of therapy in patients harboring prolactinoma are control of tumor size and normalization of serum PRL, with restoration of gonadal and sexual function and fertility. Clinical manifestations of hypogonadism have variable consequences depending on the age and sex of the patient and desire for fertility. Careful consideration of clinical consequences of hyperprolactinemia in relation to age and sex should help guide therapeutic decision making. Another important consideration in attaining our treatment goals in patients harboring microprolactinomas, is the observation that greater than 90% of microprolactinomas do not enlarge, when followed for 10 years. Treatment options for the management of microprolactinomas include observation alone, with monitoring of serum prolactin levels every 6–12 months, vs initiation of dopamine agonist therapy vs gonadal steroid hormone replacement (using the oral contraceptive or other combination estrogen and progesterone replacement regimens in females or testosterone replacement therapy in males). In the present review, current data related to clinical consequences of microprolactinomas and treatment outcomes at different stages in the lifespan are reviewed, with a suggested algorithm as to whether to treat or not, and an appropriate therapeutic regimen to institute.

Causes of amenorrhea — prevalence and principal etiologies — The prevalence of amenorrhea not due to pregnancy, lactation, or menopause is approximately 3%–4%. Normal menstrual function requires four components (hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, ovaries, and genital outflow tract), and most cases are accounted for by six conditions: polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hyperprolactinemia, thyroid dysfunction, hypogonadotropic and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and anatomic abnormalities. In specialized referral centers, approximately 5–20 patients per year were seen with primary amenorrhea annually. Amenorrhea may also occur with sexual ambiguity or virilization, and sexual ambiguity or virilization should be evaluated as separate disorders.

An accepted philosophy is that a fully informed patient should be empowered to make a decision that best balances individual QOL benefits against potential health risks.

### Emotionally induced galactorrhoea in a non-lactating female – "Pseudo-lactation"? [^aece8bdf]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Changes in neuroendocrine regulatory systems associated with psychiatric morbidity are also well known. For example major depressive disorders are associated with low dopamine synthesis in the brain. In fact this may at least partly explain the high serum prolactin levels seen in patients with pseudocyesis, a rare disorder, commonly associated with major depression, in which the woman thinks she is pregnant without having a foetus in utero, i.e. a 'pseudo-pregnancy'. However no such equivalent entity is described in medical literature where a woman falsely thinks she is lactating and experience milk production and emotional bonding to an unrelated infant, i.e. a 'pseudo-lactation'.

We describe the first patient with such symptoms, to the best of our knowledge.

### Prolactinomas and menopause: any changes in management? [^1ba501eb]. Pituitary (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Treatment goals in prolactinomas are to correct hypogonadism, restore fertility and control tumor mass in case of macroadenomas. According to current guidelines, medical treatment of asymptomatic postmenopausal women is not indicated. The purpose of this study was to review the current literature pertaining to biological behavior of prolactinomas during menopause, likelihood of successful dopamine agonist withdrawal during this period and possible prolactin-mediated increased morbidity that could modify current management.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search including papers published until July 2019 was conducted using PubMed and Medline databases.

Results

Women with prolactinomas entering menopause have a higher chance of prolactin normalization of treatment compared with women in their reproductive years. Although most prolactin secreting adenomas diagnosed during menopause are large, they respond well to dopamine agonist treatment. Data directly linking hyperprolactinemia with an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity are inconsistent. There is no data indicating that correction of hyperprolactinemia improves clinical outcomes in asymptomatic patients bearing microadenomas.

Conclusion

There is no evidence that justifies changing current recommendations to withhold medical treatment of microprolactinomas in asymptomatic post-menopausal women. Macroprolactinoma patients should be treated according to standard clinical practice.

### Menopause has a beneficial influence on the evolution of prolactinomas. A study of 99 patients [^0973ac22]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Menopause is thought to have beneficial effects in women with prolactinoma, potentially offering a higher chance for successful dopamine agonist (DA) withdrawal. However, strong evidence supporting this remains limited.

Objective

To assess the impact of menopause on prolactinoma evolution and recurrence after DA withdrawal.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

Two tertiary academic hospitals.

Patients

We retrospectively analysed data from 99 women undergoing menopause (Mp, defined as 12 months of amenorrhea, low estradiol and FSH > 25 U/L) while still on DA treatment for a prolactinoma (mean age at diagnosis: 37.9 ± 8.1 years). The tumors were microadenomas in 67 cases and macroadenomas in 32 (12 invasive).

Results

In post-menopausal women continuing DA at stable doses, median prolactin (PRL) levels decreased significantly from 18.0 µg/L before Mp to 9.8 µg/L 3–6 months after Mp (n = 71, p = 0.05) and to 7.9 µg/L after 24 months (n = 45, p < 0.001). Coronal surface also decreased significantly from 16.5 to 8.2 mm² at 24 months (n = 34, p < 0.01). DA treatment was successfully discontinued in 56 women, all meeting stringent criteria for discontinuation, with 41 (73%) remaining in remission over a median follow-up of 29 months. Recurrence occurred in 15 women (27%), mostly within the first year post-DA withdrawal. PRL concentration measured 3–6 months after DA discontinuation was the only independent predictor of recurrence. Estrogen-progestin replacement therapy, given in 23 women, did not influence prolactinoma outcome.

Conclusions

We confirm that menopause has a beneficial effect on the evolution of prolactinomas. When fulfilling stringent criteria for DA withdrawal, two-thirds of post-menopausal women can expect sustained remission, and recurrences are generally mild and asymptomatic.

### Menopause preparedness: perspectives for patient, provider, and policymaker consideration [^968e0545]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

The menopause transition is characterized by fluctuations and subsequent reduced production of the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone and the cessation of a woman's menstrual cycle. Defined as 12 months after the last period, the onset of the postmenopause typically occurs in a woman's 40s or 50s, with the average age of the final menstrual period in the United States being 51 years. An estimated 6,000 women in the United States reach menopause daily. Some individuals may experience early menopause before the age of 40 years due to certain illnesses and conditions that affect ovarian function, such as primary ovarian insufficiency and surgical removal of the ovaries, or other risk factors, including family history, smoking, and chemotherapy.

For many individuals, the hormonal changes that take place during perimenopause, the years leading up to menopause, are associated with physical and psychological symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, hot flashes, vaginal dryness, mood fluctuations, sleep disruptions, and cognitive challenges. Symptoms vary widely between individuals and are commonly misdiagnosed, resulting in delays in appropriate management of symptoms and disruption of day-to-day activities. Accumulating science about the menopause transition has revealed that this period can last up to 20 years. Some postmenopausal women are also at heightened risk for serious health conditions that increase after the final menstrual period, such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Furthermore, because of increases in life expectancy, a woman's postmenopause phase may comprise up to 40% of her life. If an individual is not adequately prepared and/or symptoms are not well-managed, the menopause transition has the potential to exacerbate conditions that impair quality of life and life expectancy.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone for women in the peri-or postmenopausal phase [^ac5614e5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

During menopause a decreasing ovarian follicular response generally causes a fluctuation and eventual decrease in estrogen levels. This can lead to the development of various perimenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms (for example hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness). Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is one of the main precursors of androgens, which in turn are converted to testosterone and estrogens. It is possible that the administration of DHEA may increase estrogen and testosterone levels in peri- and postmenopausal women to alleviate their symptoms and improve general wellbeing and sexual function (for example libido, dyspareunia, satisfaction). Treatment with DHEA is controversial as there is uncertainty about its effectiveness and safety. This review should clearly outline the evidence for DHEA in the treatment of menopausal symptoms and evaluate its effectiveness and safety by combining the results of randomised controlled trials.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of administering DHEA to women with menopausal symptoms in the peri- or postmenopausal phase.

Search Methods

The databases that we searched (3 June 2014) with no language restrictions applied were the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS. We also searched conference abstracts and citation lists in the ISI Web of Knowledge. Ongoing trials were searched in the trials registers. Reference lists of retrieved articles were checked.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing any dose and form of DHEA by any route of administration versus any other active intervention, placebo or no treatment for a minimal treatment duration of seven days in peri- and postmenopausal women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data after assessing eligibility for inclusion and quality of studies. Authors were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

Twenty-eight trials with 1273 menopausal women were included in this review. Data could be extracted from 16 trials to conduct the meta-analysis. The overall quality of the studies was moderate to low with the majority of studies that were included in the meta-analysis having reasonable methodology. Compared to placebo, DHEA did not improve quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.03 to 0.34, P = 0.10, 8 studies, 287 women (132 from parallel and 155 from crossover trials), I² = 0%, moderate quality evidence; one trial of the nine that reported on this outcome was removed in a sensitivity analysis as it was judged to be at high risk of bias). DHEA was found to be associated with androgenic side effects (mainly acne) (odds ratio (OR) 3.77, 95% CI 1.36 to 10.4, P = 0.01, 5 studies, 376 women, I² = 10%, moderate quality evidence) when compared to placebo. No associations were found with other adverse effects. It was unclear whether DHEA affected menopausal symptoms as the results from the trials were inconsistent and could not easily be pooled to provide an overall effect due to different types of measurement (for example continuous, dichotomous, change and end scores). DHEA was found to improve sexual function (SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.55, P = 0.01, 5 studies, 261 women (239 women from parallel trials and 22 women from crossover trials), I² = 0%; one trial judged to be at high risk of bias was removed during sensitivity analysis) compared to placebo. There was no difference in the acne associated with DHEA when comparing studies that used oral DHEA (OR 2.16, 95% CI 0.47 to 9.96, P = 0.90, 3 studies, 136 women, I² = 5%, very low quality evidence) to one study that used skin application of DHEA (OR 2.74, 95% CI 0.10 to 74.87, P = 0.90, 1 study, 22 women, very low quality evidence). The effects did not differ for sexual function when studies using oral DHEA (SMD 0.11, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.35, P = 0.36, 5 studies, 340 women, I² = 0) were compared to a study using intravaginal DHEA (SMD 0.42, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.81, 1 study, 218 women). Test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 1.77, df = 1 (P = 0.18), I² = 43.4%. Insufficient data were available to assess quality of life and menopausal symptoms for this comparison. There were insufficient data available to compare the effects of DHEA to hormone therapy (HT) for quality of life, menopausal symptoms, and adverse effects. No large differences in treatment effects were found for sexual function when comparing DHEA to HT (mean difference (MD) 1.26, 95% CI -0.21 to 2.73, P = 0.09, 2 studies, 41 women, I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence that DHEA improves quality of life but there is some evidence that it is associated with androgenic side effects. There is uncertainty whether DHEA decreases menopausal symptoms, but DHEA may slightly improve sexual function compared with placebo.

### Sweet and sour: an update on classic galactosemia [^6d85c83d]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Gonadal impairment

The most common complication reported for girls and women with classic galactosemia is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), with an incidence above 80% (Berry; Fridovich-Keil et al; Kaufman et al; Rubio-Gozalbo et al; Waggoner et al.). POI clinical manifestations range from absent or delayed pubertal development, primary amenorrhea, secondary amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, and premature menopause. Many female patients do not spontaneously reach puberty, which has to be induced to reach a normal pubertal development and prevent sequelae (Gubbels et al; Spencer et al.). The proposed pathogenic mechanisms include ovarian damage due to elevated Gal-1-P and galactitol; UDP-Gal deficiency causing aberrant glycosylation of glycoconjugates involved in ovarian function; increased apoptosis of maturing follicles, with accelerated follicle atresia; and possible abnormalities of the immune system, such as unrecognized auto-ovarian antibodies (Forges et al; Lai et al; Liu et al; Rubio-Gozalbo et al.). Two neonates have been reported to have morphologically normal ovaries and abundant oocytes (Levy; Levy et al.), whereas young adult females' ovaries have been reported to have a severely decreased number of normal primordial follicles (Rubio-Gozalbo et al.). Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) — an indirect marker of ovarian reserve — has been found elevated in patients very early in life up to the onset of puberty (4 months to 12 years) (Berry; Fridovich-Keil et al; Rubio-Gozalbo et al; Sanders et al.). Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) — a direct marker for ovarian reserve that is produced by granulosa cells in the developing ovarian follicle — has been found low in female patients (Sanders et al; Spencer et al.). However, low AMH levels in galactosemia patients might be not only due to follicle depletion, but might also reflect an impaired follicle maturation (Rubio-Gozalbo et al.). Indeed, extremely low AMH levels do not preclude spontaneous pregnancy (Gubbels et al.). In fact, spontaneous pregnancies occur (Briones et al; De Jongh et al; Gubbels et al; Kimonis; Ohlsson et al; Roe et al; Samuels et al; Tedesco et al.). And, whereas in the past women were told to be infertile, presently women are informed that spontaneous pregnancies may occur. The term subfertility is more accurate than infertility. Nevertheless, subfertility remains a major concern for patients and parents, and physicians are often asked about fertility preservation options (Spencer et al; van Erven et al.).

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^a40e37ed]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Evaluation of the patient — initial approach in most patients with amenorrhea — History, physical examination, serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) estimation, and estradiol (E2) will identify the most common causes of amenorrhea. The presence of breast development means there has been previous estrogen action, and excessive testosterone secretion is suggested most often by hirsutism and rarely by increased muscle mass or other signs of virilization. The history and physical examination should include a thorough assessment of the external and internal genitalia as well as a breast examination. When the physical examination is normal (in most of the cases), the initial investigations should exclude pregnancy, estimate thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and prolactin concentrations, and check FSH levels.

### Evaluation and management of galactorrhea… [^0a11045f]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Galactorrhea is nonlactational milk production, which is usually defined as milk production one year after pregnancy and cessation of breastfeeding. It can also occur in nulliparous and postmenopausal women, and even in men. 1 The incidence is variable, but it can occur in up to 90 percent of women with hyperprolactinemia. 2 The marked variability is likely a result of the difference in how the milk is expressed and how galactorrhea is defined. The pituitary lactotroph and PRL secretion are also directly stimulated by estrogen, 6 which explains why pregnant women have elevated PRL levels. 7 Following delivery, PRL increases with each suckling episode, stimulating milk production. Over the next several weeks, as breastfeeding gradually shifts from being on demand to a schedule, the increases in PRL levels become less. By two to three months, PRL levels no longer increase with each suckling episode, but milk production continues.

Following cessation of breastfeeding, milk production rapidly decreases so that it is usually gone after a month. 4 and indirectly by inhibiting the hypothalamic dopamine neurons. 6 An ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome due to a follicle-stimulating hormone–secreting tumor has been associated with hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea, both of which resolved after tumor removal, indicating that the very high estrogen level contributes to the previously mentioned clinical features. If the patient's PRL level is not elevated, then no further evaluation is needed.
33. If the major concern is decreased reproductive hormones, they can be replaced. Estrogen replacement is considered safe for the patient with a microadenoma or idiopathic hyperprolactinemia.

However, its use should be individualized in patients with macroadenomas because estrogen has the potential to increase tumor growth in patients with macroadenomas, although this is generally limited to the very high levels of estrogen found in pregnancy and not with exogenous estrogen use. TREATMENT OF GALACTORRHEA WHEN PRL LEVELS ARE NORMAL If the galactorrhea is not associated with breast tenderness and swelling, and is not particularly bothersome, the patient can be reassured. He or she should also be advised to not check for persistence of the galactorrhea, because repeated milking of the breast will stimulate PRL production and delay the resolution of the galactorrhea.

A clear understanding of the physiology of the menopausal transition, clinical symptoms, and physical changes is essential for individualized patient management, maximizing benefits and minimizing risks for the present and the future. Menopause, defined by amenorrhea for 12 consecutive months, is determined retrospectively and represents a permanent end to menses. Many physical changes occur during the menopausal transition and beyond. Knowledge of symptoms and findings experienced by women undergoing the menopausal transition allow individualized care- improving quality of life and enhancing wellbeing for years to come.

### Drugs and prolactin [^f282e1d9]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

Medications commonly cause hyperprolactinemia and their use must be differentiated from pathologic causes. The most common medications to cause hyperprolactinemia are the antipsychotic agents, although some of the newer atypical antipsychotics do not do so. Other medications causing hyperprolactinemia include antidepressants, antihypertensive agents, and drugs which increase bowel motility. Often, the medication-induced hyperprolactinemia is symptomatic, causing galactorrhea, menstrual disturbance, and erectile dysfunction. In the individual patient, it is important differentiate hyperprolactinemia due to a medication from a structural lesion in the hypothalamic-pituitary area. This can be done by stopping the medication temporarily to determine if the prolactin (PRL) levels return to normal, switching to another medication in the same class which does not cause hyperprolactinemia (in consultation with the patient's physician and/or psychiatrist), or by performing an MRI or CT scan. If the hyperprolactinemia is symptomatic, management strategies include switching to an alternative medication which does not cause hyperprolactinemia, using estrogen/testosterone replacement, or cautiously adding a dopamine agonist.

### Development of a macroprolactinoma in association with hormone replacement therapy in a perimenopausal woman with presumed idiopathic hyperprolactinemia [^2fc27a19]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a 48-year-old woman with presumed idiopathic hyperprolactinemia, who was found to have a macroprolactinoma after receiving hormone replacement therapy for almost 3 years.

Methods

We present a detailed case report, including a chronologic summary of clinical and laboratory findings as well as the drug history of our patient. The related literature is also reviewed.

Results

Premenopausal women with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia or microprolactinomas (< 1 cm) are treated with dopamine agonists if fertility is desired or galactorrhea is bothersome. Otherwise, estrogens and progestational agents may be prescribed to regularize menses and prevent osteoporosis. Several case reports of prolactinoma formation or enlargement after exposure to exogenous estrogens have been published. In our patient, a perimenopausal woman with presumably idiopathic long-standing hyperprolactinemia, a macroprolactinoma developed within 3 years after initiation of hormone replacement therapy for management of perimenopausal symptoms. The only clue for ordering a pituitary imaging study in this case was a substantial increase in the level of the serum prolactin. Treatment with cabergoline normalized the patient's serum prolactin level and considerably decreased the size of her pituitary adenoma.

Conclusion

It is postulated that exogenous estrogens could have an important role in tumor development or growth in some patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia. Therefore, it is recommended that women with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia or microprolactinomas treated with estrogens be considered for concomitant therapy with dopamine agonists. In all cases, serum prolactin levels should be diligently monitored.

### Ovarian function in girls and women with GALT-deficiency galactosemia [^b6288d30]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Risks of HRT in women with POI

Specific information on risks of HRT in POI remains scarce, as most studies have been performed in postmenopausal women, and these results should not be extrapolated to younger women (Armitage et al.). One aspect that deserves further investigation is whether HRT in young women with ovarian insufficiency should continue until the average age at menopause. Women with POI have a two-fold increased risk of mortality, and while large randomized trials are lacking, HRT may ameliorate endothelial dysfunction in young women (Kalantaridou et al.) and delay the onset of osteoporosis, a prevalent complication of POI (Anasti et al.). In the absence of contraindications, HRT remains the best treatment option known for menopausal symptoms (hot flashes, vaginal dryness, etc.) in women with hypoestrogenism from POI.

### Approach to the patient with prolactinoma [^2e1e3a64]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Management in Menopause

In postmenopausal women, prolactinomas are rarely diagnosed. With the beginning of menopause, the physiological state of hypogonadism is generally associated with the spontaneous decline in the stimulatory effects of estrogens on PRL secretion and lactotroph cell proliferation, resulting in the reduction of circulating PRL levels. Consequently, in postmenopausal women, microprolactinomas can remain undiagnosed for a long time because they lack specific features of hormonal hypersecretion. In absence of signs and symptoms of PRL excess and given the reportedly low risk of enlargement for microprolactinomas, postmenopausal women may not require medical treatment with DA. To a similar extent, patients with microprolactinomas diagnosed at fertile age and passing through menopause may be successfully discontinued from DA. Indeed, spontaneous remission from hyperprolactinemia after DA withdrawal has been reported to occur in two-thirds of postmenopausal women, mainly those with microprolactinomas, whereas the observed recurrence rate was 33% of patients.

However, most women of menopausal age harbor macroadenomas or giant tumors, responsible for a clinical picture mainly characterized by signs and symptoms of mass effects rather than PRL excess. Headache and visual loss have been reported to be the most common features at presentation; pituitary apoplexy from very large tumors has been experienced in approximately 5% of cases. Therefore, in postmenopausal women with macroprolactinomas, treatment with DA should be cautiously maintained to counteract tumor enlargement. In selected patients with macroprolactinomas not abutting the optic chiasm and stable in size while on low DA doses, a trial of DA withdrawal can be contemplated, but with careful monitoring of tumor progression.

The use of DA during menopause might be further supported by the evidence that these compounds could improve cardiometabolic and bone health in these patients, as already documented in men with prolactinomas and in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea. In this light, the choice to discontinue DA should be carefully weighed considering their beneficial effects at peripheral levels, regardless of PRL and tumor control.

### Antipsychotic use and risk of breast cancer in women with severe mental illness: replication of a nationwide nested case-control database study [^f87b06d4]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antipsychotics are critical for symptom remission and recovery in people with severe mental illness, including schizophrenia, other nonaffective psychotic disorders, and bipolar disorder. Given the chronic nature of these disorders, long-term antipsychotic treatment is often necessary, requiring careful consideration of the long-term safety of these medications. While antipsychotic efficacy has been linked to blockade of dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum, blockade of these receptors in other circuits is associated with adverse events such as extrapyramidal symptoms and hyperprolactinemia. Increased prolactin levels induced by antipsychotics are due to blockade of D2 receptors within the tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic pathway, resulting in increased prolactin secretion by lactotroph cells of the anterior pituitary. The risk of hyperprolactinemia varies with specific antipsychotics; it is greater with first-generation antipsychotics and paliperidone/risperidone, less or absent with quetiapine and clozapine, and partial dopamine agonists, such as aripiprazole, may actually reduce prolactin. Importantly, although antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia usually occurs rapidly after treatment initiation, with potential sexual side effects (eg, decreased libido, amenorrhea, galactorrhea) prompting antipsychotic switching, persistent asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia is also common, and concerns about its long-term effects have been raised.

Long-term use of prolactin-increasing antipsychotics has been associated with infertility, decreased bone mineral density, and fragility fractures in people with severe mental illness, and may also contribute to an increased likelihood of breast cancer in women. Notably, an increased incidence of breast cancer has been reported in schizophrenia compared with the general population (standardized incidence ratio = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.14–1.50). Women with schizophrenia are also half less likely to undergo mammography screening as women without schizophrenia (odds ratio [OR] = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.38–0.64), and the resulting mortality is almost doubled (relative risk = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.38–2.83). In addition to known risk factors for breast cancer, such as positive family history, reproductive factors (eg, low parity), use of estrogens (eg, hormone replacement therapy), and lifestyle habits (eg, smoking), elevated prolactin levels have also been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Although earlier evidence was inconclusive, results from recent observational studies suggest an association between prolactin-increasing antipsychotics and breast cancer in women with severe mental illness.

### Hyperprolactinemia as a manifestation of multiple sclerosis attack [^c8bdf3d1]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Prolactin is a hormone responsible for lactation and other actions needed to maintain homeostasis. The anterior pituitary synthesises and secretes prolactin, which is regulated by dopamine-mediated hypothalamic control. However, the central nervous system, immune system, uterus and mammary glands are also capable of producing prolactin. Inappropriately elevated levels can lead to galactorrhea in non-breastfeeding females or males, which can be caused by different diseases and requires different treatments.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder involving the central nervous system. Some of the symptoms of MS include loss of balance, numbness, double vision, muscle spasms, depression and, rarely, galactorrhea. The prevalence of hyperprolactinemia in patients with MS is 6.7%. Serum prolactin levels are elevated in relapsing-remitting patients with MS during the course of the illness, with half of them showing a rise in the acute stage of relapse and a decrease during the recovery and remission phases. The reason behind high prolactin levels in these patients is unclear; however, observations suggest it may be part of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysregulation due to neurodegeneration or demyelination. It is not recommended to treat galactorrhea in patients with MS with dopaminergic drugs; by treating the acute relapse of MS, hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea are typically resolved.

In this case report, we present a 31-year-old woman with left-sided paresthesia, urinary retention and bilateral galactorrhea due to a new relapse of MS. Hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea were resolved with intravenous methylprednisolone.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^046be0d1]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea — definitions and thresholds for evaluation — Amenorrhea is the absence or abnormal cessation of menses, with primary amenorrhea evaluated when there is failure to menstruate by the age of 15 in the presence of normal secondary sexual development (2 standard deviations above the mean of 13 years), or within 5 years after breast development if that occurs before the age of 10; failure to initiate breast development by the age of 13 (2 standard deviations above the mean of 10 years) also requires investigation. In women with regular menstrual cycles, a delay of menses for as little as 1 week may require the exclusion of pregnancy. Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses for > 3 months in those with previously regular cycles or 6 months in those with irregular menses, and requires investigation.

### Prolactin elevation with antipsychotic medications: mechanisms of action and clinical consequences [^9e4b2a2c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic agents differ in efficacy and side effects such as movement disorders and prolactin elevation because of varying mechanisms of action. A revised nomenclature for antipsychotic agents, which categorizes the drugs according to efficacy, risk of movement disorders, and risk of prolactin elevation, is described. Prolactin elevation, a potential side effect of some antipsychotic medications, is underdiagnosed but can have serious short-term and long-term consequences. Short-term problems include menstrual irregularities, sexual dysfunction, and depression. Long-term problems related to prolactin elevation include decreased bone density and osteoporosis, relapse of psychosis because of poor compliance due to sexual dysfunction or depression, and perhaps cancer, although more research in this area is needed. Despite the serious nature of these effects, prolactin elevation is seldom detected because clinicians often fail to inquire about sexual function or other symptoms that signal that a patient's prolactin may be elevated. These are problems that patients may not bring up with clinicians unless they are asked. Therefore, when patients are taking antipsychotic medications, clinicians should regularly inquire about sexual dysfunction, depression, menstrual disturbances, galactorrhea, and gynecomastia.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^df30af45]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea evaluation — conclusions and diagnostic approach emphasize that estrogen plus progestin may be a better strategy to differentiate hypoestrogenemia-related amenorrhea from endometrial scarring, noting that both false positive and negative progestin withdrawal tests (PWT) can occur and that other approaches may yield a more rapid and accurate diagnosis. Most cases of primary and secondary amenorrhea are similar, and most causes are accounted for by six conditions: polycystic ovary syndrome, thyroid disorders, hyperprolactinemia, hypogonadotropic and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and anatomic abnormalities. Initial assessment highlights that history, physical examination, and estimation of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol will identify the most common causes; most patients presenting with amenorrhea should undergo measurements of serum prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and pregnancy should be excluded. For primary amenorrhea, physical examination and measurement of gonadotropins are key, and the diagnostic yield of physical examination alone may be less for secondary compared with primary amenorrhea.

Clinical Presentation at Diagnosis

Clinical features of prolactinomas are summarized in Fig. 1. The pituitary adenoma per se may exert several compressive mass effects, resulting in headache, visual field defects, and hypopituitarism. Prolactin excess results in both sexes in weight gain, delayed pubertal development, hypogonadism, infertility, galactorrhea, and osteopenia or osteoporosis. Increased PRL levels underpin infertility in 7% to 20% of women and 2% to 4% of men. Other signs and symptoms are gender-related and include, in men, libido reduction, erectile dysfunction, and gynecomastia and, in women, oligo-amenorrhea, vaginal dryness, irritability, and depression. Particularly in women, the classical amenorrhea–galactorrhea syndrome generally encourages rapid medical consultation, as in clinical case 2, whereas weak symptoms of impotence and decreased libido in men might be frequently underestimated, as in clinical case 1, leading to a diagnostic delay, as in clinical case 3. However, different pathogenesis in men and women has also been hypothesized because rapidly growing prolactinomas with increased markers of cellular proliferation have been reported to occur more frequently in men. These findings have raised the question of whether prolactinomas are more aggressive in men than in women, but the available evidence is still controversial. In men, prolactinomas are usually large and invasive, with signs and symptoms of hypogonadism and mass effects being the most frequent clinical features. Additionally, according to the last World Health Organization classification, lactotroph tumors in men have a high probability of recurrence because of increased mitotic count and Ki-67 leading to elevated proliferative activity, or plurihormonal PIT-1–positive immunostaining. The latter identifies tumors composed of a monomorphous population of poorly differentiated cells displaying various levels of immunoreactivity for several pituitary tropines, including PRL and GH, β-TSH, and α-subunit, and likely belonging to the acidophilic lineage of adenomas. These PIT-1 immunoreactive adenomas belonging to the acidophilic lineage display an intrinsic aggressive behavior and a high degree of invasiveness, low rates of disease-free survival, and a high propensity for recurrence.

Adjunctive aripiprazole for antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia — The evidence review identified two RCTs that evaluated the effects of medication on hyperprolactinemia because of antipsychotic medication. In premenopausal women taking antipsychotic medication (n = 46), patients were randomized to receive 5–15 mg of aripiprazole in addition to their antipsychotic medication for 16 weeks and were compared to placebo; the RCT found no difference in outcomes related to the resumption of normal menstruation and the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised but found a benefit for the normalization of galactorrhea and sexual dysfunction, and a statistically significant difference in prolactin level normalization among groups. In male patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (n = 200), 10 mg/day of adjunctive aripiprazole was compared with a high dose of vitamin B6 (600 mg/day); both treatment groups reported a statistically significant reduction in serum prolactin through week 16, but symptoms associated with hyperprolactinemia were not measured or reported. A meta-analysis reported a statistically significant reduction in prolactin levels when aripiprazole was added to a antipsychotic medication (n = 639), but the confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low with inconsistent resolution of prolactin-related symptoms and no differences in side effects and treatment discontinuation; Zhou et al. (2021) reported increased incidence of akathisia, dizziness, hand tremor, and orthostatic hypotension with adjunctive aripiprazole, whereas Kelly et al. (2018) reported no significant differences in side effects, and concern about antipsychotic polypharmacy exists due to the risk of compounding metabolic side effects, EPS, sedation, or orthostatic hypotension.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^cdc233ed]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Secondary amenorrhea — laboratory testing and hormone interpretation: Pregnancy as a mechanism for secondary amenorrhea must be the first consideration, and false negative urinary pregnancy tests are plausible; checking blood levels of human chorionic gonadotropin may be preferred in appropriate clinical settings. In normo-ovulatory women, serum E2 levels fluctuate from early follicular phase values often in the range of 30–50 pg/mL to peak preovulatory levels in the range of 150–300 pg/mL, whereas in FHA circulating E2 is more in the menopausal range (< 30 pg/mL) with gonadotropins in the normal to low normal range; LH is often disproportionately lower than FSH in FHA, while disproportionately elevated LH relative to FSH is not uncommonly encountered in PCOS. For ovarian reserve markers, disproportionately elevated AMH is commonly encountered in PCOS, whereas undetectable AMH is consistent with decreased ovarian reserve and is observed in POI; such markers may be useful but are frequently not necessary and should be interpreted with caution. Hyperprolactinemia is a recognized mechanism, and checking prolactin levels must be included in the initial workup of not just of secondary amenorrhea.

### Medical causes and consequences of hyperprolactinaemia. A context for psychiatrists [^163ebedc]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperprolactinaemia is the commonest endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and can lead to both short-term sexual dysfunction and galactorrhoea, and long-term loss of bone mineral density. Prolactin is secreted from the anterior pituitary gland under the influence of dopamine, which exerts a tonic inhibitory effect on prolactin secretion. Physiological regulators of prolactin secretion include many different types of 'stress' and sleep. Disruption of the normal control of prolactin secretion results in hyperprolactinaemia from pathological and pharmacological causes. The administration of antipsychotic medication is responsible for the high prevalence of hyperprolactinaemia in people with severe mental illness. Physiological hyperprolactinaemia, such as pregnancy and lactation, should be distinguished from pathological causes to prevent unnecessary investigation and treatment. The causes, consequences and management of hyperprolactinaemia are discussed in this article.

### Approach to the patient with prolactinoma [^d5f58516]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH

The diagnostic workup for hyperprolactinemia is shown in Fig. 2. As reported in Table 1, a number of physiologic (pregnancy, breastfeeding, stress, exercise, food intake, and sleep) and pathologic conditions (chronic kidney and liver failure, primary hypothyroidism, compression of the pituitary stalk by a non–PRL-secreting pituitary tumor or different parasellar mass, and granulomatous infiltration of the hypothalamus), as well as several drugs (mainly antidepressants, dopamine receptor blockers, dopamine synthesis inhibitors, oral contraceptives, gastrointestinal medications, neuroleptics, and antipsychotics) can induce symptomatic hyperprolactinemia. Before a correct diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia is made, such conditions must be investigated and excluded. Attention should be paid to medical history, concomitant medications, and biochemical assessment. This is particularly true in the case of modest PRL elevations, which only occasionally may mask the presence of a prolactinoma, as in clinical case 2. To ascertain the diagnosis of a PRL-secreting pituitary tumor, a single measurement of serum PRL without excessive venipuncture stress is strongly recommended. Breast examination in patients with galactorrhea should not be performed immediately before PRL assessment because any nipple stimulation might result in PRL increase. A level above the upper limit of normal (25 μg/L in women, 20 μg/L in men) raises diagnostic suspicion. Conversely, dynamic testing of PRL secretion based on the administration of TRH, L-dopa, nomifensine, and domperidone does not find clinical application currently. In uncertain conditions, sampling can be repeated after overnight fasting on a different day in 2 to 3 samples in time course at 15- to 20-minute intervals to minimize the effect of PRL pulsatile secretion. PRL levels > 250 μg/L generally confirm the diagnosis of prolactinoma, albeit PRL increase over 200 μg/L can be also seen in case of non–PRL-secreting tumor mass, such as nonfunctioning pituitary tumors. In presence of a serum PRL level > 500 μg/L, the diagnosis of macroprolactinoma can be ruled in. Once other causes of hyperprolactinemia (see previous section) have been excluded, a radiological confirmation with pituitary imaging, mainly based on gadolinium-enhanced MRI is required. Over the past 20 years, pituitary MRI has progressively replaced computed tomography with IV contrast enhancement because the latter is less effective than MRI in visualizing small tumors on the one hand and in shaping the extension of large or giant tumors on the other. Nowadays, a pituitary computed tomography scan is recommended only when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, such as in patients with cardiac pacemakers, implanted cardiac defibrillators; internal pacing wires; clips for cerebral, carotid, or aortic aneurysm; cochlear implants; any implant held in by magnet; Swan-Ganz catheter; and pregnancy. In the latter circumstance, the use of pituitary MRI is not recommended except in the case of clinical confirmation of tumor growth suggested by sudden impairment in the visual field, and MRI should be performed without gadolinium after the second trimester of pregnancy. In those patients with macroadenomas impinging the optic chiasm, a visual field examination is recommended, whereas visual testing is not mandatory for patients with microadenomas.

### The evolution of hyperprolactinaemia as an entity in psychiatric patients [^6a580cea]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

This paper explores chronologically the evolution of raised prolactin levels as an entity in psychiatric patients. Menstrual problems were described in patients with schizophrenia prior to the introduction of antipsychotic medication, but galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia were not commonly seen until the advent of antipsychotics. Following the introduction of antipsychotic medication single case reports of patients with galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia appeared. These were followed by a collection of case reports and the process reached today's data of laboratory defined rates of prolactin and sexual side effects. The paper also reviews the emerging research linking hyperprolactinaemia with increased risk of osteoporosis and possibly breast cancer. An overarching thread which runs throughout these publications, is the paucity of clinical research, which has only recently begun to be addressed.

### Defining the menopausal transition [^27493727]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Menopause signifies the permanent cessation of ovarian function and the end of a woman's reproductive potential. A universal experience in women's aging, it is the culmination of some 50 years of reproductive aging — a process that unfolds as a continuum from birth through ovarian senescence to the menopausal transition and the postmenopause. The menopausal transition is known to play a major role in the etiology of many symptoms common in middle age and may contribute to chronic conditions and disorders of aging such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying ovarian senescence and the occurrence of various short- and long-term biological and psychological sequelae are poorly understood. Progress in researching reproductive aging and the menopause has been impeded by the lack of a staging system based on meaningful, reliable, and objective criteria for staging reproductive aging and specifying menopause-related status. Current nomenclature is described and its limitations are discussed. Specifically, contemporary terminology lacks the sensitivity and specificity needed to operationally define a woman's reproductive status in the continuum of reproductive aging. A number of proposed staging systems are currently being evaluated for their suitability in identifying appropriate demarcations across the span of reproductive aging. Further research and a better understanding of the menopausal transition are necessary to establish the validity, practicality, and acceptability of these proposed staging systems.

Endocrine side-effects

By diminishing the inhibitory effect of dopamine on prolactin secretion in the pituitary gland, antipsychotics often cause hyperprolactinaemia (González-Rodríguez, Labad, & Seeman,), which can result in galactorrhoea, cessation of normal cyclic ovarian function and hirsutism (Malik et al; Peuskens, Pani, Detraux, & De Hert). Premenopausal women have physiologically higher levels of prolactin compared to men and are therefore closer to the threshold for hyperprolactinaemia (Kaar, Natesan, McCutcheon, & Howes; Riecher-Rössler). Consequently, they are more than twice as likely to develop antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinaemia compared to postmenopausal women and men (González-Rodríguez et al; Kinon, Gilmore, Liu, & Halbreich). Moreover, prolactin secretion suppresses the production of sex hormones and induces oestrogen deficiency, which is already more frequent in female SSD patients compared to healthy females before menopausal age (Brand et al; Gogos et al; Lindamer et al; Riecher-Rössler). Oestrogen deficiency can lead to polycystic ovarian syndrome, infertility, osteoporosis, sexual dysfunction and an increased risk of breast cancer (De Hert, Detraux, & Peuskens; Haring et al; Pottegård, Lash, Cronin-Fenton, Ahern, & Damkier; Yum, Kim, & Hwang). For example, up to 48% of women receiving antipsychotic treatment report irregularities in their menstrual cycle (O'Keane,) and reduced bone mineral density is present in 32% of women treated with prolactin-raising antipsychotics for > 10 years (Meaney et al.). Prolactin-sparing antipsychotics (e.g. aripiprazole) should, therefore, be preferred over prolactin-raising antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone) for female patients of all ages (Table 1).

### Emotionally induced galactorrhoea in a non-lactating female – "Pseudo-lactation"? [^118817ba]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Our patient is a schoolgirl preparing for the advanced level examination scheduled in 6 months. Therefore exam stress could have played a major component in her hyperprolactinaemia. However although her prolactin levels were high 6 months before the exam it normalized 3 months prior to the exam. Hence if hyperprolactinamia was due to exam stress prolactin value should be higher closer to exam instead of becoming normal. Furthermore she was evaluated by the psychiatric team and any co-morbid psychiatric disorder or psychological stress was excluded.

Our patient did not have any menstrual irregularity. In hyperprolactinaemia, amenorrhoea occurs due to inhibition of pulsatile GnRH secretion by increased prolactin levels. For this to happen hyperprolactinaemia should be persistent. But even in persistent hyperprolactinaemia, amenorrhea occurs only in less than 50%.

Major drawbacks of our study were not being able to measure multiple prolactin levels with and without stimulatory cues and not performing MRI scan of pituitary during the period of galactorrhoea. This was not possible because patient presented to us 2 weeks after newborn shifted to another location. Unavailability of macroprolactin levels was another drawback. But according to Endocrine Society clinical practice guidelines majority of patients with macroprolactinaemia are asymptomatic and only 20% present with galactorrhoea. Furthermore in our patient prolactin level became normal after 3 months. If the initial elevated level of prolactin was due to macroprolactin prolactin level should have remained high.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case report of this interesting phenomenon of emotionally induced pseudo-lactation in humans. Transient elevation of serum prolactin during the symptomatic period and its rapid normalization with resolution of symptoms favours the diagnosis of a transient hyperprolactinaemia as the cause for her galactorrhoea. Strong temporal relationship of her symptoms with the presence of newborn in the neighborhood, and, exclusion of other causes on clinical, biochemical and radiological evidence, raise the possibility that transient hyperprolactinaemia was secondary to a transient lactotroph hyperplasia and hyper function which had been triggered by the stimulatory cues from and emotional attachment towards the newborn.

### "Extracts from "Clinical evidence": menopausal symptoms [^5920da97]. BMJ (2000). Excellent credibility.

Definition

Menopause begins one year after the last menstrual period. Symptoms often begin in the perimenopausal years. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE: In the United Kingdom the mean age for the menopause is 50 years 9 months. The median onset of the perimenopause is between 45.5 and 47.5 years. One Scottish survey (of 6096 women aged 45 to 54 years) found that 84% had experienced at least one of the classic menopausal symptoms, with 45% finding one or more symptoms a problem. AETIOLOGY/RISK FACTORS: Urogenital symptoms of menopause are caused by decreased oestrogen concentrations, but the cause of vasomotor symptoms and psychological effects is complex and remains unclear.

Prognosis

Menopause is a physiological event. Its timing may be genetically determined. Although endocrine changes are permanent, menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, which are experienced by about 70% of women, usually resolve with time. However, some symptoms, such as genital atrophy, may remain the same or worsen.

Aims

To reduce or prevent menopausal symptoms, and to improve quality of life with minimum adverse effects.

Outcomes

Frequency and severity of vasomotor, urogenital, and psychological symptoms; quality of life.

Methods

Clinical Evidence search and appraisal December 1999. We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews that met Clinical Evidence quality criteria.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^d5837afd]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Pituitary imaging and treatment in hyperprolactinemia — in women with hyperprolactinemia, the prevalence of a pituitary tumor is 50%–60%, the likelihood of a pituitary tumor is unrelated to the level of prolactin and only 16% of the variability in tumor size is associated with prolactin level (r = 0.40, P < .001), therefore an MRI should be performed whenever prolactin levels are persistently elevated; in most amenorrheic women with hyperprolactinemia, prolactin levels do not decline without treatment and amenorrhea does not resolve as long as the prolactin levels remain elevated, and in the absence of another organic condition, dopamine agonists are the preferred treatment of hyperprolactinemia with or without a pituitary tumor.

### Galactorrhea associated with juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus: a review of the role of prolactin [^cad67e1b]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

What caused this patient's galactorrhea?

Potential causes for galactorrhea in this patient were excluded such as pregnancy, prolactinoma (the MRI demonstrated a prominent pituitary gland, without any focal abnormalities), renal failure (normal renal function tests and urinalysis), hypothalamic-pituitary disease (normal gonadotropin levels), and primary hypothyroidism (normal T4, TSH). There were no abnormalities noted on the ophthalmologic examination of the visual fields.

Although the patient had taken risperidone regularly for 8–9 months, it had been discontinued one month prior to the onset of galactorrhea. Risperidone, a dopamine antagonist is known to induce HPRL, however, the mean half-life of risperidone and its active metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, is 20 hours with a range from 21 to 30 hours. Due to its short half-life and the fact that the medication had been discontinued approximately one month prior to developing galactorrhea, make it unlikely that risperidone was the cause. Furthermore, there is limited evidence from a study of healthy volunteers that demonstrated reduction of the total active moiety of risperidone, when administered in combination with topiramate, as in this case.

The patient's serum prolactin level (7.5 ug/ml) was within normal limits and was measured on a single sample at the time that the patient's galactorrhea was resolving. Due to the transient nature and spontaneous resolution of galactorrhea in this patient, further prolactin levels were not obtained at that time. Even so, such documentation may be difficult since prolactin is released in pulses and levels vary with circadian rhythms and the menstrual cycle so it is recommended that repeated samples be obtained in resting patients. Furthermore, heterophilic antibodies from human serum can react with the immunoglobulins included in the assay thereby interfering with the in vitro immunoassay. Thus, a single normal result does not rule out transient HPRL as the cause of this patient's galactorrhea.

In conclusion, there is a well-established relationship between PRL and the immune system and specifically, in patients with SLE. However, galactorrhea has not previously been reported in these patients. In this case, it was likely due to multifactorial influences in this patient. Her previous history of cortical dysplasia gives rise to the possibility that there are subtle structural and possibly functional abnormalities affecting the pituitary gland. Previous treatment with a dopamine antagonist may have sensitized an otherwise clinically quiescent state, within the context of a potentially hyperprolactinemic state, given the diagnosis of SLE.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^87eb178e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Duration of menopausal hormone therapy — We suggest that the decision to continue MHT be revisited at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration of MHT consistent with the treatment goals and evolving risk assessment of the individual woman. Technical remarks note that current proposed limits on duration are informed by large intervention trials (5 to 7 y) with extended follow-up for 13 years, that risk rates for breast cancer and CVD increase with age and time since menopause with risks appearing less with ET than with EPT, and that ovarian cancer risk may also increase relative to duration of MHT. The guideline concludes that clinicians and patients should reassess MHT continuation yearly and discuss the risks and individual benefits beyond 5 years.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — postmenopause diagnosis and evaluation states that a diagnosis of PCOS could be considered as enduring / lifelong, and healthcare professionals could consider that both clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism persist in the postmenopause for women with PCOS; PCOS diagnosis could be considered postmenopause if there is a past diagnosis, or a long-term history of oligo-amenorrhoea with hyperandrogenism and/or PCOM, during the earlier reproductive years (age 20–40), and further investigations should be considered to rule out androgen-secreting tumours and ovarian hyperthecosis in postmenopausal women presenting with new-onset, severe or worsening hyperandrogenism including hirsutism.

There is limited literature reporting galactorrhea with antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In this case report, I present a case of a young female who developed galactorrhea with sertraline, which improved on discontinuation of sertraline. Computer-assisted searches on galactorrhea with SSRIs yielded 23 cases, mostly with escitalopram and paroxetine and rarely with fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and sertraline, and it may be much more frequent than recognized.

### Evaluation and treatment of galactorrhea… [^32f0cbfb]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

PHYSIOLOGIC CONDITIONS Galactorrhea may be considered physiologic. Pregnant women may lactate as early as the second trimester and may continue to produce milk for up to two years after cessation of breast-feeding. Fluctuating hormone levels, particularly during puberty or menopause, may also cause lactation. Nipple stimulation, commonly associated with repeated breast self-examinations or sexual activity, causes an increase in prolactin secretion. NEOPLASTIC PROCESSES Although galactorrhea is not associated with breast cancer, it can be caused by neo-plastic processes in the brain and pituitary gland. Fortunately, most of these tumors are benign. Approximately 20 percent of women with galactorrhea have radiologically evident pituitary tumors, and the prevalence increases to 34 percent in women who also have amenorrhea. Estrogen and progesterone, found in oral contraceptive formulations and the medroxy-progesterone contraceptive injection, may cause lactation.

Possible mechanisms include direct actions on the breast tissue or effects on gonadotropins. Galactorrhea occurs more often after discontinuation of oral contraceptive pills than during prolonged use. The dosages of estrogen and progesterone used in postmenopausal hormonal replacement therapy are generally not high enough to cause galactorrhea. However, some patients with hyperprolactinemia may not have symptoms if they are estrogen deficient. Once hormone replacement therapy is started, the breast tissue is primed, and galactorrhea may then occur. HISTORY The history should include the duration of galactorrhea, previous pregnancies, and other symptoms of hyperprolactinemia, such as infertility, decreased libido, acne, hirsutism and menstrual irregularity.

The patient's menstrual history is important because hyperprolactinemia, through its effect on gonadotropin-releasing hormone, may cause low estrogen levels. As a result, the patient may have amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, as well as decreased bone density. Treatment The goals of galactorrhea treatment include decreasing or eliminating the patient's symptoms, curing any identified underlying cause, preventing bone loss, relieving the patient's anxiety and fears, and, when desired, maintaining the patient's fertility and ability to lactate.
