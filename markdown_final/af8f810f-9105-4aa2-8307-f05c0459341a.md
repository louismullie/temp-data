## Question

What are some knowledge pearls not many people know about STEMI

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a collection of lesser-known STEMI knowledge pearls. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational STEMI paradigm and its historical evolution. Then, I should verify the limitations of the STEMI/non-STEMI dichotomy and the emergence of the occlusion MI (OMI) framework. Next, I will examine subtle ECG patterns and STEMI equivalents that are frequently missed. After that, I need to check time metrics beyond door-to-balloon and the role of prehospital systems. I will then review special populations and contexts, including SMuRF-less patients, in-hospital STEMI, and older adults. Finally, I should confirm contemporary guideline shifts, quality metrics, and practical pearls for cath lab and post-PCI care, ensuring each point is supported by appropriate references and corrected if I overstate anything.

> Let me first confirm the historical paradigm so I don't jump to conclusions: the modern STEMI concept arose from the observation that transmural infarction reflects acute coronary occlusion and that ST elevation on ECG could serve as a surrogate for occlusion, enabling rapid reperfusion decisions; this evolved from earlier Q-wave/non-Q-wave frameworks and crystallized in late 20th-century guidelines, but it was always a pragmatic surrogate rather than a pathophysiologic law, which sets the stage for current anomalies and the OMI shift [^116AdPp7] [^115cbUYT].

> Wait, let me verify the limitations of the STEMI paradigm before I overcommit to it: up to a quarter of patients labeled "non-STEMI" actually have acute coronary occlusion on delayed angiography with higher mortality, while a substantial fraction of "STEMI" activations turn out to be false positives without occlusion; this false-negative/false-positive asymmetry is a key driver of the OMI movement and explains why some patients with occlusion are denied timely reperfusion under strict STEMI criteria [^112iexX8] [^1112zhKJ].

> I will now examine the OMI paradigm itself, but hold on, I should verify its evidentiary basis: the OMI framework re-centers diagnosis on the presence of occlusion rather than millimeter thresholds for ST elevation, and early data suggest that expert ECG interpretation using OMI principles can double sensitivity for occlusion while maintaining specificity; importantly, reclassification of non-STEMI as OMI identifies patients with larger infarcts and worse long-term outcomes, supporting the clinical relevance of this shift [^1112zhKJ] [^115cbUYT].

> Next, I should review subtle ECG patterns that are easy to miss; let me think about hyperacute T waves and de Winter complexes: hyperacute T waves in contiguous leads can precede overt ST elevation and should trigger urgent reperfusion evaluation, while de Winter T waves (upsloping ST depression with peaked T waves in precordial leads) indicate proximal LAD occlusion and warrant immediate cath lab activation even without classic ST elevation; I should double-check that contemporary emergency care pathways explicitly call attention to these subtle signs and recommend serial ECGs when suspicion is high [^1172Yvzy] [^1112igCX].

> But wait, what if the ECG is "ischemic" yet doesn't meet STEMI millimeter criteria; I need to ensure I cover STEMI equivalents: Wellens' pattern, new or paced LBBB with concordant ST elevation or excessively discordant ST elevation (Smith-modified Sgarbossa), posterior MI with anterior ST depression and dominant R waves in V1–V2, and diffuse ST depression with ST elevation in aVR suggesting left main or severe multivessel disease; these patterns carry high risk of occlusion and should be treated as reperfusion candidates despite lacking classic STEMI criteria [^1172Yvzy] [^112rgH2v] [^1111TsdW].

> Hold on, I should verify the time metrics that truly matter: total ischemic time from symptom onset to reperfusion — not door-to-balloon alone — drives infarct size and mortality; efforts focused solely on D2B can obscure prehospital delays, and off-hours presentation is associated with roughly 30-minute D2B prolongation and a 10–15% relative mortality increase, reinforcing the need to minimize system delays across the entire continuum [^111d3RSs].

> Let me consider prehospital and systems-of-care pearls; I need to check that guidelines endorse prehospital ECGs, bypass of non-PCI centers, and direct-to-cath-lab protocols: prehospital ECG acquisition and interpretation reduce time to treatment, regional STEMI networks with 24/7 PCI capability and standardized transfer protocols improve outcomes, and quality programs should track first-medical-contact-to-device times, door-in–door-out for transfers, and rates of false activation to drive continuous improvement [^1112igCX] [^114a8DRL] [^117BpM4Z].

> I should confirm special populations and contexts that change risk calculus: SMuRF-less patients (no standard modifiable risk factors) are increasing in proportion and have higher in-hospital mortality despite similar treatment intensity, suggesting distinct biology or ischemic tolerance; in-hospital STEMI is underrecognized with longer delays and worse outcomes; and in older adults, transradial access and half-dose fibrinolysis when appropriate can mitigate bleeding while preserving efficacy, which I need to remember when tailoring reperfusion strategy [^114xXeQ9] [^1178qMjk].

> Next, I should review contemporary guideline evolution; let me verify the shift toward a unified ACS spectrum: the 2023 ESC ACS guideline treats STEMI and NSTEMI within a single document emphasizing a serial approach (think ACS, think invasive, think antithrombotic, think revascularization, think secondary prevention), and it explicitly extends primary PCI indications beyond 12 hours when ischemia, heart failure, or arrhythmias persist; the 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP guideline similarly prioritizes transfer for primary PCI when FMC-to-device is ≤ 120 minutes and mandates early angiography after fibrinolysis, reflecting a pharmacoinvasive mindset even in the PCI era [^115NDMBo] [^1149jzRR] [^113kfn1N].

> I need to ensure I cover practical cath lab pearls; let me reconsider thrombus management and access: routine thrombus aspiration is not supported by large trials, but selective aspiration for large thrombus burden remains reasonable; transradial access reduces bleeding and vascular complications without compromising reperfusion metrics; and intracoronary imaging can clarify mechanisms and guide stent sizing in complex lesions, which is especially helpful in STEMI mimics or ambiguous anatomy [^111SoKad] [^114zoasn].

> Hold on, I should verify post-reperfusion care and monitoring: ESC 2023 recommends at least 24 hours in a CCU/ICCU after successful reperfusion when feasible, with an additional 24–48 hours on a step-down unit for uncomplicated cases; this balances early mobilization with surveillance for arrhythmias, mechanical complications, and recurrent ischemia, which I should not overlook in the push for shorter length of stay [^1156oFZm].

> Let me synthesize the overarching principle so I don't miss the forest for the trees: the STEMI paradigm successfully operationalized reperfusion but created a false dichotomy; the emerging OMI framework corrects this by anchoring decisions to occlusion physiology rather than ECG thresholds, and clinicians who integrate subtle ECG cues, minimize total ischemic time, and apply guideline-directed systems of care will catch more occlusions earlier and improve outcomes, which is the essence of these knowledge pearls [^115cbUYT] [^112iexX8].

STEMI care has many hidden pitfalls: **posterior MI is often missed** [^1172Yvzy] because it presents as anterior ST depression and requires V7–V9 for diagnosis [^112MtadT]; **de Winter T waves** signal proximal LAD occlusion and need urgent PCI despite absent STE [^1172Yvzy]; and **reperfusion arrhythmias** (e.g. accelerated idioventricular rhythm) are usually benign and should not delay reperfusion [^notfound]. Early **hyperacute T waves** can precede STE and warrant immediate action [^1112igCX], while **right ventricular infarction** with hypotension needs fluids and avoidance of nitrates [^notfound]. Total ischemic time, not door-to-balloon, drives outcomes [^111d3RSs], and **fibrinolysis remains lifesaving** when PCI is delayed [^111jnvn2]. Post-PCI **no-reflow** may respond to adenosine or nitroprusside [^114zoasn], and **early discharge** after uncomplicated PCI is safe with close follow-up [^116gFQv3]. These pearls highlight subtle ECGs, hemodynamic nuances, and system issues that can be easily overlooked but materially affect outcomes [^1172Yvzy].

---

## Electrocardiographic subtleties and pitfalls

- **Posterior MI**: Presents as anterior ST depression in V1–V3; confirm with posterior leads V7–V9 and treat as STEMI [^112rgH2v] [^112MtadT].

- **De Winter T waves**: Upsloping ST depression with peaked T waves in precordial leads indicates proximal LAD occlusion — activate the cath lab despite absent STE [^1172Yvzy].

- **Hyperacute T waves**: Early, broad-based, peaked T waves can precede STE and signal imminent infarction — act immediately [^1112igCX].

- **Right ventricular infarction**: Inferior MI with hypotension suggests RV involvement; give fluids and avoid nitrates and morphine [^notfound].

- **Sgarbossa criteria**: In LBBB or paced rhythms, concordant STE ≥ 1 mm, discordant STE ≥ 5 mm, or concordant STD ≥ 1 mm suggest occlusion MI — do not delay reperfusion [^1166UAYr].

---

## Hemodynamic and mechanical complications

- **Cardiogenic shock**: Early revascularization (PCI or CABG) is critical; consider mechanical circulatory support if refractory [^115W6oB8].

- **Free wall rupture**: Sudden hypotension with pericardial tamponade; immediate pericardiocentesis and surgical repair are lifesaving.

- **Papillary muscle rupture**: New severe MR with pulmonary edema; urgent surgical consultation is essential.

- **Ventricular septal rupture**: New harsh holosystolic murmur with hemodynamic compromise; surgical repair is definitive.

---

## Pharmacologic management nuances

- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Prasugrel or ticagrelor are preferred over clopidogrel unless contraindicated; tailor to bleeding risk [^notfound].

- **Anticoagulation**: Heparin is standard; consider bivalirudin in high bleeding risk or HIT.

- **Fibrinolysis**: Still lifesaving when PCI is delayed; use tenecteplase or alteplase with appropriate adjuncts [^111jnvn2].

- **Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors**: Reserve for high thrombus burden or bailout scenarios [^notfound].

---

## Procedural considerations and complications

- **Radial access**: Preferred for lower bleeding and vascular complications; especially beneficial in elderly and high bleeding risk [^1178qMjk].

- **Thrombus aspiration**: Not routine; consider selective use for large thrombus burden [^111SoKad].

- **No-reflow phenomenon**: Treat with intracoronary adenosine, nitroprusside, or verapamil; prevent with distal protection devices in selected cases [^notfound].

- **Contrast-induced nephropathy**: Hydration and minimizing contrast volume are key preventive strategies.

---

## System-level and patient-specific factors

- **Total ischemic time**: More predictive of outcomes than door-to-balloon; prioritize early reperfusion [^111d3RSs].

- **Off-hours presentation**: Associated with higher mortality due to delays; systems must address this gap [^115NDufR].

- **Female patients**: Higher mortality partly due to delayed recognition and treatment; maintain high suspicion [^117Fdr36].

- **Elderly patients**: Higher bleeding risk; consider radial access, adjusted antithrombotic dosing, and careful risk-benefit assessment [^1178qMjk].

---

## Post-STEMI care and secondary prevention

- **Early discharge**: Safe in selected uncomplicated patients after PCI with close follow-up [^116gFQv3].

- **Cardiac rehabilitation**: Strongly recommended to improve outcomes and reduce recurrence.

- **Long-term management**: High-intensity statin, ACE inhibitor or ARB, beta-blocker, and lifestyle modification are essential [^115d5MAz].

---

## Emerging trends and controversies

- **Complete revascularization**: Favors complete revascularization in multivessel disease, but timing remains debated [^1131J6ZM].

- **Ischaemic postconditioning**: Mixed results; not routinely recommended pending further evidence [^113i7KC5].

- **Digital health**: Mobile ECG and telemedicine may expedite diagnosis and transfer, especially in remote settings [^1112igCX].

---

These pearls underscore the importance of **keen ECG interpretation**, vigilant hemodynamic management, and **coordinated systems care** to optimize STEMI outcomes.

### Insights into the pathophysiology of ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^1119PPYw]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Although an approximate 13 million individuals in the United States are known to have coronary artery disease (CAD), only a small percentage of them develop unstable CAD each year. About 500,000 to 1 million people present annually with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), some of whom had never been diagnosed with CAD. The known etiology of coronary occlusion is the disruption of the atherosclerotic plaque within the vascular wall, and vascular inflammation is thought to lead to this disruption. Since many patients with CAD never suffer an myocardial infarction, the question then becomes why does inflammation-induced plaque disruption occur in only some patients? The explanation may lie in differing genetic and phenotypic characteristics. A greater understanding of the pathophysiology and the identification of new genetic and inflammatory markers are slowly leading to new therapeutic interventions that promise to greatly reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with CAD within the foreseeable future.

We recommend that for future guidelines, professional societies on both sides of the Atlantic acknowledge the current confusion about the terminologies on treatment delays in STEMI and uncertainties in utilising available data for information regarding the proper treatment for various patient subsets, and avoid recommendations that may have deleterious consequences. It is uncertain whether a pharmacoinvasive strategy in the future will qualify as an alternative reperfusion strategy. However, the Strategic Reperfusion Early After Myocardial Infarction trial found no mortality benefit but an increased risk of stroke in patients randomised to a pharmacoinvasive strategy compared to patients randomised to a PPCI strategy.

### From ST-segment elevation MI to occlusion MI: the new paradigm shift in acute myocardial infarction [^115hFmzq]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

STEMI crisis

"By proliferating versions of the paradigm, crisis loosens the rules of normal puzzle-solving in ways that ultimately permits a new paradigm to emerge… The proliferation of competing articulations, the willingness to try anything, the expression of explicit discontent, the recourse to philosophy and to debate over fundamentals, all these are symptoms of a transition from normal to extraordinary research".

The increasing anomalies in the STEMI paradigm have given rise to proliferating versions of the paradigm, with terms like "subtle STEMI", "semi-STEMI", and "STEMI-equivalents". Now this crisis is reflected in official guidelines: the 2018 Fourth Universal Definition of MI summarized multiple advances in ECG interpretation, including lesser degrees of STE, reciprocal STD, hyperacute T waves, acute Q waves, de Winter T waves, and anterior STD. But the conclusion of this document dares not deviate from the paradigm: "it is essential to integrate the ECG findings with the aim of classifying type 1 MI into STEMI or non-STEMI in order to establish the appropriate treatment according to current guidelines". Similarly, for the first time, the 2023 European Society of Cardiology acute coronary syndromes guidelines discuss STEMI and non-STEMI within the same document because of the shared pathophysiology. But these new guidelines still dichotomize acute coronary syndromes by STEMI vs non-STEMI, not only as the initial "working diagnosis" but also as the "final diagnosis". This will ensure that non-STEMI with OMI will continue to be classified, even retrospectively, as "non-STEMI" rather than being identified as missed STEMI(−)OMI.

### Analyzing prominent T waves and ST-segment abnormalities in acute myocardial infarction [^1156hHAM]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperacute T waves and the non-concave appearance of the ST segment are early changes that may be seen on the electrocardiogram (ECG) in an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patient. There are specific morphological changes in these ECG findings that can help distinguish them from other conditions with similar ECG patterns. The differential diagnosis of prominent T waves and ST-segment elevation is well known, however, certain tools to distinguish ECG patterns with various etiologies have been developed and proven useful to the emergency physician.

Objectives

1) To discuss and review the more common differential diagnosis of prominent T waves and how to identify the hyperacute T wave of AMI. 2) To review the distinction and determination of a concave and non-concave ST segment that may be initially overlooked.

Case Report

A 42-year-old woman with minimal cardiac risk factors developed an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) that illustrates the evolution of early and classic ECG changes associated with her infarct.

Conclusions

The classic STEMI is ingrained in the emergency physician's mind, however, sometimes other lesser known and obvious ECG patterns can present early on in the evolution of disease, and these morphological patterns should be identified and treated accordingly.

### Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction in patients hospitalized for noncardiac conditions [^113kKp7L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rapid reperfusion with early percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the standard of care for patients with ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who present to a hospital with interventional cardiology capabilities. Recognition of the importance of rapid reperfusion has led to significant improvement in door‐to‐balloon times in the last 5 years (from a median of 96 minutes in 2005 to 64 minutes in 2010), which correlates with an improvement in overall outcomes of STEMI patients. Research and nationwide initiatives on STEMI care have targeted patients who have onset of STEMI while outside the hospital. Much less is known about clinical presentation, sources of delay in diagnosis and treatment, and outcomes in patients who develop STEMIs while hospitalized for a noncardiac condition. Patients in the hospital for treatment of active medical or surgical conditions are susceptible to developing STEMIs, but we know surprisingly little about optimal care in this setting.

The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association last published evidence-based guidelines for the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in 1999. In mid-2004, in recognition of the evolution and improvement of many of the most basic tenets of clinical management of STEMI since that time, an updated edition of the STEMI guidelines has been published. These guidelines offer many evidence-based recommendations that are pertinent to the out-of-hospital and emergency department care of STEMI patients, including initial evaluation, risk stratification, stabilizing management, and the choice between pharmacologic and mechanical revascularization. These are presented and discussed here.

### Highlights from the 2013 ACCF / AHA guidelines for the management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction and beyond [^116h6b5j]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is considered a cardiology emergency requiring immediate recognition and treatment aimed at successful and early reperfusion to ensure optimal outcomes. The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have issued guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with acute myocardial infarction since 1990. These guidelines are based on clinical research exploring reperfusion modalities and adjunctive therapies. They are further supported by expert opinion where randomized trial evidence is lacking. In January 2013, the ACCF/AHA released the most recent guidelines for the management of patients with STEMI. This review focuses on the newest and most important recommendations taken from the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guidelines for the Management of STEMI and highlight important new studies that have emerged over the past year.

### Door to balloon time: is there a point that is too short? [^112WDLLJ]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The duration of ischemic time is directly related to permanent myocardial damage and mortality in the setting of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Rapidly restoring myocardial blood flow to limit the total ischemic time is a priority. The time duration between a patient entering the medical system and being treated with percutaneous coronary intervention to open the occluded culprit vessel is termed door-to-balloon (DTB) time, which is publicly reported and used to judge hospital quality of care. While longer DTB time is associated with increased mortality in the setting of STEMI, efforts to lower DTB time have not translated into decreased mortality. Here we review the literature on DTB time, explore the factors thought to influence the interpretation of the association between DTB time and mortality, and make suggestions on goals for future efforts related to DTB time.

### Total ischemic time: the correct focus of attention for optimal ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction care [^111d3RSs]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2011). Low credibility.

Currently accepted standards for gauging quality of care in the treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) mainly focus on shortening the time to treatment after the patient arrives at the hospital. But this narrow focus fails to consider the substantial duration of myocardial ischemia that exists prior to hospital arrival, and the large number of deaths that occur during the pre-hospital period. The time from symptom onset until reperfusion occurs is one estimate of total ischemic time. Several experimental studies and now human clinical studies have confirmed that infarct size and mortality are strongly correlated with the total ischemic time, and much less so with its subintervals like door-to-balloon time. This review will discuss the importance of total ischemic time in STEMI.

### Transatlantic comparison of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction guidelines: insights from the United States and Europe [^1141gvdv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains a significant global public health concern. Practice guidelines in both the United States and Europe have been major contributors to providing evidence-based care. Rapid advances in contemporary therapies mandate regular and timely updates to guideline recommendations. In the fall of 2012, the European Society of Cardiology published their latest guidelines for the management of STEMI. In 2013 (∼3 months later), the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association jointly published their most recent STEMI guideline statements. In this review, we compare the transatlantic guidelines, highlighting differences in their recommendations and the interpretation of evidence addressing STEMI care.

### Effect of ischaemic postconditioning on markers of myocardial injury in ST-elevation myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis [^113i7KC5]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Ischaemic postconditioning (IPoC) has demonstrated inconsistent benefits in limiting myocardial injury in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) among ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Cardiac biomarkers are an acceptable marker for extent of injury but their correlation with IPoC has not been systematically evaluated.

### ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients without standard modifiable cardiovascular risk factors-how common are they, and what are their outcomes? [^114xXeQ9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

This is the first report, in a large, multicenter study, of an increase in the proportion of SMuRF‐less STEMI patients. This increase may be explained by a simple competing risks principle, with improved identification and effective management of SMuRFs in primary care effectively increasing the relative proportion of patients with minimal risk factors that have received little recognition to date. Alternatively, it is plausible that environmental factors such as air particulate matter and heavy metal exposure levels or other unknown factors may have changed and may be contributing to atherosclerotic events in individuals without SMuRFs. 26, 27, 28

A major goal of these analyses was to investigate the outcomes of SMuRF‐less STEMI patients compared with their counterparts whose myocardial infarctions were more easily explained by traditional risk factors. We confirmed previous observations that SMuRF‐less myocardial infarction patients were more likely to die in hospital than those with 1 or more SMuRFs. 15, 16, 29 This does not appear to reflect treatment differences (Table 3). These data need to be more widely communicated to front‐line physicians to ensure that timely evidence‐based care is provided to this vulnerable group of patients. Despite the higher in‐hospital mortality in SMuRF‐less individuals, the rates of MACE, including in‐hospital recurrent myocardial infarctions and cardiogenic shock were similar. The higher in‐hospital mortality rate may reflect differing underlying biological processes or a reduced capacity to tolerate myocardial ischemia, and mechanisms of in‐hospital mortality in SMuRF‐less individuals warrant further investigation. 30

### In search of coronary thrombosis as the cause of myocardial infarction: unraveling a 20th-century mystery [^116AdPp7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

For the greater part of the 20th century, the pathophysiology of acute myocardial infarction regarding whether thrombosis was either present or primary was debated until 1973 when pathologists and clinicians met and by consensus, finally decided that the data supported that transmural infarction (what we now refer to as ST elevation myocardial infarction or STEMI) was caused by thrombus in the vessel supplying the infarcted territory. As the data for this consensus came from pathological analysis, it took another 7 years until angiographic and interventional data in humans with acute presentations of transmural infarction convincingly indicated that thrombus was indeed responsible. Subsequently, in patients presenting with either syndromes of unstable angina or nontransmural (later called non-ST elevation) myocardial infarction, it was established through angiographic and other interventional approaches that thrombus formation was also causative in a substantial proportion of these patients. This article reviews the history and this search for causation of myocardial infarction that now has resulted in present therapies that have saved innumerable lives over the last 30 to 40 years.

### From ST-segment elevation MI to occlusion MI: the new paradigm shift in acute myocardial infarction [^115DwBcv]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Kuhn explains that while paradigms often begin as flexible, they become rigid over time. The 1996 Acute MI guidelines advised thrombolytics for hyperacute T waves or ST-segment depression (STD) V 1 -V 4 from posterior MI, noting that "it should be clear that certain cases require experienced interpretation of the ECG before withholding reperfusion therapy". But by 1999 the Acute MI guidelines advised clinicians to "classify patients as those with STE or left bundle branch block (LBBB) (acute reperfusion indicated) and those with nondiagnostic ECGs" even if the latter included "direct posterior infarctions caused by circumflex artery occlusion". Then the STEMI paradigm formally emerged, with separate guidelines for 2 supposedly distinct disease entities: non-STEMI vs STEMI. The former included an image to visualize the STEMI/non-STEMI dichotomy, with STEMI showing an occluded artery and non-STEMI a nonocclusive thrombus.

Despite its appeal, this image unfortunately represented a clear deviation from the actual evidence. The STE millimeter criteria based on age and sex originated from studies comparing healthy individuals to those who had MI measured by creatine kinase-MB and, despite this, were now being recommended for the differentiation of MI with and without ACO, even when there was no real evidence from any angiographic data or even thrombolytic trials.

The normal science of the STEMI paradigm

"Normal science, the puzzle-solving activity we have just examined, is a highly cumulative enterprise, eminently successful in its aim, the steady expansion of scientific knowledge… Normal science does not aim at novelties of fact or theory and, when successful, finds none".

Most science takes place during the long periods between paradigm shifts, in what Kuhn called "normal science". This takes the prevailing paradigm for granted and seeks to extend knowledge and solve puzzles within this framework. The normal science of the STEMI paradigm has been geared toward solving the problem of how, in patients with ACO as identified by STEMI criteria on the ECG, to best reperfuse the arteries and how to reduce reperfusion delays.

### 2007 focused update to the ACC / AHA guidelines for the management of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: implications for emergency department practice [^113h5hfM]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have issued a "focused update" of their 2004 guidelines for the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Several of the issues addressed involve new data and new recommendations on treatment decisions that may be made in the emergency department. In this review, we present the new recommendations that are pertinent to emergency medicine practice and comment on their potential implementation into an evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach to the timely care of the STEMI patient.

### Early versus delayed complete revascularisation in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and multivessel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1131J6ZM]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

The optimal timing of non-culprit lesion revascularisation is still controversial among patients presented with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and residual lesions after culprit revascularisation, so our systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to assess the effect of timing of complete revascularisation on major cardiovascular events.

### Atypical electrocardiographic presentations in need of primary percutaneous coronary intervention [^1172Yvzy]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Early initiation of reperfusion therapy remains the cornerstone of successful management for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Rapid restoration of coronary blood flow relies on prompt recognition of the typical ST-segment elevation on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)-a surrogate for coronary occlusion or critical stenosis-allowing timely activation of the STEMI protocol cascade, with a major positive impact in mortality and clinical outcomes. However, atypical, very high risk ECG patterns-known as "STEMI equivalents"-are present in 10% to 25% of patients with ongoing myocardial ischemia in need of urgent primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Though briefly mentioned in the current recommendations, structured clinical data on those specific ECG presentations are lacking. By thoroughly searching MEDLINE and EMBASE we conducted a structured review of non-STEMI, albeit very high risk, ECG patterns of acute coronary syndrome, often associated with coronary occlusion or critical stenosis. After screening 997 studies, we identified the following distinct "STEMI equivalent" ECG patterns: Wellens' syndrome, de Winter sign, hyperacute T waves, left bundle branch block-including paced rhythm-and right bundle branch block. For each pattern, a brief summary of the existing evidence, together with the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value-whenever available-are presented. In conclusion, prompt recognition of "STEMI equivalent" ECG patterns is crucial for every physician or paramedic dealing with acute coronary syndrome patients in the emergency department or the prehospital setting, as misinterpretation of those high risk presentations can lead to reperfusion delays and worse outcomes.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^111r6PzE]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to ECG, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain continuous ECG monitoring and ensure the availability of defibrillator capacity as soon as possible in all patients with suspected STEMI, in suspected ACS with other ECG changes, or ongoing chest pain, and once the diagnosis of myocardial infarction is made.

---

### Rapid diagnosis of STEMI equivalent in patients with left bundle-branch block: is It feasible? [^115Egdzz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

In patients presenting with symptoms compatible with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) it is crucial to rapidly identify those who have ongoing ischemia and necrosis that could benefit from emergent reperfusion therapy. It is accepted that in patients with narrow QRS complexes, ST elevation on the presenting ECG signifies acute occlusion of an epicardial artery, so‐called ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Emergent reperfusion therapy is a class I recommendation by the current guidelines. However, it is well known that not all patients with acute occlusion of an epicardial artery show ST elevation. Although it seems plausible that these patients can also benefit from emergent reperfusion therapy, direct evidence is lacking. Patients with non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) may not have ongoing persistent active ischemia and a large percentage do not have ECG changes at all or only nonspecific ECG changes. Thus, in patients with narrow QRS, the ECG is insensitive for diagnosing all acute myocardial infarctions (AMI). It is also known that a large percentage of patients with STEMI do not have total occlusion of the epicardial coronary artery and that the angiographic findings in patients with STEMI can be indistinguishable from those in patients with NSTEMI.

### The electrocardiogram in the ACS patient: high-risk electrocardiographic presentations lacking anatomically oriented ST-segment elevation [^113hgQsm]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is defined as pathologic ST-segment elevation occurring in at least 2 anatomically contiguous leads in a patient with a clinical presentation consistent with acute myocardial infarction (AMI); these findings can suggest the need for urgent revascularization. Unfortunately, the electrocardiogram (ECG) may be nondiagnostic in a large portion of patients who initially present with AMI; furthermore, it is now recognized that ECG patterns that do not meet the traditional diagnostic criteria for STEMI may represent significant AMI — these patterns are generally referred to as the STEMI equivalent patterns in that they are caused by occlusion of an epicardial coronary artery, place significant portions of the left ventricle in jeopardy, and can result in a poor outcome if not recognized and treated appropriately.

Of course, there is always the chance this was a spurious finding that should not worry us. Furthermore, the only deaths we know about in this study are those that occurred after a hospital readmission. Perhaps other patients died without readmission, or after admission to a hospital in a different state: prior work has found that 20% to 25% of unplanned readmissions within 30 days of cardiac care are to a different hospital than the index hospital, 6, 7 and NRD data are state based, so we cannot know about any out‐of‐state readmission events. Perhaps readmitted patients died of noncardiac problems: as many as half of readmissions after percutaneous coronary intervention, even when done urgently, occur for noncardiac reasons. 6 I would feel better about these explanations had the authors not previously reported similar findings for an older US population using a different database linked to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services records. 8 In that analysis of ≈34 000 STEMI events, a similar "J curve" for mortality and other adverse events was seen: patients in hospital 1 or 2 days were about twice as likely to die within 30 days as those staying 3 days, with even longer LOS (reflecting greater acuity during the index hospitalization) associated with even higher event rates. Unadjusted observations held up in a propensity‐matched cohort analysis. A provocative observation from that study was the significantly lower use of guideline‐directed medical therapies in the short LOS group. Although medication information was not presented in the study by Jang et al, 4 cumulative event curves indicate most deaths in the short LOS AW‐STEMI patients occurred within the first week. Perhaps relevant, AW‐STEMI patients with a hospital stay of ≤ 3 days and who were subsequently readmitted had the highest observed incidence of leaving the index hospitalization against medical advice (1.3% of 10 210 patients). Were these patients getting their medications promptly and properly after leaving hospital? Were they subjected to stress too soon after primary percutaneous coronary intervention?

### Chameleons: electrocardiogram imitators of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^113rzu3C]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The imperative for timely reperfusion therapy for patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) underscores the need for clinicians to have an understanding of how to distinguish patterns of STEMI from its imitators. These imitating diagnoses may confound an evaluation, potentially delaying necessary therapy. Although numerous diagnoses may mimic STEMI, several morphologic clues may allow the physician to determine if the pattern is concerning for either STEMI or a mimicking diagnosis. Furthermore, obtaining a satisfactory history, comparing previous electrocardiograms, and assessing serial tests may provide valuable clues.

### Thrombus aspiration for ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction in modern era: still an issue of debate? [^111SoKad]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

The role of manual thrombus aspiration (TA) during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) for acute ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction has been a matter of intense research and debate now. Although recent randomized controlled clinical trials (notably TASTE [Thrombus Aspiration in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction in Scandinavia] and TOTAL [Trial of Routine Aspiration Thrombectomy With PCI Versus PCI Alone in Patients With STEMI]) do not supply evidence supporting the routine use of TA in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, manual TA remains a therapeutic option for interventional cardiologists when treating patients with substantial thrombus burden during PPCI. It remains unknown whether patients might actually benefit from TA applied in a more selective manner depending on the thrombus burden during PPCI, instead of routine application. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the instruments used in the TA procedure, positive as well as negative clinical effects of TA during PPCI, and analyze the potential reasons for observed effects, in an effort to help the clinical decision making by physicians for the use of TA in individual ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients during PPCI.

### Prolonged door-to-balloon time: is treatment delayed always treatment denied? [^116UnQPx]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Rapid reperfusion following the onset of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction has been shown to provide life-saving benefit. Both systemic fibrinolytic therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention have been shown to be effective in reducing mortality, and their effectiveness is greater the sooner they are applied. Percutaneous coronary intervention has become the dominant method of reperfusion and may offer benefit over systemic fibrinolysis in some patients. Accordingly, physicians, hospitals, and professional organizations have developed guidelines and algorithms to both speed and standardize care. In addition, the institutional rapidity of therapy-the mean or median door-to-balloon time-is often publically reported providing further impetus to rapid triage and treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. However, some patients do not receive reperfusion within the time guidelines set out by professional organizations. In many instances, this delay relates to medical issues that exist in addition to the patient's myocardial infarction. These data raise the question of whether the most rapid reperfusion is always superior to more delayed but potentially more comprehensive therapy.

Biomarkers and differential diagnosis

Q1. You are on rounds in the emergency department and your intern asks you: what is the main difference between non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina?

NSTEMI is characterized by ischaemic symptoms associated with acute cardiomyocyte injury (= rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin T/I), while ischaemic symptoms at rest (or minimal effort) in the absence of acute cardiomyocyte injury define unstable angina. This translates into an increased risk of death in NSTEMI patients, while unstable angina patients are at relatively low short-term risk of death.

Q2. A 72-year-old patient with hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia as cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) presents to the emergency department with typical chest pain of 3 h duration, palpitations, atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of about 120 beats per minute, ST depression on electrocardiogram (ECG), and a mild elevation in cardiac troponin (cTn) (twice the upper limit of normal [ULN]). Is it correct to state that the underlying process is a rupture, ulceration, fissuring, or erosion of a coronary atherosclerotic plaque?

No. According to the universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI), two main subtypes of NSTEMI have to be differentiated: type 1 MI, characterized by any of the processes just previously described, and type 2 MI, in which an extra-coronary condition is the main cause of imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand (e.g. tachycardia, anaemia, hypertension, or hypotension). The patient described may have had both.

Q3. Which are the three mandatory diagnostic cornerstones of the early diagnosis of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) among the following: past clinical history including a detailed description of the chest pain characteristics, 12-lead ECG, chest X-ray, elevated and dynamic rise in cTn, treadmill test, computed tomography (CT) angiography, and myocardial perfusion scan?

### ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction care in America: celebration and anxiety [^115Qj3Na]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

There is some solace to be found in this distressing observation. Although the 30‐day mortality rate of AW‐STEMI patients was twice that of those staying in hospital 1 more day, the difference was small in absolute terms: a mortality risk of 0.2% compared with 0.1%. With 64 097 patients discharged after 1 to 2 days and 53 235 discharged at 3 days, this is a difference of 75 lives of 117 332, ≈15 excess deaths for each year of study. Not to diminish the concern, but at least the death rate in this cohort was not far out of range. And when bundled with those who stayed for a third day, an overall strategy of early discharge was not linked to unfavorable outcomes and was cost saving. I suppose planning for a 3‐day stay is prudent for AW‐STEMI, but until we have a better understanding about this group, we cannot use that extra time wisely. Knowing other uncomplicated STEMI patients can be safely discharged in < 3 days, and that the extra day for AW‐STEMI patients increases costs only modestly, is reassuring.

Although it is a distracting observation, concerns over this special patient subgroup should not cloud the important broader findings in the article by Jang et al. 4 This complex and well‐executed analysis of a large data set representing approximately half of all hospitalizations in America over a 5‐year period demonstrates that hospitals have been working hard to deliver high‐quality, efficient care for STEMI patients. That work is paying off, literally, by lowering short‐term and 30‐day cumulative care costs while producing excellent outcomes for patients. As is always the case, a bit more information is needed to complete the picture. The early discharge AW‐STEMI group is ripe for further study.

3 The ACS Spectrum

In advancing the science and implementation, the 2023 Guidelines offer a conceptual approach of five items: think A.C.S. at the initial assessment, think invasive management, think antithrombotic therapy, think revascularization, and think secondary prevention. To further explain the thinking A.C.S. at the initial evaluation of patients with suspected ACS, "A" relates to an abnormal ECG (performing an ECG urgently to assess for evidence of ischemia or other abnormalities), "C" considers the clinical context and other available investigations, and "S" for stable, performing an examination to assess whether the patient is clinically and vitally stable.

The guidelines (Figure 1) graphically explore the spectrum of clinical presentations such that the patient may initially have had chest pain, but at presentation either has minimal or no symptoms; to the patient with increasing chest pain or other symptoms; to the patient with persistent chest pain or symptoms; to the patient with cardiogenic shock or acute heart failure; and finally, the patient who presents with a cardiac arrest. The ECG may be normal at presentation, may have ST segment depression as potentially an NSTEMI, or may have ST segment elevation leading to the immediate diagnosis of STEMI. If the high‐sensitivity troponin is not elevated, the resultant diagnosis is unstable angina, but the characteristic rise and fall of high‐sensitivity troponin does not differentiate between NSTEMI and STEMI.

### ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction care in America: celebration and anxiety [^116gFQv3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

More than 20 years ago, a consortium of investigators tested the idea that patients judged to be at low risk for complications following ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) could be discharged from hospitals faster by relying on angiographic findings rather than routine predischarge stress testing, as recommended by guidelines at the time. 1 This change was expected to lower costs of care. Low‐risk patients were arbitrarily defined as nonelderly patients (aged ≤ 70 years) without arrhythmias or 3‐vessel coronary artery disease who had successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention and well‐preserved left ventricular function. They found that these low‐risk patients could be discharged safely after 3 days instead of the average of ≈7 days with usual care. Hospital costs were ≈20% lower with this accelerated care approach. Since then, routine use of invasive therapies and shorter hospital stays have become routine after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). See Article by Jang et al.

As we have become more aggressive about short hospital stays, some have questioned whether we occasionally put patients at risk. If we send patients home too soon, we might see preventable harm events driving readmissions. This has been a particular concern among heart failure providers 2 who are eager to keep hospital stays short but who have felt the pressure of publicly reported readmissions and mortality data, often citing high figures, for more than a decade. Although the conversation around heart failure has been, perhaps, more of a focal point, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began public reporting of data for AMI at the same time. 3 It seems timely, then, to ask a few questions: How are we doing with AMI patients, how long do they stay in hospital, how often do they require readmission, and what is the total cost of caring for them through 30 days? We might also ask: Are there any signals that earlier hospital discharge is unsafe?

STEMI — symptom onset ≥ 12 h pathways: With "Cardiogenic shock or heart failure", the algorithm evaluates "PCI feasible?"; if feasible it leads to "Primary PCI (1)", whereas if not feasible it leads to "CABG (1)". With "Ongoing ischemia, heart failure, or electrical instability", the terminal action is "Primary PCI (2a)". For "Symptom onset within 12–24 h", the terminal action is "PCI (2a)". When there is a "Totally occluded infarct artery > 24 h and no symptoms or severe ischemia", the pathway assigns "PCI (3: No Benefit)".

1 Introduction

Recognizing that acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) constitute a spectrum encompassing unstable angina, non‐ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the 2023 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the management of ACSs addressed all three. This differs from the prior US guidelines that individually addressed unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI. The 2023 ESCACS Guidelines thus encompass comprehensive patient management from admission to long‐term care, again including what in prior US guidelines would have been a secondary prevention guideline. In addition, the task force included a patient member who provided a patient perspective that is highlighted in the European publication.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^1112igCX]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Electrocardiographic detection of myocardial infarction — an electrocardiogram (ECG) "should be acquired and interpreted promptly (ie, target within 10 minutes) after first medical contact", and "prehospital ECGs reduce the time to diagnosis and treatment, and can facilitate the triage of STEMI patients… if within the recommended time interval (120 minutes from STEMI diagnosis)". For ongoing symptoms or a nondiagnostic tracing, "recording several standard ECGs… at 15–30 minute intervals for the initial 1–2 hours, or the use of continuous computer-assisted 12-lead ECG recording… is reasonable". Certain patterns carry prognostic/diagnostic implications: "ST-segment depression ≥ 1 mm in 6 leads… is suggestive evidence of multivessel disease or left main disease", while a comparison tracing helps but "should not delay the decision for treatment". Early ischemic changes include "increased hyperacute T wave amplitude… in at least 2 contiguous leads", and infarction evolution is reflected as "the development of new Q waves" indicating necrosis that "starts minutes/hours after the myocardial insult", with "transient Q waves" sometimes seen during acute ischemia or "(rarely) during acute MI with successful reperfusion".

### From ST-segment elevation MI to occlusion MI: the new paradigm shift in acute myocardial infarction [^112iexX8]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

STEMI anomalies

"Normal science often suppresses fundamental novelties because they are necessarily subversive of its basic commitments… The source of resistance is the assurance that the older paradigm will ultimately solve all its problems, that nature can be shoved into the box the paradigm provides".

Paradigms make normal science possible, but this inevitably leads to the discovery of anomalies that do not fit within the paradigm. When this happens, the normal response is to either reject these anomalies or try to absorb them into the prevailing paradigm. Even before the STEMI paradigm had fully emerged there were 3 early anomalies: anterior STD from posterior OMI, subtle inferior OMI with reciprocal STD in aVL, and Sgarbossa criteria for OMI in the presence of LBBB.

A 1994 report on emergency department diagnosis of STEMI described the challenge of ECG interpretation for borderline STE, and differentiating STEMI from early repolarization, pericarditis, LBBB, and old MI with persisting STE. In other words, by dichotomizing ECGs by presence vs absence of STE, STEMI criteria cannot differentiate between different types of STE, or identify STE secondary to an abnormal QRS with superimposed primary ischemic elevation.

As a result of the vast research catalyzed by the STEMI paradigm, years of angiographic data have demonstrated the chasm between the STEMI/non-STEMI dichotomy and the underlying pathology of OMI (Figure 3).

Figure 3
The STEMI/Non-STEMI False Dichotomy

STEMI criteria are supposed to differentiate patients with ACO from those without. But up to 25% of code STEMI have No ACO: these are appropriately termed false positives, receive a different discharge diagnosis, and are identified as a quality improvement issue. But at least 25% of "Non-STEMI" Have ACO on delayed angiography, with higher mortality. These should be recognized as false negative STEMI and identified as a quality improvement issue, but instead they are still diagnosed as "Non-STEMI". This is what we call the "no false negative paradox": In the STEMI paradigm, there cannot be a false negative diagnosis. ACO = acute coronary occlusion; ECG = electrocardiogram; other abbreviation as in Figure 1.

### What causes acute coronary syndromes? Applying koch's postulates [^116Ywub7]. Atherosclerosis (2005). Low credibility.

The term "acute coronary syndromes" (ACS) is used to describe a heterogeneous spectrum of clinical conditions. This includes myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and unstable angina. These conditions are linked by a similar constellation of signs and symptoms but not necessarily by a common pathophysiology. They are syndromes. Several different hypotheses exist that have attempted to explain the pathological mechanisms that are involved in these conditions, however, it is not clear whether ACS are caused by variations of a single disease process or by several disease processes. The contribution of both vessel wall- and blood-related factors in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes is herein discussed with the guidance of Koch's postulates.

### Inflammation in acute myocardial infarction: the good, the bad and the ugly [^113mELem]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Model of deleterious post-AMI inflammation

These considerations inform a proposed model of deleterious post-AMI inflammation as well as an approach to optimally target inflammation post-AMI (Figure 1). The degree of baseline inflammation (Figure 1, area hatched in blue, 'Baseline inflammation') depends in part on the control of traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidaemia and diabetes, as well as other comorbidities, particularly chronic inflammatory diseases.

Figure 1
Putative model for the natural history of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction vs. non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and the potential effects of percutaneous coronary intervention and anti-inflammatory drugs. Baseline inflammation comprises a chronic level of activity of a patient's immuno-inflammatory system, determined by traditional cardiovascular risk factors as well as other comorbidities. On top of this chronic inflammation, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction results in an acute excessive surge of inflammation, both of higher grade and earlier onset compared with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Early percutaneous coronary intervention is the gold standard in the treatment of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and its beneficial effects on outcome are undisputed. However, percutaneous coronary intervention elicits an additional spike in inflammation caused by local release of inflammatory mediators from balloon and stent expansion, distal microemboli as well as reperfusion injury. Though by far outweighed by the positive aspects of early percutaneous coronary intervention, these effects of reperfusion injury on post-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction inflammation should not be neglected. Early anti-inflammatory therapy is anticipated to attenuate this early excessive inflammation after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Extending treatment throughout the follow-up period suppresses the residual inflammatory risk (RIR), for which a causal role on patient outcome has been proven.

4 Delays in Care

The guidelines explore the potential delays for patients presenting with STEMI. These include patient self‐presentation delay or emergency medical system (EMS) delay and systems of care delay within the receiving medical center, all adding to the total ischemic time. Analysis of these components may improve the delivery of care for patients with STEMI and will involve patient education for prompt presentation, the EMS system efficiency, the emergency room contact in the hospital, and transfer to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, ideally in under 90 min. The guidelines further detail the recommendations for patients presenting to a non‐PCI center, scheduling transfer to an appropriate more intensive level facility.

### Reperfusion strategies in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a comprehensive review of contemporary management options [^111jnvn2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

There are an estimated 500,000 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) events in the U.S. annually. Despite improvements in care, up to one-third of patients presenting with STEMI within 12 h of symptom onset still receive no reperfusion therapy acutely. Clinical studies indicate that speed of reperfusion after infarct onset may be more important than whether pharmacologic or mechanical intervention is used. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), when performed rapidly at high-volume centers, generally has superior efficacy to fibrinolysis, although fibrinolysis may be more suitable for many patients as an initial reperfusion strategy. Because up to 70% of STEMI patients present to hospitals without on-site PCI facilities, and prolonged door-to-balloon times due to inevitable transport delays commonly limit the benefit of PCI, the continued role and importance of the prompt, early use of fibrinolytic therapy may be underappreciated. Logistical complexities such as triage or transportation delays must be considered when a reperfusion strategy is selected, because prompt fibrinolysis may achieve greater benefit, especially if the fibrinolytic-to-PCI time delay associated with transfer exceeds approximately 1 h. Selection of a fibrinolytic requires consideration of several factors, including ease of dosing and combination with adjunctive therapies. Careful attention to these variables is critical to ensuring safe and rapid reperfusion, particularly in the prehospital setting. The emerging modality of pharmacoinvasive therapy, although controversial, seeks to combine the benefits of mechanical and pharmacologic reperfusion. Results from ongoing clinical trials will provide guidance regarding the utility of this strategy.

### 2012 ESC STEMI guidelines and reperfusion therapy: evidence base ignored, threatening optimal patient management [^111xnSn4]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

Throughout the years, successive guidelines have mistakenly equated 'PCI-related delay' and 'FMC to PPCI' (the total delay from FMC to PPCI) (figure 1). This error persists in the recently updated ESC guideline. Clarification of this distinction is of paramount importance because of the suggested reduction in the 'window of opportunity for PPCI', a suggestion not clearly supported by evidence, which has significant public health implications. In paragraph 3.5.2, the ESC STEMI guideline references a registry analysis from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (NRMI), concluding: 'primary PCI (wire passage) should be performed within 90 min after FMC in all cases. In patients presenting early, with a large amount of myocardium at risk, the delay should be shorter (< 60 min)'. The NRMI reference is also listed in paragraph 3.4.1 in the ESC STEMI guideline when recommending the acceptable 'FMC-to-PCI' delay of only 60 min in early incomers with anterior infarction. However, this study describes 'PCI-related delay', that is, the theoretical extra delay that may be spent to perform PPCI over FT (figure 1). The NRMI manuscript by Pinto et al. does not describe 'FMC-to-PCI' delay in the cohorts evaluated since timing of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) evaluation was imprecise. The only delay data available were the interval 'Door-to-balloon (D2B)' delay, which was 116 min when calculated as a weighted mean (table 1). Given the fact that 'FMC-to-PCI' is considerably longer than D2B delay among patients transported by EMS (figure 1), the 'FMC-to-PCI' delay is likely to have been considerably longer than 120 min (table 1). Consequently, these data cannot be applied recommendations regarding the optimal time to 'FMC to PCI' or to support a recommendation 'of a systems goal of FMC to PCI of 60 min'. It would appear that the 2012 STEMI guideline authors, when compiling the overwhelming amount of scientific data, have either intended to use a different reference or misinterpreted the findings from Pinto et al 's original work. We are not aware of supportive data that would justify the current STEMI guideline recommendations to consider fibrinolysis within 30 min of FMC when PPCI cannot be performed within 60 min of FMC.

### How can we optimize the processes of care for acute coronary syndromes to improve outcomes? [^116wXkKs]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS), either ST-elevation myocardial infarction or non-ST-elevation ACS, are still one of the most common cardiac emergencies with substantial morbidity and mortality. The availability of evidence-based treatments, such as early and intense platelet inhibition and anticoagulation, and timely reperfusion and revascularization, has substantially improved outcomes in patients with ACS. The implementation of streamlined processes of care for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-elevation ACS over the last decade including both appropriate tools, especially cardiac troponin, for rapid diagnosis and risk stratification and for decision support, and the widespread availability of modern antithrombotic and interventional treatments, have reduced morbidity and mortality to unprecedented low levels. These changes in the process of care require a synchronized approach, and research using a team-based strategy and effective regional networks has allowed healthcare systems to provide modern treatments for most patients with ACS. There are still areas needing improvement, such as the delivery of care to people in rural areas or with delayed time to treatment.

### Impact of long-term statin pretreatment on myocardial damage in ST elevation myocardial infarction (from the AIDA STEMI CMR substudy) [^111agsSi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Nonrandomized studies suggested lower mortality rates with statin pretreatment in patients with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, clinical data are still inconclusive and the mechanisms of these presumed beneficial effects require further exploration. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging offers the possibility of studying a variety of markers of myocardial damage and reperfusion injury after myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to assess a possible link of statin pretreatment with myocardial damage in acute STEMI. The multicenter Abciximab i.v. versus i.c. in ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction CMR substudy enrolled 795 consecutive patients with acute STEMI who underwent primary angioplasty within 12 hours of symptom onset. CMR studies assessing left ventricular ejection fraction, infarct size, microvascular obstruction, area at risk, and myocardial salvage index were performed in a median of 3 days after the clinical event. We performed a retrospective analysis to evaluate the impact of statin pretreatment on myocardial damage. Information on statin pretreatment was available in 791 of 795 patients (99%). Of these, 122 (15%) had long-term statin pretreatment. CMR results showed no significant differences in the area at risk, left ventricular ejection fraction, infarct size, microvascular obstruction, and myocardial salvage index between patients with and without statin pretreatment. Furthermore, no differences in short- and long-term outcomes could be observed. In conclusion, in this CMR study, statin pretreatment in patients with STEMI was not associated with lesser myocardial damage.

### Introducing a chest pain pathway in the emergency department to improve quality of care for patients with possible cardiac chest pain [^112txYPE]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

The European Society of Cardiology define ACS as a clinical spectrum of disease, ranging from unstable angina (no myocardial damage but increased risk of myocardial infarction and subsequent complications), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI – some damage to myocardium), and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) which reflects a completely occluded coronary artery.

Diagnosis is made on the presence of an ischaemic ECG, suggestive clinical history, or the presence of circulating biomarkers of myocardial necrosis (Troponin). Two out of these three factors must be present to reach a diagnosis of myocardial infarction. However, forty to sixty per cent of people who are subsequently diagnosed with ACS present to the ED with an initial non-diagnostic ECG. Some of these patients will not have raised troponin initially, and those with unstable angina will not have elevated troponin at any point, unless they go on to develop an MI. This means that the only way these people can initially be recognised is through the history of the presenting complaint. The full extent of coronary artery disease is often not clear until the patient undergoes invasive investigations such as coronary angiography.

Difficulties in recognition of ACS and the subsequent inconsistencies in management of these patients are well known and challenge clinicians worldwide. DeBusk et al report that half of all patients presenting with chest pain are hospitalised to detect the ten per cent who have an ACS, but that this high admission rate still fails to identify the small percentage of patients with ACS that are discharged inappropriately.

Some tools are available for use in the ED, but many of these suppose knowledge of the various presentations of ACS, are based on populations with confirmed ACS, or are aimed at recognition of MI but not unstable angina. The Goldman score, TIMI score, GRACE score, and HEART scores were all trialled and found to be unhelpful. This is mainly because Goldman is outdated and does not have any criteria relating to unstable angina, which we did not want to miss. TIMI and GRACE were validated on cohorts of patients with confirmed ACS and rely on clinical parameters which do not relate to the presenting complaint, such as createnine and systolic blood pressure. We found that patients who were over 80 years with renal impairment and high systolic blood pressure were likely to be admitted whatever the nature of the chest pain.

### A new electrocardiographic criteria for emergent reperfusion therapy [^1111TsdW]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The benefit of emergency reperfusion therapy with fibrinolytics or primary percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with ST-segment elevation (STE) acute myocardial infarction (MI) is well known. However, what is not well known are which subgroups of MI patients with ST-segment depression (STD) on the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) may benefit from emergent reperfusion therapy. Current clinical guidelines recommend against administering emergent reperfusion therapy to MI patients with STD on the ECG unless a true posterior MI is suspected. Overlooked subgroups of patients with STD on the initial ECG who may potentially benefit from emergent reperfusion therapy are patients with multilead STD with coexistent STE in lead aVR. This finding has been reported in MI patients with occlusion of the left main artery, occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery, and MI in the presence of severe multivessel coronary artery disease. Because these patients have a higher mortality in the setting of MI, we believe that this ECG finding be considered a STEMI equivalent and that patients with this finding receive consideration for emergent reperfusion therapy preferably at a center with both primary percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting capability. In this report, we present 3 such patients to heighten the awareness of the emergency physician to this phenomenon.

### Macrophage behaviour 72 hours after implantation of biodegradable polymer-based sirolimus-eluting stent in a case of ST elevation myocardial infarction [^115AcK69]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Background

The healing process after coronary artery stent implantation is dependent on the resolution of the inflammatory reaction that drives atherogenesis. Macrophages are known to play an important role in the development of atherosclerotic lesionswith two macrophage phenotypes having been associated with different areas of the lesions: M1 (proinflammatory) macrophages that have been detected in the rupture-prone area of the intima, and M2 (anti-inflammatory) macrophages that have been localised in the adventitia underlying advanced plaques.

However, little is known about which type of macrophage is mobilised just after stent implantation on vulnerable plaques in a culprit coronary artery after ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Behaviour of human macrophages just after stent implantation in the infarct-related artery in STEMI patients is rarely investigated because the only definitive examination could occur postmortem. As such, we describe a postmortem case with the presence of cluster of differentiation (CD) 163-positive macrophages in close proximity to the stent struts 72 hours after drug-eluting stent implantation in the culprit coronary lesion for STEMI.

### Different perspectives on outcomes in patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction when observed in clinical trials and in real life [^111AQzF8]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

This editorial refers to 'Modes and timing of death in 66 252 patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes enrolled in 14 TIMI trials' †, by D.D. Berg et al. on page.

Non-ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is currently the most common manifestation of coronary artery disease. In the 1980s, the pathophysiology of the condition was elucidated by showing the underlying ruptured atherosclerotic plaque with superimposed thrombotic material leading to impeded coronary blood flow by severe stenosis, temporary occlusions and downstream embolization of thrombotic material leading to myocardial injury. Initially the diagnosis mainly relied on ECG changes but, since the 1990s, elevation of troponin has been the key diagnostic finding. Since the beginning of the 1990s, a series of randomized clinical trials have established that treatment with aspirin, P 2 Y 12 inhibitors, statins, and early revascularization under the protection of anticoagulation improves survival and reduces the risk of re-infarction. After this success story, it is appropriate to ask which might be the remaining problems that need to be addressed in order to improve outcomes further.

### Thoughts about the abnormalities in the electrocardiogram of patients with acute myocardial infarction with emphasis on a more accurate method of interpreting ST-segment displacement: part I [^114cCvNT]. Clinical Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

The QRS, S-T, and T wave abnormalities produced by the usual myocardial infarction are discussed in Part I of this manuscript. The recent guidelines supplied by the ACC/AHA Practice Guidelines divide primary S-T segment displacement into S-T segment elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non S-T segment elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Accordingly, the electrophysiologic mechanisms responsible for epicardial and subendocardial injury that produce the S-T segment abnormalities are discussed in this manuscript. In this regard, the author suggests that the Grant method of interpreting the 12 lead electrocardiogram, which uses basic principles and vector concepts, is a more accurate method of identifying epicardial injury and subendocardial injury than memorizing the rules provided by the guidelines. An electrocardiogram is shown to illustrate this point. In Addition, the author expresses his personal view that labeling an electrocardiogram as NSTEMI but not stating what is actually present in the tracing is a cumbersome method of communication. The author believes it is better communication to state what is present rather than to state what is not present. At best, the result of both assessments should be stated in the interpretation. Part II of the manuscript is devoted to a discussion as to why treatment with thrombolytic or percutaneous coronary intervention is more effective in patients whose electrocardiograms reveal epicardial injury than it is in patients whose electrocardiograms reveal subendocardial injury or no injury.

### From ST-segment elevation MI to occlusion MI: the new paradigm shift in acute myocardial infarction [^115cbUYT]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

A generation ago thrombolytic therapy led to a paradigm shift in myocardial infarction (MI), from Q-wave/non-Q-wave to ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) vs non-STEMI. Using STE on the electrocardiogram (ECG) as a surrogate marker for acute coronary occlusion (ACO) allowed for rapid diagnosis and treatment. But the vast research catalyzed by the STEMI paradigm has revealed increasing anomalies: 25% of "non-STEMI" have ACO with delayed reperfusion and higher mortality. Studying these limitations has given rise to the occlusion MI (OMI) paradigm, based on the presence or absence of ACO in the patient rather than STE on ECG. The OMI paradigm shift harnesses advanced ECG interpretation aided by artificial intelligence, complementary bedside echocardiography and advanced imaging, and clinical signs of refractory ischemia, and offers the next opportunity to transform emergency cardiology and improve patient care. This State-of-the-Art Review examines the paradigm shifts from Q wave to STEMI to OMI.

### Spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma mimicking ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^114zf6j8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Several medical conditions that mimic ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have been reported previously, but acute abdominal disease mimicking STEMI is rare.

Case Report

We report on a 72-year-old man who presented to the emergency department (ED) with epigastric pain. Meanwhile, STEMI with shock developed. Anticoagulation medication and emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were arranged in a timely manner. However, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rupture was the true cause of the ST-segment elevation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case report highlights the fact that acute myocardial infarction is not the only cause of ST-segment elevation. HCC rupture should be one of the differential diagnoses.

### Targeting an ischemic time [^117Fdr36]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The selection criteria applied by Greulich et al 7 enabled the research question to be efficiently addressed within a comparatively homogeneous subgroup of patients. Confounding factors, such as variations in antegrade flow in the culprit artery, collateral blood supply, and multivessel disease, are mitigated out. Their findings have important clinical implications that are relevant to practice guidelines for STEMI. Current guidelines recommend primary PCI in patients with a symptom‐to‐balloon time of up to 12 hours, provided intervention can be delivered within 120 minutes of "STEMI diagnosis". 1 The message emphasizes the therapeutic priority for implementation of prehospital care networks that can efficiently diagnose STEMI in the community and rapidly transfer the patient to regional primary PCI centers, and when the first medical contact to PCI is > 120 minutes, then lytic therapy can be administered prehospital followed by direct transfer to the PCI center, circumventing the emergency department. 12 Public education is key to inform patients and the public on how to recognize the symptoms of acute STEMI, thereby reducing the time from symptom onset to the call for help. This message is especially relevant to women, who may not recognize the symptoms as being ischemic in origin, who may be less well placed to call for help, and when they do call for help, may be less likely to be positively diagnosed by first responders and emergency care (male) clinicians. Public health interventions represent key areas for future research and advocacy. Reflecting the importance of the efficiency of medical care, door‐to‐balloon time has been identified as being more closely associated with 1‐year mortality than symptom onset‐to‐door time. 9 In patients with a delayed hospital presentation beyond 12 hours, factors relating to the patient's decision to seek help are a main component of delay. 13 This strengthens the argument for using patient education to improve STEMI outcomes.

Additional ECG findings consistent with acute coronary artery occlusion — diagnostic cues — note that the application of STEMI ECG criteria on a standard 12-lead ECG alone will miss a significant minority of patients who have acute coronary occlusion; therefore, the ECG should be closely examined for subtle changes such as hyperacute T waves or ST-segment elevation < 1 mm, particularly when combined with reciprocal ST-segment depression, as concomitant reciprocal ST-segment depression may be visually more evident than ST-segment elevation; if present, these patients should be evaluated for emergent coronary angiography.

Coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after fibrinolytic therapy in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are guided by strong statements that use "is recommended" language: "In patients with STEMI, transfer to a PCI-capable center immediately after fibrinolytic therapy is recommended". For suspected failed reperfusion, "immediate angiography with rescue PCI is recommended to reduce the risk of death or recurrent MI", and after fibrinolytic therapy, "early angiography between 2 and 24 hours with the intent to perform PCI is recommended to reduce the rates of death or MI". Signs of failed reperfusion include "A lack of improvement in ischemic symptoms, persistent ST-segment elevation (< 50% resolution of ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads or < 70% in inferior leads), or hemodynamic or electrical instability", and management for others states "routine coronary angiography within 2 to 24 hours after fibrinolytic therapy with coronary revascularization as needed is recommended".

### The left bundle-branch block puzzle in the 2013 ST-elevation myocardial infarction guideline: from falsely declaring emergency to denying reperfusion in a high-risk population. are the sgarbossa criteria ready for prime time? [^1166UAYr]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Prompt and accurate identification of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the presence of left bundle-branch block (LBBB) remains difficult. The 2004 STEMI guideline recommended emergent reperfusion therapy to patients with suspected ischemia and new or presumably new LBBB. These recommendations have led to frequent false catheterization laboratory activation and inappropriate fibrinolytic therapy because most patients with suspected ischemia and new or presumably new LBBB do not have acute coronary artery occlusion on angiography. The new 2013 STEMI guideline makes a drastic change by removing previous recommendations. Therefore, patients with suspected ischemia and new or presumably new LBBB would no longer be treated as STEMI equivalent. The new guideline fails to recognize that some patients with suspected ischemia and LBBB do have STEMI, and denying reperfusion therapy could be fatal. The Sgarbossa electrocardiography criteria are the most validated tool to aid in the diagnosis of STEMI in the presence of LBBB. A Sgarbossa score of ≥ 3 has a superb specificity (98%) and positive predictive value for acute myocardial infarction and angiography-confirmed acute coronary occlusion. Thus, we propose a diagnosis and triage algorithm incorporating the Sgarbossa criteria to quickly and accurately identify, among patients presenting with chest pain and new or presumably new LBBB, those with acute coronary artery occlusion. This is a high-risk population in which reperfusion therapy would be denied by the 2013 STEMI guideline. Our algorithm will also significantly reduce false catheterization laboratory activation and inappropriate fibrinolytic therapy, the inevitable consequence of the 2004 STEMI guideline.

### Off-hour presentation and outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115NDufR]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis shows that patients with acute myocardial infarction who presented during off-hours had higher mortality than did those who presented during regular hours. Higher mortality during off-hours was seen for both in-hospital and 30 day mortality. The difference in mortality may be larger for patients with a diagnosis of STEMI and for a non-North American location of the study and may have worsened in recent years.

Comparison with other studies

This review showed that patients with STEMI were less likely to receive percutaneous coronary intervention within 90 minutes and had longer door to balloon times during off-hours. An approximate 30 minute delay in door to balloon time is associated with a 20–30% relative increase in in-hospital morality for STEMI patients, regardless of the baseline door to balloon time up to 180 minutes. Therefore, the 15 minute increase in door to balloon time observed during off-hours could increase mortality by as much as 10–15%, assuming linearity between door to balloon time and mortality. This is consistent with our point estimate of 12% increase in odds of mortality for STEMI, which suggests that the mortality increase in off-hours may well be partially explained by prolonged door to balloon times. Magid et al reported that the difference in mortality became non-significant when adjusted for reperfusion treatment time. Additionally, a lower rate of urgent percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI patients may also partially explain higher mortality during off-hours.

### Acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation: implementation of new guidelines [^116JW4hu]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Unstable angina and non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction have in recent years been recognised as frequent and important clinical manifestations of coronary-artery disease. The European (ESC) and American (ACC/AHA) professional societies last year released guidelines on diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of these disorders. These guidelines summarise similarly the current evidence and translate them to clinical practice. Most important changes relate to the inclusion of troponins into the risk stratification algorithm, the addition of low-molecular-weight heparin and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists to medical treatment, and the role of invasive management for improved long-term outcome. Guidelines are constantly challenged by newly emerging study results. Recently, early invasive management and clopidogrel have been found to exert further benefit to this high-risk group of patients. Accordingly, the societies on both sides of the Atlantic will work together closely to update and implement these guidelines.

### From ST-segment elevation MI to occlusion MI: the new paradigm shift in acute myocardial infarction [^1112zhKJ]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

OMI paradigm shift

"The decision to reject one paradigm is always simultaneously the decision to accept another, and the judgment leading to that decision involves the comparison of both paradigms with nature and with each other".

The study of STEMI anomalies has given rise to the new OMI paradigm (Figure 4). The STEMI and OMI paradigms are now being directly compared with nature and with each other. The OMI timeline summarizes this growing body of literature.

Figure 4
Occlusion MI Paradigm

The OMI paradigm classifies MI by the presence or absence of occlusion in the patient. As with other paradigm shifts, this incorporates the previous paradigm (eg, STEMI(+)OMI) while providing evidence-based advances for STEMI(−)OMI that not only add to ECG interpretation but change the diagnostic focus from ECG to patient. Abbreviations as in Figures 1 and 3.

Aslanger published the DIFOCCULT (DIagnostic accuracy oF electrocardiogram for acute coronary OCClUsion resuLTing in myocardial infarction) trial, in which 28% of non-STEMI were reclassified as "OMI" by blinded ECG interpretation alone. These non-STEMI-OMI patients had much larger infarcts and higher 800-day mortality (10.6% vs 4.4%). Similarly, Meyersfound that emergency physicians trained in the OMI paradigm could identify OMI with twice the sensitivity and preserved specificity as STEMI criteria, and significantly earlier.

Citing the work of Meyers, the new American College of Cardiology expert consensus on acute chest pain warns that STEMI criteria "will miss a significant minority of patients with ACO" and that providers need to look for subtle "ECG signs of vessel occlusion" — like hyperacute T waves, subtle STE with reciprocal change, anterior depression from posterior OMI, and Smith-Modified Sgarbossa criteria. This is a crucial acknowledgment of the difference between the limited surrogate marker of STEMI criteria and the underlying pathology of OMI, and promotion of evidence-based ECG advances.

### SCAI / ACC / AHA expert consensus document: 2014 update on percutaneous coronary intervention without on-site surgical backup [^117WrZTe]. Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

2010 ESC/EACTS myocardial revascularization guidance — centers without on-site surgery and system design: The guidelines do not comment on PCI without on-site surgery or issues related to institutional or operator competency, but they stress full disclosure of the lack of on-site cardiac surgery and the inadvisability of performing PCI for high-risk patients/lesions at facilities without on-site surgical backup. For ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the guidelines do not provide specific recommendations regarding PCI at centers without on-site surgery; instead, they emphasize networks connected by an efficient emergency transport system and recommend that primary PCI centers perform procedures 24 h a day, 7 days a week for all STEMI patients. Other models mentioned, although not ideal, include weekly or daily rotation of primary PCI centers or multiple primary PCI centers in the same region, and hospitals that cannot create a 24/7 service for primary PCI should be allowed to perform primary PCI in patients already admitted for another condition who subsequently develop STEMI. Reported system characteristics include that the mean population served by a single primary PCI center varied between 0.3 and 7.4 million inhabitants, and in countries offering primary PCI to the majority of STEMI patients, this population varied between 0.3 and 1.1 million per center. Where transfer times make timely reperfusion impossible, thrombolysis with subsequent immediate transfer to a primary PCI center has been endorsed.

### Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction in two young women with cystic fibrosis and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes [^112iGA3g]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Ischemic heart disease is rarely reported in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) despite multiple potential risk factors. Here we report two cases of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), both in young women with cystic fibrosis (CF) and cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD). These cases illustrate the importance of considering myocardial injury/infarction in the differential diagnosis of patients with CF and chest pain or shortness of breath, and addressing the growing risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1178qMjk]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

St-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) reperfusion in older adults — preferred strategy, timelines, and key adjuncts: American and European society guidelines recommend primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) as the preferred reperfusion strategy in all acute STEMI when symptom onset to first medical contact is < 12 hours, with door-to-balloon time < 90 minutes or anticipated transfer to reperfusion time < 120 minutes (Class 1; Level of Evidence A). If pPCI is not possible, it is recommended that older patients should receive fibrinolysis when appropriate; trials demonstrated the importance of half-dose fibrinolytic therapy in patients ≥ 75 years and that in elderly patients presenting within 3 hours of symptom onset when pPCI was not available within 1 hour, half-dose fibrinolysis had similar safety and efficacy compared with pPCI. As adjunctive therapy with fibrinolysis, clopidogrel should be considered the preferred P2Y12 inhibitor, with patients > 75 years receiving an initial dose of 75 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 75 mg once daily; for access during pPCI, transradial access has been proven safe in older patients and should be considered the preferred access site to lower bleeding, vascular complications, acute kidney injury, and perhaps death in STEMI.

### Prognostic value of new-generation troponins in ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction in the modern era: the RUTI-STEMI study [^113EzVc6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The high clinical sensitivity and myocardial tissue specificity of troponins have positioned them as the quintessential biomarker for myocardial damage and the preferred biomarker for diagnosing myocardial infarction (MI). 1 However, in the setting of ST‐segment–elevation MI (STEMI), diagnosis does not require troponin measurement: symptoms and ECG data are sufficient to activate a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

It is well known that, after an STEMI, cardiac troponins correlate with infarct size in the short‐term phase 2, 3 and with left ventricular remodeling during the long‐term. 4 Nevertheless, it is uncertain whether serial troponin measurements provide true value in clinical predictions of STEMI in the era of primary PCI. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of peak troponin levels in patients with STEMI over standard prognosticators. We measured troponins with a sensitive‐contemporary troponin I (sc‐TnI) assay and a high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs‐TnT) assay.

### Great debate: the universal definition of myocardial infarction is flawed and should be put to rest [^112KEFHW]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Myocardial infarction (MI) is defined pathologically as myocardial cell death resulting from prolonged ischaemia. The clinical definition of this pathological process relies on clinical evidence of myocardial ischaemia and biomarker evidence of myocardial cell death. Cardiac troponins are the standard clinical biomarker for assessing cardiac cell death. Within the framework of the universal definition of myocardial infarction (UDMI), the definition of acute MI aims to guide clinicians to accurately diagnose and classify acute MI, and distinguish acute MI from other forms of myocardial injury in daily practice. In the latest (Fourth) UDMI, a major effort has been made to providing: (i) a stratified pathophysiology-informed framework for the classification of different MI types and (ii) an overview of the factors that should be considered for distinguishing MI from non-ischaemic myocardial injury. The development and implementation of the UDMI in its various iterations has intended to comprehensively define MI and not to provide an MI management guideline. It has resulted in major achievements. However, significant reservations have emerged among different stakeholders (Graphical Abstract) which form the basis of this 'Great Debate' manuscript.

### Door-to-drug and door-to-balloon times: where can we improve? Time to reperfusion therapy in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) [^1155pESi]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

To better understand hospital performance in door-to-drug and door-to-balloon times for patients with STEMI, we examined hospital-level variation in key subintervals of door-to-drug time (door-to-electrocardiogram [ECG] and ECG-to-drug) and of door-to-balloon time (door-to-ECG, ECG-to-lab, lab-to-balloon). We sought to identify achievable subinterval times based on the experience of top performing hospitals.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis, using data from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction, of admissions between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2002 (20435 patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy in 693 hospitals, and 13387 patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention in 340 hospitals). Using hierarchical regression modeling, we estimated hospital-level geometric means of each subinterval, adjusted for patient clinical characteristics. We ranked hospitals based on the proportion of patients treated within 30 minutes for door-to-drug time and 90 minutes for door-to-balloon times and compared adjusted subinterval times across these groups.

Results

The higher performing hospitals (top 20%) in door-to-drug time and door-to-balloon times had significantly shorter times in nearly all subintervals compared with other hospitals, adjusted for patient clinical characteristics. Adjusted mean subinterval times in higher performing hospitals in door-to-drug time were 6.8 minutes (SD = 1.7) for door-to-ECG and 18.7 minutes (SD = 3.5) for ECG-to-drug. Adjusted mean subinterval times in higher performing hospitals in door-to-balloon time were 7.9 minutes (SD = 1.7) for door-to-ECG, 47.8 minutes (SD = 7.1) for ECG-to-lab, and 29.0 minutes (5.4) for lab-to-balloon, adjusted for patient clinical characteristics.

Conclusions

Substantial national attention is being directed at improving time to treatment of patients with STEMI. These data suggest achievable subinterval times for hospitals seeking to improve performance in this important quality indicator.
