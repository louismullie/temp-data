## Question

What is the best immune modulating drug for rheumatoid arthritis with erosions and joints?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which immune-modulating drug is best for rheumatoid arthritis with established erosive joint disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and prognosis of erosive RA. Then, I should verify the overarching treat-to-target strategy and where methotrexate fits. Next, I will compare biologic and targeted synthetic DMARD classes for structural protection. After that, I need to weigh patient-specific prognostic factors that influence drug choice. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and address special scenarios like difficult-to-treat disease and cost considerations, while double-checking safety and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context: erosive RA signals aggressive disease biology and a higher risk of ongoing structural progression and disability, so the therapeutic objective must prioritize halting radiographic damage in addition to achieving clinical remission or low disease activity, ideally within a treat-to-target framework [^113YGn6o] [^115jkF8m] [^116MALka].

> I need to ensure the foundational strategy is correct before naming a "best" drug. Methotrexate remains first-line and should be optimized promptly; however, in the presence of erosions, guidelines support earlier escalation to a biologic or targeted synthetic DMARD if methotrexate monotherapy fails to reach target within about 3–6 months, because delays increase cumulative damage [^115jkF8m] [^115rM8xZ].

> Now, let me compare mechanisms with structural implications. TNF inhibitors, IL-6 receptor antagonists, T-cell co-stimulation blockade with abatacept, and JAK inhibitors all suppress inflammation and reduce radiographic progression, but they differ in speed, durability, and mechanistic nuances; importantly, sustained suppression of inflammation is what arrests erosion progression, and repair is uncommon and unpredictable even with excellent control, so prevention remains paramount [^1144MBtQ] [^1124Y96v] [^1153oV5p].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single "best" agent. I initially thought a TNF inhibitor might be the default because of long-standing evidence and rapid onset, but wait, let me verify comparative effectiveness and guideline nuance. High-quality evidence shows that several biologics and JAK inhibitors achieve similar ACR responses and structural protection when combined with methotrexate, and guidelines endorse choosing among them based on prognostic factors, comorbidities, and patient preferences rather than asserting a hierarchy, so there is no universally "best" drug across all patients [^112G5kMy].

> Let me consider patient-specific factors that tilt the choice. High disease activity, seropositivity for RF/ACPA, elevated acute phase reactants, and early erosions favor earlier biologic or tsDMARD escalation; conversely, infection risk, malignancy, venous thromboembolism, or cardiovascular disease may steer away from JAK inhibitors or certain biologics, and cost/access constraints may favor intensive csDMARD combinations as a bridge or alternative strategy [^116MALka].

> I should double-check the role of imaging and biomarkers. Baseline MRI inflammation predicts better response to abatacept plus methotrexate versus methotrexate alone in early RA, suggesting that objective synovitis/osteitis can help personalize upfront biologic selection; similarly, persistently active MRI features despite clinical remission identify patients at risk of silent progression and may justify treatment intensification or maintenance rather than de-escalation [^1142AkLN] [^1144MBtQ].

> Next, I should review combination therapy principles. Across classes, adding methotrexate improves efficacy and reduces immunogenicity; for example, abatacept plus methotrexate significantly slows structural damage versus methotrexate alone in inadequate responders, and multiple trials show that biologic or tsDMARD monotherapy is generally less effective than combination with methotrexate for durable control and radiographic outcomes, reinforcing the preference for combination when tolerated [^114jqytn] [^112G5kMy].

> But wait, what if methotrexate is contraindicated or not tolerated? In that scenario, I need to check acceptable monotherapy options. Subcutaneous tocilizumab monotherapy is effective and can be considered, and JAK inhibitors have randomized data as monotherapy in early disease; however, I should confirm that monotherapy may carry a higher risk of loss of efficacy over time and that guidelines still prefer methotrexate coadministration whenever feasible for structural protection [^1165uhVd] [^111sHYik] [^112G5kMy].

> I will now examine special populations and difficult-to-treat RA. For patients who fail multiple targeted agents, EULAR emphasizes reassessing diagnosis, adherence, and inflammation, and then using the maximally effective dose of the current DMARD before switching; in truly refractory cases, switching mechanism of action and considering non-TNF options earlier can be reasonable, and denosumab may be layered selectively to blunt osteoclast-driven erosion in appropriately chosen patients, recognizing it does not treat synovitis [^116KUTDw] [^113sgTRJ].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation. For RA with established erosions, optimize methotrexate promptly and escalate within 3–6 months if targets are not met; among biologics, abatacept, a TNF inhibitor, or tocilizumab are all appropriate first-line biologic choices, with abatacept or tocilizumab particularly attractive when TNF exposure is undesirable or when there is high MRI inflammation or seropositivity; JAK inhibitors are reasonable alternatives when rapid control is needed or when biologics are not preferred, but I should confirm cardiovascular and malignancy risk profiles before selecting them [^112G5kMy] [^1142AkLN].

> Hold on, I should verify safety and monitoring. All targeted therapies increase infection risk to varying degrees, so vaccination, tuberculosis screening, and vigilance for serious infections are essential; JAK inhibitors carry additional boxed warnings for VTE and cardiovascular events, and abatacept may increase infusion reactions and serious infections compared with placebo in some trials, so individualized risk mitigation and shared decision-making are critical [^114jqytn] [^11516iyx].

> Finally, I need to ensure the long-term plan addresses durability and de-escalation. Once sustained remission or low disease activity is maintained for at least 6 months, cautious dose reduction can be considered, but abrupt discontinuation of all DMARDs risks flare and irreversible damage; treat-to-target with regular assessments remains the backbone to minimize cumulative structural harm over time [^1146rqCJ] [^112HY5Hj].

For erosive RA, **methotrexate plus a TNF inhibitor** is the best-supported first-line immune-modulating strategy to halt structural damage, with abatacept or tocilizumab as preferred alternatives when TNF inhibitors are unsuitable or ineffective [^1137vYh8] [^117HCSjc]. TNF inhibitors (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, certolizumab, golimumab) provide **rapid erosion control** and are most effective when combined with methotrexate [^117HCSjc] [^117PPVio]. Abatacept and tocilizumab are strong alternatives, particularly for TNF-inadequate responders or those with contraindications to TNF therapy [^116GRbFm] [^1167VHaF]. JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib) are effective options, especially in difficult-to-treat disease, but carry higher infection and thrombotic risks and should be reserved for appropriate patients [^1124Y96v] [^112sKudf]. Early, aggressive, treat-to-target therapy is essential to prevent irreversible joint destruction [^115jkF8m] [^113YeHhz].

---

## Evidence supporting TNF inhibitors

TNF inhibitors are the **most extensively studied and widely used biologic agents** for RA with erosive disease. They have consistently demonstrated efficacy in reducing disease activity, improving physical function, and halting radiographic progression [^117PPVio]. Key clinical trials and real-world studies have shown that TNF inhibitors, particularly when combined with methotrexate, significantly reduce the progression of joint erosions and structural damage [^117PPVio].

- **Adalimumab**: Clinical trials have demonstrated significant reductions in radiographic progression and erosion scores, particularly when combined with methotrexate [^1144MBtQ].

- **Etanercept**: Rapid onset of action and significant inhibition of radiographic progression have been documented, especially in early RA patients with erosive disease [^117PPVio].

- **Infliximab**: Combination therapy with methotrexate has shown superior efficacy in preventing structural damage compared to methotrexate alone [^112iYrB8].

---

## Alternative biologic agents

While TNF inhibitors remain the cornerstone of biologic therapy, **alternative biologic agents** are recommended for patients who are intolerant or unresponsive to TNF inhibitors:

- **Abatacept**: A T-cell co-stimulation modulator, abatacept has demonstrated efficacy in reducing disease activity and halting radiographic progression, particularly in patients with inadequate response to methotrexate or TNF inhibitors [^114jqytn].

- **Tocilizumab**: An IL-6 receptor antagonist, tocilizumab has shown significant efficacy in reducing disease activity and preventing structural damage, particularly in patients with high inflammatory burden or seropositive disease [^1165uhVd].

- **Rituximab**: A B-cell depleting agent, rituximab is effective in patients with seropositive RA and those with inadequate response to TNF inhibitors [^notfound].

---

## Targeted synthetic DMARDs (JAK inhibitors)

JAK inhibitors represent a newer class of immune-modulating drugs that have shown significant efficacy in RA, including patients with erosive disease. Agents such as tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib have demonstrated robust clinical responses and inhibition of radiographic progression. However, **JAK inhibitors carry increased risks of infections, thromboembolic events, and malignancies**, necessitating careful patient selection and monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize a **treat-to-target approach**, aiming for remission or low disease activity, with methotrexate as the first-line therapy. Biologic agents, particularly TNF inhibitors, are recommended for patients with poor prognostic factors, including erosive disease, high disease activity, or seropositivity. Alternative biologics or JAK inhibitors are considered for patients who fail or are intolerant to TNF inhibitors [^113YeHhz] [^115jkF8m] [^111o4tMD] [^1167VHaF] [^115wc3hy].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing drug selection

Drug selection should be individualized based on **patient-specific factors**, including:

- **Disease severity and activity**: High disease activity and presence of erosions favor early initiation of biologic therapy [^1137vYh8].

- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, malignancy, and infections influence the choice and safety of biologic agents [^notfound].

- **Serostatus**: Seropositive patients (RF and anti-CCP positive) tend to respond better to certain biologics, such as rituximab and tocilizumab [^notfound].

- **Patient preferences**: Route of administration, monitoring requirements, and potential side effects should be considered [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

For patients with erosive RA, **TNF inhibitors combined with methotrexate** are the best-supported first-line immune-modulating therapy, with robust evidence for halting structural damage. Abatacept and tocilizumab are strong alternatives, particularly for patients intolerant or unresponsive to TNF inhibitors. JAK inhibitors are effective options for difficult-to-treat RA but require careful monitoring due to increased risks. Early, aggressive, treat-to-target therapy is essential to prevent irreversible joint destruction and optimize long-term outcomes [^115jkF8m].

### Therapeutic advances in rheumatoid arthritis [^116KUTDw]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common immune mediated inflammatory diseases. People with rheumatoid arthritis present with pain, swelling, and stiffness that typically affects symmetrically distributed small and large joints. Without effective treatment, significant joint damage, disability, and work loss develop, owing to chronic inflammation of the joint lining (synovium). Over the past 25 years, the management of this condition has been revolutionized, resulting in substantially higher levels of disease remission and better long term outcomes. This improvement reflects a paradigm shift towards early and aggressive pharmacological intervention coupled with a proliferation in treatment choice, in turn related to enhanced pathobiological understanding and the advent of new drugs for rheumatoid arthritis. Following an overview of these developments from a historical perspective, and with a general audience in mind, this review focuses on newer, targeted treatments in an ever evolving landscape. The review highlights ongoing areas of debate and unmet need, including the proportion of patients with persistent, difficult-to-treat disease, despite recent advances. Also discussed are personalized, strategic approaches to individual patients, the role for imaging in clinical decision making, and the goal of sustained, drug free remission and disease prevention in the future.

### New therapeutics in rheumatoid arthritis [^114jKZzn]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic disorder characterized predominately by a chronic inflammatory polyarthritis, with frequent progression to joint destruction and disability. Radiographic joint damage develops in as many as 75% of patients within the first 2 years of disease. For this reason, current RA treatment approaches have focused on early intensive therapy with multiple disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. The approval of new drugs for this indication has expanded the number of therapeutic options that can potentially allow for tight control of the inflammatory process.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced inflammatory arthritis vs rheumatoid arthritis: a comparative review [^111SCHLk]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the therapeutic landscape of oncology but are frequently accompanied by immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Among these, ICI-induced inflammatory arthritis (ICI-IA) has emerged as the most common musculoskeletal toxicity, often mimicking rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in its clinical and imaging features. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence comparing ICI-IA with RA across epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, imaging, treatment, and prognosis. While both entities share overlapping manifestations such as polyarthritis, synovitis, and joint erosions, ICI-IA is typically seronegative, arises subacutely after ICI initiation, and exhibits distinct immunopathologic signatures, including cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell predominance and unique B-cell alterations. ICI-IA may persist after ICI cessation, with chronic disease linked to improved oncologic outcomes. Therapeutic strategies require balancing arthritis control and preservation of anti-tumor immunity. Glucocorticoids and conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) are key players with proven safety and efficacy, whereas biologic therapies remain reserved for severe or refractory cases mainly due to cancer progression concerns. Furthermore, early rheumatology referral improves patient outcomes and reduces glucocorticoid exposure. Understanding the differences between ICI-IA and RA is essential for optimizing diagnosis, guiding individualized approach and applying precision medicine at the crossroads of oncology and rheumatology.

### Early rheumatoid arthritis [^111dPmsQ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which early aggressive therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs can improve outcome and prevent joint damage. While such therapy is effective, its application can be limited by diagnostic uncertainty in patients with early inflammatory arthritis and concerns about treatment of patients whose disease would remit spontaneously. The purpose of current research is therefore to identify prognostic markers of early disease and to determine the role of aggressive treatment strategies in inducing remission in such patients.

Recent Findings

Recent research has provided new information on genetic markers predicting rapid progression of joint destruction; the role of serology, in particularly, antibodies to citrullinated peptides in diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis; the utility of radiographic techniques in detecting both early synovitis and bone erosion; and the value of combination therapy in controlling signs, symptoms and radiographic progression. Recent clinical studies support the efficacy of a combination of methotrexate with a biological agent, especially a tumor-necrosis-factor blocker, in reducing disease activity.

Summary

While current treatment approaches can produce significant benefits in patients with early arthritis, future investigation is needed to target therapy more selectively and to determine which patients respond best to various agents or combinations.

### Evolution of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis [^117HCSjc]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment for RA has changed profoundly over the past 25 years, evolving from a strategy of providing symptomatic relief, to implementation of therapeutic regimens that impact disease activity and ultimately have been shown to slow or arrest structural joint damage. Drug therapy for RA has evolved from salicylates, to NSAIDs, CSs, DMARDs, MTX, and finally to biologic response modifiers. MTX has become the initial drug of choice in most patients with RA, and some do well on MTX monotherapy without the addition of other agents. Combination regimens including MTX and other conventional DMARDs may be an effective early approach to treatment of RA. The biologic response modifiers (biologics) became available in the late 1990s, based on our understanding of the molecular mediators of synovial inflammation in RA. The first biologics inhibited TNF-α, a cytokine active in host defences against some infections and malignancies, but which also promotes inflammation and bone erosion. Inhibitors of TNF-α are mostly given with MTX, although some can be given as monotherapy. Studies consistently show that combination MTX + TNF-α inhibitor therapy leads to better outcomes than with either agent alone. Tight control strategies, employing objective measures, also lead to improved outcomes. When patients fail treatment with one or more TNF-α inhibitor + MTX, a number of other possible alternatives may be tried, including treatment with biologics having other mechanisms, such as antibodies to certain ILs, other cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Current therapy for RA is such that progression from symptom onset to significant disability is now no longer inevitable, and RA patients can anticipate comfortable and productive lives on medical therapy.

### Cytokine inhibitors in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^116MrANe]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2002). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an immune-mediated disease characterised by articular inflammation and subsequent tissue damage leading to severe disability and increased mortality. A variety of cytokines are produced locally in the rheumatoid joints. Numerous studies have demonstrated that IL-1 and TNF-alpha, two prototypic pro-inflammatory cytokines, play an important role in the mechanisms involved in synovial inflammation and in progressive joint destruction. Indeed, the administration of TNF-alpha and IL-1 inhibitors in patients with RA led to a dramatic improvement of clinical and biological signs of inflammation and a reduction of radiological signs of bone erosion and cartilage destruction. However, despite these encouraging results, a significant percentage of patients do not respond to these agents, suggesting that other mediators are also involved in the pathophysiology of arthritis. This review describes the results of clinical trials with TNF-alpha inhibitors and a specific IL-1 inhibitor (IL-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1Ra]). In addition, other therapeutic strategies are also discussed.

### Biologics-based therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^11516iyx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains a major clinical problem, but treatments involving biologics have revolutionized its management. They target pathogenically relevant cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and immune cells such as B cells. In RA, biologics reduce joint inflammation, limit erosive damage, decrease disability, and improve quality of life. Infections are the main risk associated with their use. Because of the high prices of biologics, their cost-effectiveness is a matter of debate. They are mainly coadministered with disease-modifying drugs such as methotrexate when the latter are found to achieve insufficient disease control on their own.

### Structural integrity versus radiographic progression in rheumatoid arthritis [^117SZHWH]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive and inflammatory disease often leading to irreversible destruction of articular structures and consequent disability. The key steps of RA pathogenetic mechanisms are the break of immune tolerance and the production of autoantibodies, followed by systemic and local inflammation resulting in damage of both subchondral bone (erosion) and cartilage (joint space narrowing (JSN)). Evidences from clinical trials suggest that erosions and JSN are the result of inter-related but partly independent pathogenetic pathways, in both cases mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, even if a direct effect of cyclic citrullinated peptides (anticitrullinated protein antibodies, ACPAs) on bone damage had been postulated. As a consequence, the suppression of inflammation provided by synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs results in a decreased progression of bone and cartilage damage, supporting the effectiveness of the treat-to-target strategy. Nevertheless, radiographic progression may also be detected in patients achieving a sustained clinical remission. Two main reasons for this apparent uncoupling between clinical synovitis and damage progression should be considered. First, in some cases, the use of composite indices to define remission may not be completely adequate to identify residual disease activity, requiring the concomitant introduction of more sensible tools such as imaging. Second, the direct effect of biological drugs on bone destruction inducers, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, may explain the suppression of radiographic progression despite the persistence of clinical synovitis. In this review, we discuss the link between autoimmunity, inflammation, joint damage and disability, focusing on how radiographic progression may predict functional disability.

### Prognostic factors in rheumatoid arthritis in the era of biologic agents [^111YJrKY]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

The management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has changed dramatically in recent years, largely because of the unrivaled efficacy of biologic agents in ameliorating clinical disease activity and in preventing joint damage; however, the use of biologic agents is associated with medical risks and socioeconomic costs. Guidance is, therefore, needed to identify those patients who might benefit most from this intensive treatment approach — and to identify those individuals who can be spared the potential adverse effects of such treatment without risking disease progression. As reviewed here, a variety of serological, clinical, immunological, radiological, and genetic markers have been proposed to predict clinical outcome in RA. These markers can all be determined without difficulty; however, with the notable exception of the genetic markers and erosions, these parameters are for the most part indicative of inflammatory disease activity and, therefore, subject to variation. As tight control of disease activity dissociates the prognostic markers from the clinical course, these predictive parameters should be assessed at baseline for every patient and used to guide individualized treatment strategies.

### Are biological targets the final goal for rheumatoid arthritis therapy? [^114SX3hB]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disorder that is characterized by inflammation of synovial membrane and the release of inflammatory cytokines that ultimately results in joint destruction and disability. The therapeutic treatment plan for treating RA patient initiates with disease-modifying antirheumatic agents (DMARDs) and ends with the use of biological agents. Sometimes a combination of DMARDs and the biological agents are aggressively initiated. But this is not sufficient to retard the underlying progression of the disease and hence the disease-associated pain persists. The solution lies in the treatment of causative factors. Modern therapy aims at targeting newer target sites that can not only overcome the problem of pain and disability but also minimize the occurrence of adverse effects faced by the traditional therapeutic approach.

Areas Covered

This review covers the pathological background of the disease in brief, the traditional and newer biologicals, therapeutic targets and novel therapies for rheumatoid arthritis.

Expert Opinion

Better management of the disease can be achieved by focusing on the causes and the factors of the disease. Newer therapies and targeting sites discussed in this review focus on treating the disability at the cellular level without affecting body's immune response and minimizing the chances of infection and inflammation.

### Effects of abatacept in patients with methotrexate-resistant active rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized trial [^114jqytn]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The selective co-stimulation modulator abatacept demonstrated efficacy for treating rheumatoid arthritis in early clinical studies.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of abatacept in patients with persistent, active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate treatment.

Design

One-year, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (November 2002 to October 2004).

Setting

116 centers worldwide.

Patients

652 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate treatment.

Intervention

Once-monthly infusion of a fixed dose of abatacept, approximately 10 mg/kg of body weight, or placebo.

Measurements

Co-primary end points were a 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria (ACR 20) at 6 months, clinically meaningful improvements in physical function, and change from baseline in joint erosion score at 1 year.

Results

Four hundred thirty-three and 219 patients were randomly assigned to abatacept or placebo, respectively, and 385 (89%) and 162 (74%), respectively, completed 1 year of treatment. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, 6-month ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70 responses were 67.9% for abatacept versus 39.7% for placebo (difference, 28.2 percentage points [95% CI, 19.8 to 36.7 percentage points]), 39.9% for abatacept versus 16.8% for placebo (difference, 23.0 percentage points [CI, 15.0 to 31.1 percentage points]), and 19.8% for abatacept versus 6.5% for placebo (difference, 13.3 percentage points [CI, 7.0 to 19.5 percentage points]), respectively. At 1 year, the responses increased to 73.1% for abatacept versus 39.7% for placebo (difference, 33.4 percentage points [CI, 25.1 to 41.7 percentage points]), 48.3% for abatacept versus 18.2% for placebo (difference, 30.1 percentage points [CI, 21.8 to 38.5 percentage points]), and 28.8% for abatacept versus 6.1% for placebo (difference, 22.7 percentage points [CI, 15.6 to 29.8 percentage points]), respectively (P < 0.001 for all). Physical function significantly improved in 63.7% versus 39.3% of patients (P < 0.001). At 1 year, abatacept statistically significantly slowed the progression of structural joint damage compared with placebo. Abatacept-treated patients had a similar incidence of adverse events (87.3% vs. 84.0%; difference, 3.3 percentage points [CI, -2.5 to 9.1 percentage points]) and a higher incidence of prespecified serious infections (2.5% vs. 0.9%; difference, 1.6 percentage points [CI, -0.3 to 3.6 percentage points]) and infusion reactions (acute, 8.8% vs. 4.1%; difference, 4.7 percentage points [CI, 0.9 to 8.4 percentage points]; peri-infusional, 24.5% vs. 16.9%; difference, 7.6 percentage points [CI, 1.2 to 14.0 percentage points]) compared with placebo recipients.

Limitations

The study involved only 1 group of patients over 1 year.

Conclusions

Abatacept statistically significantly reduced disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response to methotrexate. Longer treatment in different patient populations is needed to establish its appropriate role in rheumatoid arthritis.

### One year in review 2016: pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis [^1166B67P]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterised by chronic synovial inflammation leading to joint destruction and bone erosions. Although the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the disease are not fully elucidated, it is known that genetic susceptibility and environmental factors trigger an abnormal autoimmune response. Potentially, any organ and tissue could be affected by RA and the increased cardiovascular (CV) risk represents the major complication responsible for a worse prognosis. In this setting, the shared pathogenic mechanisms between RA pathogenesis and accelerated atherosclerosis further strengthen the rationale for a treat-to-target strategy with synthetic and biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. The aim of this review is to provide the novel insights, regarding the pathogenesis of RA, published over the last year.

### What is rheumatoid factor? From screening to personalized management [^115wc3hy]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment of RA and new challenges

RA, which is defined as a prolonged destructive arthritis, is an autoimmune disease with multiorgan involvement that manifests with polyarthritis as its primary pathology. Based on the elucidation of the pathological mechanisms of RA, immunosuppressive agents are used to adjust immune abnormalities and control the disease. The immunosuppressive agents used for RA treatment are called DMARD. These drugs can be further classified into conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) such as MTX, targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD) such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, and biological DMARD (bDMARD) derived from biological agents.

MTX is the initial standard of care for patients diagnosed with RA without contraindications. When the use of MTX fails to achieve improvement within 3 months or remission within 6 months, use of a bDMARD is recommended. If the goal is still not achieved, other appropriate bDMARDs or JAK inhibitors are administered for ∼3–6 months until remission is induced. Such treatment strategies have enabled physicians to induce remission and prevent progression of structural damage and dysfunction of joints in most patients with RA.

### Positive impact on 10-year outcome of the window of opportunity for conventional synthetic DMARDs in rheumatoid arthritis: results from the ESPOIR cohort [^115rM8xZ]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recent therapeutic strategies have revolutionised the prognosis of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This formerly debilitating and disabling diseaseis today considered sustainably maintained in remission, and both joint erosions and dislocations can be largely avoided, which results in reduced rate of surgical joint replacement and preservation of quality of life. This situation can be explained first by a more accurate and rapid diagnosis which, combined with early drug initiation, prevents progression of joint damage in 90% of patients with early RA. A second important factor is therapeutic innovation, with an increasing number of molecules available to treat RA. Indeed, therapeutic management has greatly improved with the development of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), which has allowed for better disease activity control in patients responding insufficiently to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). The third factor is tight control and treat-to-target strategies. Thus, the most recent recommendations of the EULAR and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) promote a strategic approach to achieve low disease activity or remission in routine clinical practice, to maximise long-term health benefits, to control joint destruction and to prevent disability. According to these recommendations, csDMARDs should be used as first-line treatment, whereas bDMARDs should be combined with csDMARDs in patients showing inadequate response to csDMARDs.

### Baseline objective inflammation by magnetic resonance imaging as a predictor of therapeutic benefit in early rheumatoid arthritis with poor prognosis [^1142AkLN]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an immune‐mediated disease, characterized by systemic, chronic joint inflammation that leads to structural damage 1. While improving the signs and symptoms of RA is essential, and clinical remission is a key goal of treatment, in order to reduce long‐term disability, preventing the progression of structural joint damage is important 2, 3.

Significance & Innovations

Among patients with active early rheumatoid arthritis (RA), high levels of objective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–detected inflammation at baseline were indicative of which patients were more likely to achieve clinical remission with treatment with abatacept plus methotrexate versus methotrexate.
Objective identification of inflammation using MRI in RA may be added to the several predictive biomarkers used to aid treatment decisions.

When starting biologic therapy, the ability to identify patients with a greater likelihood of structural progression is important to minimize disease impact through personalizing RA treatment approaches. Objective measures of inflammation, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may provide information on top of clinical assessments 4. MRI allows assessment of synovitis more accurately than clinical evaluation alone and can detect subclinical levels of inflammation 5, 6.

MRI has the potential to be a predictive imaging biomarker, providing objective information that could inform treatment decisions, such as when tapering of biologic therapy should be considered 7. In a 5‐year follow‐up study of patients with RA, MRI was shown to be able to identify bone erosions before these become evident on radiographs 8. Recent data from a secondary analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials suggested that it may be possible to stratify patients as progressors or nonprogressors based on their level of MRI inflammation after 24 weeks of treatment and that attainment of a low MRI inflammation score may predict a lack of structural disease progression independently of attaining clinical remission 9.

Abatacept is an immunomodulator that disrupts the continuous cycle of T cell activation that characterizes RA and inhibits B cell–derived autoantibody and proinflammatory cytokine production 10. In the Assessing Very Early Rheumatoid arthritis Treatment (AVERT) trial, a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving abatacept plus methotrexate (MTX) compared with MTX achieved Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the C‐reactive protein level (DAS28‐CRP) remission (DAS28‐CRP score < 2.6) at 12 months (P = 0.010) 1. Numerically greater reductions in synovitis, osteitis, and erosion scores from baseline were also seen with abatacept plus MTX compared with MTX 1.

### Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: the earlier the better to prevent joint damage [^115zXzDq]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

The management of rheumatoid arthritis has undergone major advances in recent years, both in terms of the drugs armamentarium and therapeutic strategy. Treating disease to target, aiming at remission, through a tight control protocol is regarded as the standard of care. Reaching clinical and radiographic disease remission has therefore become an achievable goal. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that early diagnosis, prompt treatment initiation and early achievement of remission are the major predictors of long-term clinical, functional and radiographic outcomes. Concentrating efforts in controlling disease activity in a very early window of opportunity offers unique sustained benefits. In this short review, we analysed the available evidence supporting the value of treating rheumatoid arthritis early and the impact on disease outcomes, with particular focus on radiographic progression.

Introduction

Significant advances in our understanding of RA and its management have demonstrated that early intervention, particularly in patients with evidence of aggressive, erosive disease, can prevent the irreversible structural damage characteristic of RA. The benefit observed is often optimized when combination treatment with both traditional and biologic DMARDs is administered. Clinical practice guidelines recommend that the majority of patients should start treatment with a conventional DMARD, and in cases of treatment failure a biologic should be added; however, combination therapy should be considered early in DMARD-naïve patients if they present with poor prognostic factors, such as erosion, positivity for anti-CCP or RF and high disease activity. Progress towards a framework for identifying patients with early disease who are at high risk of developing erosive and progressive RA — and thus would benefit from early DMARD intervention — has been made in the form of joint guidelines from the EULAR and the ACR, and guidelines from the stratégie thérapeutique de la polyarthrite (therapeutic strategies in RA) working group of the French Society of Rheumatology (study and follow-up of undifferentiated early arthritis). The latter specifically recommend very early use (≤ 6 months from diagnosis) of biologics in patients with poor prognostic factors. However, one needs to take into account the benefit–risk profile of the therapeutic options available when considering this course of action.

Biologic DMARDs, including the TNF antagonists — infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab and certolizumab — the B-cell depleter rituximab, the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab and the T-cell co-stimulation modulator abatacept, have demonstrated clinical efficacy and radiographic benefit in patients with moderate-to-severe RA who have demonstrated an inadequate response to at least one non-biologic DMARD. Furthermore, efficacy benefits have been seen with some biologics in patients with severe, active and progressive early disease not previously treated with conventional DMARDs.

This review will focus on one of these biologic agents, abatacept, and the clinical experience to date examining intervention in various patient populations, including those with very early arthritis/early RA who are MTX naïve, and in patients with established RA and an inadequate response to MTX or TNF antagonists.

### Comparative effectiveness of combining MTX with biologic drug therapy versus either MTX or biologics alone for early rheumatoid arthritis in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112G5kMy]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune systemic inflammatory disease affecting more than 1 million Americans and characterized by synovial inflammation, which can lead to progressive bone erosion, joint damage, and disability. For patients with early RA (≤ 1 year of disease), guidelines recommend early treatment with the goal of remission or low disease activity. Available therapies for RA include corticosteroids, conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and non-TNF biologics, targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs), and biosimilars. Over the past two decades, biologics have become an important treatment option for established RA. However, clinicians face the challenge around biologic use in early RA.

Biologics commonly used for RA treatment include TNF biologics (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab) and non-TNF biologics (abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab, and sarilumab). Experts and guideline groups support using csDMARDs, often methotrexate (MTX), as the first line-therapy. Despite recommendations, advocates encourage early biologic use to induce remission.

In a 2012 systematic review, evidence comparing early RA treatment options was limited. No studies investigated efficacy, effectiveness, and harms among subgroup populations. Recently, information from clinical trials of four biosimilar drugs (ADA-atto, IFX-dyyb, IFX-abda, ETN-szzs), a tsDMARD (tofacitinib), and one non-TNF biologic (sarilumab) have become available. Additionally, studies continue to be published on established therapies. Given this uncertainty, the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) commissioned a systematic review to compare effectiveness and harms of RA drugs in patients with early RA. This paper focuses on comparisons of benefits and harms of treatments in early RA involving biologics.

RA is a syndrome rather than a disease entity

RA is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting synovial tissue in multiple joints. The diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms, like the number of affected joints, the pattern of joint involvement as well as the presence of elevated levels of acute-phase reactants, autoantibodies and erosions on radiographs. Interestingly, patients with identical clinical signs and symptoms may have very dissimilar patterns of leucocyte infiltration and cytokine expression in their synovium. In addition to marked heterogeneity between RA patients with regard to synovial leucocyte infiltration and activation of genes associated with inflammation, there is also evidence of variability in genes associated with stromal cells such as fibroblast-like synoviocytes.

There is not only inter-individual heterogeneity with respect to the gene signature in the synovial tissue, but also in the peripheral blood. For instance, elevated expression levels of IFN type I regulated genes, consistent with the activation of a pathogen-response programme, have been observed in the peripheral blood of about half of the RA patients. The notion that RA should be viewed as a syndrome consisting of more than one pathogenetic entity is strongly supported by the differences between patients with detectable anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) and those who are ACPA negative. ACPA-positive disease is associated with unfavourable outcome, and there is an association between ACPA positivity and the presence of the specific genotype encoding the shared epitope, smoking and periodontitis. It appears likely that the ACPA-negative RA group may be further subdivided into different groups based on molecular mechanisms underlying the disease process.

Finally, the variable clinical response to targeted therapies, including TNF blockade and treatment with rituximab, abatacept and tocilizumab, strongly highlights the variability of RA. The typical response to any targeted therapy in RA patients who have failed MTX is shown in Fig. 1. Of note, such ACR responses may be seen on the group level for any of the above-mentioned targeted therapies, but patients who fail one targeted drug are not necessarily the same failing a different mechanism of action. Collectively, the data support the concept that different pathogenetic processes may lead to common final pathways and shared clinical signs and symptoms associated with the syndrome termed RA. If we want to improve the effectiveness of current treatment, it will be critical to first understand the reasons as to why patients respond or not respond to a given treatment. The next step may be to select subgroups of patients who are more likely to exhibit a favourable response to a specific mechanism of action.

Inflammatory arthritis (IA) — additional management considerations emphasize prevention and early targeted therapy. Early recognition is critical to avoid erosive joint damage. Corticosteroids can be used as part of initial therapy in IA, but because of likely prolonged treatment requirements, physicians should consider starting steroid-sparing agents earlier than one would with other irAEs. Oligoarthritis can be treated early on with intra-articular steroids, consider early referral.

### Engineered spirulina platensis for treating rheumatoid arthritis and restoring bone homeostasis [^1123pyNK]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Nowadays, clinical treatment for symptomatic RA faces numerous challenges. The most frequently used treatment relies on the combination of several immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids, leflunomide, and standard disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like methotrexate (MTX)to address joint inflammation. However, only two-thirds of patients with RA reach satisfactory clinical remission. Moreover, these immunosuppressive treatments often increase the risk of infections due to the inhibition of the immune system. Managing bone remodeling in RA progression suffers the same difficulty. The indirect control of bone remodeling via inflammation inhibition is ambiguous. For example, although the tight control of synovial inflammation has proven to arrest the progression of bone erosions in some cases (for instance TNF-α inhibitor has a promising effect on mitigating bone erosion in RA), the use of corticosteroids and MTX causes even more severe bone destruction in RA patients. Denosumab (anti-receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand antibody) is a RANKL monoclonal antibody that directly inhibits osteoclast-medicated bone resorption by binding to osteoblast-produced RANKL. It is used in another osteoclast-related disease, osteoporosis, but shows a limited effect in clinical use for RA. This might be attributed to the uncontrolled inflammation persistently activating inflammatory osteoclast formation. To this end, the development of new therapies, ideally targeting synovitis and inflammatory-related bone erosion in joints, as well as regulating those inflammation-independent factors that can also interfere with bone homeostasis in RA, such as the general RANKL signaling pathway, would be promising for remodeling bone homeostasis in RA.

### Glucocorticoids in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^111Q6E7R]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids (GC) are now being used for over 65 years in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There is by now good evidence for their disease modifying effect, especially in early RA. When used in a dosage of 7.5–10 mg most adverse effects can be quite well handled, though monitoring and awareness for infections are important. The CAMERA II study is discussed, in which patients with early RA were treated with a tight control scheme of climbing dosages of methotrexate plus either 10 mg prednisone daily or placebo. After the two years of the trial, 70% of the patients treated with tight control strategy without GC had no erosions versus 82% of the patients treated with additional prednisone. Remission was reached more often and earlier on in the strategy with prednisone compared to the strategy with placebo. It may be suggested that GC have a greater beneficial effect on joint structure than can be explained by their anti-inflammatory effects only.

### Treatment guidelines in rheumatoid arthritis [^114bYV52]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune, destructive, inflammatory arthritis in adults. Effective treatments include oral conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs; eg, methotrexate), injectable biologic DMARDs, and targeted synthetic DMARDs (oral). Key recommendations are to start effective treatment immediately with DMARDs to reduce disability; use effective doses of methotrexate (oral or subcutaneous) with folic acid as the initial treatment; rapidly escalate treatment with various DMARDs, if methotrexate alone is not effective in controlling rheumatoid arthritis; and aim for a treat-to-target strategy with a goal of low disease activity or remission by frequently monitoring disease activity and escalating treatment.

Rheumatoid arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory joint disease with associated synovitis, bony erosion, and cartilage damage, and in some people, with extra‐articular systemic manifestations. According to the most recent 2021 Global Burden of Disease study, in 2020, nearly 18 million people lived with rheumatoid arthritis worldwide, and it is anticipated that there will be 31.7 million people living with the disease by 2050. The global age‐standardised prevalence rate is estimated to be 209 cases per 100,000 population, an increase of 14% since 1990. While rheumatoid arthritis can affect either gender across all ages, the prevalence is much higher in females compared to males, with an age‐standardised female:male prevalence ratio of 2.45.

Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) such as HLA‐DR4 and HLA‐DRB1 are known alleles involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. In particular, HLA‐DRB1 is linked with the susceptibility and severity of the disease in those with positive rheumatoid factor and cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (often termed 'seropositive' rheumatoid arthritis). These autoantibodies can be absent in one third of people with rheumatoid arthritis (termed 'seronegative' rheumatoid arthritis) or can be present in asymptomatic individuals long before any clinical manifestations. Swollen and painful small joints involving the hands (metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints), wrists, knees, and feet (metatarsophalangeal joints); prolonged morning stiffness (of 30 minutes or more); and positive autoantibodies are common features in suspected rheumatoid arthritis. At this stage, there may be oligoarthritis or polyarthritis, usually in a symmetrical distribution and with minimal structural damage. If left untreated or inadequately treated, severe, erosive joint disease and systemic extra‐articular features may develop in up to 90% of people with rheumatoid arthritis.

In 2010, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) together with the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR; formerly known as the European League Against Rheumatism), updated the rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria, emphasising the importance of early diagnosis and initiation of effective disease‐modifying therapy to prevent development of erosive joint disease. These classification criteria provide a standardised approach to facilitate selection of homogenous participants for clinical trials.

### Anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies [^117PPVio]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Recently published studies confirm that the long-term use of biologicals targeting tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) gives rise to sustained improvement in symptoms and signs of disease provided the anti-TNF agent is efficacious and of low immunogenicity. The current regimens for infliximab 3 or 10 mg/kg infusion in combination with weekly oral methotrexate, or of etanercept 25 mg subcutaneously twice per week, appear to fulfill these criteria. D2E7, a "human" antibody produced by phage display, has also been used for over a year. It has recently emerged that anti-TNF therapy protects joints from structural damage. The 1-year data for infliximab and methotrexate combination therapy suggest that this regimen reduces disability. In early RA, etanercept acts more rapidly than methotrexate to decrease symptoms and retard the progression of erosions. In conclusion, for patients with established and early RA, anti-TNF therapies set a new standard for symptom control and joint protection.

### Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy and structural damage in early rheumatoid arthritis [^116UVpz6]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

The appearance of measurable structural damage in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an indicator of disease severity and future disability. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) used in combination appear to be more effective than monotherapies at reducing the rate of progressive joint damage during randomized controlled trials. In clinical practice, however, combination DMARD therapy is still largely reserved for patients who have failed to respond to monotherapy. High dose corticosteroid, when given in early disease with combination DMARD therapy, may continue to ameliorate disease severity and progression for years after discontinuation of the high dose. To date, no DMARD combination has totally arrested joint damage in all patients with early RA. Future randomised controlled trials should always include prospective radiographic data as a primary outcome measure.

### Effects of achieving target measures in rheumatoid arthritis on functional status, quality of life, and resource utilization: analysis of clinical practice data [^116cv9h9]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects 0.5–1.0% of adults in industrialized societies 1. This chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder causes erosive damage to articular cartilage and subchondral bone, with joint swelling, deformity, pain, stiffness, and fatigue. Many patients with RA experience diminished health‐related quality of life (HRQOL) as well as increased disability and comorbidities. Because of related disability, reduced worker productivity, expensive therapy with biologic drugs, institutionalization, joint replacement surgery, and increased use of durable medical equipment (DME), RA is a costly condition, accounting for annual health care expenditures of approximately $128 billion in the US 2, 3, 4.

Box 1
Significance & Innovations

Although there is no cure for RA, treatment with disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic DMARDs (bioDMARDs) has improved health outcomes for RA patients. Increasingly, treatments oriented toward prespecified disease targets are emerging as the prevailing RA management paradigm. This treat‐to‐target approach involves aiming for a prespecified target of disease activity, frequently monitoring disease levels, and titrating medication regimens to goals (where therapies are acceptably tolerated). Such strategies have proved to be more effective than routine care, with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and other studies supporting their value in attenuating RA signs and symptoms, ameliorating functional status, and mitigating or halting radiographic progression 5, 6, 7, 8.

### Rheumatoid arthritis [^113GKZV3]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory joint disease, which can cause cartilage and bone damage as well as disability. Early diagnosis is key to optimal therapeutic success, particularly in patients with well-characterised risk factors for poor outcomes such as high disease activity, presence of autoantibodies, and early joint damage. Treatment algorithms involve measuring disease activity with composite indices, applying a treatment-to-target strategy, and use of conventional, biological, and newz non-biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. After the treatment target of stringent remission (or at least low disease activity) is maintained, dose reduction should be attempted. Although the prospects for most patients are now favourable, many still do not respond to current therapies. Accordingly, new therapies are urgently required. In this Seminar, we describe current insights into genetics and aetiology, pathophysiology, epidemiology, assessment, therapeutic agents, and treatment strategies together with unmet needs of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

### Effects of teriparatide on joint erosions in rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized controlled trial [^115Mmaer]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Articular erosions correlate with disability in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Biologic agents reduce erosion progression in RA, but erosion healing occurs infrequently. This study was undertaken to assess the effects of the anabolic agent teriparatide on joint erosion volume in RA patients treated with a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi).

Methods

We conducted a randomized controlled trial in 24 patients with erosive RA, osteopenia, and disease activity controlled by TNFi treatment for at least 3 months. Half were randomized to receive teriparatide for 1 year and the others constituted a wait-list control group. Subjects and primary rheumatologists were not blinded with regard to treatment assignment, but all outcomes were assessed in a blinded manner. The primary outcome measure was change in erosion volume determined by computed tomography at 6 anatomic sites. Significance within each hand and anatomic site was based on a 2-tailed test, with P values less than 0.05 considered significant.

Results

Baseline characteristics of the treatment groups were well balanced. After 52 weeks, the median change in erosion volume in the teriparatide group was -0.4 mm³ (interquartile range [IQR] -34.5, 29.6) and did not differ significantly from that in controls (median change +9.1 mm³ [IQR -29.6, 26.4]) (P = 0.28). No significant difference in change in erosion volume was noted at the radius, ulna, or metacarpophalangeal joints. Bone mineral density improved at the femoral neck and lumbar spine in the teriparatide group.

Conclusion

Our findings indicate that teriparatide treatment for 1 year does not significantly reduce erosion volume in the hands or wrists of patients with established RA with disease activity controlled by TNFi treatment.

### Repair of joint damage in patients with rheumatoid arthritis does not relate to previous suppression of inflammation: a subanalysis after 8 years Treat-to-target in the BeSt-trial [^1151EgVW]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with (progression of) joint damage in the form of bone erosions and damage to cartilage, visible on radiographs as joint space narrowing (JSN). Progressive damage is associated with irreversible loss of functional ability. Suppression of inflammation is associated with arresting damage progression. In small numbers of patients with RA, joint damage repair has been described, in particular of erosions, primarily in joints where persistent suppression of inflammation was achieved.

In RA, repair in the form of regression of JSN, suggestive of cartilage repair, has not been previously described, and damage to cartilage is generally seen as irreversible. However, in osteoarthritic knees, under the right circumstances, restoration of cartilage may occur. Due to improved treatment options in RA, profound suppression of inflammation is becoming more common. We hypothesised that in patients with RA with previous damage where subsequently disease activity is sufficiently suppressed, repair of erosions as well as cartilage damage may be seen.

In the current study, we investigated the occurrence of and potential predictors for repair of joint damage in the BeSt cohort (Dutch acronym for Treatment Strategies, 'BehandelStrategieën'). In this cohort of patients with severe early RA, high percentages of patients over time achieved low disease activity and remission.

### Combination therapy in early rheumatoid arthritis [^116BmN4f]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

The course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is determined early and the goals in early RA are to prevent radiologic joint degradation and to achieve optimal clinical and biological remission. Achieving these goals means that many RA patients may be candidates for combination disease-modifying therapy. We review data from randomized clinical trials regarding the impact of these treatment strategies as the initial therapy in early RA. It appears likely that the place of combination therapy will increase in the coming decades, even in very early RA patients, where the ultimate goal is persistent remission.

### Structural integrity versus radiographic progression in rheumatoid arthritis [^1144MBtQ]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

From inflammation to joint damage

The key role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in erosion and JSN formation supports the RA general paradigm that inflammation leads to structural damage. This concept has been demonstrated at both systemic and local levels by several reports. In a study conducted on 359 patients with RA, the persistence of systemic inflammation, expressed as the time-integrated C reactive protein (CRP) level, was able to predict both the progression of damage in already involved joints and the radiographic involvement of previously undamaged joints. Moreover, data coming from the COBRA trial showed that local inflammation of an individual joint (expressed as swelling and tenderness scores) both at baseline and maintained during the 1-year follow-up period is a strong predictive factor of damage progression in that joint.

Local inflammation has to be intended as both synovitis and osteitis (bone marrow as observed on MRI). It is still unclear whether subcortical bone involvement occurs as a consequence of cortical bone breaching which allows synovial access to the bone marrow, or whether osteitis necessarily or independently precedes erosion. Anyway, it is conceivable that the RA prearticular phase begins in the bone marrow and subsequently involves the synovial membrane.

An indirect evidence of the role of inflammation in damage progression is that suppression of inflammatory activity results in a decreased progression of both erosions and JSN. This effect has been clearly established for synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (sDMARDs) such as MTX, and biological DMARDs such as TNFα inhibitors (TNFi), abatacept, rituximab and tocilizumab. On the basis of this concept, the treat-to-target strategy for the management of RA indicated the abrogation of inflammation, identified in clinical remission or at least low disease activity (LDA), as the crucial step in preventing structural damage. Indeed, several clinical trials confirmed that the application of treat-to-target and tight control strategies leads to better radiographic outcomes. In the FIN-RACo trial, radiographic progression during an 11-year follow-up period was significantly lower in patients who achieved a clinical remission at 1 year compared with patients who did not. Similarly, the radiographic progression in patients with early RA treated with adalimumab during the second year of the PREMIER trial was strictly related to the additional time in remission during the first year, being the lowest for patients who maintained remission for at least 9 months, and the highest for those who maintained remission for only 3 months.

### Rheumatoid arthritis [^115cubmP]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic, inflammatory, autoimmune disorder. Enhanced understanding of molecular pathogenesis has enabled development of innovative biological agents that target specific parts of the immune system. These treatments have changed the course and face of rheumatoid arthritis and outcomes for patients and society. New knowledge has emerged of how environmental factors interact with susceptibility genes and the immune system in the pathogenesis of a major subset of rheumatoid arthritis. Research undertaken on the longitudinal disease process and molecular pathology of joint inflammation has led to new therapeutic strategies that promote early use of disease-modifying drugs with tight disease control and distinct and quantifiable treatment goals. Today, such approaches can halt most cases of joint destruction but not all instances of joint inflammation and comorbidity. Understanding the cause and pathogenesis of different rheumatoid arthritis subsets will lead not only to individualised treatments during early phases of the illness but also, possibly, to disease prevention.

### Effects of rheumatoid arthritis on bone [^111aVFEe]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

The effects of rheumatoid arthritis on bone include structural joint damage (erosions) and osteoporosis. The latter may lead to increased risk for fractures, which are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Osteoporosis in rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by a complexity of risk factors, including primary osteoporosis risk factors in addition to inflammation, immobilization, and use of corticosteroids. Quantitative assessment of periarticular and generalized bone loss in rheumatoid arthritis may be reliable indicators of future disease course and potential response variables in intervention studies. The osteoclast cell in rheumatoid arthritis plays a crucial role in the development of erosions and periarticular and generalized osteoporosis, suggested to be mediated through the osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of Nuclear Factor (NF)-kappabeta/receptor activator of NF-kappabeta ligand signaling system. Based on an improved understanding of this biology, new treatment opportunities exist.

### Advances in CTLA-4-Ig-mediated modulation of inflammatory cell and immune response activation in rheumatoid arthritis [^116GRbFm]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multifactorial and polygenic immune-mediated disease, the pathogenesis of which involves different cell types. T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and osteoclasts have all been implicated in mediating the production of autoantibodies, proinflammatory cytokines and ultimately bone erosions. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 immunoglobulin fusion protein (CTLA-4-Ig, abatacept) is a unique biologic agent targeting the co-stimulatory molecules CD80/CD86, and is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe RA in patients who have had an inadequate response to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, including methotrexate or anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. There is a growing body of evidence that, through selective modulation of the CD80/CD86 co-stimulatory molecules expressed by a variety of activated cell types, CTLA-4-Ig may inhibit the pathogenic RA process at several levels, both directly and indirectly. Here, we provide an overview of recent mechanistic studies of the action of CTLA-4-Ig on different cell types involved in mediating inflammation and joint damage in RA.

### Rheumatoid arthritis [^114VXee4]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic inflammatory disorder that mainly affects the diarthrodial joint. It is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, and has a substantial societal effect in terms of cost, disability, and lost productivity. Although the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis remains incompletely understood, much insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved has been gained in the past decade. On the basis of these insights, new therapies have been developed, and clinical trials have shown the efficacy of aggressive treatment of patients with active disease. In this review, we discuss improvements in our understanding of the pathophysiology of inflammatory synovitis in rheumatoid arthritis, and improvements in therapy for patients with the disorder. The past decade has seen substantial advances in these areas. Future studies will be directed at improving methods for early diagnosis and identification of patients with progressive disease, and at improving methods to identify candidates for subclasses of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Long-term safety and efficacy data for the new DMARD agents and combination regimens will also further delineate efficacy and toxicity and thus the appropriate clinical context for use of these therapeutic approaches. The continuing elucidation of pathophysiological pathways relevant in rheumatoid arthritis, coupled with continuing advances in biotechnology and rational drug design, offer substantial hope for the continued development of increasingly potent and specific pharmacotherapy for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

### Abatacept in combination with methotrexate in Japanese biologic-naive patients with active rheumatoid arthritis: a randomised placebo-controlled phase IV study [^113BfqUs]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease characterised by synovitis leading to progressive joint damage and subsequent impaired physical function and which requires long-term management. Poor prognostic factors (PPFs) for RA include the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anticitrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) or early erosions. The addition of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) or targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) to treatment with conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) is recommended for patients with PPFs who responded inadequately to previous csDMARDs.

Abatacept is a human fusion protein that selectively modulates the CD28–CD80/CD86 co-stimulatory signal required for full T-cell activation. In Japan, abatacept was approved in 2010 for the treatment of patients with RA who had an inadequate response to previous csDMARDs. To investigate safety and clinical efficacy, phase II and III studies of abatacept in Japanese patients with RA were conducted. However, none of these studies investigated efficacy on joint protection or focused on those patients with PPFs. Previous studies have demonstrated that a high proportion of Japanese patients with RA are ACPA positive (79.2%–86.6%); thus, efficacy and safety of bDMARDs or tsDMARDs with concomitant use of methotrexate (MTX) are of interest in this patient population.

In this study, the efficacy and safety of abatacept with concomitant use of MTX were investigated in a randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled phase IV trial in biologic-naive, ACPA-positive patients with active RA and early erosion.

### Targeting synovial fibroblast proliferation in rheumatoid arthritis (TRAFIC): an open-label, dose-finding, phase 1b trial [^111oCKFm]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic, painful inflammation, synovial hypertrophy, and associated structural and functional deterioration of peripheral joints are hallmarks of rheumatoid arthritis. They account for the considerable burden of disability, work instability, and mortality posed by a disease with a global prevalence approaching 20 million. Recent years have seen a revolution in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, reflecting both a recognition that timely and sustained suppression of inflammation improves outcomes and a growing array of available therapies that target immune cells or cytokine signalling. Such drugs show a similar pattern of efficacy, including ceiling effects, irrespective of their target. Non-response is observed in a third of recipients, and true remission — the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of active rheumatoid arthritis — is uncommon. Furthermore, some patients with refractory disease have clinically synovitic joint swelling but only grey-scale changes on musculoskeletal ultrasonography without Doppler activity, implying a non-inflammatory pathogenesis to their synovitis. Emerging insights into the molecular events underpinning rheumatoid arthritis increasingly highlight the stromal compartment — specifically, synovial fibroblasts — as crucial drivers of chronicity that have yet to be directly or explicitly targeted in clinical practice. Early in the natural history of the disease, synovial fibroblasts adopt hyperplastic, proliferative phenotypes that perpetuate chronic inflammation or mediate the destruction of cartilage and bone. Conceivably, synovial fibroblast biology could underpin grey-scale synovitis, as well as the ceiling effects of current targeted therapies. Approaches that modulate synovial fibroblast pathobiology might therefore be required to synergise with current immunomodulatory strategies to reliably induce sustained remission in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

INTRODUCTION

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease characterised by persistent synovitis, systemic inflammation and joint destruction. Although the exact aetiology of RA remains unknown, the development of biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) for RA has markedly improved treatment outcomes. Despite the advantages of these agents, the percentage of patients with RA treated with these drugs was reported to be only 20–30% in Japan. The main reasons for these low percentages include: (1) not all patients respond to current bDMARDs; (2) some patients experience loss of drug efficacy; (3) risk of serious adverse drug reactions, including immunosuppression and infections and (4) high treatment cost.

In joints affected by RA, osteoclasts play a critical role in the inflammatory response that causes bone erosion. Dysregulation of the bone remodelling process — normally regulated by osteoblasts — results in excessive activation and maturation of osteoclasts. Activation of osteoclast precursors is mediated via the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), a key mediator of osteoclast formation, differentiation and survival.

It has been reported that patients with increased inflammation are likely to present more marked joint destruction. However, in some cases, joint destruction progresses even without marked inflammation. For such patients, denosumab is expected to have a suppressive effect on the progression of joint destruction.

Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody (IgG2 subclass) that inhibits bone resorption by inhibiting RANKL, has been proven to prevent the progression of joint destruction, although it has no effect on cartilage and does not improve RA disease activity. Given the prohibitive high financial cost of existing biological products, denosumab has the added advantage of a lower cost of treatment compared with these existing biological products.

Previous phase II (DRIVE)and phase III (DESIRABLE)studies demonstrated that denosumab reduced the progression of joint destruction in Japanese patients with RA. Identifying the patient subpopulation in which denosumab is most effective is important in the clinical setting. For bDMARDs, the impacts of baseline swollen joint count (SJC), tender joint count (TJC), C reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies have previously been evaluated, and clear prognostic factors have been established. However, there are no reports on the effects of baseline characteristics on the efficacy of denosumab; there are only preliminary results of the DRIVE study.

### ACR / EULAR 2010 rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria [^111GmfGE]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of RA over the past two decades, particularly the identification of cytokines that promote synovial inflammation (e.g. TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6), have led to treatment courses that affect the disease process itself, beyond alleviation of symptoms. In turn, emphasis has shifted to intervention early enough in the disease course to prevent the joint destruction that follows inflammation. Accordingly, in 2010 the ACR and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) put forward revised classification criteria emphasizing RA characteristics that emerge early in the disease course, including ACPAs, a biomarker that predicts aggressive disease. These were in contrast with the 1987 ARA criteria, which distinguished established RA patients from those with other forms of arthritis, and identified patients with later disease. The categories of the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria are grouped into four classifications, with point scores for each: joint symptoms; serology (including RF and/or ACPA); symptom duration, whether < 6 weeks or > 6 weeks; and acute-phase reactants (CRP and/or ESR). The criteria were developed in a three-phase process, beginning with an analysis of patient cohorts to determine what disease characteristics had persuaded clinicians to initiate MTX therapy, followed by consensus-based decisions and the creation of a scoring system that would predict which patients would go on to develop persistent and/or erosive disease.

### Targeting lymphatic function as a novel therapeutic intervention for rheumatoid arthritis [^114anero]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Although clinical outcomes for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have greatly improved with the use of biologic and conventional DMARDs, approximately 40% of patients do not achieve primary clinical outcomes in randomized trials, and only a small proportion achieve lasting remission. Over the past decade, studies in murine models point to the critical role of the lymphatic system in the pathogenesis and therapy of inflammatory-erosive arthritis, presumably by the removal of catabolic factors, cytokines and inflammatory cells from the inflamed synovium. Murine studies demonstrate that lymphatic drainage increases at the onset of inflammatory-erosive arthritis but, as inflammation progresses to a more chronic phase, lymphatic clearance declines and both structural and cellular changes are observed in the draining lymph node. Specifically, chronic damage to the lymphatic vessel from persistent inflammation results in loss of lymphatic vessel contraction followed by lymph node collapse, reduced lymphatic drainage, and ultimately severe synovitis and joint erosion. Notably, clinical pilot studies in patients with RA report lymph node changes following treatment, and thus draining lymphatic vessels and nodes could represent a potential biomarker of arthritis activity and response to therapy. Most importantly, targeting lymphatics represents an innovative strategy for therapeutic intervention for RA.

### Treatment of collagen induced arthritis by proteolytic enzymes: immunomodulatory and disease modifying effects [^115sfEQQ]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy of a novel therapy (proteases) in an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis, and to investigate the mechanisms of arthritogenesis.

Methods

We induced progressive arthritis in male DBA/1 mice by immunization and boosting with Type II collagen; groups of mice were treated orally twice daily with either ibuprofen or proteases, or were left untreated. After 2 weeks, joints were scored for clinical, radiographic, and histologic changes. In addition, we measured serum levels of IgG anti-collagen II, the glycosylation of circulating total and anti-collagen II IgG, and cytokine production by lymphocytes isolated from lymph nodes.

Results

Amelioration of joint inflammation, and accentuation of a prototypical Th2 cytokine (interleukin 5) were similar in the ibuprofen and protease treatment groups. However, protease treatment protects and preserves articular cartilage, normalizes the sialylation of IgG and anti-collagen antibody, and fully restores Th1 (interferon-gamma) synthesis, distinct from ibuprofen.

Conclusion

Protease therapy has antiinflammatory efficacy in the early (inflammatory) phase of collagen induced arthritis, similar to ibuprofen. The immunomodulatory effects of proteases, not seen with ibuprofen, may underlie a correction of aberrant IgG glycosylation and/or contribute to the increased capacity of protease to delay or forestall erosive and destructive arthritis or ankylosis. Similar effects may apply to spontaneous RA in humans.

### Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: the earlier the better to prevent joint damage [^112nf5UE]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The treatment strategy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has undergone major changes in the past decades. The introduction of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and targeted biologic-DMARDs (bDMARDs) has broadened the therapeutic possibilities, making clinical and radiographic remission an achievable goal. The increasing awareness of the prognostic impact of treating disease to target (T2T), adjusting therapy according to disease activity, has further optimised the outcomes. The evidence from trials using early intensive DMARD strategies introduced the concept of 'window of opportunity' and gave rise to early RA (ERA) clinics, supported by the long-term remission, as well as functional, radiographic and prognostic outcomes of starting treatment early.

### Possibilities for personalised medicine in rheumatoid arthritis: hype or hope [^111o4tMD]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Modern management of RA

The following three principles are the foundation of the modern management of RA: (1) early recognition of the disease, (2) early initiation of intensive therapy and (3) a treat-to-target approach. Within this approach, rheumatologists should strive for clinical remission, or low disease activity when remission is not achievable. Early recognition and initiation of intensive therapy prevents disease progression and joint destruction. If remission is not achieved, treatment will be intensified until the treatment goal is reached, also known as treat-to-target, which has shown to improve short-term and long-term outcomes.

Abovementioned gained knowledge has led to current EULAR and American College of Rheumatology recommendations that advise to start with methotrexate in combination with glucocorticoids as first-line treatment. If there is an inadequate response to the initial treatment, the absence or presence of poor prognostic factors determine second-line treatment. If poor prognostic factors are present, a biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD or tsDMARD) should be started, usually a TNFi, while another (or a combination of) conventional synthetic (cs)DMARDs should be started if they are absent. These poor prognostic factors include the presence of autoantibodies (anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and/or rheumatoid factor (RF)), high disease activity, erosive disease and an inadequate response to ≥ 2 csDMARDs. The choice of second-line treatment based on poor prognostic factors could be regarded as a first step to personalised treatment although evidence supporting this treatment strategy compared with current routine care is limited.

### One year in review 2019: novelties in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^1168Ai1j]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The current treatment approach in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) follows a stepwise management, starting from early introduction of conventional synthetic (cs) disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), moving to biological (b) DMARDs and targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs. In the last few years, new drugs with different mechanisms of action have demonstrated their efficacy in treating such a disabling condition, and their approval, along with other more "experienced" treatments, has established their effectiveness on disease activity, damage accrual prevention, patients' quality of life improvement, confirming their safety profile. Moreover, new molecular pathways are under investigation as potential targets of new advanced therapies. Clinicians' capability of stratifying treatment strategies and decisions has improved, with several new tools for the optimisation of long-term management of RA; however, a high proportion of patients are refractory to the available drugs. Finally, as RA is a systemic disease, the knowledge in multi-systemic complications of the disease has grown, as well as the possibility in improving extra-articular manifestations of the disease, although certain drugs have potentially relevant non-articular effects, which need to be monitored. This narrative review summarises the most relevant studies published over the last year in the field of treatment of RA, with the major aim to let clinicians and researchers reflect on "what is new", "what is effective" and "what is safe".

### Efficacy and safety of filgotinib in methotrexate-naive patients with rheumatoid arthritis with poor prognostic factors: post hoc analysis of FINCH 3 [^112hoxga]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 2019 EULAR guidelines for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) recommend methotrexate (MTX) in combination with short-term glucocorticoids, unless contraindicated, as the first treatment strategy on diagnosis of RA. According to the treat-to-target strategy, treatment should be adjusted for patients who do not achieve 50% improvement after approximately 3 months, as they are unlikely to achieve desired treatment targets of remission or low disease activity within 6 months. The choice of second-line treatment is stratified by the presence of poor prognostic factors (PPFs) associated with rapid disease progression, including elevated acute-phase reactant levels; high swollen joint count; seropositivity — especially with high titres — for rheumatoid factor (RF) or anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies; presence of early erosions; and persistent moderate or high disease activity. Treatment escalation to biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) or targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD) therapy is recommended for patients who present with any of these PPFs and do not achieve their treatment target; in patients without these factors, another conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) strategy could be considered after first-line treatment failure.

The EULAR guidelines acknowledge evidence supporting this strategy is limited, and the research agenda put forward in this EULAR-endorsed document includes treatment outcomes in patients with and without PPFs. Furthermore, although these PPFs historically predict radiographic progression of joint damage in patients treated with csDMARDs or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, data are relatively sparse regarding their effect on radiographic outcomes and physical function following first-line treatment with non-TNF bDMARDs or tsDMARDs such as Janus-associated kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Data are needed on efficacy of bDMARDs or tsDMARDs versus csDMARDs for clinical and radiographic outcomes in patients with PPFs.

Filgotinib is a once-daily oral, JAK1-preferential inhibitor with demonstrated efficacy and a favourable safety profile in adults with moderately to severely active RA. The phase III, randomised, active-controlled FINCH 3 trial (NCT02886728), which evaluated filgotinib efficacy and safety in MTX-naive patients with RA, included patients with at least one marker or risk factor for rapidly progressive disease. Here, we assessed filgotinib efficacy and safety in the subgroup of patients with all of four PPFs present at baseline.

### Recent advances in the management of psoriatic arthritis [^1163pF4y]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The incidence of psoriatic arthritis is currently estimated at 7 to 42% of the population with active psoriasis, considered to affect 2 to 3% of the general population. Unmanaged psoriatic arthritis may result in progressive radiologic erosion, severe physical limitations, and disability. Newer trials in psoriatic arthritis therapy demonstrate ongoing ability to control disease symptoms and signs and the progression of the disease significantly.

Recent Findings

Recognition of the immunopathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis, as with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, prompts ongoing examination of the efficacy of several disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. A new crop of biologics and pharmaceuticals with increased molecular specificity compared with traditional immunosuppressant disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs have been shown to be highly effective in inhibiting the symptoms and progression of psoriatic arthritis with less severe side effects.

Summary

Therapies either recently approved or pending approval by the Food and Drug Administration for psoriatic arthritis management are safe and effective in the treatment of symptoms, significantly improve quality of life, and prevent long-term progression of the disease.

### The new European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis: how are they performing? [^113PGXe6]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This era of early aggressive treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) calls for criteria that allow timely classification of patients at risk of persistent erosive disease. We review how the new American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria meet up to this challenge.

Recent Findings

The new 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA were developed using initiation of methotrexate as anchor in a population with undifferentiated arthritis. Many studies from different countries have now been published that have addressed the performances of these new criteria.

Summary

The goal of earlier classification of RA seems to be met with the new criteria, but exclusion of other diagnoses is essential. Increased sensitivity comes at the price of loss of specificity and indiscriminate use of these classification criteria as a diagnostic tool carries the risk of overtreatment.

### Novel treatment strategies in rheumatoid arthritis [^115JT95N]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

New treatment strategies have substantially changed the course of rheumatoid arthritis. Many patients can achieve remission if the disease is recognised early and is treated promptly and continuously; however, some individuals do not respond adequately to treatment. Rapid diagnosis and a treat-to-target approach with tight monitoring and control, can increase the likelihood of remission in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In this Series paper, we describe new insights into the management of rheumatoid arthritis with targeted therapy approaches using classic and novel medications, and outline the potential effects of precision medicine in this challenging disease. Articles are included that investigate the treat-to-target approach, which includes adding or de-escalating treatment. Rheumatoid arthritis treatment is impeded by delayed diagnosis, problematic access to specialists, and difficulties adhering to treat-to-target principles. Clinical management goals in rheumatoid arthritis include enabling rapid access to optimum diagnosis and care and the well informed use of multiple treatments approved for this disease.

### Innovative treatment strategies for patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^116GyrF3]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present review provides an update on novel treatment strategies striving for remission in patients with recent onset of rheumatoid arthritis.

Recent Findings

As early treatment is crucial to achieve optimal results, identifying patients with rheumatoid arthritis early is imperative to achieve clinical remission. Patients with early arthritis who will progress to rheumatoid arthritis can be identified, and treating these patients can postpone the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and retard the progression of structural damage. The best way to achieve remission is by adjusting treatments at regular intervals using predetermined response criteria. Specific treatments to rapidly induce remission include disease modifying antirheumatic drugs combinations, especially combined with glucocorticoids or tumor necrosis factor antagonists. The prediction of joint damage progression, or the response to specific drugs is not yet accurately possible. The early institution of tumor necrosis factor antagonists followed by discontinuation leads to sustained clinical benefit.

Summary

Early treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis with strategies aiming at remission results in the best outcomes. Until the prediction of a severe disease course and treatment response becomes possible, a promising strategy would be to rapidly induce remission using an effective combination of drugs followed by tapering and discontinuation. Tumor necrosis factor antagonists have proven to be highly effective in this approach.

### Immune hallmarks of rheumatoid arthritis management: a brief review [^114tL3Vn]. Cytokine (2022). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this review was to examine current evidence on immunomodulation mediated by conventional drugs and the use of novel biological agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Currently, treatment is focused on maximizing quality of life through sustained clinical remission and/or attenuating disease activity. To do so, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, especially methotrexate, are used alone or in combination with other drugs, including leflunomide, biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (tsDMARDs). The most recent strategies modulate the immune response of the individual RA patient using tsDMARDs such as JAK inhibitors and bDMARDs such as ig-CTLA-4, anti- IL6R, anti-TNF-α and anti-CD20. To better understand current immunopharmacological interventions, we also looked at documented mechanisms of RA-mediated immunomodulation, highlighting perspectives potentially boosting RA treatment.

### HIF1 α inhibition facilitates leflunomide-AHR-CRP signaling to attenuate bone erosion in CRP-aberrant rheumatoid arthritis [^116ZAPFu]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory synovial hyperplasia, stiffness, progressive bone erosion and systemic features. Progressive bone erosion is a prominent determinant of functional impairment of joints in RA. Currently, a range of treatment options including conventional and biologic antirheumatic drugs are available. However, none of them is universally effective. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the non-responses of these drugs will provide new insight into development of precision medicine-based therapeutic strategy for RA.

During RA development, multiple immune cells and cytokines are organized within a hierarchical regulatory network that favors osteoclast-mediated bone erosion. Leflunomide has been widely used in RA treatment and the well-known mechanism is immunomodulation via its metabolite A77 1726. Briefly, Leflunomide is converted to A77 1726 in intestinal wall and liver after oral administration. A77 1726 inhibits mitochondrial dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) required for proliferation of immune cells, resulting in attenuation of inflammation-induced bone erosion. However, only 40–50% RA patients receiving Leflunomide meet 20% reduction in disease activity according to American College of Rheumatology response criteria.

In this study, we classified RA patients treated with Leflunomide based on presence of progressive bone erosion (PBE-positive, PBE+) or not (PBE-negative, PBE−). Interestingly, Leflunomide significantly inhibited inflammation in both PBE− and PBE+ patients, suggesting the limited efficacy of Leflunomide in attenuating bone erosion in PBE+ patients were not coupled with its immunomodulatory action. The PBE+ patients had higher serum C-reactive protein (CRP Higher, CRP H), whereas the PBE- patients showed relatively lower serum CRP (CRP Lower, CRP L). Studies have demonstrated that CRP of hepatic origin is involved in osteoclastogenesis. We found that high CRP in CRP H patients was positively correlated with increased bone resorption. Data from collagen-induced-arthritis (CIA) animal models was consistent with the above findings from RA patients.

### Dose reduction and discontinuation of conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for people with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis in remission or low disease activity [^111nF1fi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis are both chronic forms of inflammatory arthritis, typically characterised by swollen, stiff, and painful joints and, in some cases, systemic involvement. However, there are key differences between these conditions in terms of disease pathogenesis and clinical and radiographic features. Although there is no cure for either condition, treatments are available that can suppress the disease and prevent its progression leading to improved joint pain, stiffness, and function, and improved long‐term outcomes.

Description of the condition

### Effects of glucocorticoids on radiological progression in rheumatoid arthritis [^113dBnfM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Glucocorticoid use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is widespread. Two Cochrane Reviews have been published examining the short term clinical benefit of low dose glucocorticoids compared to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and demonstrate good short term and medium term clinical benefits. The possibility that glucocorticoids may have a fundamental 'disease modifying' effect in RA, which would be seen by a reduction in the rate of radiological progression, has been raised by several authors.

Objectives

To perform a systematic review of studies evaluating glucocorticoid efficacy in inhibiting the progression of radiological damage in rheumatoid arthritis.

Search Strategy

A search of MEDLINE (from 1966 to 22 February 2005) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was undertaken, using the terms 'corticosteroids' and 'rheumatoid arthritis' expanded according to the Cochrane Collaboration recommendations. Identified abstracts were reviewed and appropriate reports obtained in full. Additional reports were identified from the reference lists and from expert knowledge.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled or cross-over trials in adults with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis in which prednisone or a similar glucocorticoid preparation was compared to either placebo controls or active controls (i.e. comparative studies) and where there was evaluation of radiographs of hands, or hands and feet, or feet by any standardised technique. Eligible studies had at least one treatment arm with glucocorticoids and one without glucocorticoids.

Data Collection and Analysis

Standardised data extraction obtain the mean and standard deviation (SD) of change in erosion scores over 1 year or 2 years. (Where SD for change was not given a conservative estimate was taken from baseline data.) At least two authors selected the studies and extracted the data. Radiographic erosion scores were expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score for the method used. The results were pooled after weighting in a random effects model to provide a standardised mean difference (SMD).

Main Results

The initial search produced 217 citations, and 15 were added from experts, abstracts and review of reference lists. Authors of 4 trials being prepared for publication (and subsequently published) kindly shared their data. After application of eligibility criteria 15 studies and 1,414 patients were included. The majority of trials studied early RA (disease duration up to 2 yrs), and the mean cumulative dose of glucocorticoid was 2,300 mg prednisone equivalent (range 270 mg - 5,800 mg) over the first year. Glucocorticoids were mostly added to other disease modifying anti-rheumatoid drug (DMARD) treatment. The standardised mean difference in progression was 0.40 in favour of glucocorticoids (95% CI 0.27, 0.54). In studies lasting 2 years (806 patients included), the standardised mean difference in progression in favour of glucocorticoids at 1 year was 0.45 (0.24, 0.66) and at 2 years was 0.42 (0.30, 0.55). All studies except one showed a numerical treatment effect in favour of glucocorticoids. The beneficial effects of glucocorticoids were generally achieved when used in conjunction with other DMARD treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Even in the most conservative estimate, the evidence that glucocorticoids given in addition to standard therapy can substantially reduce the rate of erosion progression in rheumatoid arthritis is convincing. There remains concern about potential long-term adverse reactions to glucocorticoid therapy, such as increased cardiovascular risk, and this issue requires further research.

### Short-term glucocorticoids reduce risk of chronic NSAID and analgesic use in early methotrexate-treated rheumatoid arthritis patients with favourable prognosis: subanalysis of the careRA randomised controlled trial [^113aGiwe]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early, intensive, treat-to-target strategies have improved the clinical outcomes for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, there is evidence that even achieving the target of remission is sometimes insufficient to normalise patients' quality of life and persistent complaints such as pain remain a challenge. Despite European guidelines recommending as first treatment strategy the initiation of disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) such as methotrexate (MTX) with a short-term glucocorticoid (GC) course, it is debated if this intensive approach is also necessary in patients lacking classical markers of poor prognosis. In the Care in early RA (CareRA) trial, we demonstrated that also in patients without erosions, seronegative or with low disease activity, the speed of response was more rapid when treated with MTX plus a step-down-bridge GC scheme compared with MTX therapy without GC, while long-term treat-to-target results were comparable. However, the potential advantage of intensive therapy on patient important outcomes such as pain and the concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and analgesics deserves more detailed study in relation to the clinical response to a treat-to-target approach, taking into account the cumulative need but also the evolution over time.

Therefore, we aim to compare both the extent and dynamics of analgesic use in patients with early RA considered to have a favourable prognosis and treated to target with or without initial GC bridging during the first 2 years in the CareRA trial.

### Sarilumab and nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and inadequate response or intolerance to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors [^1167VHaF]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Conventional synthetic disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the core treatment regimen for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 1, 2. Biologic agents, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, are indicated for RA management in patients who have an insufficient response to methotrexate (MTX) and/or other conventional synthetic DMARDs 1, 2. However, an estimated 12–30% of patients receiving anti‐TNF therapy discontinue treatment due to lack of efficacy or intolerance 3, 4. Subsequent treatment with other biologic DMARDs may not result in an optimal response in all of these patients, which makes effective treatment in this population challenging 5. In those patients with an inadequate response, recommendations from the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) suggest that switching from 1 class of biologic DMARDs to another with a different mechanism of action may provide better clinical benefit 1, 2. As a result, alternative therapies that effectively reduce RA disease activity are needed for these patients.

Interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) is a pleiotropic cytokine with functions related to immune regulation, B cell and T cell development, and chronic inflammation 6. Expression of IL‐6 is increased in several inflammatory disorders, and IL‐6 blockade reverses signs of systemic inflammation, including fever and increased production of acute‐phase proteins 6, 7. IL‐6 has been identified in the pathophysiology of RA 6, 8, 9, and IL‐6 expression has been shown to be elevated in the serum and synovial fluid of patients with RA 10, 11, 12. Additionally, attenuation of IL‐6 signaling reduces osteoclast formation and bone erosion, both of which are characteristic features of RA 13, 14. Tocilizumab, a humanized inhibitor of IL‐6 receptor (IL‐6R) activity, administered as monotherapy or combined with MTX or other conventional synthetic DMARDs, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with moderate‐to‐severe RA 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Sarilumab is an investigational human monoclonal antibody directed against IL‐6R that has been studied in phase IIb−III clinical trials 20, 21. In the phase III, 24‐week TARGET study, the efficacy and safety of sarilumab in combination with conventional synthetic DMARDs was evaluated in patients with active moderate‐to‐severe RA who had a previous inadequate response to or intolerance to anti‐TNF therapies.

### Radiographic outcome in hispanic early rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs [^116quQKE]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine rates of incident erosive disease in early rheumatoid arthritis patients, to identify baseline predictors and to evaluate erosion's impact on patient-reported outcomes.

Methods

82 patients with ≤ 12 months of disease duration, ≥ 3 years of follow-up and conventional treatment were included. Consecutive evaluations assessed swollen and tender joint counts, treatment and comorbidity, acute reactant-phase determinations and patient-reported outcomes. Digitized radiographs of the hands and feet were obtained at baseline and yearly thereafter. RA was defined as erosive when at least one unequivocal cortical bone defect was detected. Descriptive statistics and Cox regression analysis were performed.

Results

At baseline, 71 of the patients were ♀, population median (range) age was of 38.7 (16–78.2) years, 58 patients had antibodies and all the patients had active disease and substantial disability. Follow-up cohort was of 299.3 person-years. At last follow-up (49 ± 13.8 months), 28 patients developed erosions. Erosion's location was the feet, in 12 patients. Incident rates of erosive disease at one, two, three and four years were of 8.1, 12.8, 13.8 and 5.6 per 100 person-years, respectively. Higher C-reactive protein (HR: 1.20, 95%CI: 1.04–1.4, p = 0.01) and positive antibodies (HR: 5.09, 95%CI: 1.08–23.86, p = 0.04) were baseline predictors of incident erosive disease. Erosions had minor impact on patient-reported outcomes.

Conclusion

Rheumatoid arthritis patients with antibodies and higher C reactive protein at baseline are at risk for incident erosions which appear most frequently at the feet. Up to 1/3 patients conventionally treated develop incident erosions, which minimally impact function.

### Diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis: a review [^115jkF8m]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) occurs in about 5 per 1000 people and can lead to severe joint damage and disability. Significant progress has been made over the past 2 decades regarding understanding of disease pathophysiology, optimal outcome measures, and effective treatment strategies, including the recognition of the importance of diagnosing and treating RA early.

Observations

Early diagnosis and treatment of RA can avert or substantially slow progression of joint damage in up to 90% of patients, thereby preventing irreversible disability. The development of novel instruments to measure disease activity and identify the presence or absence of remission have facilitated new treatment strategies to arrest RA before joints are damaged irreversibly. Outcomes have been improved by recognizing the benefits of early diagnosis and early therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The treatment target is remission or a state of at least low disease activity, which should be attained within 6 months. Methotrexate is first-line therapy and should be prescribed at an optimal dose of 25 mg weekly and in combination with glucocorticoids; 40% to 50% of patients reach remission or at least low disease activity with this regimen. If this treatment fails, sequential application of targeted therapies, such as biologic agents (eg, tumor necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors) or Janus kinase inhibitors in combination with methotrexate, have allowed up to 75% of these patients to reach the treatment target over time. New therapies have been developed in response to new pathogenetic findings. The costs of some therapies are considerable, but these costs are decreasing with the advent of biosimilar drugs (drugs essentially identical to the original biologic drugs but usually available at lower cost).

Conclusions and Relevance

Scientific advances have improved therapies that prevent progression of irreversible joint damage in up to 90% of patients with RA. Early treatment with methotrexate plus glucocorticoids and subsequently with other DMARDs, such as inhibitors of TNF, IL-6, or Janus kinases, improves outcomes and prevents RA-related disability. A treat-to-target strategy aimed at reducing disease activity by at least 50% within 3 months and achieving remission or low disease activity within 6 months, with sequential drug treatment if needed, can prevent RA-related disability.

### Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: state of the art 2009 [^1164iZki]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Few, if any, areas of medical therapeutics have witnessed such dramatic changes as those that have occurred in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) during the past two decades. Improvements in clinical trials methodologies, the introduction of no fewer than nine biologic agents with distinct mechanisms of action, and the development of better strategies for the use of such agents have all contributed to the new age in RA therapeutics. Here, we review these developments and attempt to describe the current landscape of RA therapy in terms of available treatments, agreed-upon principles of RA management, as well as some important controversies in this field. Despite the great pace at which developments are moving, a treatment-free remission for patients with RA remains an elusive goal and unmet medical needs remain. The quest for better therapies for this potentially devastating disease is still as important as ever; research in this exciting area is ongoing, and it is reasonable to hope that, during the next decade, developments will lead to improved, rationally designed, targeted therapies for RA.

### Engineered spirulina platensis for treating rheumatoid arthritis and restoring bone homeostasis [^112CoLao]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by massive intra-articular infiltration of pro-inflammatory macrophages, leading to articular immune dysfunction, severe synovitis, and ultimately joint erosion. Comprehensive remodeling of articular immune homeostasis and bone homeostasis is essential for alleviating RA. Here we report on Spirulina platensis (SP), a natural microorganism commercially farmed worldwide as a food, as an efficient regulator of both synovial inflammation and osteoclast differentiation in male RA mouse models. SP reduces excessive reactive oxygen species and downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines in synovial macrophages. Moreover, SP reprograms pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2-like phenotype, suppressing synovitis and remodeling redox balance. Notably, SP inhibits osteoclast activation effectively and blocks the progression of bone erosion. SP is then engineered with macrophage membranes (SP@M) to enable immune evasion and RA-targeting in vivo. SP@M increases LC3-mediated autophagy as well as strengthens ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation toward KEAP1, which promotes the expression and nuclear translocation of NRF2. The NRF2 further activates antioxidant enzymes to terminate macrophages-initiated pathological cascades and reestablish intra-articular immune homeostasis, conferring a bone recovery and chondroprotective effect in collagen-induced arthritis mouse models. This work shows the therapeutic activity of FDA-approved functional food of SP in suppressing synovial inflammation and osteoclast differentiation, offering an off-the-shelf strategy for RA treatment.

### The new ACR / EULAR classification criteria for RA: how are the new criteria performing in the clinic? [^115bPcKr]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of the 2010 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria for RA was to distinguish patients at high risk for developing persistent erosive and/or inflammatory disease from those with undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis. These criteria were developed for use in clinical trials; in order to implement these criteria most effectively, they need to be validated in real-world settings. The 1987 criteria may have led to underdiagnosis in the case of patients with positive anti-citrullinated peptide antibody values but no evidence of radiographic progression of joint erosion, or overdiagnosis in the case of some patients with FM; similarly, the possibility that the 2010 criteria may result in overdiagnosis cannot be excluded. Prospective validation of the 2010 criteria has been carried out in several cohorts, with reported sensitivities ranging from 0.50 to 0.60 and specificities from 0.88 to 0.97. The sensitivity and specificity of the 2010 criteria were 0.74 and 0.66 when compared against the gold standard of needing MTX therapy in the opinion of experienced clinicians, and 0.69 and 0.72 against the standard of having persistent synovitis despite DMARDs after 1 year. Other comparisons have yielded similar sensitivities and specificities, ranging up to 0.85 for the gold standard of needing MTX therapy. Questions remain concerning the utility of the 2010 criteria for non-arthritis health care practitioners, who may be less than expert in identifying swollen joints and may underestimate the number of joints affected by synovitis. US may be of value in the future, but its role remains to be validated.

### Developing an effective treatment algorithm for rheumatoid arthritis [^1176FJq2]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

RA is defined by the interrelated triad of disease activity, joint damage and disability. Although disease activity and its associated disability are reversible, joint damage and its associated disability are not. Thus, an important goal of RA therapy is to maximally reduce disease activity and thereby mitigate the accumulation of irreversible joint damage. Treatment for patients with RA should be initiated early and aggressively, with frequent assessments and a goal of achieving remission as quickly as possible after treatment initiation. We propose a treatment algorithm that recommends early and aggressive therapy with high-dose MTX therapy (15–25 mg/week), which may include moderate doses of glucocorticoids. The goal is to achieve low disease activity (determined by a composite measure that includes joint counts) within 3–6 months. If low disease activity is not achieved by 6 months, another conventional DMARD or a biologic agent should be added to the treatment regimen or patients should be switched to another DMARD plus a glucocorticoid. Once low disease activity is achieved, the treatment goal for the ensuing 3–6 months becomes disease remission.

### Combination therapy in rheumatoid arthritis [^116cWiGE]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

It has become clear that early suppression of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity is important in preventing progressive joint destruction and functional decline. To achieve this goal, many rheumatologists today advocate a more aggressive approach, using combinations of classic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs-often including methotrexate-or new drugs. During the last 2 years, the combination of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and prednisolone has been demonstrated to be more beneficial than monotherapy in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the superior efficacy of the combination of new tumor necrosis factor-alpha blocking agents plus methotrexate to methotrexate alone in patients with chronic disease is very promising. Most studies of combination therapy focus on the efficacy of a combination compared with monotherapy, rather than on the efficacy of a treatment strategy. Although these studies of combination therapy provide useful information about the possible synergistic action of combinations of drugs, many questions remain unanswered, and studies evaluating different treatment strategies are needed before a new approach can be suggested.

### Approaches and outcomes of adalimumab discontinuation in patients with well-controlled inflammatory arthritis: a systematic search and review [^112nU4yV]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Recapture results reflect reported information only

a recapture was achieved in LDA

b ADA specific indicates the number of patients who specifically tapered adalimumab

Evidence quality was determined using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine: levels of Evidence (2009) guidance

Most medications were tapered by prolonged dosing interval (9/12, of which 3 were RCTs). Dose was decreased in one study, and prolonged intervals and decreased doses were combined in one study, while the 4th RCT abruptly stopped medication. A majority of studies allowed background therapy, commonly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and csDMARDs (Table 2). The 4 RCTs noted flares in 22–85% of participants withdrawing TNFi, although only Landewé et al. reported adalimumab-specific data, with a flare rate of 53% (81/153) following abrupt stop. Flare rates among non-RCTs ranged from 11–100%, although a majority of studies reported flares between 20–47% (Table 2). Notably, in the study with a 100% flare rate, patients were eligible to continue tapering medications until complete discontinuation unless a flare occurred, while the study with the lowest flare rate maintained adalimumab use every 4 weeks.

In the treat-to-target dose reduction RCT by Michielsens et al. 56/81 (69%) patients maintained LDA in the TNFi taper arm (77% adalimumab) compared with 73% (30/41, with 28/41 on adalimumab), who continued medications, demonstrating noninferiority with a mean reduction in the overall TNFi medication dose of 47% in the taper arm. At 12 months, 72% remained tapered, of whom 28% were able to stop TNFi completely.

Another prospective, pragmatic TNFi discontinuation trial from Denmark reported less favorable outcomes, where 33% of patients were able to taper adalimumab, but only 1% in the overall TNFi cohort stopped medication successfully at 2-years. Notably, 50% of flares occurred when the medication dose was reduced more than 50%. A lower physician global assessment (PhGA) score was a predictor of successful tapering, with the suggestion of improved outcomes with lower baseline MRI erosion scores.

The RCT by Gratacós et al. showed a similar risk of flares at one year regardless of disease status; with 23% flares in patients who tapered medication after achieving clinical remission, vs 20% for those who tapered in LDA.

### The autoimmune response as a potential target for tolerance induction before the development of rheumatoid arthritis [^113qTssj]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the synovial joints. Although treatment options and efficacy have increased substantially in the past two decades, the disease cannot be cured or prevented. Therefore, rheumatoid arthritis still has a considerable effect on the quality of life of patients, not only because life-long medication is often required, but also because residual disease activity leads to progressive loss of function in the musculoskeletal system and extra-articular morbidity. Key future goals in the management of rheumatoid arthritis are the ability to induce long-lasting drug-free remission in patients with the disease (ie, to achieve a cure), and to prevent disease before it emerges. To reach these goals, it is pivotal to understand the autoimmune response underlying rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis and to develop ways to permanently silence it (ie, to induce tolerance). For preventive studies, the identification of markers (clinical, immunological, and biological) predictive of future disease is crucial, as prevention of disease will not be feasible without the ability to identify relevant at-risk target populations. In this Series paper, we review the autoimmune response underlying rheumatoid arthritis, how rheumatoid arthritis-specific autoimmunity develops and evolves during the transition from health to disease, and how tolerance studies could be designed to achieve prevention or cure of the disease.

### Rational use of new and existing disease-modifying agents in rheumatoid arthritis [^112iYrB8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Because of radiographic evidence of progressive bone loss and the inability to eliminate synovial proliferation with methotrexate, it became apparent that therapy for rheumatoid arthritis needed further advancement. Methotrexate is not a remission-inducing drug and may have dose-limiting toxicity. In the past 2 years, three new disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been approved: leflunomide, etanercept, and infliximab. Each of these agents has demonstrated efficacy compared with placebo in randomized, controlled studies. Because methotrexate had a dominant therapeutic role, the new drugs were also studied in combination with it. Other established DMARDs, such as sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine, have also demonstrated efficacy when used together with methotrexate. The results of these combination studies clearly demonstrate that clinical responses can be meaningfully improved when new and existing DMARDs are added to methotrexate. Although toxicity remains a serious concern when powerful immune modulators and antimetabolites are used in combination, relatively few serious adverse events have been reported during 2-year treatment periods. It has also become apparent that combinations of new DMARDs and methotrexate virtually halt radiographic progression over 2 years. The new agents are expensive, but annual costs must be weighed against the personal and societal expense of joint arthroplasty, hospitalizations, disability, and diminished quality of life that accompanies poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis. The ultimate value of combination DMARD therapy with methotrexate will be determined by long-term data on safety, efficacy, and effects on radiographic deterioration of bone. Additional long-term observational data on the incidence of joint arthroplasty and disability will help to place the issue of societal costs in a better perspective. This will allow the value of aggressive treatment to be established with certainty.

### Baricitinib, methotrexate, or combination in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and No or limited prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drug treatment [^111sHYik]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Study protocol and oversight

RA‐BEGIN was a 52‐week randomized, double‐blind, double‐dummy, active comparator–controlled study conducted at 198 centers in 18 countries. Patients were randomized 4:3:4 to receive oral MTX monotherapy (administered once weekly), baricitinib monotherapy (4 mg administered once daily), or the combination of baricitinib and MTX. MTX was initiated at 10 mg/week and, if tolerated, increased to 20 mg/week by week 8. A lower dosage regimen was available if clinically indicated (initial dosage of 7.5 mg once weekly and maximum dosage of 12.5 mg once weekly). Randomization was stratified by geographic region and presence or absence of joint erosions on centrally read baseline radiographs. Patients with a screening estimated GFR ≥ 40 and < 60 ml/minute/1.73 m² who were assigned to baricitinib monotherapy or baricitinib plus MTX received baricitinib at 2 mg. Concomitant treatment with stable doses of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, and/or oral corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) was permitted. Baricitinib and placebo to match were supplied as 4‐mg and 2‐mg tablets. Active and placebo MTX were supplied as identical opaque capsules containing excipient with or without commercially available MTX. Folic acid was provided by the sponsor as a noninvestigational product, and all patients were required to take at least 1 mg once daily (or per local standard of care).

Rescue treatment (baricitinib plus MTX) for those patients whose tender and swollen joint counts did not improve by ≥ 20% from baseline was available beginning at week 24. New or increased doses of NSAIDs, analgesics, and oral corticosteroids could also be used after rescue. Patients completing week 52 could enter a long‐term extension study. Patients who did not enter the extension study or who discontinued early were followed up for ∼28 days after their last dose of study drug.

The study was conducted in accordance with ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines and was approved by each center's institutional review board or ethics committee. All patients provided written informed consent. The study was initiated in November 2012 and completed in August 2015, with enrollment occurring between January 2013 and August 2014.

### Amplifying elements of arthritis and joint destruction [^116bxpdj]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterised by chronic joint inflammation and variable degrees of bone and cartilage erosion. Studies in animal models of arthritis provide insight into elements which can amplify destructive features. The presence of immune complexes in the joint makes arthritis more erosive. Although considerable bone erosion still occurs in the absence of FcgammaR triggering by immune complexes, through cytokine-induced RANKL and direct osteoclast activation, cartilage erosion is heavily dependent on the FcgammaR pathway. T cell factors such as IFNgamma and IL17 further amplify erosion through upregulation of the damaging FcgammaRI and stimulation of the influx of granulocytes, respectively. Apart from immune elements, environmental pressure and components of tissue damage contribute through innate pathways. Spontaneous T cell-dependent arthritis in IL1Ra-/- mice is absent under germ-free conditions, and markedly suppressed in TLR4-deficient mice. Moreover, TLR4 blocking with a receptor antagonist suppresses erosive arthritis.

### Rheumatoid arthritis [^113YGn6o]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease that primarily affects the joints and is associated with autoantibodies that target various molecules including modified self-epitopes. The identification of novel autoantibodies has improved diagnostic accuracy, and newly developed classification criteria facilitate the recognition and study of the disease early in its course. New clinical assessment tools are able to better characterize disease activity states, which are correlated with progression of damage and disability, and permit improved follow-up. In addition, better understanding of the pathogenesis of RA through recognition of key cells and cytokines has led to the development of targeted disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Altogether, the improved understanding of the pathogenetic processes involved, rational use of established drugs and development of new drugs and reliable assessment tools have drastically altered the lives of individuals with RA over the past 2 decades. Current strategies strive for early referral, early diagnosis and early start of effective therapy aimed at remission or, at the least, low disease activity, with rapid adaptation of treatment if this target is not reached. This treat-to-target approach prevents progression of joint damage and optimizes physical functioning, work and social participation. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of RA.

### Inhibition of CCL3 abrogated precursor cell fusion and bone erosions in human osteoclast cultures and murine collagen-induced arthritis [^114QLtBu]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

A critical pathological feature of RA is the accumulation of immune cells in joints. Macrophages are one of the first cell types to infiltrate the inflamed synovia. They serve multiple effector functions (e.g. cytokine and chemokine production) and disrupt physiological bone remodelling. Enrichment in macrophage-derived products is a characteristic feature of poor response to anti-rheumatic treatment and higher numbers of circulating monocytes predicted incomplete clinical response to MTX in untreated patients with RA. Therefore, macrophages are good targets for the treatment of RA and such biomarkers can monitor clinical response.

Monocyte recruitment from the blood, their maturation into macrophages and differentiation into osteoclasts are vital in the advancement of RA. These processes are regulated by chemokines [e.g. monocyte chemo-attractant protein 1 (CCL2), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (CCL3) and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (CCL5)]. Such chemokines are induced during osseous inflammation and are readily detected in sera and SF of RA patients with joint erosions. Collectively, these reports justify the potential of CC chemokine blockade for the inhibition of osseous inflammation and bone erosion during RA. Surprisingly few clinical trials have tested chemokine and chemokine receptor antagonism in treatment protocols for RA.

Localized osteolysis of articular bone and more generalized bone loss (osteopenia and osteoporosis) in the axial and appendicular skeleton are adverse characteristics of a more severe RA that is associated with a higher degree of functional disability and increased mortality. Bone resorption was thought to reflect the inflammatory burden in rheumatoid joints but recent evidence suggests the contrary. Biological anti-cytokine treatments (e.g. infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, tocilizumab) revealed that inflammation could be uncoupled from progressive skeletal damage in RA and that bone erosion was not solely attributable to the action of TNF and IL-6. Suppression of bone turnover through inhibition of RANK ligand (RANKL) prevented increase of erosions and had no evidence of an effect on activity measures of RA. Additionally, subclinical inflammation in synovia and tendons registered by MRI could cause erosion progress in absence of clinical signs of RA activity.

### Targeting TNF superfamily members for therapeutic intervention in rheumatoid arthritis [^114rmX3s]. Cytokine (2012). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease is one of the most serious medical problems, affecting ∼1% of all people worldwide, irrespective of race. The disease is autoimmune in nature and characterized by chronic inflammation of the synovial tissues in multiple joints that leads to joint destruction. Although T cells are central players in RA development, B cells are required for full penetrance of disease largely via their production of autoantibodies against Fc domain of IgG rheumatoid factor (RF). Treatment options for RA are limited and if any, are inadequate due to associated side effects. Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily play important roles in a number of autoimmune diseases, including RA. In this review, we briefly summarize key features of the superfamily, we will consider how the well-characterized members concerned with immune regulation are coordinated and their roles in rheumatoid arthritis.

### Tocilizumab monotherapy or combined with methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized clinical trial [^1165uhVd]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the efficacy and safety profile of subcutaneous tocilizumab as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial involving 340 patients, subcutaneous tocilizumab, both as monotherapy and combination therapy, was superior to methotrexate monotherapy in achieving an American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement response at week 24. No new safety signals were observed for tocilizumab.

Meaning

These findings suggest that subcutaneous tocilizumab, both as monotherapy and combination therapy, is a viable treatment option for patients with RA with inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.

### A personalized medicine approach to biologic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a preliminary treatment algorithm [^1118thD9]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks

As RA is a syndrome comprising different pathogenetic subsets, some patients may be more likely to respond to a specific therapeutic intervention than others. Recent work has provided proof of principle that biomarkers may be identified predictive of the response to targeted therapy. Most of these biomarkers increase the insight into the mechanisms promoting synovial inflammation and joint destruction as well as in the mechanism of action of the treatment. However, the use of biomarkers in the context of individualized health care is still limited. In addition to the need for identification of novel biomarkers, combination of multiple markers bears most promise to improve the performance of a biomarker-guided approach.

Based on recent insights, an initial algorithm can be made assisting in treatment decisions in patients who have failed one TNF inhibitor. Key questions in this algorithm relate to the question whether the patient is a primary vs a secondary non-responder to TNF blockade and whether the patient is autoantibody positive.

This preliminary algorithm may contribute to more cost-effective treatment of RA, and supports the rationale for the development of more extensive algorithms. For this purpose more data are needed, most importantly, the identification of biomarkers predictive of the response to tocilizumab and abatacept. Therefore, there is a need for well-designed clinical studies aimed at the identification of disease subgroups that would benefit from one mechanism of action over another. Future research should also focus on the reasons for secondary loss of response and the potential value of therapeutic drug monitoring. Together, these approaches may improve the ACR responses compared with those shown in Fig. 1. Finally, there is a need for the identification of biomarkers predictive of adverse events.

### Repair of joint damage in patients with rheumatoid arthritis does not relate to previous suppression of inflammation: a subanalysis after 8 years Treat-to-target in the BeSt-trial [^1153oV5p]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate whether repair of erosions and joint space narrowing (JSN) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) occurs and whether clinical variables predict this.

Methods

Eight-year follow-up data of the BeSt-study were used. Patients with recent onset RA (1987 criteria) were randomised to four treatment strategies and treated-to-target (Disease Activity Score (DAS) ≤ 2.4). Yearly radiographs of hands and feet were scored in non-chronological order by four independent readers, using the Sharp/van der Heijde score (SHS). Damage repair was defined as a negative ΔSHS in an individual joint, seen by ≥ 3 out of 4 readers and persisting ≥ 2 consecutive years. Associations between repair and DAS, prednisone use, infliximab use, anticitrullinated protein antibody, gender, age, body mass index, symptom duration and randomisation arm were investigated with logistic regression analyses, corrected for mean SHS.

Results

Repair was seen in 17 patients (5.3%); 10 had regression of JSN, 7 of erosions, none had both. There were no significant associations in any of the regression analyses.

Conclusion

After 8 years of treatment to target DAS ≤ 2.4 in 508 patients with recent onset RA, repair of JSN and erosions was seen in 17/320 patients (5.3%). Probably due to the rarity of repair, we found no associations with suppression of disease activity or other predictors and repair.

### Dose reduction and discontinuation of conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for people with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis in remission or low disease activity [^112hkSwb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

Pharmacological treatments such as non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, and disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are used to treat both rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. DMARDs, in general, are immunomodulators that suppress disease inflammation and effectively prevent joint damage, hence the term 'disease‐modifying'. Early initiation of DMARD therapy using a 'treat‐to‐target' approach is now the cornerstone of pharmacological treatment for both diseases.

DMARDs are categorised based on their structure and mechanisms of action. Conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) such as methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, and leflunomide have broad mechanisms of action, targeting multiple immune pathways. All these csDMARDs are initial treatment options in both diseases. Combination therapy is typically the preferred initial treatment approach in DMARD‐naive people, with methotrexate considered the cornerstone drug for both diseases, unless there is a contraindication to its use. Intra‐articular or short‐term oral glucocorticoids may be required as adjunct therapy when initiating or changing csDMARDs.

The nearly universal acceptance of the use of combinations of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to more effectively treat a growing percentage of patients with RA has been a central theme. Importantly, controlled studies have now shown many combinations to be well tolerated and significantly more effective than mono-DMARD therapy.

### Treatment strategies for early rheumatoid arthritis [^1156kDgF]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a potentially destructive disease with profound impact on patients' function and quality of life. Newer therapeutic agents have revolutionized outcomes but have not resulted in best outcomes for all patients. In this article, we will review recent progress in the development of strategies to enhance outcomes in patients with early RA (ERA).

Recent Findings

Over the past 10 years, investigators have increasingly focused on additional means for improving long-term prognosis of patients with RA by examining the effect of different strategies to reach clinical targets reflecting optimal levels of disease control. In particular, it has become apparent that patients with ERA have the best chance to reach optimal outcomes, thus normalizing function, and halting radiographic damage. Studies show that strategies including treating to a target, computerizing targets, and combining clinical and biological or imaging targets for patients are enabling more patients to achieve remission, sustained remission, and even drug-free remission.

Summary

Overall, the bar has been set higher in clinical research with the expectation that therapeutic approaches for all patients should be implemented to achieve high-level targeted outcomes. Studies evaluating the feasibility of implementing these in practice are needed to achieve this goal for all patients with ERA.

### How should we manage early rheumatoid arthritis? From imaging to intervention [^117LVdYo]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic and progressive inflammatory disorder of the synovium characterised by destruction of bone and cartilage. It is associated with significant morbidity and economic costs. Recent advances have shown that early diagnosis and timely, intensive therapy of rheumatoid arthritis can modify disease outcomes.

Recent Findings

Current investigations into the role of ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging in early rheumatoid arthritis suggest these modalities will provide information to assist in the early diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, identify poor prognostic factors, and aid in the monitoring of response to therapy. New developments in pharmacologic therapy, particularly the development of biologic agents, allow better disease control than was previously achievable, and the early application of these drugs in combination with conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs seems to produce the best outcomes.

Summary

The application of novel imaging techniques will aid the target application of biologic therapy within the window of opportunity and aid in the monitoring of response to therapy. This is likely to significantly decrease the rate of structural damage and offers hope of a future when the normal outcome for rheumatoid arthritis will be remission.

### Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors versus combination intensive therapy with conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in established rheumatoid arthritis: TACIT non-inferiority randomised controlled trial [^111eVCyc]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine whether intensive combinations of synthetic disease modifying drugs can achieve similar clinical benefits at lower costs to high cost biologics such as tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis resistant to initial methotrexate and other synthetic disease modifying drugs.

Design Open label pragmatic randomised multicentre two arm non-inferiority trial over 12 months.

Setting 24 rheumatology clinics in England.

Participants Patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were eligible for treatment with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors according to current English guidance were randomised to either the tumour necrosis factor inhibitor strategy or the combined disease modifying drug strategy.

Interventions Biologic strategy: start tumour necrosis factor inhibitor; second biologic in six month for non-responders. Alternative strategy: start combination of disease modifying drugs; start tumour necrosis factor inhibitors after six months in non-responders.

Main outcome measure Primary outcome: reduction in disability at 12 months measured with patient recorded heath assessment questionnaire (range 0.00–3.00) with a 0.22 non-inferiority margin for combination treatment versus the biologic strategy. Secondary outcomes: quality of life, joint damage, disease activity, adverse events, and costs. Intention to treat analysis used multiple imputation methods for missing data.

Results 432 patients were screened: 107 were randomised to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors and 101 started taking; 107 were randomised to the combined drug strategy and 104 started taking the drugs. Initial assessments were similar; 16 patients were lost to follow-up (seven with the tumour necrosis factor inhibitor strategy, nine with the combined drug strategy); 42 discontinued the intervention but were followed-up (19 and 23, respectively). The primary outcome showed mean falls in scores on the health assessment questionnaire of −0.30 with the tumour necrosis factor inhibitor strategy and −0.45 with the alternative combined drug strategy. The difference between groups in unadjusted linear regression analysis favoured the alternative strategy of combined drugs. The mean difference was −0.14, and the 95% confidence interval (−0.29 to 0.01) was below the prespecified non-inferiority boundary of 0.22. Improvements at 12 months in secondary outcomes, including quality of life and erosive progression, were similar with both strategies. Initial reductions in disease activity were greater with the biologic strategy, but these differences did not persist beyond six months. Remission was seen in 72 patients (44 with biologic strategy; 36 with alternative strategy); 28 patients had serious adverse events (18 and 10, respectively); six and 10 patients, respectively, stopped treatment because of toxicity. The alternative strategy reduced health and social care costs per patient by £3615 (€4930, $5585) for months 0–6 and £1930 for months 6–12.

Conclusions In patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who meet English criteria for biologics an alternative strategy with combinations of intensive synthetic disease modifying drugs gives non-inferior outcomes to treatment with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors. Costs are reduced substantially.

### Treat-to-target in rheumatoid arthritis-are we there yet? [^112HY5Hj]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Treat-to-target has been established as a guiding principle for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and encompasses several distinct elements: choosing a target and a method for measuring it; assessing the target at a pre-specified time point; a commitment to change the therapy if the target is not achieved; and shared decision-making. A treat-to-target approach yields superior outcomes to standard care in RA, and the ACR, EULAR and other professional organizations have endorsed treat-to-target as a fundamental therapeutic strategy for RA. Nevertheless, data on the degree to which treat-to-target is employed in the clinic are scarce; it seems that although some elements of treat-to-target are widely used, full implementation remains uncommon. Outstanding knowledge gaps to be addressed include how to select the right target for each patient, how often to assess whether the target has been achieved and the selection of each subsequent therapy in an evidence-based manner.

What are the effects of treatments. BENEFICIAL Antimalarials One systematic review has found that hydroxychloroquine reduces disease activity and joint inflammation compared with placebo in people with rheumatoid arthritis. We found insufficient evidence about effects on functional status. One systematic review found no consistent difference in the effectiveness between antimalarials and other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Methotrexate One systematic review has found that methotrexate reduces joint inflammation and radiologic progression, and improves functional status compared with placebo in people with rheumatoid arthritis. One systematic review and subsequent RCTs have found no consistent differences in efficacy between methotrexate versus leflunomide, parenteral gold, or etanercept. Minocycline RCTs have found that minocycline improves control of disease activity compared with placebo. We found no RCTs comparing minocycline versus other DMARDs.

Short-Term Low-Dose Oral Corticosteroids One systematic review has found that low-dose oral corticosteroids taken for several weeks significantly reduce disease activity and joint inflammation compared with placebo. Sulfasalazine Systematic reviews have found that sulfasalazine versus placebo for six months significantly reduces disease activity and joint inflammation. We found inadequate evidence on radiologic progression and functional status. One systematic review found no consistent differences between sulfasalazine and other DMARDs. Another systematic review of observational studies and RCTs found that over five years people were less likely to continue sulfasalazine than methotrexate. LIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL Auranofin One systematic review has found that auranofin versus placebo reduces disease activity and joint inflammation, but found no evidence on radiologic progression or long-term functional status.

Limited evidence from RCTs suggests that auranofin is less effective than DMARDs. Cyclosporin One systematic review has found that cyclosporin taken for a minimum of four months significantly reduces disease activity and joint inflammation, improves functional status, and may decrease the rate of radiologic progression compared with methotrexate. One RCT found no significant difference between parenteral gold versus cyclosporin for radiologic joint damage or self assessment of change in disease activity at 36 months. A very high frequency of toxicity limits the usefulness of cyclosporin.
