## Question

Absorption of b12

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about vitamin B12 absorption. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core physiology of B12 absorption from mouth to ileum. Then, I should verify the role of intrinsic factor and the terminal ileum. Next, I will examine passive diffusion and its clinical implications. After that, I need to check enterohepatic recycling and storage. Then, I will review dose-dependent bioavailability and newer tracer data. I should also consider special populations and malabsorption states, including pernicious anemia, bariatric surgery, and CKD. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical takeaways and reconcile any conflicting statements from the literature, making sure I cite the best available sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the canonical pathway so I don't miss a step. Dietary B12 is protein-bound in animal foods; gastric acid and pepsin release it, after which it binds haptocorrin (R-binder) in saliva and gastric secretions. In the duodenum, pancreatic proteases degrade haptocorrin, freeing B12 to bind intrinsic factor (IF) from gastric parietal cells. The B12–IF complex traverses to the terminal ileum, where cubilin–amnionless receptors mediate endocytosis in a calcium-dependent process, and B12 is then transferred to transcobalamin II for portal transport and tissue delivery, including hepatic storage [^115GTMDr] [^113CY3mJ] [^114nGRbK].

> Wait, let me verify the site of absorption because older literature sometimes cites conflicting locations. The weight of evidence supports the distal ileum as the principal site for IF-mediated B12 absorption, with calcium dependence and receptor-mediated endocytosis, whereas earlier reports suggesting duodenal or jejunal uptake likely reflect non–IF-mediated diffusion or experimental variability. This aligns with modern reviews and classic clinical observations in pernicious anemia and ileal disease [^115GTMDr] [^116jMEEe].

> I need to ensure I quantify passive diffusion correctly. Approximately 1% of an oral dose is absorbed by passive diffusion independent of IF, which becomes clinically meaningful at pharmacologic doses. This underpins the effectiveness of high-dose oral therapy even in pernicious anemia, though I should confirm that this 1% figure is consistent across sources and not an overgeneralization [^112HxYbX] [^111A3cQx] [^1159x2yR].

> Next, I should review enterohepatic circulation and storage so I don't underestimate the time course of deficiency. The liver stores roughly 1–3 mg of B12, and about 1–4 mcg/day is secreted into bile. In the presence of IF, most is reabsorbed in the terminal ileum, which explains why deficiency from malabsorption can manifest in months, whereas dietary insufficiency may take years to deplete stores. This also explains why parenteral repletion can transiently elevate serum B12 and why urinary loss occurs when binding proteins are saturated [^113qBA4c] [^116TmAuS].

> Hold on, I should verify dose-dependent bioavailability because this affects oral dosing strategies. At low physiologic doses (about 2–3 mcg), oral bioavailability is roughly 40–60%, but as dose increases, fractional absorption falls due to saturable IF-dependent transport. Stable-isotope studies show mean bioavailability around 46% at 2.3 mcg and about 7.6% at 18.3 mcg, with a late absorption peak suggesting colonic contribution. This dose–response helps explain why 1,000 mcg oral dosing can be effective despite low fractional absorption [^115eugch] [^114gYCJM].

> Let me consider the colon piece carefully, because I initially thought mammalian hosts cannot utilize colonic B12. That is too strong a statement. While the ileum is the canonical absorption site, tracer studies demonstrate measurable colonic absorption of B12, albeit at low efficiency, and this may contribute to homeostasis in marginal intake states. However, this does not replace the need for dietary or supplemental B12, and the clinical relevance remains limited compared with ileal absorption [^114gYCJM].

> I should confirm the clinical implications for pernicious anemia and other malabsorption states. High-dose oral cyanocobalamin (commonly 1,000 mcg/day) is effective in pernicious anemia because passive diffusion supplies sufficient amounts, and prospective data show biochemical remission in most patients. Guidelines endorse oral therapy as noninferior to intramuscular in many settings, though severe neurologic disease may still warrant parenteral therapy for faster repletion [^111A3cQx] [^1159x2yR] [^1142nVEF].

> But wait, what about after bariatric surgery and other anatomical changes. Sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass reduce intrinsic factor availability and bypass the distal ileum, so deficiency is common without prophylaxis. Lifelong high-dose oral B12 (often 1 mg/day) or alternative routes are recommended, and clinicians should remember that serum B12 may be normal early when MMA is already elevated, so MMA testing improves sensitivity in this context [^117LruNt] [^114GZbL6] [^1168W7K2].

> I need to check medication effects that impair absorption. Proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers reduce gastric acid and can impair food-bound B12 release, and metformin has been repeatedly associated with B12 deficiency, likely via effects on IF–B12 complex handling or calcium-dependent ileal absorption. Clinicians should maintain vigilance in long-term users and consider supplementation or periodic monitoring when risk is high [^116CCRXL] [^117WmgF6] [^114GZbL6].

> Let me reconsider the role of parenteral therapy so I don't overstate oral equivalence. Intramuscular cyanocobalamin remains standard for severe deficiency, significant neurologic symptoms, or when adherence or malabsorption is uncertain. Typical regimens use 100 mcg IM daily for about a week, then every 1–3 months lifelong for pernicious anemia, with faster biochemical correction than oral in some contexts, though high-dose oral can match hematologic and neurologic outcomes in many patients [^117T4SXj] [^1159x2yR] [^114GZbL6].

> I should double-check special populations and safety. In chronic kidney disease, cyanocobalamin may be less desirable due to impaired cyanide clearance; some experts prefer methylcobalamin in dialysis populations, though high-quality comparative outcome data are limited. Elevated serum B12 without supplementation can be a paraneoplastic marker and warrants evaluation for malignancy, so I need to interpret high levels in context [^112pCC4S] [^112cxq29].

> Next, I should review practical dosing so recommendations are actionable. For deficiency without severe neurologic disease, oral cyanocobalamin 1,000–2,000 mcg daily is effective. For maintenance or prevention in older adults, vegans, or those on metformin, 25–250 mcg daily is reasonable, and dietary fortification or modest supplements are advised for older adults and strict vegetarians. Monitoring should include CBC, serum B12, and MMA when suspicion remains high despite borderline B12 values [^1159x2yR] [^1142nVEF] [^114GZbL6].

> Hold on, I should verify that I've reconciled conflicting statements about oral reliability. Earlier FDA labeling emphasized that oral absorption is undependable in pernicious anemia, which reflects the IF-dependent pathway. However, contemporary evidence and guidelines show that high-dose oral therapy is effective via passive diffusion, so the apparent contradiction resolves when dose and mechanism are specified. I need to ensure I communicate that nuance clearly [^112HxYbX] [^1159x2yR] [^111A3cQx].

> In summary, B12 absorption is a multistep process requiring gastric acid and pepsin, haptocorrin binding, pancreatic proteases, intrinsic factor, and ileal receptors, with passive diffusion enabling high-dose oral therapy. Storage and enterohepatic recycling confer a large reserve, but malabsorption at the stomach or ileum, medications, and aging can precipitate deficiency. Modern practice favors oral therapy in most cases, reserving parenteral therapy for severe disease, neurologic involvement, or adherence concerns, and dose selection should reflect the saturable, dose-dependent nature of absorption [^115GTMDr] [^115eugch] [^1159x2yR].

Vitamin B12 absorption is a **multistep process** that begins with release from food proteins in the stomach, followed by binding to intrinsic factor (IF) in the small intestine, and ends with active uptake in the terminal ileum [^115GTMDr]. Only about 1% of oral B12 is absorbed by passive diffusion, so high-dose oral therapy can still be effective when IF-mediated absorption is impaired [^112HxYbX] [^113QvQJe]. Malabsorption can result from pernicious anemia, atrophic gastritis, ileal disease, or drugs like metformin and PPIs, and deficiency is common in older adults, vegans, and after bariatric surgery [^114GZbL6] [^117LruNt]. Diagnosis relies on serum B12 with confirmatory MMA/homocysteine, and treatment is oral or parenteral B12 depending on severity and cause [^1159x2yR] [^1142nVEF].

---

## Physiological mechanisms of absorption

### Release from food proteins

In the stomach, **gastric acid and pepsin** liberate B12 from food proteins, and salivary haptocorrin binds and protects it [^113CY3mJ]. In the duodenum, pancreatic proteases degrade haptocorrin, freeing B12 to bind intrinsic factor (IF) [^1136ppXf].

---

### Intrinsic factor-mediated absorption

IF, produced by parietal cells, forms a B12–IF complex that resists proteolysis and is absorbed in the terminal ileum via cubilin–amnionless receptors in a **calcium-dependent process** [^115GTMDr]. Inside enterocytes, B12 is released, binds transcobalamin II, and enters the portal circulation for delivery to tissues [^113CY3mJ].

---

### Passive diffusion

About 1% of oral B12 is absorbed by passive diffusion, which becomes clinically relevant at **high oral doses** (≥ 1,000 mcg) [^112HxYbX] [^113QvQJe].

---

## Sites of absorption

| **Site of absorption** | **Mechanism** | **Contribution to total absorption** |
|-|-|-|
| Terminal ileum | Intrinsic factor-mediated active transport | Major (~90%) |
| Entire small intestine | Passive diffusion | Minor (~1%) |

---

## Factors influencing absorption

Several factors influence **B12 absorption**:

- **Intrinsic factor**: Essential for ileal uptake; deficiency causes pernicious anemia [^115GTMDr].
- **Gastric acid**: Required for B12 release; achlorhydria impairs absorption [^114Ru4BF].
- **Pancreatic enzymes**: Needed to degrade haptocorrin and free B12 [^1136ppXf].
- **Calcium**: Required for ileal receptor function [^1136ppXf].
- **Age**: Gastric atrophy and IF decline reduce absorption in older adults [^115x3v5a].
- **Medications**: Metformin and PPIs can impair absorption [^117WmgF6] [^116CCRXL].

---

## Clinical implications of impaired absorption

Impaired absorption leads to **deficiency** with hematologic (macrocytic anemia) and neurologic (neuropathy, cognitive impairment) manifestations [^114GZbL6]. Common causes include:

- **Pernicious anemia**: Autoimmune IF deficiency [^115GTMDr].
- **Atrophic gastritis**: Reduced acid and IF [^115x3v5a].
- **Ileal disease**: Crohn's, resection, or bacterial overgrowth [^1136ppXf].
- **Medications**: Metformin, PPIs, H2 blockers [^117WmgF6] [^116CCRXL].
- **Dietary insufficiency**: Strict vegan diets [^112HxYbX].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis combines clinical suspicion with laboratory testing:

- **Serum B12**: Low levels suggest deficiency; borderline levels (180–350 pg/mL) need confirmation [^114wHVoy].
- **Methylmalonic acid (MMA)**: Elevated in B12 deficiency [^116X2VPz].
- **Homocysteine**: Elevated in B12 deficiency [^117XBUaq].
- **Holotranscobalamin**: Active B12 fraction; early marker of deficiency [^113WenGk].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment depends on severity and cause:

- **Oral supplementation**: 1,000–2,000 mcg daily; effective even in pernicious anemia due to passive diffusion [^113QvQJe] [^111A3cQx].
- **Intramuscular injections**: 100–1,000 mcg monthly for severe deficiency or malabsorption [^117T4SXj].
- **Nasal spray**: 500 mcg weekly for maintenance after repletion [^1149ZCYz].
- **Underlying cause**: Treat malabsorption or stop offending drugs when possible [^114CvkMt].

---

Vitamin B12 absorption is a **complex, IF-dependent process** in the terminal ileum, with passive diffusion enabling high-dose oral therapy. Impaired absorption from autoimmune, gastrointestinal, or drug-related causes is common and can cause significant morbidity, but deficiency is readily diagnosed and treated with appropriate supplementation.

### How I treat cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency [^1123to9s]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

The challenges in medical management of cobalamin deficiency lie in attention to the unique pathophysiology that underlies cobalamin deficiency, more than in the mechanics of therapy. The central physiologic principles are that clinically important deficiency is more likely to occur (and progress) when intrinsic factor-driven absorption fails than when diet is poor and that most causes take years to produce clinically obvious deficiency. Transient defects have little clinical impact. The key management principle is the importance of follow-up, which also requires knowing how the deficiency arose. The virtues of these principles are not always fully appreciated. Recent developments have made diagnosis and management more difficult by diminishing the ability to determine cobalamin absorption status. Clinicians must also grapple with premature medicalization of isolated, mild biochemical changes that added many asymptomatic cases of still undetermined medical relevance to their caseload, often expanded by inflated cobalamin level criteria. The potential for misattribution of cobalamin-unrelated presentations to nongermane cobalamin and metabolite abnormalities has grown. Pathophysiologically based management requires systematic attention to each of its individual components: correctly diagnosing cobalamin deficiency, reversing it, defining its underlying cause, preventing relapse, managing the underlying disorder and its complications, and educating the patient.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Vitamin B12is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis.

Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B12is transported via specific B12binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B12storage.

Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1000 mcg of vitamin B12, 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage.

Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B12depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B12prevents progression of neurologic damage.

The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B12in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B12is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs).

Vitamin B12is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B12enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B12.

Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B12, and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure.

### Bioavailability and daily requirement of vitamin bin adult humans: an observational study of its colonic absorption and daily excretion as measured by [C]-cyanocobalamin kinetics [^114gYCJM]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical and biochemical vitamin B 12 (B 12) deficiency is lower than anticipated in vegetarians. Extraileal absorption, such as from the colon, as well as reduced daily excretion, may be adaptive mechanisms to maintain B 12 homeostasis with marginal intakes.

Objective

To measure the absorption of B 12 from the small and large intestine, and its daily rate of excretion from the body, using a [13 C]-cyanocobalamin tracer.

Methods

Oral B 12 bioavailability was measured over 12 h after administration of [13 C]-cyanocobalamin tracer (2.5 μg) in normal participants. The colonic B 12 bioavailability was evaluated by direct instillation of [13 C]-cyanocobalamin (5 μg) into the ascending colon. Bioavailability was calculated from 2-compartmental modeling of the tracer appearance in plasma. The excretion rate of B 12 was measured from [13 C]-cyanocobalamin elimination from the body over 4 wk after oral dosing (5 μg).

Results

The oral B 12 bioavailability (n = 11) was 63% ± 10% measured over 12 h. A late absorption peak, accounting for 12% of the absorption, was observed after an average lag time of 8.7 h from dosing. The colonic B 12 bioavailability (n = 10) was 7% ± 5% over 4 h. The daily B 12 excretion rate (n = 4) was 0.7 ± 0.2 μg/d. The minimum daily requirement of B 12 in these participants was derived at 1 μg /d.

Conclusions

B 12 is absorbed in the human colon. This observation confirms the potential contribution of the colon in daily B 12 nutriture, and along with a possible lower requirement, could explain the absence of clinical deficiency in populations with marginal B 12 intakes.

### Vitamin B deficiency [^113VrFbh]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B 12 (B12; also known as cobalamin) is a B vitamin that has an important role in cellular metabolism, especially in DNA synthesis, methylation and mitochondrial metabolism. Clinical B12 deficiency with classic haematological and neurological manifestations is relatively uncommon. However, subclinical deficiency affects between 2.5% and 26% of the general population depending on the definition used, although the clinical relevance is unclear. B12 deficiency can affect individuals at all ages, but most particularly elderly individuals. Infants, children, adolescents and women of reproductive age are also at high risk of deficiency in populations where dietary intake of B12-containing animal-derived foods is restricted. Deficiency is caused by either inadequate intake, inadequate bioavailability or malabsorption. Disruption of B12 transport in the blood, or impaired cellular uptake or metabolism causes an intracellular deficiency. Diagnostic biomarkers for B12 status include decreased levels of circulating total B12 and transcobalamin-bound B12, and abnormally increased levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid. However, the exact cut-offs to classify clinical and subclinical deficiency remain debated. Management depends on B12 supplementation, either via high-dose oral routes or via parenteral administration. This Primer describes the current knowledge surrounding B12 deficiency, and highlights improvements in diagnostic methods as well as shifting concepts about the prevalence, causes and manifestations of B12 deficiency.

### Measuring vitamin B-12 bioavailability with [13C]-cyanocobalamin in humans [^115eugch]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin B-12 deficiency is widespread in many parts of the world, affecting all age groups and increasing with age. It is primarily due to a low intake of animal source foods or malabsorption. The measurement of bioavailability of vitamin B-12 is etiologically important in deficiency but is limited due to the use of radioactive isotopes like [57Co]- or [14C]-cyanocobalamin.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to measure the bioavailability of [13C]-cyanocobalamin in humans and to assess the effect of parenteral replenishment of vitamin B-12 on the bioavailability.

Methods

We synthesized a stable isotope-labeled vitamin B-12, [13C]-cyanocobalamin, using Salmonella enterica by providing [13C2]-ethanolamine as a sole carbon source. After purification and mass spectrometry-based characterization, its oral bioavailability was measured in the fasted state with high and low oral doses, before and after parenteral replenishment of vitamin B-12 stores, from the kinetics of its plasma appearance in a 2-compartment model.

Results

[13C]-cyanocobalamin was completely decyanated to [13C]-methylcobalamin describing metabolic utilization, and its plasma appearance showed early and late absorption phases. At a low dose of 2.3 µg, the mean bioavailability was 46.2 ± 12.8 (%, mean ± SD, n = 11). At a higher dose of 18.3 µg, the mean bioavailability was 7.6 ± 1.7 (%, mean ± SD, n = 4). Parenteral replenishment of the vitamin B-12 store in deficient individuals prior to the measurement resulted in a 1.9-fold increase in bioavailability.

Conclusions

Vitamin B-12 bioavailability is dose dependent and at a low dose that approximates the normal daily requirement (46%). The stable isotope method described here could be used to define the etiology of deficiency and to inform the dietary requirement in different physiologic states as well as the dose required for supplementation and food fortification. This trial was registered at the Clinical Trials Registry of India as CTRI/2018/04/012957.

### Pharmacokinetics of oral cyanocobalamin formulated with sodium N-[8-(2-hydroxybenzoyl) amino] caprylate (SNAC): an open-label, randomized, single-dose, parallel-group study in healthy male subjects [^115ckGfj]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency may be caused by inadequate dietary intake of B12 or by conditions that result in malabsorption of the vitamin. Crystalline vitamin B12, usually in the form of cyanocobalamin, is administered parenterally (ie, intramuscularly) or orally for treating deficiency states. Intramuscular administration is widely accepted as a treatment method. Oral B12 supplementation is also used, but it is considered to be less reliable.

Objective

This study was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of 2 oral formulations of cyanocobalamin-a marketed cyanocobalamin tablet (immediate-release B12 5 mg) and cyanocobalamin formulated with a proprietary carrier, sodium N-[8-(2-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]caprylate (SNAC)-to establish the feasibility of using an absorption enhancer with B12 to improve uptake of the vitamin. This was the first clinical study conducted with the cyanocobalamin/SNAC coformulation.

Methods

An open-label, randomized, single-dose, parallel-group study was conducted in healthy male subjects. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: Treatment A subjects (n = 4) received 2 tablets of 5-mg cyanocobalamin formulated with 100-mg SNAC as part of a dose range-finding arm included to determine a dose to provide a measurable concentration of vitamin B12 at all time points when tested with the available vitamin B12 assay; treatment B subjects (n = 6) received 1 tablet of 5-mg cyanocobalamin formulated with 100-mg SNAC; treatment C subjects (n = 6) received 1 commercially available 5-mg cyanocobalamin tablet; and treatment D subjects (n = 4) received commercially available 1-mg cyanocobalamin IV. Treatment A was completed 3 weeks before treatments B, C, and D were studied. Human serum B12 was analyzed by chemiluminescence assay method. Validation procedures established that samples could be diluted up to 100 times without any effects on accuracy and precision. The pharmacokinetic properties of vitamin B12 were characterized by noncompartmental analysis. Vitamin B12 absolute bioavailability estimates were calculated between the oral (A, B, and C) and IV (D) treatments using non-baseline-adjusted vitamin B12 concentrations as well as baseline-adjusted vitamin B12 concentrations, with or without body weight adjustments. Tolerability was evaluated through review or monitoring of medical history, physical examination findings, concomitant medications, vital signs, laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis values), electrocardiography, adverse events, and serious adverse events.

Results

Twenty healthy male subjects, aged 20 to 45 years, participated in this study. Based on data from treatment A, a 5-mg cyanocobalamin dose was selected for use with treatments B and C. The oral cyanocobalamin formulation containing SNAC had greater mean absolute bioavailability than the commercial oral formulation (5.09% vs 2.16%, respectively), calculated on AUC(0-last) values uncorrected for baseline, weight, or body mass index. It also had a reduced T(max) compared with the commercial formulation (0.5 hours vs 6.83 hours, respectively). The K(e) was similar between treatments (0.028 1/h vs 0.025 1/h). Comparable results were achieved using corrected values. The cyanocobalamin/SNAC formulation was well tolerated, and there were no reported adverse events.

Conclusions

An oral formulation of 5-mg cyanocobalamin containing 100-mg SNAC, an absorption enhancer, provided significantly improved bioavailability and a significant decrease in T(max) for B12 in a small study of normal healthy subjects compared with a commercially available 5-mg cyanocobalamin oral formulation. Both oral formulations and commercial 1-mg cyanocobalamin IV were well tolerated.

### Vitamin B12 as a modulator of gut microbial ecology [^116EZ9q3]. Cell Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

The microbial mechanisms and key metabolites that shape the composition of the human gut microbiota are largely unknown, impeding efforts to manipulate dysbiotic microbial communities toward stability and health. Vitamins, which by definition are not synthesized in sufficient quantities by the host and can mediate fundamental biological processes in microbes, represent an attractive target for reshaping microbial communities. Here, we discuss how vitamin B12 (cobalamin) impacts diverse host-microbe symbioses. Although cobalamin is synthesized by some human gut microbes, it is a precious resource in the gut and is likely not provisioned to the host in significant quantities. However, this vitamin may make an unrecognized contribution in shaping the structure and function of human gut microbial communities.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Vitamin B12is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis.

Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within one hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed Vitamin B12is transported via specific B12binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for Vitamin B12storage.

Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1000 mcg of Vitamin B12, 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage.

Gastrointestinal absorption of Vitamin B12depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of Vitamin B12prevents progression of neurologic damage.

The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of Vitamin B12in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B12is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs).

Vitamin B12is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and Vitamin B12enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of Vitamin B12.

Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of Vitamin B12, and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxocobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure.

### Vitamin B [^1142nVEF]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

How is B 12 deficiency treated?

The therapeutic goals of B 12 treatment are the reversal of metabolic abnormalities and the prevention or reduction of clinical symptoms (fig 1). Treatment depends in part on the severity of symptoms and the cause of the deficiency. In individuals with symptomatic B 12 deficiency despite normal dietary B 12 intake, B 12 malabsorption is the most likely cause and should guide parenteral therapy.

The three key treatment areas are outlined below.

Insufficient dietary intake

To prevent deficiency, oral cyanocobalamin supplementation once daily 20–50 mcg or 50–150 mcg is most commonly recommended. In some countries, methyl- and adenosylcobalamin-containing preparations are available; however, one observational study suggests better efficacy with cyanocobalamin than with methylcobalamin. Exercise caution when using combination preparations to avoid excessive folate or B 6 intake. With advancing age, B 12 absorption declines, and a higher supplemental B 12 dose may be needed. Yearly monitoring of B 12 status and suitable adjustment of the supplementation dose is recommended.

For symptomatic deficiency (box 1) caused by insufficient dietary intake, intramuscular B 12 therapy is usually initiated with the aim of progressing to oral supplements once symptoms have resolved.

### Vitamin B12 transport from food to the body's cells – a sophisticated, multistep pathway [^115GTMDr]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B(12) (B(12); also known as cobalamin) is a cofactor in many metabolic processes; deficiency of this vitamin is associated with megaloblastic anaemia and various neurological disorders. In contrast to many prokaryotes, humans and other mammals are unable to synthesize B(12). Instead, a sophisticated pathway for specific uptake and transport of this molecule has evolved. Failure in the gastrointestinal part of this pathway is the most common cause of nondietary-induced B(12) deficiency disease. However, although less frequent, defects in cellular processing and further downstream steps in the transport pathway are also known culprits of functional B(12) deficiency. Biochemical and genetic approaches have identified novel proteins in the B(12) transport pathway — now known to involve more than 15 gene products — delineating a coherent pathway for B(12) trafficking from food to the body's cells. Some of these gene products are specifically dedicated to B(12) transport, whereas others embrace additional roles, which explains the heterogeneity in the clinical picture of the many genetic disorders causing B(12) deficiency. This Review describes basic and clinical features of this multistep pathway with emphasis on gastrointestinal transport of B(12) and its importance in clinical medicine.

### Vitamin B12 as a treatment for pain [^115Qvpi4]. Pain Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

First isolated as cyanocobalamin in 1948, vitamin B12 has been explored for pain treatment almost since its discovery. With the advent of the opioid epidemic, safer treatments for pain are needed.

Objectives

Our objective was to compile the latest information on potential mechanisms from animal studies and clinical trial data on vitamin B12 for the treatment of pain conditions.

Study Design

We conducted a narrative review.

Methods

PubMed was searched using the terms "methylcobalamin pain", "hydroxycobalamin pain", "cyanocobalamin pain", and "vitamin B12 pain". Animal studies that identified mechanisms of action for the effects of pain were collected. Clinical trials utilizing larger, pharmaceutical doses of vitamin B12 (> 100 µg/dose) in pain treatment were identified and reviewed.

Results

Animal studies support multiple beneficial effects of vitamin B12 including the regeneration of nerves and the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes and other pain-signaling pathways. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated synergistic benefits of vitamin B12 combined with other pain medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opiates. Clinical trials provide evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin B12 for the treatment of low back pain and neuralgia, although data is still fairly limited and optimal treatment regimens have not been identified.

Limitations

More large, double-blind placebo-controlled trials are needed to fully establish efficacy and best dosing parameters.

Conclusion

Vitamin B12 may prove to be an adjunctive or integrative treatment for pain conditions. While more research is needed, considering the low incidence of side effects and overall safety, B12 may be an additional tool to consider for pain treatment.

Key Words

Vitamin B12, cyanocobalamin, methylcobalamin, hydroxycobalamin, pain, chronic pain, neuropathy, low back pain.

### Cyanocobalamin [^117T4SXj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:

Avoid using the intravenous route. Use of this product intravenously will result in almost all of the vitamin being lost in the urine.

Pernicious Anemia: Parenteral vitamin B12is the recommended treatment and will be required for the remainder of the patient's life. The oral form is not dependable. A dose of 100 mcg daily for 6 or 7 days should be administered by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. If there is clinical improvement and if a reticulocyte response is observed, the same amount may be given on alternate days for seven doses, then every 3 to 4 days for another 2 to 3 weeks. By this time hematologic values should have become normal. This regimen should be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concomitantly if needed.

Patients with Normal Intestinal Absorption: Where the oral route is not deemed adequate, initial treatment similar to that for patients with pernicious anemia may be indicated depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic treatment should be with an oral B12preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies are present, they should be treated.

Schilling Test: The flushing dose is 1000 mcg.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### The association between vitamin B12, albuminuria and reduced kidney function: an observational cohort study [^112pCC4S]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Potential mechanisms

B12 in the blood is primarily protein-bound. Approximately 20% of circulating B12 is bound to holotranscobalamin (TC2) with the remainder to haptocorrin. TC2-bound B12 is the biologically active form as B12 bound to haptocorrin cannot be taken up into cells. A congenital form of megaloblastic anemia has been described in infants lacking TC2 despite normal total B12 levels. The kidney plays an important role in TC2 metabolism. TC2 is filtered at the glomerulus and is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule by megalin. B12 is then returned to the blood bound to newly synthesized TC2. Thus, defects in protein reabsorption in the proximal tubule could lead to a loss of biologically active TC2 in the urine.

Increased TC2 and haptocorrin levels have been noted in patients with CKD. Despite this, there is decreased uptake of TC2 into cells. This can lead to a paradoxical increase in cellular homocysteine levels despite normal total B12. Thus, a functional B12 deficiency can occur in patients with CKD in the setting of increased TC2 losses in the urine, decreased TC2 absorption in the proximal tubule and decreased cellular uptake of TC2.

Another important consideration is the possibility that elevated B12 levels and B12 supplementation may be harmful in individuals with CKD. Cyanide metabolism is abnormal in individuals with CKD due to decreased clearance. Cyanocobalamin, the most commonly used form of B12 replacement is metabolized to active methylcobalamin releasing small amounts of cyanide. Under normal circumstances, methylcobalamin acts as a means of removing cyanide from the circulation through conversion to cyanocobalamin. However, in patients with CKD the reduced cyanide clearance prevents conversion of cyanocobalamin to the active form and therefore supplementation in this form is less effective at reducing homocysteine levels.

In fact, a recent randomized trial of cyanocobalamin administration found more rapid GFR decline and cardiovascular morbidity in the treatment arm. It was suggested that this may be related to increased synthesis of assymetric dimethylarginine which is known to inhibit nitric oxide. However, the data above suggest that in fact this finding may result from the use of cyanocobalamin rather than methylcobalamin in this population and that methylcobalamin should be preferred in individuals with CKD. Unfortunately, as we do not have data on vitamin supplementation, this is speculative and would warrant further investigation.

### Absorption of water-soluble vitamins [^111bR8Mi]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Water-soluble vitamins are required as enzyme cofactors in a wide variety of metabolic reactions. Riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin C are essential in redox reactions; thiamine and biotin are involved in macronutrient metabolism; and folate, vitamin B12, pyridoxine, and riboflavin play important roles in the regulation of S-adenosylmethionine production and DNA synthesis. Each of the water-soluble vitamins appears to require its own membrane transport process for absorption across the enterocyte. The absorption of vitamin B12, or cobalamin (Cbl), is unique in requiring multiple processes from the stomach to the ileum that involve at least four different binding proteins. Whereas all water-soluble vitamins are absorbed from the small intestine, folate, biotin, and riboflavin can be transported across colonic epithelial cells, with uncertain clinical significance. This article reviews recent studies on the requirement, metabolism, and deficiency state of each water-soluble vitamin, followed by a discussion of current knowledge on the regulation of its intestinal absorption.

Vitamin B12

Function of Vitamin

Vitamin B12 or cobalamin is a water-soluble vitamin found naturally in foods such liver, eggs, fish, and milk products. The human body relies on dietary intake for adequate blood levels of cobalamin.

Cobalamin has a central cobalt atom in its structure and is found in 2 active forms in our bodies: methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin. Similar to vitamin B9, cobalamin is essential for our bodies to create healthy red blood cells, DNA and RNA, and is critical for brain health and appropriate nerve cell development. Cobalamin act as a co-factor for a key reaction that turns homocysteine into methionine. High levels of homocysteine can be toxic for our bodies and damage our blood vessels and nerve cells. The by-products of the reaction that creates methionine are directly used to synthesize pyrimidine for DNA. Additionally, methionine itself is an important methyl-donor that is used in metabolic reactions.

Issues with malabsorption in the gastrointestinal system, impairment in the synthesis and function of intrinsic factor, low dietary intake of cobalamin, Crohn's disease, excessive alcohol intake, pernicious anemia, history of bariatric surgery and strict vegan diets can cause cobalamin deficiencies. Vitamin B12 is absorbed in the distal ileum through its transportation protein intrinsic factor, those who have had bariatric surgery and issues with intrinsic factor are at a higher risk of deficiency. Signs and symptoms of this vitamin deficiency include macrocytic anemia, depression and abnormal fetal development.

Epidemiology of Disease

Prevalence estimates of cobalamin deficiencies vary quite a bit and depend on the population that is being assessed. In the general population it is estimated that 1% to 2% of people are vitamin B12 deficient. In one analysis the estimates for cobalamin deficiency in those older than 60 years in both the United States and the United Kingdom was approximately 6%. They stated that this prevalence increased to almost 20% as the age of the sample increased. This same study found the prevalence to be significant higher in all age groups in lower income countries. In vegetarians the prevalence of cobalamin deficiency in infants can be as high as 45%, 33.3% in children and adolescent and 39% in pregnant women. Previous studies have also found that cobalamin deficiencies were higher in those with type 2 diabetes and pernicious anemia.

### Advances in the understanding of cobalamin assimilation and metabolism [^11668JDX]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

The haematological and neurological consequences of cobalamin deficiency define the essential role of this vitamin in key metabolic reactions. The identification of cubilin-amnionless as the receptors for intestinal absorption of intrinsic factor-bound cobalamin and the plasma membrane receptor for cellular uptake of transcobalamin bound cobalamin have provided a clearer understanding of the absorption and cellular uptake of this vitamin. As the genes involved in the intracellular processing of cobalamins and genetic defects of these pathways are identified, the metabolic disposition of cobalamins and the proteins involved are being recognized. The synthesis of methylcobalamin and 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin, their utilization in conjunction with methionine synthase and methylmalonylCoA mutase, respectively, and the metabolic consequences of defects in these pathways could provide insights into the clinical presentation of cobalamin deficiency.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency [^111tiPE5]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of macrocytic anemia and has been implicated in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. The role of B12 deficiency in hyperhomocysteinemia and the promotion of atherosclerosis is only now being explored. Diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency is typically based on measurement of serum vitamin B12 levels; however, about 50 percent of patients with subclinical disease have normal B12 levels. A more sensitive method of screening for vitamin B12 deficiency is measurement of serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, which are increased early in vitamin B12 deficiency. Use of the Schilling test for detection of pernicious anemia has been supplanted for the most part by serologic testing for parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies. Contrary to prevailing medical practice, studies show that supplementation with oral vitamin B12 is a safe and effective treatment for the B12 deficiency state. Even when intrinsic factor is not present to aid in the absorption of vitamin B12 (pernicious anemia) or in other diseases that affect the usual absorption sites in the terminal ileum, oral therapy remains effective.

### The complex machinery of human cobalamin metabolism [^113AGCNK]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B 12 (cobalamin, Cbl) is required as a cofactor by two human enzymes, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR) and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMUT). Within the body, a vast array of transporters, enzymes and chaperones are required for the generation and delivery of these cofactor forms. How they perform these functions is dictated by the structure and interactions of the proteins involved, the molecular bases of which are only now being elucidated. In this review, we highlight recent insights into human Cbl metabolism and address open questions in the field by employing a protein structure and interactome based perspective. We discuss how three very similar proteins-haptocorrin, intrinsic factor and transcobalamin-exploit slight structural differences and unique ligand receptor interactions to effect selective Cbl absorption and internalisation. We describe recent advances in the understanding of how endocytosed Cbl is transported across the lysosomal membrane and the implications of the recently solved ABCD4 structure. We detail how MMACHC and MMADHC cooperate to modify and target cytosolic Cbl to the client enzymes MTR and MMUT using ingenious modifications to an ancient nitroreductase fold, and how MTR and MMUT link with their accessory enzymes to sustainably harness the supernucleophilic potential of Cbl. Finally, we provide an outlook on how future studies may combine structural and interactome based approaches and incorporate knowledge of post-translational modifications to bring further insights.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Vitamin B12is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B12enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses.

A three way crossover study in 25 fasting healthy subjects was conducted to compare the bioavailability of the B12nasal spray to the B12nasal gel and to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the nasal formulations as compared to the intramuscular injection. The peak concentrations after administration of intranasal spray were reached in 1.25 ± 1.9 hours. The mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of B12, obtained after baseline correction, following administration of intranasal spray were 748 ± 549 pg/mL. The bioavailability of the B12nasal spray was found to be 10% less than the B12nasal gel.

Distribution

In the blood, B12is bound to transcobalamin II, a specific B-globulin carrier protein, and is distributed and stored primarily in the liver and bone marrow.

Elimination

About 3–8 mcg of B12is secreted into the GI tract daily via the bile and undergoes some enterohepatic recycling; in normal subjects with sufficient intrinsic factor, all but about 1 mcg is reabsorbed. When B12is administered in doses which saturate the binding capacity of plasma proteins and the liver, the unbound B12is rapidly eliminated in the urine. Retention of B12in the body is dose-dependent. About 80–90% of an intramuscular dose up to 50 mcg is retained in the body; this percentage drops to 55% for a 100 mcg dose, and decreases to 15% when a 1000 mcg dose is given.

### Treatment of vitamin b (12)-deficiency anemia: oral versus parenteral therapy [^1111nLjr]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the use of oral cyanocobalamin therapy in the treatment of cobalamin (vitamin B(12))-deficient anemia.

Data Sources

Primary and review articles were identified by MEDLINE search (1966-May 2000) and through secondary sources.

Data Synthesis

Cobalamin-deficient anemia is among the most common diagnoses in older populations. Cobalamin-deficient anemia may be diagnosed as pernicious anemia, resulting from the lack of intrinsic factor required for cobalamin absorption or as protein malabsorption from the inability to displace cobalamin from protein food sources. Several studies provide evidence that daily oral cyanocobalamin as opposed to monthly parenteral formulations may adequately treat both types of cobalamin-deficient anemias.

Conclusions

Daily oral cyanocobalamin at doses of 1000–2000 microg can be used for treatment in most cobalamin-deficient patients who can tolerate oral supplementation. There are inadequate data at the present time to support the use of oral cyanocobalamin replacement in patients with severe neurologic involvement.

### Cyanocobalamin (vitamin deficiency system) [^114CvkMt]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B12deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions:

Addisonian (pernicious) anemia

Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy

Fish tapeworm infestation

Malignancy of pancreas or bowel

Folic acid deficiency

It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug Interactions), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin.

Requirements of vitamin B12in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation.

Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is also suitable for the vitamin B12absorption test (Schilling test).

### Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency – an update [^111b7Xx4]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

We represent an update on diagnosing and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency should be suspected in all patients with unexplained anaemia and/or neurological symptoms, as well as in patients at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency such as the elderly and patients with intestinal diseases. Measurement of plasma cobalamins is suggested as the primary analysis followed by measurement of plasma methylmalonic acid in unsettled cases. Accumulating evidence indicates that the biologically active cobalamin, plasma holotranscobalamin (holoTC), may be superior to plasma cobalamins, and measurement of holoTC is currently introduced in the clinical setting. No consensus exists concerning evaluation of the cause for vitamin B12 deficiency, and pros and cons on the different tests mainly aiming at evaluation of the function of the gastric mucosa are presented. Once the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency has been confirmed efficient treatment can be ensured either by injections every 2–3 month or by a daily dose of 1 mg vitamin B12.

### Role of the ileum in the absorption of vitamin B12 and intrinsic factor (NF) [^116jMEEe]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE in man and in several species of animals, including the dog, indicates that the major portion of orally administered vitamin B12 is absorbed from the distal ileum. 1–4 Other investigators, however, have variously indicated that the maximal absorption of vitamin B12 takes place in the duodenum, 5 in the jejunum, 6 or throughout the entire small intestine.
7. Studies also indicate that a substance from gastric mucosa, probably a mucopolysaccharide termed intrinsic factor, forms a complex with vitamin B12, thereby enhancing its absorption by the intestine. It has been suggested that a possible explanation for the conflicting evidence as to the site of absorption of vitamin B12 may be the inconstant availability of endogenous intrinsic factor during transit from stomach to ileum. This might result from the binding of vitamin B12 by proteins without intrinsic factor activity, making it unavailable. Drapanas T, Williams JS, McDonald JC, Heyden W, Bow T, Spencer RP.

### Dependency on host vitamin B12 has shaped Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex evolution [^114VWYwH]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin B12 (B12), historically known as the "anti-pernicious anemia factor" by its ability to cure pernicious anemia, was first documented in 1926. It has the largest and most complex chemical structure of all the vitamins and biological cofactors, whose intricate structure was solved in 1956 by X-ray crystallography. The term B12 -or cobalamin (Cbl)- refers to a group of water soluble, cobalt-containing corrinoid molecules, which are required in a wide range of metabolic processes both in prokaryotes and animals. Specifically, B12 in animals is essential for carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism, and the formation and regeneration of red blood cells, as well as the maintenance of the central nervous system. Despite most prokaryotes and animals possess enzymes that require B12 as cofactor, only some bacteria and archaea are able to synthesize B12 de novo. However, even though some bacteria of the microbiota residing in the large intestine produce Cbl, mammals are not able to uptake Cbl produced at this location, since the site of B12 absorption is located in the small intestine. Therefore, animals, including humans, must assimilate B12 by dietary intake. Indeed, some mammalian herbivores (including rabbits, mice, rats and primates) practice coprophagy to obtain Cbl as they fail to obtain sufficient vitamin from vegetarian dietary sources. In humans, to obtain full benefits from vegan and vegetarian diets, these individuals should ingest fortified foods and/or B12 supplements.

The presence of B12-dependent enzymes in bacteria and animals makes this vitamin an attractive candidate for host-pathogen cross-talk. Indeed, it has been proposed a role for B12 in shaping the ecological niche of some bacterial genus as Salmonella or Yersinia. While non-typhoidal Salmonellae retain an intact B12 pathway, this is inactivated in the typhoidal human pathogens. Similarly, although Y. enterocolitic a and environmental Yersinia species retain all the genes for B12 synthesis, the human-pathogens Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis have lost most of them. In other words, those serotypes or species maintaining a functional production of endogenous B12 are adapted to cause intestinal infections; while those pathogens lacking B12 biosynthesis are associated with disseminated diseases. Together, maintaining the B12 biosynthesis in enteric pathogens provides a metabolic advantage to outcompete their intestinal microbiota counterparts in an inflamed gut; while loss of B12 synthesis might represent a signature of invasive pathogens for the change of the intestinal niche and a movement away to a more systemic infectious cycle.

Vitamin B12

Background

The main source of cobalamin is from dietary intake of animal and dairy products. Cyanocobalamin, another name for vitamin B12, is an artefactual molecule based on previously used isolation methods from liver specimens and does not have direct biologic activity. The actual biologically active forms proceed from cobalamin. Ingested cobalamin complexes with salivary haptocorrin, which is released from cobalamin by pancreatic proteases in the duodenum. Intrinsic factor secreted from the parietal cells of the stomach then complexes with the released cobalamin. When this complex arrives at the distal ileum, it binds to cubilin on the enterocytes and is endocytosed. The cobalamin molecule is separated from intrinsic factor and transferred to transcobalamin II, which is a plasma transport protein.

At the target cell, the complex is endocytosed into the cellular lysosome where cobalamin is released from transcobalamin. It is metabolized to two active forms: adenosylcobalamin in the mitochondria and methylcobalamin in the cytosol.

Methylcobalamin is a methyl-transferring cofactor to the enzyme methionine synthase. Catalyzed by methionine synthase, methyltetrahydrofolate surrenders a methyl group to cobalamin, which then methylates homocysteine and forms methionine. Methionine is an essential amino acid required in the synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids.

Adenosylcobalamin is formed within mitochondria and is a cofactor for a mutase known as methylmalonyl-CoA-mutase. This enzyme converts methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl CoA and is important in the catabolism of various aminoacids and fatty acids. These processes may also require pyridoxine (vitamin B6) as a cofactor.

Unlike cobalamin acquired from dietary sources, pharmacologic sources provide either cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin. Gastrointestinal absorption is saturable. After a 5–50 mcg dose, the maximum amount of absorbed B12 is 1.5 mcg. Dairy products, fish, and shellfish appear to continuously increase plasma vitamin B12 levels with increased daily intake. Meat and meat products, on the other hand, appear to have a plateau effect beyond 4 μg/day. Beyond 10 μg/day, plasma vitamin B12 levels plateau, independent of the food source.

### Vitamin B, folate, and the methionine remethylation cycle-biochemistry, pathways, and regulation [^115UB1L8]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B 12 (cobalamin, Cbl) is a nutrient essential to human health. Due to its complex structure and dual cofactor forms, Cbl undergoes a complicated series of absorptive and processing steps before serving as cofactor for the enzymes methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthase. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is required for the catabolism of certain (branched-chain) amino acids into an anaplerotic substrate in the mitochondrion, and dysfunction of the enzyme itself or in production of its cofactor adenosyl-Cbl result in an inability to successfully undergo protein catabolism with concomitant mitochondrial energy disruption. Methionine synthase catalyzes the methyl-Cbl dependent (re)methylation of homocysteine to methionine within the methionine cycle; a reaction required to produce this essential amino acid and generate S-adenosylmethionine, the most important cellular methyl-donor. Disruption of methionine synthase has wide-ranging implications for all methylation-dependent reactions, including epigenetic modification, but also for the intracellular folate pathway, since methionine synthase uses 5-methyltetrahydrofolate as a one-carbon donor. Folate-bound one-carbon units are also required for deoxythymidine monophosphate and de novo purine synthesis; therefore, the flow of single carbon units to each of these pathways must be regulated based on cellular needs. This review provides an overview on Cbl metabolism with a brief description of absorption and intracellular metabolic pathways. It also provides a description of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism and its intersection with Cbl at the methionine cycle. Finally, a summary of recent advances in understanding of how both pathways are regulated is presented.

### Is oral vitamin B12 as effective as intramuscular injection? [^113QvQJe]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Can vitamin B 12 deficiency be treated orally. Evidence-Based Answer In patients with vitaminB 12 deficiency, two oral regimens have been shown to achieve neurologic and hematologic response in the short term. Effective dosages were 2, 000 mcg daily or 1, 000 mcg daily for 10 days, then weekly and monthly. Practice Pointers Vitamin B 12 deficiency causes macrocytic anemia, fatigue, loss of appetite, and mood disturbances. It also can cause serious neurologic and neuropsychiatric illness such as paresthesias, ataxia, and memory loss. The process of vitamin B 12 absorption can be impaired at the level of the stomach, where intrinsic factor is produced, or at the level of the terminal ileum, where intrinsic factor bound to vitamin B 12 is absorbed. Medications such as metformin or antacids also can impair absorption. A small amount of vitamin B 12 is absorbed by passive diffusion without intrinsic factor. Traditionally, vitamin B.

12 replacement has been administered intramuscularly because absorption through the gastrointestinal tract is deficient. However, this route is less convenient for patients than oral medication and may not be covered by health insurance. Because a small amount of vitamin B 12 is absorbed by passive diffusion, megadoses of oral vitamin B 12 medication have been used as a cost-saving and more comfortable alternative to intramuscular B 12 administration.

1. Vidal-Alaball and colleagues searched for randomized controlled trials comparing oral with intramuscular administration of vitamin B.
12. They found two trials with a total of 93 patients who were followed for between 90 days and four months. All patients had vitamin B 12 deficiency, defined as vitamin B 12 level less than 244 pg per mL. Some patients had conditions that cause malabsorption from the gut, but no patients with inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease were included in either study.

One study used a daily oral dosage of 2, 000 mcg, and the other an oral dosage of 1, 000 mcg daily for 10 days, then weekly for four weeks, then monthly for life. In both studies, high-dose oral B 12 was as effective as intramuscular injection at achieving neurologic and hematologic response.

What is vitamin B 12?

Vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) is a water soluble vitamin required for several physiological processes, including normal nervous system functioning, and red blood cell development and maturation. It has antioxidant effects, is a co-factor in mitochondrial energy metabolism, and contributes to DNA synthesis, the methylation cycle, and epigenetic regulation.B 12 is present in foods of animal origin, such as meat, eggs, and milk, or via food fortification. Healthy adults require an average intake of 4–7 mcg daily to maintain B 12 status.

Vitamin B12 requirements in parenteral nutrition — adult dose and rationale: Adult parenteral multivitamin products provide 5 mcg/d of crystalline cyanocobalamin. Serum B12 tends to be elevated in chronic parenteral nutrition, usually in the 700- to 900-pg/mL range, but there are several good reasons to continue this generous 5 mcg/d dose. Reasons include that although this dose yields serum B12 at the upper limits of normal there is no evidence for a B12 toxicity syndrome, high serum levels may reflect daily parenteral infusion rather than elevated tissue levels, parenteral B12 enters the systemic rather than portal circulation with first-pass uptake of 50% by the liver and 25% of systemic blood first passing the kidneys leading to probable urinary loss, B12 secreted into bile may not be recaptured due to loss of ileal receptors, and smokers have increased urinary B12 losses as thiocyanate.

In patients with tobacco amblyopia or B12 deficiency who smoke, increased urinary thiocyanate losses mean they should receive hydroxocobalamin, which is a potent cyanide antagonist; this compound is currently available only in parenteral form.

### Holotranscobalamin, a marker of vitamin B-12 status: analytical aspects and clinical utility [^113WenGk]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Approximately one-quarter of circulating cobalamin (vitamin B-12) binds to transcobalamin (holoTC) and is thereby available for the cells of the body. For this reason, holoTC is also referred to as active vitamin B-12. HoloTC was suggested as an optimal marker of early vitamin B-12 deficiency > 20 y ago. This suggestion led to the development of suitable assays for measurement of the compound and clinical studies that aimed to show the benefit of measurement of holoTC rather than of vitamin B-12. Today holoTC can be analyzed by 3 methods: direct measurement of the complex between transcobalamin and vitamin B-12, measurement of vitamin B-12 attached to transcobalamin, or measurement of the amount of transcobalamin saturated with vitamin B-12. These 3 methods give similar results, but direct measurement of holoTC complex is preferable in the clinical setting from a practical point of view. HoloTC measurement has proven useful for the identification of the few patients who suffer from transcobalamin deficiency. In addition, holoTC is part of the CobaSorb test and therefore useful for assessment of vitamin B-12 absorption. Clinical studies that compare the ability of holoTC and vitamin B-12 to identify individuals with vitamin B-12 deficiency (elevated concentration of methylmalonic acid) suggest that holoTC performs better than total vitamin B-12. To date, holoTC has not been used for population-based assessments of vitamin B-12 status, but we suggest that holoTC is a better marker than total vitamin B-12 for such studies.

### Oral vitamin B12 supplementation in pernicious anemia: a prospective cohort study [^111A3cQx]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The absorption of vitamin B12 is hindered in pernicious anemia (PA) owing to intrinsic factor deficiency. Traditionally, intramuscular vitamin B12 injections were the standard treatment, bypassing the impaired absorption. Although there is potential for oral vitamin B12 supplementation through passive enteral absorption, it is not commonly prescribed in PA owing to limited studies assessing its efficacy.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the efficacy of oral vitamin B12 supplementation in PA.

Methods

We enrolled participants diagnosed with incident vitamin B12 deficiency related to PA. The diagnosis of PA was based on the presence of classical immune gastritis and of anti-intrinsic factor and/or antiparietal cell antibodies. To evaluate the vitamin B12 status, we measured total plasma vitamin B12, plasma homocysteine, and plasma methylmalonic acid (pMMA) concentration and urinary methylmalonic acid-to-creatinine ratio. Participants were treated with oral cyanocobalamin at a dosage of 1000 μg/d throughout the study duration. Clinical and biological vitamin B12 deficiency related features were prospectively and systematically assessed over the 1-y study duration.

Results

We included 26 patients with vitamin B12 deficiency revealing PA. Following 1 mo of oral vitamin B12 supplementation, 88.5% of patients were no longer deficient in vitamin B12, with significant improvement of plasma vitamin B12 [407 (297–485) compared with 148 (116–213) pmol/L; P < 0.0001], plasma homocysteine [13.5 (10.9–29.8) compared with 18.6 (13.7–46.8) μmol/L; P < 0.0001], and pMMA [0.24 (0.16–0.38) compared with 0.56 (0.28–1.09) pmol/L; P < 0.0001] concentrations than those at baseline. The enhancement of these biological parameters persisted throughout the 12-month follow-up, with no patients showing vitamin B12 deficiency by the end of the follow-up period. The median time to reverse initial vitamin B12 deficiency abnormalities ranged from 1 mo for hemolysis to 4 mo for mucosal symptoms.

Conclusions

Oral supplementation with 1000 μg/d of cyanocobalamin has been shown to improve vitamin B12 deficiency in PA.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: is routine screening and supplementation justified? [^1136ppXf]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin B12 or cobalamin is a water soluble vitamin that plays a very fundamental role in DNA synthesis, optimal haemopoesis and neurological function. The clinical picture of vitamin B12 deficiency hence, is predominantly of features of haematological and neuro-cognitive dysfunction.

This review will mainly discuss the physiological roles of vitamin B12, the varied pathophysiological mechanisms of vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and perspectives on screening for vitamin B12 deficiency and supplementation of vitamin B12 among diabetic patients.

Absorption of vitamin B12

The principal source of vitamin B12 is animal proteins. The preliminary step in the metabolism of vitamin B12 involves its release from animal sources, a process mediated by the action of pepsin and gastric acid. After the release, dietary vitamin B12 binds to the R-protein secreted by the salivary glands. In the duodenum, in the presence of an alkaline medium and pancreatic proteases, the R- protein is hydrolysed to release vitamin B12 which later binds with the intrinsic factor (IF) secreted by the gastric parietal cells.

The vitamin B12 –IF complex is highly resistant to proteolytic degradation. The complex attaches at its specific receptors on the mucosa of the terminal ileum, a site where its absorption occurs. This stage of vitamin B12 absorption is calcium mediated.

The intracellular vitamin B12 is released following IF degradation. This free vitamin B12 attaches to another protein carrier, transcobalamin –II (TC-II) and is later released into the circulation. This vitamin B12 – TC-II complex, also referred to as holo TC-II is then actively taken up by the liver, bone marrow and other vital body cells. The liver serves as the principal storage site of up to 90% of the body's total vitamin B12.

A disruption in any of the described steps above will result into clinical or biochemical vitamin B12 deficiency. This includes insufficient dietary intake especially among alcoholics and vegetarians and malabsorption due to several conditions like chronic atrophic gastritis mainly in the elderly, pernicious anemia, celiac disease, chronic pancreatitis and drugs like metformin and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Cyanocobalamin is indicated for Vitamin B12deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions:

Addisonian (pernicious) anemia

Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy

Fish tapeworm infestation

Malignancy of pancreas or bowel

Folic acid deficiency

It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin.

Requirements of Vitamin B12in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation.

Cyanocobalamin injection is also suitable for the Vitamin B12absorption test (Schilling test).

Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) deficiency — background and bariatric surgery: Vitamin B12/cyanocobalamin is a water-soluble nutrient cleaved from its protein by the hydrochloric acid in the stomach, then combined with a protein called intrinsic factor, and then absorbed in the terminal ileum; after bariatric surgery, vitamin B12 deficiency may be reported after sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and BPD-DS, can be mitigated with appropriate nutrition and a high-quality multivitamin supplement, and post-operative vitamin B12 levels are often monitored.

Vitamin B12 — intake, storage, enterohepatic cycling, and excretion are summarized as follows: In the United States, the median adult B12 intake from food is 5 mcg/d for men and 3.5 mcg/d for women. The liver takes up 50% of dietary B12 and provides the main storage site, and the total body B12 content is 1–3 mg. Vitamin B12 has an enterohepatic circulation, and each day, about 1 to 4 μg is secreted into the bile and can be recaptured if intrinsic factor (IF) is present. If IF is absent or the distal ileum has been resected, clinical B12 deficiency can develop in a few months, whereas B12 deficiency in vegans develops over many years. After a parenteral injection of B12, if the circulating vitamin exceeds transcobalamin (TC) binding capacity, the excess is secreted in the urine. Vitamin B12 toxicity has not been described.

### Relationship between serum B12 concentrations and mortality: experience in NHANES [^117VYrSM]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient which has an important role in many processes in the body, including DNA synthesis and DNA methylation, synthesis of blood cells, and nerve function. Metabolically, vitamin B12 is closely associated with folate in the regulation of key elements involving the transfer of one-carbon units. Animal products like meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and milk are the exclusive dietary sources for vitamin B12 in human nutrition. The uptake of vitamin B12 in the body is rather complex, and both salivary production of certain B12-binding proteins, intrinsic factor in the stomach, gastric acid, and pancreatic enzymes play a role in absorption which ultimately takes places in the ileum. Deficiency may occur either when the food does not contain sufficient animal products or when there is interference in the uptake and absorptive mechanisms, although several other factors, including exposure to nitrous oxide, may be involved.

Excess intake of vitamin B12 or treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency with intramuscular injections has been considered safe for over half a century, as the compound is water-soluble. Any excess of an injected dose will be excreted in the urine, and the ability to absorb excessive quantities of orally administered B12 is limited by the restricted capacity of the receptors in the ileum. Nevertheless, there have been several reports on the association between serum B12 concentrations and increased risk of disease, i.e. risk of lung cancer, or even mortality. Although most epidemiologic studies showed no association between serum B12 and cardiovascular disease, a recent paper suggested that higher serum B12 concentrations were associated with increased risk of mortality. However, it should be noted that a causal relationship between serum B12 concentrations and subsequent disease or mortality has never been demonstrated. Increased serum B12 concentrations may be a proxy for increased intake of red meat, inflammation due to other chronic diseases, or intake of supplements as a complementary therapy for other conditions. One very recent paper using data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study in postmenopausal women showed no association between vitamin B12 (supplement) intake and risk of lung cancer.

Metformin induced vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with T2DM

In the absence of contraindications like renal and hepatic dysfunction, recent guidelines advocate for the use of metformin as the first line glucose lowering agent concurrently with life style modification approaches. Despite its very superior glycemic lowering effect, metformin has for long been shown to decrease vitamin B12 levels. In one early randomised controlled trial by DeFronzo et al. metformin decreased the serum vitamin B12 levels by 22% and 29% compared to placebo and glyburide respectively. This side effect of metformin has been demonstrated again in several ensuing cross sectional studies, case reports and randomised controlled trials.

The risk of developing metformin associated vitamin B12 deficiency is greatly influenced by increasing age, metformin dose and duration of use. In a nested case control study performed among 155 adult Chinese DM patients on metformin and 310 controls, every 1 g/day increase in the metformin dose conferred an odds ratio of 2.9 (95% confidence interval, 2.15–3.87) for developing vitamin B12 deficiency. Among patients using metformin for ≥ 3 years, the adjusted odds ratio was 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.46–3.91) compared with those who had received metformin for ≤ 3 years.

Decrease in vitamin B12 absorption and levels following metformin use typically starts as early as the 4 th month. Clinically overt features of vitamin B12 deficiency manifest by 5–10 years owing to the large body stores in the liver mainly that are not quickly depleted.

The proposed mechanisms to explain metformin induced vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with T2DM include: alterations in small bowel motility which stimulates bacterial overgrowth and consequential vitamin B12 deficiency, competitive inhibition or inactivation of vitamin B12 absorption, alterations in intrinsic factor (IF) levels and interaction with the cubulin endocytic receptor. Metformin has also been shown to inhibit the calcium dependent absorption of the vitamin B12-IF complex at the terminal ileum. This inhibitory effect is reversed with calcium supplementation.

Figure 3
Physiological mechanisms of vitamin B12 absorption. Following the consumption of a meal rich in vitamin B12, including foods such as fish, chicken, milk, yoghurt, and eggs, vitamin B12 or Cbl binds to R secreted by saliva, forming a complex that protects it from degradation. Vitamin B12 in food is initially bound to proteins and is released in the stomach through the action of gastric acid and pepsin. Once freed, the vitamin binds to R‐binders (haptocorrins) secreted by saliva and the gastric mucosa. In the small intestine, pancreatic proteases break down the R‐binders, freeing vitamin B12, which subsequently binds to IF, a glycoprotein produced by parietal cells in the stomach. The resulting vitamin B12‐intrinsic factor complex travels to the distal ileum, where specific receptors recognise and mediate its absorption through receptor‐mediated endocytosis. Within the intestinal epithelial cells, intrinsic factor is degraded, releasing vitamin B12 into the intercellular flow bound to TCII, a transport protein. This complex is then transported via the bloodstream to tissues, particularly the liver, which serves as the primary storage site, holding up to 3 mg of vitamin B12. Efficient enterohepatic recycling further minimises losses, ensuring the body's vitamin B12 supply is maintained. Cbl, cobalamin; IF, intrinsic factor; R, haptocorrins; TCII, transcobalamin II.

### Update on vitamin B12 deficiency [^114wg4C9]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin B(12) (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and elevated serum homocysteine levels, especially in older persons. There are a number of risk factors for vitamin B(12) deficiency, including prolonged use of metformin and proton pump inhibitors. No major medical organizations, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, have published guidelines on screening asymptomatic or low-risk adults for vitamin B(12) deficiency, but high-risk patients, such as those with malabsorptive disorders, may warrant screening. The initial laboratory assessment of a patient with suspected vitamin B(12) deficiency should include a complete blood count and a serum vitamin B(12) level. Measurements of serum vitamin B(12) may not reliably detect deficiency, and measurement of serum homocysteine and/or methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low normal levels of vitamin B(12). Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B(12) (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration in correcting the deficiency, regardless of etiology. Because crystalline formulations are better absorbed than naturally occurring vitamin B(12), patients older than 50 years and strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B(12) and vitamin B(12) supplements, rather than attempting to get vitamin B(12) strictly from dietary sources. Administration of vitamin B(12) to patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients or alter the cognitive decline of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.

### Comparing the efficacy and tolerability of a new daily oral vitamin B12 formulation and intermittent intramuscular vitamin B12 in normalizing low cobalamin levels: a randomized, open-label, parallel-group study [^112GQcN7]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B(12) deficiency is routinely treated with parenteral dosing and less often with high-dose oral vitamin B(12). Oral vitamin B(12) formulations have low bioavailability in patients with malabsorption and are considered less reliable than parenteral treatments.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profile of a new proprietary oral vitamin B(12) formulation (oral B(12)) with intramuscular (IM) vitamin B(12) (IM B(12)) in restoring normal serum B(12) concentrations in patients with low cobalamin levels (< 350 pg/mL).

Methods

Patients were recruited from 5 centers and randomly assigned to receive oral B(12) 1000 μg, taken daily for 90 days, or IM B(12) 1000 μg, given on study days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 30, 60, and 90. The patients were aged ≥ 60 years or aged ≥ 18 years and had gastrointestinal abnormalities or were on a restricted diet. The primary efficacy outcome compared the proportion of patients in each treatment arm in whom cobalamin levels were normalized (≥ 350 ng/mL) following 60 days of treatment. Secondary objectives included comparing the efficacy of the 2 formulations after 90 days of treatment, assessing time to normalization of B(12) levels, and evaluating the changes in the levels of biomarkers methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HC). The effect on holotranscobalamin II (active B(12)) levels was assessed as an exploratory end point and correlated to serum cobalamin levels in both treatment groups. Blood samples were collected at baseline (day 1) and on days 15, 31, 61, and 91.

Results

Fifty patients were recruited. Forty-eight patients (96.0%) completed the study (22 patients [91.7%] in the oral B(12) group and 26 patients [100%] in the IM B(12) group). All patients (100%) in both treatment groups and in both populations had a cobalamin level ≥ 350 pg/mL on day 61 and maintained it on day 91. The difference between the IM and oral treatment groups did not reach the planned level of statistical significance (P < 0.05) for mean percent change from baseline (PCFB) in serum cobalamin levels on day 61 and day 91. The difference between the IM and oral treatment groups did not reach the planned level of statistical significance for mean PCFB in serum MMA levels on day 61. There was a statistical difference between the IM and oral treatment groups for mean PCFB in serum MMA levels on day 91 (P = 0.033), with lower values in the oral B(12) group. The difference between the IM and oral treatment groups did not reach the planned level of statistical significance for mean PCFB in plasma HC levels on day 61 and day 91. All patients in each treatment group achieved normalization of serum cobalamin levels by day 15. All patients in both treatment groups and in both populations had plasma holotranscobalamin levels ≥ 40 pmol/L on day 61 and on day 91. No statistical analysis was planned or performed for safety end points, which were reported only descriptively. Most observed adverse effects were considered mild or moderate in intensity. All adverse effects that were considered severe in intensity were also considered by the investigator to be not related to the study drug.

Conclusions

In this selected study population comprising individuals with low cobalamin levels but who otherwise were in good health, patients received oral B(12) (1000 μg/d) or IM B(12) (1000 μg in 9 injections over 3 months) for a total of 3 months. Both the oral and IM formulations were effective in restoring normal levels of serum cobalamin in all patients studied (100%). Both formulations used in this study were well tolerated at the dose studied. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01312831.

### Reframing micronutrient deficiencies for modern times: a review [^114Ru4BF]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Presentation and Pathophysiology for Vitamin B12 Deficiency

Vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies are often evaluated together as their roles are intertwined. Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, is found in animal derived foods where it is bound to protein. Very little is found in plant-based foods unless the product is fortified. Gastric acid, pepsin, intrinsic factor, and pancreatic proteases need to be present to aid absorption which occurs in the ileum. Conditions that interfere with B12-intrinsic factor formation, decrease gastric acid, or disrupt absorption at the ileum can result in deficiency. Once absorbed, the active form of the vitamin is bound to transcobalamin II while the inactive form is bound to haptocorrin.

The liver stores approximately 2-3mg of the vitamin which is also reabsorbed via the enterohepatic pathway. Given a typical daily requirement of 2.4mcg, it would take years to deplete stores. The vitamin is essential for DNA synthesis, methylation, production of hematopoietic cell as well as maintenance of the myelin sheath.

Patients often present with glossitis, cognitive changes or a symmetrical neuropathy involving dorsal and lateral columns of the spinal cord causing weakness, ataxia, and paresthesias. Laboratory studies may reveal macrocytosis or hypersegmented neutrophils. In extreme cases, a non-autoimmune hemolytic anemia with associated elevated LDH may be present due to abnormal DNA synthesis. The absence of an anemia should not exclude the disease if other symptoms are present.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^116ePRUh]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cobalamin, or vitamin B12 (B12), is an essential vitamin normally acquired through absorption in the enteric system in mammals. Deficiency in humans can be caused by a lack of intake (eg, vegan diet) or by any disease or procedure of the digestive tract impairing the absorption of B12. After depletion of B12 stores, signs of deficiency such as hematological and neurological symptoms may develop, including megaloblastic anemia and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. The latter presents as a spinal syndrome (sensory ataxia, paresthesia, weakness, etc.) involving multiple tracts, principally the posterior columns. Qualitative pathological analyses of the tissue revealed a degeneration with vacuolization of the tracts included in the white matter (WM), suggesting that vitamin B12 might be important for maintenance of intact myelination. However, the exact cellular substrate that is impacted by B12 deficiency or insufficiency has not yet been elucidated. In addition to affecting general cognition and memory, vitamin B12 deficiency may even lead to dementia and psychosis, suggesting a broader dependence of the brain on B12. Nonetheless, the VITACOG study established that B vitamin supplementation including B12 in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) leads to both functional and structural benefits. According to their foundational work, B12 supplementation slows the progression of brain atrophy in MCI and of clinical decline in multiple areas of cognitive testing. Moreover, B12 deficiency is associated with a higher burden of WM hyperintensities (WMH) in the brain, which could indicate microstructural changes (ie, ependymal disruption or chronic ischemic changes) reflecting overall brain health.

### Water-soluble vitamins in people with low glomerular filtration rate or on dialysis: a review [^113sca58]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Homocysteine and Cardiovascular and Mortality Outcomes

Because the intrinsic factor pathway is saturable and independent of intrinsic factor absorption has limited capacity, leading to the absorption of about 1% of an oral dose, intravenous therapy has the potential to raise B12 levels to a larger extent than achievable with oral therapy. It has been suggested that these pharmacologic effects may lead to more dramatic homocysteine lowering than therapeutic or near-therapeutic replacements. Intravenous hydroxycobalamin given to vitamin B12-replete patients on dialysis led to 14-fold increases in B12 and 23% reductions in homocysteine. In a randomized crossover trial, hydroxycobalamin 1 mg intravenously every 4 weeks resulted in a 40-fold increase in serum B12 levels in patients on hemodialysis, whereas cyanocobalamin levels increased 10-fold; however, reduction in homocysteine was similar with both treatments, around 33%. Oral vitamin B12 combined with folic acid and pyridoxine has been shown, in randomized controlled trials, to reduce total homocysteine levels by 30–50% in patients with low glomerular filtration rate or end-stage renal disease.

In a recent, multicenter, randomized trial, 650 patients with end-stage renal disease who had average homocysteine levels of 28.2–30.0 μmol/l were randomized to two B vitamin regimens given postdialysis. The active regimen consisted of 5 mg folic acid, 50 μg cobalamin, and 10 mg vitamin B6, whereas the placebo regimen consisted of 0.2 mg folic acid, 4 μg cobalamin, and 1 mg vitamin B6. Homocysteine levels fell significantly with active treatment (−10.4 μmol/l vs. −1.8 μmol/l). However, there was no difference in all-cause mortality (31% vs. 28%) or cardiovascular events (25% vs. 30%). Interestingly, the change in cobalamin levels from baseline was similar in both groups despite differing doses of cobalamin supplementation (100–125 pmol/l rise).

Multiple studies have demonstrated similar effects of vitamin B12 therapy on homocysteine levels and a lack of efficacy with regard to cardiovascular outcomes in patients with low glomerular filtration rate and on dialysis–.

Cognitive Effects

As in the nonrenal population, supplementation has not been shown to improve cognitive outcomes. A 1-year study involving patients with low glomerular filtration rate and patients on dialysis found that supplementation with a vitamin B complex reduced homocysteine levels in the treatment group, but had no beneficial outcomes on cognitive functioning in comparison with placebo.

### Intestinal absorption of water-soluble vitamins: an update [^114qADBm]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The molecular biology revolution has led to a significant improvement in our understanding of biological and physiological processes. Such expansion of knowledge has also covered the field of intestinal absorption of water-soluble vitamins and is the subject of this review.

Recent Findings

Impressive progress has been made in the understanding of the mechanisms and regulation of transport of water-soluble vitamins at the cellular and molecular levels. In addition, the 5' regulatory regions of the genes that encode a number of the involved transporters have been cloned and characterized in vitro and in vivo in transgenic mice, thus providing important information about transcriptional regulation of these events. Furthermore, confocal imaging of live intestinal epithelial cells has led to significant progress in understanding the mechanisms involved in intracellular trafficking and membrane targeting of the carrier proteins and how clinical mutations lead to interference with transport. Finally, the identification in the large intestine of efficient and specialized carrier-mediated systems that are capable of absorbing a number of the bacterially synthesized vitamins (thiamin, folate, biotin, riboflavin, pantothenic acid) has raised the possibility that this source of vitamins may play a role in regulating (fine tuning) the normal body homeostasis of these vitamins, and especially the vitamin level in the local colonocytes.

Summary

Water-soluble vitamin absorption involves regulated and specific mechanisms. Interference with the function of these mechanisms may lead to deficiency. The large intestine is capable of absorbing water-soluble vitamins that are synthesized by the normal microflora.

### Oral cobalamin therapy for the treatment of patients with food-cobalamin malabsorption [^113pozav]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The standard treatment for cobalamin (vitamin B(12)) deficiency involves regular intramuscular cobalamin injection. It has been suggested that oral cobalamin therapy may be effective for treating patients who have food-cobalamin malabsorption.

Subjects and Methods

We prospectively studied 10 patients with cobalamin deficiency and well-established food-cobalamin malabsorption who received 3000 microg or 5000 microg of oral crystalline cyanocobalamin once a week for at least 3 months. Complete blood counts and serum cobalamin, homocysteine, and folate levels were determined at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. Patients were reexamined after 6 months.

Results

After 3 months of treatment, all patients had increased hemoglobin levels (mean increase, 1.9 g/dL; 95% confidence interval: 0.9 to 3.9 g/dL; P < 0.01 compared with baseline) and decreased erythrocyte cell volume (mean decrease, 7.8 fL; 95% confidence interval: 0.9 to 16.5 fL; P < 0.001). However, 2 patients had only minor, if any, responses. Serum cobalamin levels were increased in all 8 patients in whom it was measured.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that moderate doses of crystalline cyanocobalamin given orally may be an effective treatment for food-cobalamin malabsorption.

### Synopsis of the 2020 U.S. VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of adult overweight and obesity [^114aoCvY]. Military Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) and weight loss: Vitamin B-12 has a very limited role in promoting weight loss, and there are no studies evaluating weight loss with vitamin B-12 injections, tablets, sublingual pills, or drinks. Conversely, B-12 deficiency has been associated with weight loss, particularly after bariatric surgical procedures, and can lead to permanent nerve damage if left untreated; no weight loss should be anticipated as a result of the use of exogenous vitamin B-12, injection site reaction might be anticipated if that route is chosen, and in patients with normal renal function a hypervitaminosis state is unlikely.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: a population-based cohort study [^112cxq29]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

The underlying pathogenesis leading to high Cbl levels is poorly elucidated, with a few exceptions. It is not thought to involve increased Cbl intake because intestinal absorption capacity is saturable and high physiological consumption does not increase plasma Cbl levels substantially. Only Cbl therapy in the form of injections or extremely high oral doses can produce high circulating levels, and in this study, patients treated with Cbl were excluded. We therefore conclude that the mechanisms resulting in high Cbl levels may be related to malignant pathogenesis. Our recent study showed that levels of the circulating Cbl binding protein haptocorrin were high in patients with high plasma Cbl levels. Moreover, cancer was associated with high Cbl and high haptocorrin levels. This protein originates from a variety of tissues, but its physiological function remains unknown. It is elevated in patients with some cancer types and has been suggested as a marker for disease progression. Thus, haptocorrin may be a candidate factor to include in future studies of the possible pathogenic mechanisms leading to high Cbl levels in cancer patients, in particular for the novel associations demonstrated in this study.

In conclusion, our study showed that high plasma Cbl levels increased the risk of subsequently diagnosed cancer, mostly within the first year of follow-up. However, this association was not present for all cancer types. Although our results may have clinical implications for interpreting high Cbl levels, further studies are warranted to examine the possible diagnostic value of high plasma Cbl levels.

### Mandatory fortification of the food supply with cobalamin: an idea whose time has not yet come [^113QcKaK]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

The success of folic acid fortification has generated consideration of similar fortification with cobalamin for its own sake but more so to mitigate possible neurologic risks from increased folate intake by cobalamin-deficient persons. However, the folate model itself, the success of which was predicted by successful clinical trials and the known favorable facts of high folic acid bioavailability and the infrequency of folate malabsorption, may not apply to cobalamin fortification. Cobalamin bioavailability is more restricted than folic acid and is unfortunately poorest in persons deficient in cobalamin. Moreover, clinical trials to demonstrate actual health benefits of relevant oral doses have not yet been done in persons with mild subclinical deficiency, who are the only practical targets of cobalamin fortification because > 94% of persons with clinically overt cobalamin deficiency have severe malabsorption and therefore cannot respond to normal fortification doses. However, it is only in the severely malabsorptive disorders, such as pernicious anemia, not subclinical deficiency, that neurologic deterioration following folic acid therapy has been described to date. It is still unknown whether mild deficiency states, which usually arise from normal absorption or only food-bound cobalamin malabsorption, have real health consequences or how often they progress to overt clinical cobalamin deficiency. Reports of cognitive or other risks in the common subclinical deficiency state, although worrisome, have been inconsistent. Moreover, their observational nature proved neither causative connections nor documented health benefits. Extensive work, especially randomized clinical trials, must be done before mandatory dietary intervention on a national scale can be justified.

### Folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin D status in healthy and active home-dwelling people over 70 years [^115x3v5a]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The supply of nutrients such as vitamin D, cobalamin and folate is sometimes critical for the general population in many countries around the world. Older people in particular are at risk of insufficient intake or deficiency of these nutrients due to age-related dysfunction (e.g. reduced mucosal integrity) or an unbalanced diet. This is supported by the fact that diet-related metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes or cognitive and neuromuscular dysfunction, increase with age.

1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D, is important not only for bone and tooth formation, but also for the immune system and the neuropsychiatric function. The primary determinant of vitamin D status is not dietary intake, but endogenous synthesis, which may be insufficient due to reduced sun exposure during the winter months and decreased capacity with age. In conclusion, the minimum serum 25-(OH)D level can be observed in February and March, and the maximum in late summer.

There is an ongoing debate about the target concentrations of circulating 25-(OH)D needed to maintain health, and suggested cut-off values in scientific publications and advisory bodies vary. The National Academy of Medicine (NAM) and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) consider 25-(OH)D concentrations > 50 nmol/L to be sufficient for metabolic health. For the prevention of falls and fractures, some guidelines also recommend 25-(OH)D concentrations > 75 nmol/L as desirable, which is particularly important for older people with advanced degenerative bone resorption processes.

The supply of cobalamin may be critical for the elderly due to its complex absorption process, which may be affected by age-related disorders. Dietary intake may be sufficient for older omnivores, but reduced absorption due to atrophic gastritis as well as Helicobacter pylori infection, chronic use of proton pump inhibitors or lack of intrinsic factor may lead to deficits in cobalamin status. Because clinical symptoms such as macrocytic anaemia and neuropathy are not immediately apparent, cobalamin deficiency often goes unrecognised for a long time. It is therefore important to screen also apparently healthy elderly individuals for cobalamin deficiency using valid long-term markers such as holotranscobalamin (holoTC).

### The effect of recombinant human intrinsic factor on the uptake of vitamin B12 in patients with evident vitamin B12 deficiency [^116MTS3t]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

We report on the use of recombinant human intrinsic factor (rhIF) in a new vitamin B12 absorption test. Holotranscobalamin (holoTC) was measured before and 24 hours after intake of three 9-mg doses of vitamin B12 (B12) and again 24 hours after intake of the same dose of B12 together with rhIF (rhIF-B12). Nine patients with evident vitamin B12 deficiency had a significantly higher increase in holoTC after intake of rhIF-B12 than after intake of B12. Twenty-eight patients with suspected vitamin B12 deficiency showed no additional increase in holoTC after intake of rhIF-B12. We conclude that rhIF promotes B12 absorption among patients with evident vitamin B12 deficiency.

### Elevated serum cobalamin levels in childhood: a retrospective analysis [^111ttj6R]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin, [Cbl]) is a water-soluble vitamin primarily sourced from animal-derived foods. In humans, dietary proteins that contain Cbl are enzymatically hydrolyzed in the stomach and intestines, releasing the vitamin. Subsequently, the liberated Cbl binds to intrinsic factor (IF), a glycoprotein secreted by gastric parietal cells. The resulting IF-Cbl complex is actively absorbed in the terminal ileum and then released into the portal circulation. Within plasma, Cbl is bound either to transcobalamin II (hTC), its biologically active transporter, or to storage proteins collectively referred to as haptocorrins (HC), which include transcobalamin I and transcobalamin III. Approximately 6–20% of circulating Cbl is bound to hTC, whereas 80–94% is associated with HC. hTC is predominantly synthesized by hepatocytes and undergoes renal reabsorption. Vitamin B12 plays critical roles in nucleotide synthesis and methyl group transfer reactions. In pediatric populations, deficiency may manifest as megaloblastic anemia and neurological deficits.

Elevated serum Cbl levels are often regarded as benign by clinicians due to their asymptomatic nature, and there is no clear consensus regarding their clinical significance. The most commonly identified cause of elevated Cbl levels is high-dose Cbl supplementation. However, elevated Cbl levels have also been documented in conditions such as myeloproliferative disorders, leukemia, solid tumors, as well as liver and kidney diseases. Elevated serum Cbl may either be a consequence of an underlying pathology or represent its initial manifestation. Due to the scarcity of extensive studies, its interpretation remains challenging. Nevertheless, some studies in adults suggest associations between elevated serum Cbl levels and increased mortality and malignancies. In contrast, research investigating elevated Cbl levels in pediatric populations remains considerably limited.

In children with elevated serum Cbl levels, the underlying etiological factors remain largely unknown. Furthermore, there is insufficient information regarding the short- and long-term clinical consequences and appropriate management strategies for this condition. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and laboratory findings in children presenting with markedly elevated Cbl levels, with the objective of identifying potential underlying causes and outcomes.

### Influence of cobalamin deficiency compared with that of cobalamin absorption on serum holo-transcobalamin II [^114YUcVG]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Cobalamin attached to transcobalamin II (TC II), known as holo-TC II, is the active cobalamin fraction taken up by tissues. Holo-TC II is also the form in which absorbed cobalamin enters the circulation from the ileum. Therefore, holo-TC II has been proposed variously as a marker of cobalamin adequacy, cobalamin absorption, or both, including even its advocacy as a surrogate Schilling test. Such claims carry conflicting diagnostic implications because metabolic adequacy and absorption are not identical.

Objective

The objective was to examine metabolic and absorptive influences on holo-TC II.

Design

Treated patients with pernicious anemia (PA), who have abnormal absorption but a normal metabolic status, were chosen as the model to differentiate between the effects of the 2 cobalamin-related characteristics. Serum holo-TC II and indexes of cobalamin metabolism in 23 treated patients were compared with those of 6 untreated PA patients (abnormal absorption and metabolic status) and 33 control subjects (normal absorption and metabolic status).

Results

Holo-TC II, which correlated directly with cobalamin and inversely with homocysteine, was significantly higher in treated PA patients in metabolic remission than in untreated PA patients (74 ± 59 compared with 9 ± 6 pmol/L) and was significantly lower than in control subjects (105 ± 58 pmol/L), although the latter difference was small and the values overlapped greatly.

Conclusions

Metabolic cobalamin status is a major determinant of serum holo-TC II. Absorption status may have mild influence as well, although other explanations remain possible. Serum holo-TC II cannot be used clinically to diagnose cobalamin malabsorption because of overlap with normal values. The influences on holo-TC II are complex and require careful analysis.

### The importance of methylmalonic acid dosage on the assessment of patients with neurological manifestations following bariatric surgery [^1168W7K2]. Obesity Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 or cyanocobalamin is an important substance that is included in several metabolic pathways. Its deficiency is a common event after bariatric surgery, decreasing the vitamin B12 absorption after almost all of the stomach and duodenum are eliminated from the digestion process. Neurological manifestations of cyanocobalamin deficiency are not uncommon. We report a case of a young woman who developed ataxia, weakness and peripheral neuropathy after bariatric surgery, but with normal value of vitamin B12 dosage. For the diagnosis, it was necessary to dose methylmalonic acid. We discuss the importance of methylmalonic acid dosage after bariatric surgery in patients who present suspect of cyanocobalamin deficiency with normal values of this vitamin and the role of proton pump inhibitor use and vitamin supplementation in patients with early neurological presentation.

- **Hypokalemia, thrombocytosis**: use caution in severe megaloblastic anemia, as hypokalemia and sudden may occur when treated intensely.
- **Mask symptoms of folate deficiency**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as indiscriminate administration of vitamin B12 in patients with folate-deficient megaloblastic anemia may mask the diagnosis of folate deficiency.
- **Polycythemia vera**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as vitamin B12 deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera and treatment with vitamin B12 may unmask this condition.

### Holo-transcobalamin is an indicator of vitamin B-12 absorption in healthy adults with adequate vitamin B-12 status [^111NjQz3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Background

It has been hypothesized that the response of holo-transcobalamin (holo-TC) to oral vitamin B-12 may be used to assess absorption. To develop a reliable clinical absorption test that uses holo-TC, it is necessary to determine the optimal timeline for vitamin B-12 administration and postdose assessment.

Objective

The objective of this study was to assess the magnitude and patterns of change in the postabsorption response of holo-TC to oral vitamin B-12.

Design

Adult (18–49 y) male and female participants (n = 21) with normal vitamin B-12 status were given three 9-mug doses of vitamin B-12 at 6-h intervals beginning early morning (baseline) on day 1. Blood was drawn at 17 timed intervals over the course of 3 d for the analysis of holo-TC and other indicators of vitamin B-12 status.

Results

Mean holo-TC increased significantly (P < 0.001) from baseline at 6 h (11%) and 24 h (50%). TC saturation increased significantly (P < 0.001) from baseline at 12.5 h (33%) and 24 h (50%). The mean cobalamin concentration changed significantly (P < 0.001) from baseline at 24 h (15%) and 48 h (14%). The ratio of holo-TC to cobalamin increased significantly (P < 0.001) at 24 h (32%).

Conclusions

The greatest increase in holo-TC was observed 24 h after ingestion of three 9-mug doses of vitamin B-12. Our results indicate that a vitamin B-12 absorption test based on measurement of holo-TC after administration of three 9-mug doses of vitamin B-12 should run for 24 h.

### Acquired and inherited disorders of cobalamin and folate in children [^113Y4iUH]. British Journal of Haematology (2006). Low credibility.

Cobalamin deficiency in the newborn usually results from cobalamin deficiency in the mother. Megaloblastic anaemia, pancytopenia and failure to thrive can be present, accompanied by neurological deficits if the diagnosis is delayed. Most cases of spina bifida and other neural tube defects result from maternal folate and/or cobalamin insufficiency in the periconceptual period. Polymorphisms in a number of genes involved in folate and cobalamin metabolism exacerbate the risk. Inborn errors of cobalamin metabolism affect its absorption, (intrinsic factor deficiency, Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome) and transport (transcobalamin deficiency) as well as its intracellular metabolism affecting adenosylcobalamin synthesis (cblA and cblB), methionine synthase function (cblE and cblG) or both (cblC, cblD and cblF). Inborn errors of folate metabolism include congenital folate malabsorption, severe methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency and formiminotransferase deficiency. The identification of disease-causing mutations in specific genes has improved our ability to diagnose many of these conditions, both before and after birth.

### Plasma absorption of cyanocobalamin Co 57… [^113dWgw6]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The eight-hour plasma absorption of cyanocobalamin Co 57 was performed in 186 patients with pernicious anemia, 40 with intestinal malabsorption, 147 with gastric resection, 51 with simple gastric achlorhydria or hypochlorhydria, and 141 controls. Patients with pernicious anemia and intestinal malabsorption could always be separated from control subjects by this method and, with the addition of hog intrinsic factor concentrate, usually from each other. The plamsa absorption test closely reflected the serum vitamin B12 concentration in untreated patients with pernicious anemia and intestinal malabsorption, but exceptions occurred in patients with gastric resection, simple hypochlorhydria, or achlorhydria. The plasma absorption test showed good correlation with the urinary excretion method. The plasma absorption of crystalline cyanocobalamin Co 57 is a valid reflection of vitamin B12 absorption in pernicious anemia and intestinal malabsorption. Doscherholmen A.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: common questions and answers [^114wHVoy]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs in approximately 2% to 3% of adults in the United States. Risk factors include malabsorptive processes, limited dietary intake of vitamin B12, use of certain medications (eg, metformin, proton pump inhibitors), and older age. Symptoms vary based on the severity of vitamin B12 deficiency but may include fatigue, brain fog, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and ataxia. Although universal screening is not recommended, testing should be considered in patients with at least one risk factor for and one clinical feature of vitamin B12 deficiency. Initial testing includes total serum vitamin B12 level, which is diagnostic for deficiency if less than 180 pg/mL. Borderline levels (180–350 pg/mL) warrant a methylmalonic acid measurement, which is diagnostic for vitamin B12 deficiency if elevated. Patients without a clear cause of deficiency should undergo further testing for atrophic gastritis with a Helicobacter pylori test and evaluation for autoantibodies associated with autoimmune gastritis. Oral vitamin B12 supplementation can be used in most patients and is noninferior to intramuscular supplementation. Intramuscular administration should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or neurologic manifestations. Vitamin B12 levels that are persistently elevated (greater than 1,000 pg/mL on two measurements) have been associated with solid tumors, hematologic malignancy, and increased risk of cardiovascular death.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^116rzU6b]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings are of critical importance for rethinking the "biologically sufficient" B12 levels. The population‐based studies that defined healthy micronutrient levels may have missed the subclinical manifestations of low or high B12 at the extremes of the population distribution that can affect people without causing overt symptoms. While the clinical features of unambiguous B12 deficiency are well defined as predominantly hematological (most conspicuously macrocytic anemia) and neurological, the condition can manifest with either hematological or neurological syndromes in isolation. Without sensitive tools to detect subtle neurological deficits, the heterogeneous nature of the symptoms remained unexplained. Notably, during and following B12 repletion therapy, patients often request higher dosing of B12 to treat their neurological symptoms, even after their hematological symptoms have resolved. Our findings support the idea that subtle neurological deficits manifest at higher levels than the current threshold defined for deficiency, and most importantly, it could provide an explanation for the often‐reported discrepancy between hematological and neurological symptoms. When B12 intake or absorption is impaired, the levels of Holo‐TC initially decrease in the blood, which can be first compensated by releasing the B12 in storage. This slow progression toward deficiency could be better described by a sliding scale of insufficiency, wherein the tissue levels decline until Holo‐TC falls below what is necessary to supply critical cells for biochemical reactions in the nervous system, and then the bone marrow. Revisiting the definition for healthy B12 levels could promote earlier intervention and prevention of cognitive decline, especially in the elderly carrying increased risk for B12 malabsorption and insufficiency. A study on an aging population previously argued for a broadening of the reference range for B12 levels in elder people, and our results further support such a shift to account for age. The elderly population may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of declining B12 availability and may benefit from a change in guidelines for what is currently defined as healthy levels of vitamin B12.

The theoretical model we are proposing with this work is that inadequate amounts of vitamin B12 could induce neurological deficits at a threshold that is higher than the one in current use (Graphical abstract). Moreover, we should work on defining a cutoff for higher B12 and study how haptocorrin might be associated with or could induce neuro‐axonal damage. Accordingly, our current understanding of optimal serum B12 may have to be revisited to account for the clinical manifestations of B12 inadequacy at both ends of the spectrum.

### The science and practice of micronutrient supplementations in nutritional anemia: an evidence-based review [^113gMevi]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Nutritional anemia is the most common type of anemia, affecting millions of people in all age groups worldwide. While inadequate access to food and nutrients can lead to anemia, patients with certain health status or medical conditions are also at increased risk of developing nutritional anemia. Iron, cobalamin, and folate are the most recognized micronutrients that are vital for the generation of erythrocytes. Iron deficiency is associated with insufficient production of hemoglobin. Deficiency of cobalamin or folate leads to impaired synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid, proteins, and cell division. Recent research has demonstrated that the status of copper and zinc in the body can significantly affect iron absorption and utilization. With an increasing number of patients undergoing bariatric surgical procedures, more cases of anemia associated with copper and zinc deficiencies have also emerged. The intestinal absorption of these 5 critical micronutrients are highly regulated and mediated by specific apical transport mechanisms in the enterocytes. Health conditions that persistently alter the histology of the upper intestinal architecture, expression, or function of these substrate-specific transporters, or the normal digestion and flow of these key micronutrients, can lead to nutritional anemia. The focus of this article is to review the science of intestinal micronutrient absorption, discuss the clinical assessment of micronutrient deficiencies in relation to anemia, and suggest an effective treatment plan and monitoring strategies using an evidence-based approach.

### Omeprazole [^116CCRXL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency

Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with omeprazole.

5.9 Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism

Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. Hypomagnesemia may lead to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia and may exacerbate underlying hypocalcemia in at-risk patients. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.

For patientsexpected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Consider monitoringmagnesium and calcium levels prior to initiation of omeprazole and periodically while on treatment in patients with a preexisting risk of hypocalcemia (e.g., hypoparathyroidism). Supplement with magnesium and/or calcium, as necessary. If hypocalcemia is refractory to treatment, consider discontinuing the PPI.

5.10 Interaction with St. John's Wort or Rifampin

Drugs which induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (such as St. John's Wort or rifampin) can substantially decrease omeprazole concentrations [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole with St. John's Wort or rifampin.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: recognition and management [^114GZbL6]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, various neuropsychiatric symptoms, and other clinical manifestations. Screening average-risk adults for vitamin B12 deficiency is not recommended. Screening may be warranted in patients with one or more risk factors, such as gastric or small intestine resections, inflammatory bowel disease, use of metformin for more than four months, use of proton pump inhibitors or histamine H2 blockers for more than 12 months, vegans or strict vegetarians, and adults older than 75 years. Initial laboratory assessment should include a complete blood count and serum vitamin B12 level. Measurement of serum methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low-normal levels of vitamin B12. Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B12 (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration for correcting anemia and neurologic symptoms. Intramuscular therapy leads to more rapid improvement and should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or severe neurologic symptoms. Absorption rates improve with supplementation; therefore, patients older than 50 years and vegans or strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B12 or take vitamin B12 supplements. Patients who have had bariatric surgery should receive 1 mg of oral vitamin B12 per day indefinitely. Use of vitamin B12 in patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease does not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, or alter cognitive decline.

ABSORPTION OF VITAMIN B12. JAMA. 1960; 173:

1031. doi: 10.1001/jama.1960.03020270057015 In pernicious anemia, the failure of transport of 1 mcg. of vitamin B12 daily across the mucosa of the whole length of the small intestine leads to a deficiency which, unless effectively treated, is lethal. This failure is due to absence in the gastric secretion of intrinsic factor, which is not known to have any other function than the facilitation of transmucosal transfer of vitamin B12. Although the broad outlines of the vitamin B12-IF relationship are fairly clear, a full understanding of the mechanisms involved is wanting. The use of vitamin B12 labeled with radioactive cobalt has helped greatly to clarify the picture, but the forms in which vitamin B12 exists in foods and the tissues of the body, the identity of IF, and the precise nature of the vitamin B12-IF complex remain to be established.

### How common is vitamin B-12 deficiency? [^112RWuW4]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

In considering the vitamin B-12 fortification of flour, it is important to know who is at risk of vitamin B-12 deficiency and whether those individuals would benefit from flour fortification. This article reviews current knowledge of the prevalence and causes of vitamin B-12 deficiency and considers whether fortification would improve the status of deficient subgroups of the population. In large surveys in the United States and the United Kingdom, approximately 6% of those aged ≥ 60 y are vitamin B-12 deficient (plasma vitamin B-12 < 148 pmol/L), with the prevalence of deficiency increasing with age. Closer to 20% have marginal status (plasma vitamin B-12: 148–221 pmol/L) in later life. In developing countries, deficiency is much more common, starting in early life and persisting across the life span. Inadequate intake, due to low consumption of animal-source foods, is the main cause of low serum vitamin B-12 in younger adults and likely the main cause in poor populations worldwide; in most studies, serum vitamin B-12 concentration is correlated with intake of this vitamin. In older persons, food-bound cobalamin malabsorption becomes the predominant cause of deficiency, at least in part due to gastric atrophy, but it is likely that most elderly can absorb the vitamin from fortified food. Fortification of flour with vitamin B-12 is likely to improve the status of most persons with low stores of this vitamin. However, intervention studies are still needed to assess efficacy and functional benefits of increasing intake of the amounts likely to be consumed in flour, including in elderly persons with varying degrees of gastric atrophy.

Effect of renal function and dose of cyanocobalamin on stroke reduction by B vitamins

Box 2
Summary of the evidence regarding B vitamins for stroke prevention

The overall results of previous trials of vitamin B therapy for the prevention of stroke might be the result of the increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in participants with impaired renal function, cancelling out the benefits observed in participants with good renal function.
Koyama and colleagues have reported that patients with renal failure have increased concentrations of thiocyanate and that coadministration of intravenous methylcobalamin and oral folate normalises hyperhomocysteinemia in haemodialysis patients. These findings, in addition to two plausible mechanisms for increased risk of cardiovascular events with exposure to thiocyanate — thiocyanate increases the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein and thiocyanate formation consumes hydrogen sulfide — suggest that cyanide from cyanocobalamin (or impaired decyanation of cyanocobalamin) in patients with impaired renal function might be harmful.
If the harm from B vitamins in the Diabetic Intervention with Vitamins to Improve Nephropathy (DIVINe) studywas caused by folic acid, then it would be expected that in the CSPPT studypatients with impaired renal function who were treated with folic acid alone would also have a higher risk of stroke and an increased decline in renal function. However, folic acid improved renal function and reduced the number of composite events, including overall mortality. These results suggest that possible harm from B vitamins in other studies was due to cyanocobalamin or pyridoxine (B 6).
In the VITATOPS trial, B vitamin therapy with 400 µg cyanocobalamin was not beneficial in patients with diabetes who had an eGFR < 50 mL/min/1.73 m² (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.32, p = 0.54), but was beneficial in patients with an eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m² (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.98, p = 0.03).
In the DIVINe study, B vitamins (including 1000 µg cyanocobalamin) administered to patients with diabetic nephropathy (eGFR > 50 mL min/1.73 m²) accelerated decline in renal function and doubled the number of cardiovascular events compared with individuals who did not receive B vitamins.
In the VISP subgroup analysis, which excluded patients with an eGFR < 46.18 mL/min/1.73 m² and patients who received cyanocobalamin injections, a 34% reduction in the composite outcome of stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death was observed in patients with normal cyanocobalamin absorption (baseline B 12 above the median) who received high-dose B vitamin therapy compared with patients with poor cyanocobalamin absorption (baseline B 12 below the median) who received low-dose vitamin B therapy.
The Su. Fol.OM3 trialreported that B vitamins reduced stroke incidence by 43%, and it is hypothesised that this was because the trial included relatively young participants with good renal function and minimal exposure to cyanocobalamin (only 20 µg daily).
The Heart Outcomes Protection Evaluation-2 (HOPE-2) trialreported that B vitamins reduced the risk of stroke by 23%, and it is hypothesised that this was because the trial included a younger study population with better renal function than other trials such as Norwegian Vitamin (NORVIT)and VISP.
The VISPand NORVITtrials showed no benefit of B vitamin therapy for stroke prevention, and it is hypothesised that this was because the participants in these trials were older and had poorer renal function than the study populations of subsequent trials. In the NORVIT trial there was an increased risk of stroke among participants who received cyanocobalamin. Reproduced with permission from Elsevier.

### Mechanisms and implications of the gut microbial modulation of intestinal metabolic processes [^114LcZ8A]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Microbiota impacting micronutrient metabolism

Micronutrients are essential for cellular processes, including immunology and energy synthesis, while commensal gut bacteria significantly contribute to the biosynthesis, metabolism, and absorption of these micronutrients. The gut microbiota functions as a bioreactor within the intestines, affecting nutrient bioavailability by converting substances into either beneficial or detrimental metabolites. Microbiota generates substantial quantities of vitamins, including vitamin K and B vitamins, and facilitates the absorption of minerals such as iron and calcium. Engevik and colleagues conducted a study assessing 512 gut microbial strains from 6 phyla for their ability to biosynthesize folate. It was shown that merely 13% of these strains, all belonging to the Proteobacteria phylum, contained the entire genetic apparatus for folate production. A further 39% of organisms, predominantly from Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia, exhibited an incomplete capacity for folate synthesis. This provides a glimpse of the complex involvement of gut bacteria in the production and availability of micronutrients. Others investigated the biosynthetic potential of gut microbiota and determined that the majority of the B-vitamins were synthesized by these microorganisms. For these vitamins to be advantageous to the body, synthesis must transpire prior to the absorption regions of the intestines. B12-producing bacteria in the colon may not enhance B12 bioavailability, as absorption takes place in the ileum. Escherichia coli facilitates the metabolism of vitamin B9 by improving its bioavailability and generating tetrahydrofolate, while simultaneously serving as a conduit for vitamin B12. Certain Firmicutes, found using 16S sequencing, are associated with serum vitamin D levels, modulated by butyrate-producing bacteria that augment vitamin D receptor expression. Furthermore, gut microbiota can negatively influence vitamin bioavailability, seen by enhanced vitamin E bioavailability following antibiotic therapy and diminished vitamin C absorption attributable to lipopolysaccharides produced by bacteria.

### An integrative epi-transcriptomic approach identifies the human cartilage chitinase 3-like protein 2 (as a potential mediator of B12 deficiency in adipocytes [^112E6KZL]. Epigenetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin B12 (B12: cobalamin) is a key water-soluble vitamin required for many physiological and biochemical processes in the human body. B12 is produced by bacteria as hydroxycobalamin or derived synthetically (via bacterial fermentation and synthesis) as cyanocobalamin. Sources of B12 therefore include most animal-derived foods, some fermented non-animal derived foods, or nutritional supplementation. B12 deficiency varies widely from 2.5% to 26%; even higher levels of deficiency are found in different sub-populations (i.e. children, young adults, pregnant women, and older adults). The classical complications of severe deficiency, although uncommon, are mainly seen in the haematological or nervous systems.

On a biochemical level, B12 has multiple functions and is a crucial cofactor to two enzymes, methionine synthase (a methyltransferase) and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Methionine synthase enables the one-carbon cycle to use 5-methyltetrahydrofolate as a substrate to convert homocysteine to methionine and to generate a methyl group and tetrahydrofolate. The methionine produced from this cycle is metabolized via a transulfuration pathway (the end product of which is the anti-oxidant glutathione), the methyl group is used for DNA methylation, an epigenetic process, and tetrahydrofolate allows the synthesis of DNA and RNA, via purine and thymidine. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase catalyses the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, allowing downstream metabolism of fatty acids and amino acids to generate energy via the citric acid cycle (TCA cycle).

### Impact of metformin therapy on vitamin B12 levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112G8VnC]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1.3 Literature Review

Metformin is administered orally in a tablet form, typically at a dose of 500 to 1000 mg usually taken twice daily. Metformin's mechanism of action is to increase the hepatic protein kinase activity, thus reducing both the hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis and enhancing glucose uptake by tissues through activation of the glucose 4 transporter (GLUT4) in the skeletal muscles and adipose tissue. Therefore, metformin is important in improving glycaemic control in the body.

A cross‐sectional study by Jinwoon Kim et al. involving 1111 patients with T2DM who took metformin for at least 6 months, found that about 22.2% of the patients had serum vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition, another study conducted in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia, showed that vitamin B12 deficiency and borderline deficiency were strongly associated with Metformin type of treatment. It also showed that patients who were under higher doses of metformin, more than 1000 mg, had lower levels of vitamin B12. About 69.6% of the patients with T2DM in Tripoli, Libya, had uncontrolled and poor glycaemic control in the follow‐up, which may predispose the patient to long‐term complications. Long‐term complications are more prevalent in patients with T2DM, especially if their condition is poorly managed. In addition, patients suffering from T2DM may suffer from cardiovascular morbidity and mortality when compared with non‐diabetic patients, and an increase in cardiovascular death rate by 4.4‐fold.

Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, is a water‐soluble vitamin found in various foods, such as meat, fish, eggs and dairy products. It is important for DNA synthesis, myelination and the function of the central nervous system.

Patients with serum B12 above 300 pg/mL are considered normal, a range between 200 pg/mL and 300 pg/mL is regarded as a borderline deficiency, whereas patients with serum B12 below 200 pg/mL are considered deficient. Vitamin B12 works as a cofactor for the enzyme methionine synthase. This enzyme facilitates the conversion of homocysteine into methionine, which is important in DNA synthesis. In vitamin B12 deficiency, homocysteine cannot convert into methionine, slowing DNA synthesis, which leads to megaloblastic anaemia.

The intrinsic factor is a glycoprotein produced by stomach parietal cells. It binds to vitamin B12 to be absorbed later in the distal ileum. Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs in patients undergoing gastrectomy, resection of the terminal ileum or gastric bypass, and it is also seen in patients who suffer from Crohn's disease or celiac disease due to a decrease in intrinsic factor production.

### Juvenile selective vitamin B ₁ ₂ malabsorption: 50 years after its description-10 years of genetic testing [^113v5tUC]. Pediatric Research (2011). Low credibility.

Fifty years have passed since the description of juvenile selective malabsorption of cobalamin (Cbl). Quality of life improvements have dramatically reduced the incidence of parasite-induced or nutritional Cbl deficiency. Consequently, inherited defects have become a leading cause of Cbl deficiency in children, which is not always expressed as anemia. Unfortunately, the gold standard for clinical diagnosis, the Schilling test, has increasingly become unavailable, and replacement tests are only in their infancy. Genetic testing is complicated by genetic heterogeneity and differential diagnosis. This review documents the history, research, and advances in genetics that have elucidated the causes of juvenile Cbl malabsorption. Genetic research has unearthed many cases in the past decade, mostly in Europe and North America, often among immigrants from the Middle East or North Africa. Lack of suitable clinical testing potentially leaves many patients inadequately diagnosed. The consequences of suboptimal Cbl levels for neurological development are well documented. By raising awareness, we wish to push for fast track development of better clinical tools and suitable genetic testing. Clinical awareness must include attention to ethnicity, a sensitive topic but effective for fast diagnosis. The treatment with monthly parenteral Cbl for life offers a simple and cost-effective solution once proper diagnosis is made.

### Subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people: a systematic review [^112rx8LK]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Although we did not find an association between subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people, this does not imply that patients with pernicious anaemia or age-related food-vitamin B12 malabsorption (with tissue depletion of vitamin B12 and very low vitamin B12 concentrations) will not benefit from vitamin B12 administration, especially since non-placebo-controlled studies showed (large) increases in haemoglobin concentrations or haematocrit after intramuscular or oral vitamin B12 administration in patients with pernicious anaemia or age-related food-vitamin B12 malabsorption. However, apart from the undisputed reality of pernicious anaemia, the clinical impact of a subnormal vitamin B12 level in older people is unclear, especially since several observational studies and randomized controlled trials also showed no effect of vitamin B12 administration on cognitive function.
