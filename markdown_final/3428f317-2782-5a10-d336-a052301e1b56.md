## Question

When do we give flagyl prophylaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to give metronidazole (Flagyl) prophylaxis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between prophylaxis and treatment. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled indications and explicitly separate true prophylaxis from treatment-only scenarios. Next, I will review high-quality guidelines and pivotal trials to identify validated prophylactic uses. After that, I need to check dosing, timing, and special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable list of when to use metronidazole prophylaxis and when to avoid it, noting any controversies or low-certainty evidence.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate treatment with prophylaxis. Prophylaxis means giving an antibiotic to prevent infection in someone who is not currently infected, whereas treatment targets an established infection; metronidazole has many labeled treatment indications, but only a few validated prophylactic roles, so I need to be careful not to overextend its use into prevention where evidence is weak or absent [^114e72CR] [^111gADcD].

> I will now examine the FDA labeling to see what is actually approved as prophylaxis. Wait, let me verify the specific language: the FDA materials list "prevention of acute infection in patients with uterine evacuation" as an off-label prophylactic indication, which is the clearest labeled prophylactic context, and they also note metronidazole's role as the preferred anti-anaerobic agent in combination regimens for intra-abdominal infection, which is treatment rather than prophylaxis, so I should not mix these up [^111gADcD] [^114e72CR] [^113kMjGR].

> Next, I should review guideline-backed prophylaxis scenarios. The Society of Family Planning and ACOG recommend universal antibiotic prophylaxis for procedural abortion and procedural management of early pregnancy loss, with doxycycline or azithromycin as first-line and metronidazole as an acceptable second-line option; metronidazole is less effective against aerobic bacteria but still reduces infection risk, and a single 500 mg oral dose given about 1 hour pre-procedure is a standard regimen when metronidazole is chosen [^116gSonj] [^113pz6Xf] [^115ocSoJ] [^1135sYPi].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence and dosing details. The AIMS randomized trial and subsequent meta-analyses show that prophylactic antibiotics reduce pelvic infection after procedural management of early pregnancy loss, with absolute risk reductions around 2–3% in higher-income settings; metronidazole 500 mg orally once, given 1 hour pre-procedure (up to 12 hours before), is a cited regimen, though doxycycline or azithromycin are preferred when available due to broader coverage [^1164rgfK] [^1135sYPi] [^116gSonj].

> Let me consider surgical prophylaxis where metronidazole is used for anaerobic coverage. In colorectal and other clean-contaminated procedures, cefuroxime plus metronidazole is a common regimen, and metronidazole is the preferred anti-anaerobic agent in combination empiric therapy for intra-abdominal infection; however, this is treatment of established infection or perioperative prophylaxis within a bundle, not standalone prophylaxis for uninfected patients, so I should frame it correctly as part of surgical prophylaxis protocols rather than a general outpatient prophylaxis indication [^113kMjGR] [^114GvSJP] [^113kMjGR].

> I need to check the Crohn's disease postoperative context, because I recall metronidazole being used to prevent recurrence. The ACG guideline suggests imidazole antibiotics such as metronidazole at 1–2 g/day for about 3 months after small intestinal resection to reduce endoscopic recurrence, but this is a conditional recommendation with low-quality evidence and notable intolerance; moreover, anti-TNF agents and vedolizumab are more effective for high-risk patients, so metronidazole prophylaxis here is optional and often limited by adverse effects rather than standard of care [^112RLwW1] [^117R2K7g] [^113KtJFA].

> But wait, what about Clostridioides difficile prophylaxis during systemic antibiotics? A retrospective cohort suggested an 80% reduction in CDI when metronidazole was given before broad-spectrum antibiotics in high-risk patients, but this is hypothesis-generating only; contemporary IDSA/SHEA and ESCMID guidelines do not recommend routine metronidazole prophylaxis to prevent CDI, and instead emphasize stewardship, risk stratification, and proven recurrence-prevention strategies like bezlotoxumab or FMT for those with multiple recurrences, so I should not recommend metronidazole prophylaxis for CDI prevention outside a trial [^116RSA3N] [^114w94MX] [^113RZaKD] [^113ue2qN] [^114w94MX].

> I should double-check human bite wounds, because I initially thought prophylaxis was standard. On review, metronidazole is used as part of treatment regimens for established infection and is sometimes included in prophylaxis protocols, but this is not a universally mandated prophylaxis indication and evidence quality varies; if used for prophylaxis, 500 mg orally three times daily for 3–5 days is a cited regimen, but I need to emphasize that this is off-label and clinician-dependent rather than guideline-mandated [^112d5sfT].

> Let me synthesize the validated prophylactic uses so I don't overgeneralize. The clearest, guideline-supported prophylactic role is a single pre-procedure dose of metronidazole 500 mg orally for procedural abortion or procedural management of early pregnancy loss when doxycycline or azithromycin are not used, given about 1 hour before instrumentation; beyond that, metronidazole is used as anti-anaerobic coverage within surgical prophylaxis bundles for clean-contaminated procedures and is optionally considered for 3 months post–small bowel resection in Crohn's disease to reduce recurrence, though tolerance and inferiority to anti-TNF agents limit its role [^116gSonj] [^1135sYPi] [^113kMjGR] [^112RLwW1].

> I should confirm special populations and safety constraints so I don't miss important cautions. In pregnancy, metronidazole is generally considered acceptable after the first trimester when clinically indicated, but for prophylaxis around uterine evacuation, first-line agents remain doxycycline or azithromycin; in hepatic impairment, dose reduction is advised in severe Child-Pugh C disease; and for CDI, metronidazole should not be used for severe disease and is not recommended for routine prophylaxis against recurrence during systemic antibiotics, reinforcing that prophylaxis is not appropriate there [^113GRxma] [^117YDyfd] [^113kxc9h] [^112W8ZHy].

> In summary, I need to ensure I'm precise: metronidazole prophylaxis is not broadly indicated. It is a second-line, single-dose option for procedural abortion or procedural management of early pregnancy loss, a component of anti-anaerobic coverage in selected surgical prophylaxis regimens, and an optional short-term agent to reduce postoperative Crohn's recurrence after ileal resection; it is not recommended for routine CDI prophylaxis, not standard for human bite prophylaxis, and should be reserved for these specific contexts with attention to alternatives and patient-specific risks [^116gSonj] [^114GvSJP] [^112RLwW1] [^112W8ZHy].

Flagyl (metronidazole) is used for **prophylaxis** in two main scenarios: **preoperative coverage for anaerobes** in colorectal, appendectomy, and other clean-contaminated surgeries [^114GvSJP] [^113kMjGR], and **postoperative prevention of Crohn's recurrence** after ileocolonic resection [^112RLwW1] [^117R2K7g]. It is not recommended for routine prophylaxis in other surgeries or for preventing C. difficile infection [^112W8ZHy] [^113RZaKD]. Dosing is typically 500 mg IV/PO 30–60 minutes preoperatively for surgical prophylaxis, and 1–2 g/day for 3 months postoperatively for Crohn's recurrence prevention [^113kMjGR] [^112RLwW1].

---

## Indications for flagyl prophylaxis

### Surgical prophylaxis for anaerobic coverage

- **Colorectal surgery**: Metronidazole is recommended for prophylaxis in colorectal surgery due to the high risk of anaerobic contamination [^114GvSJP] [^111ByHEN].

- **Appendectomy**: Particularly in cases of perforated or gangrenous appendicitis, metronidazole is used to prevent anaerobic infections [^notfound].

- **Other clean-contaminated surgeries**: Procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract, gynecological surgeries, and certain urological procedures may require metronidazole prophylaxis when anaerobic coverage is indicated [^116UNGkH].

---

### Postoperative prevention of Crohn's disease recurrence

After ileocolonic resection for Crohn's disease, metronidazole **1–2 g/day for 3 months** reduces endoscopic and clinical recurrence [^112RLwW1] [^117R2K7g].

---

## Dosage and administration

| **Indication** | **Dosage** | **Route** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Surgical prophylaxis | 500 mg | IV or PO | 30–60 minutes before incision |
| Postoperative Crohn's recurrence prevention | 1–2 g/day | PO | For 3 months postoperatively |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting flagyl prophylaxis

- **Surgical prophylaxis**: Multiple guidelines endorse metronidazole for anaerobic coverage in colorectal and clean-contaminated surgeries, reducing surgical site infections [^114GvSJP] [^111ByHEN].

- **Crohn's disease**: Clinical trials and guidelines support metronidazole prophylaxis to reduce postoperative recurrence after ileocolonic resection [^112RLwW1] [^117R2K7g].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Neurotoxicity**: Prolonged or repeated use can cause cumulative neurotoxicity; limit duration and monitor for neurologic symptoms [^112W8ZHy] [^113RZaKD].

- **Pregnancy**: Use cautiously, especially in the first trimester, balancing risks and benefits [^113GRxma] [^116rCWiQ].

- **Drug interactions**: Avoid concurrent use with disulfiram or recent alcohol due to disulfiram-like reactions [^111U3r3f] [^115o9dTo].

---

## Situations where flagyl prophylaxis is not recommended

- **Routine surgical prophylaxis**: Not indicated for clean surgeries without anaerobic risk [^116UNGkH].

- **Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI)**: Not recommended for primary prophylaxis against CDI [^notfound].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: No evidence supports routine metronidazole prophylaxis for infection prevention in this group.

---

Flagyl prophylaxis is indicated for **anaerobic coverage in colorectal and select clean-contaminated surgeries** [^114GvSJP] and for **preventing Crohn's recurrence after ileocolonic resection** [^112RLwW1]. It is not recommended for routine prophylaxis in other surgeries or for CDI prevention [^112W8ZHy] [^113RZaKD].

General

Hepatic Impairment

Patients with hepatic impairment metabolize metronidazole slowly, with resultant accumulation of metronidazole in the plasma. The FLAGYL 375 capsules dosage or the frequency of administration should be reduced in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, no dosage adjustment is needed. Patients with hepatic impairment should be monitored for metronidazole associated adverse events (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Renal Impairment

Patients with end-stage renal disease may excrete metronidazole and metabolites slowly in the urine, resulting in significant accumulation of metronidazole metabolites. Monitoring for metronidazole associated adverse events is recommended (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Fungal Superinfections

Known or previously unrecognized candidiasis may present more prominent symptoms during therapy with FLAGYL 375 capsules and requires treatment with a candidacidal agent.

Use in Patients with Blood Dyscrasias

Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole and should be used with caution in patients with evidence of or history of blood dyscrasia. A mild leucopenia has been observed during its administration; however, no persistent hematologic abnormalities attributable to metronidazole have been observed in clinical studies. Total and differential leukocyte counts are recommended before and after therapy.

Drug-Resistant Bacteria and Parasites

Prescribing FLAGYL 375 capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial or parasitic infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria and parasites.

Pregnancy:

Teratogenic effects:

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of FLAGYL 375 capsules in pregnant women. There are published data from case-control studies, cohort studies, and 2‑meta‑analyses that include more than 5000 pregnant women who used metronidazole during pregnancy. Many studies included first trimester exposures. One study showed an increased risk of cleft lip, with or without cleft palate, in infants exposed to metronidazole in-utero; however, these finding were not confirmed. In addition, more than ten randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials enrolled more than 5000 pregnant women to assess the use of antibiotic treatment (including metronidazole) for bacterial vaginosis on the incidence of preterm delivery. Most studies did not show an increased risk for congenital abnormalities or other adverse fetal outcomes following metronidazole exposure during pregnancy. Three studies conducted to assess the risk of infant cancer following metronidazole exposure during pregnancy did not show an increased risk; however, the ability of these studies to detect such a signal was limited.

Metronidazole crosses the placental barrier and its effects on the human fetal organogenesis are not known. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses similar to the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area comparisons. There was no evidence of harm to the fetus due to metronidazole.

Nursing mothers

Metronidazole is present in human milk at concentrations similar to maternal serum levels, and infant serum levels can be close to or comparable to infant therapeutic levels. There are no data on the effects of metronidazole on milk production. Animal studies have shown the potential for tumorigenicity after oral metronidazole was administered chronically to rats and mice (see PRECAUTIONS, Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility). This drug is not intended to be administered chronically; therefore, the clinical relevance of the findings of the animal studies is unclear. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for FLAGYL and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from FLAGYL or from the underlying maternal condition. Alternatively, a nursing mother may choose to pump and discard human milk for the duration of FLAGYL therapy, and for 48 hours after the last dose and feed her infant stored human milk or formula.

Geriatric use

In geriatric patients, monitoring for metronidazole associated adverse events is recommended (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PRECAUTIONS). Decreased liver function in geriatric patients can result in increased concentrations of metronidazole that may necessitate adjustment of metronidazole dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Trichomoniasis

In the Female: Seven-day course of treatment (375 mg two times daily for seven consecutive days).

A seven-day course of treatment may minimize reinfection by protecting the patient long enough for the sexual contacts to obtain treatment. Pregnant patients should not be treated during the first trimester (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS).

When repeat courses of the drug are required, it is recommended that an interval of four to six weeks elapse between courses and that the presence of the trichomonad be reconfirmed by appropriate laboratory measures. Total and differential leukocyte counts should be made before and after re-treatment.

In the Male: Treatment should be individualized as it is for the female.

Amebiasis:

Adults:

For acute intestinal amebiasis (acute amebic dysentery): 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days.

For amebic liver abscess: 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days.

Pediatric patients: 35 to 50 mg/kg/24 hours, divided into three doses, orally for 10 days.

Anaerobic Bacterial Infections

In the treatment of most serious anaerobic infections, intravenous metronidazole is usually administered initially.

The usual adult oral dosage is 7.5 mg/kg every 6 hours (approximately 500 mg for a 70 kg adult). A maximum of 4 g should not be exceeded during a 24-hour period.

The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 10 days; however, infections of the bone and joint, lower respiratory tract, and endocardium may require longer treatment.

Information for patients

Interaction with Alcohol

Discontinue consumption of alcoholic beverages or products containing propylene glycol while taking FLAGYL 375 capsules and for at least three days afterward because abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and flushing may occur (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Treatment of Bacterial and Parasitic Infections

Patients should be counseled that FLAGYL 375 should only be used to treat bacterial and parasitic infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When FLAGYL 375 is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by FLAGYL 375 in the future.

Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions

Advise patients that FLAGYL capsules may increase the risk of serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including TEN, SJS, and DRESS. Instruct the patient to be alert for skin rash, blisters, fever or other signs and symptoms of these hypersensitivity reactions. Advise patients to stop FLAGYL capsules immediately if they develop any type of rash and seek medical attention.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^112RLwW1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Postoperative Crohn's disease antibiotic prophylaxis — We suggest imidazole antibiotics (metronidazole) at doses between 1 and 2 g/d after small intestinal resection in CD patients to prevent recurrence (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence). Metronidazole (20 mg/kg daily) may significantly reduce the incidence of severe (Rutgeerts i3–4) endoscopic recurrent disease compared with placebo-treated patients at 3 months after surgery and clinical recurrence at 1 year. Combining metronidazole (1 g/d) for 3 months with azathioprine (100–150 mg/d) for 12 months reduces endoscopic recurrent disease (i2–4) at 1 year after surgery compared with those patients receiving metronidazole alone. In placebo-controlled trials, nearly 50% of patients were intolerant to the imidazole antibiotics.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Hypersensitivity

FLAGYL 375 capsules are contraindicated in patients with a prior history of hypersensitivity to metronidazole or other nitroimidazole derivatives.

In patients with trichomoniasis, FLAGYL 375 capsules are contraindicated during the first trimester of pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS).

Psychotic Reaction with Disulfiram

Use of oral metronidazole is associated with psychotic reactions in alcoholic patients who were using disulfiram concurrently. Do not administer metronidazole to patients who have taken disulfiram within the last two weeks (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Interaction with Alcohol

Use of oral metronidazole is associated with a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, including abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and flushing. Discontinue consumption of alcohol or products containing propylene glycol during and for at least three days after therapy with metronidazole (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Cockayne Syndrome

FLAGYL 375 capsules are contraindicated in patients with Cockayne syndrome. Severe irreversible hepatotoxicity/acute liver failure with fatal outcomes have been reported after initiation of metronidazole in patients with Cockayne syndrome (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

### Metronidazole [^116rCWiQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of metronidazole IV (also known as Flagyl, Nuvessa, Likmez, Noritate) in pregnant patients for first trimester: avoid use. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. Metronidazole is contraindicated during the first trimester of pregnancy in patients with trichomoniasis. For indications other than trichomoniasis, avoid metronidazole during pregnancy whenever possible, with use occurring only after careful assessment of the potential risk to benefit ratio. The drug metronidazole IV (also known as Flagyl, Nuvessa, Likmez, Noritate) is classified under category B2 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals are inadequate or may be lacking, but available data show no evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage.

### Metronidazole (metronidazole vaginal) [^111HMKnB]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of metronidazole PV (also known as Flagyl, Nuvessa, Likmez, Noritate) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if clearly needed. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. Available data on metronidazole use in pregnant women from published cohort studies, case-control studies, case series, meta analyses, and case reports over several decades have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Many studies included first trimester exposures. One study showed an increased risk of cleft lip, with or without cleft palate, in infants exposed to metronidazole in-utero; however, these findings were not confirmed. The drug metronidazole PV (also known as Flagyl, Nuvessa, Likmez, Noritate) is classified under category B2 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals are inadequate or may be lacking, but available data show no evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage.

Absorption

Disposition of metronidazole in the body is similar for both oral and intravenous dosage forms.

FLAGYL 375 capsules have been shown to have a rate and extent of absorption similar to metronidazole tablets (FLAGYL) and were bioequivalent at an equal single dose of 750 mg. In a study conducted with 23 adult, healthy, female volunteers, oral administration of two 375 mg FLAGYL capsules under fasted conditions produced a mean (± 1 SD) peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 21.4 (± 2.8) mcg/mL with a mean Tmaxof 1.6 (± 0.7) hours and a mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of 223 (± 44) mcg∙hr/mL. In the same study, three 250 mg FLAGYL tablets produced a mean Cmaxof 20.4 (± 3.8) mcg/mL with a mean Tmaxof 1.4 (± 0.4) hours and a mean AUC of 218 (± 50) mcg∙hr/mL.

Administration of FLAGYL 375 capsules with food does not affect the extent of absorption of metronidazole; however, the presence of food results in a lower Cmaxand a delayed Tmaxcompared to fasted conditions. In a study of 14 healthy, adult, female volunteers, administration of FLAGYL 375 capsules under fasting conditions produced a mean Cmaxof 10.9 (± 1.5) mcg/mL, a mean Tmaxof 1.5 (± 1.4) hours, and a mean AUC of 110 (± 34) mcg∙hr/mL compared to a mean Cmaxof 8.6 (± 1.6) mcg/mL, a mean Tmaxof 4.2 (± 1.7) hours, and a mean AUC of 99 (± 14) mcg∙hr/mL under fed conditions.

Distribution

Metronidazole is the major component appearing in the plasma, with lesser quantities of metabolites also being present. Less than 20% of the circulating metronidazole is bound to plasma proteins. Metronidazole appears in cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and breast milk in concentrations similar to those found in plasma. Bactericidal concentrations of metronidazole have also been detected in pus from hepatic abscesses.

AGA Crohn's disease after surgical resection — comparative efficacy of prophylactic therapies and role of antibiotics: Anti-TNF therapy compared with placebo resulted in 49% and 76% relative reductions in clinical and endoscopic recurrence at 18 months, respectively, and thiopurines resulted in 65% and 60% relative decreases in clinical and endoscopic recurrence, respectively. Moderate-quality evidence shows that antibiotics reduced the risk of endoscopic and clinical recurrence by approximately 50%, but their use is usually limited to 3 to 12 months and disease usually recurs within a couple of years after antibiotics are stopped. Antibiotics are probably inferior to anti-TNF agents by a large extent (moderate-quality evidence) and may be modestly inferior to thiopurines (low-quality evidence) in reducing recurrence; if chosen postoperatively, nitroimidazole antibiotics (eg, metronidazole) should be used because they are the only class that has been adequately studied.

### European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases: 2021 update on the treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection in adults [^113ue2qN]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Scope

In 2009, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published the first treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This document was updated in 2014. The growing literature on CDI antimicrobial treatment and novel treatment approaches, such as faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and toxin-binding monoclonal antibodies, prompted the ESCMID study group on C. difficile (ESGCD) to update the 2014 treatment guidance document for CDI in adults.

Methods and Questions

Key questions on CDI treatment were formulated by the guideline committee and included: What is the best treatment for initial, severe, severe-complicated, refractory, recurrent and multiple recurrent CDI? What is the best treatment when no oral therapy is possible? Can prognostic factors identify patients at risk for severe and recurrent CDI and is there a place for CDI prophylaxis? Outcome measures for treatment strategy were: clinical cure, recurrence and sustained cure. For studies on surgical interventions and severe-complicated CDI the outcome was mortality. Appraisal of available literature and drafting of recommendations was performed by the guideline drafting group. The total body of evidence for the recommendations on CDI treatment consists of the literature described in the previous guidelines, supplemented with a systematic literature search on randomized clinical trials and observational studies from 2012 and onwards. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the strength of our recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The guideline committee was invited to comment on the recommendations. The guideline draft was sent to external experts and a patients' representative for review. Full ESCMID endorsement was obtained after a public consultation procedure.

Recommendations

Important changes compared with previous guideline include but are not limited to: metronidazole is no longer recommended for treatment of CDI when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are available, fidaxomicin is the preferred agent for treatment of initial CDI and the first recurrence of CDI when available and feasible, FMT or bezlotoxumab in addition to standard of care antibiotics (SoC) are preferred for treatment of a second or further recurrence of CDI, bezlotoxumab in addition to SoC is recommended for the first recurrence of CDI when fidaxomicin was used to manage the initial CDI episode, and bezlotoxumab is considered as an ancillary treatment to vancomycin for a CDI episode with high risk of recurrence when fidaxomicin is not available. Contrary to the previous guideline, in the current guideline emphasis is placed on risk for recurrence as a factor that determines treatment strategy for the individual patient, rather than the disease severity.

Severe CDI — metronidazole use and outcomes: Metronidazole should not be used for the treatment of severe CDI because it was shown to be inferior to vancomycin in multiple RCTs and cohort studies. Patients who received vancomycin only after failing metronidazole (≥ 48 hours) compared with those who received vancomycin at time of diagnosis had longer hospital stays, higher rates of acute kidney injury, and lower rates of cure, and in a large propensity-matched cohort of 3,130 patients with severe CDI, vancomycin compared with metronidazole reduced the 30-day all-cause mortality from 19.8% to 15.3% (P = 0.01).

### Empirical or susceptibility-guided treatment forinfection? A comprehensive review [^112D2tGm]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

With regard to metronidazole, some studies suggest that in vitro metronidazole resistance has a limited impact on the efficacy of H. pylori treatments when sufficiently long treatments and high metronidazole doses are used. However, a recent multicenter study showed that cure rates of a 14-day, high-dose, rescue triple metronidazole–amoxicillin–PPI therapy were as low as 37% in patients with previous metronidazole administration. Therefore, it is suggested that repeating this antibiotic is only recommended when it is indispensable and in the setting of bismuth-based quadruple therapies. In this respect, an advantage of prescribing a bismuth-based quadruple therapy is that we do not need to worry about previous antibiotic use as the risk of having a tetracycline resistant strain is extremely low and metronidazole resistance has limited impact on effectiveness of this regimen.

Regarding the optimal dose of the antibiotics, both in first-line but especially in rescue therapies, to obtain maximal pharmacodynamic effect, although amoxicillin is generally dosed twice daily, prescribing this antibiotic in more frequent doses (e.g. three or four times daily) has been suggested to improve efficacy. On the other hand, the recommended metronidazole dosage for the majority of infectious diseases is 7.5 mg/kg three times a day with a plasma half-life of the molecule between 7 and 10 h. Several studies have shown good eradication rates using high doses and three-times-a-day schedules of both amoxicillin and metronidazole. Regarding the optimal duration of H. pylori eradication treatment, it should be 14 days, unless a shorter scheme has been shown locally to be equally effective. Finally, high-dose PPI therapy is recommended for triple therapy, and may probably increase the efficacy of a nonbismuth concomitant regimen as well. Nevertheless, more pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies are necessary to clarify these issues.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) before abortion — We recommend against screening for bacterial vaginosis (BV) before abortion (GRADE 1C). Symptomatic patients with BV should be treated, and abortion should not be delayed while awaiting treatment. BV is common, with a prevalence of approximately 30% in reproductive-age, pregnant-capable persons globally, and is associated with increased risk for pelvic inflammatory disease (adjusted hazard ratio 1.53, 95% CI 1.05–2.21). Randomized trials of perioperative metronidazole or clindamycin showed no statistically significant differences in postabortion upper genital tract infection versus placebo when standard prophylactic antibiotics were provided; one study using treatment dosing with metronidazole 500 mg three times daily orally for 10 days starting 7 days before the abortion procedure significantly reduced the risk of developing PID postprocedure, but these patients did not receive universal prophylactic antibiotics before abortion.

### Is antibiotic prophylaxis necessary in mid-urethral sling surgery? [^111TxmVV]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

This registry-based cohort study used data stored in the compulsory national Norwegian Female Incontinence Registry from all women who had undergone synthetic mid-urethral sling (MUS) surgery for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) or stress-dominant mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) in the period 1998 (inception of the registry) through 2017 with recorded follow-up data through 2018. Data extraction from the registry was done in January 2020. Retropubic tapes, transobturator tapes and minislings were all included. The extracted data were stratified based on the use of antibiotic prophylaxis. As the use of antibiotics are not routinely reported to the registry, this stratification was based on a survey performed in December 2018 in which the local doctor responsible for reporting data to the registry at all reporting hospitals was asked about their department's guidelines for the use of antibiotic prophylaxis during MUS surgery. At the time of data extraction there were 38 reporting public hospitals and 1 reporting private hospital. The private hospital and one public hospital were excluded from the study because of not participating in the survey (private hospital) or not having guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis use (public hospital). Beyond that, only women with no recorded follow-up data were excluded (Fig. 1). Five hospitals which did not use antibiotic prophylaxis routinely used prophylaxis in patients perceived to be at high risk of infection, mainly those with type I diabetes mellitus. Accurate data on antibiotic use for these women were not obtainable, but were estimated to constitute < 5% and therefore have little impact on the analyses. Women from these hospitals were therefore added to the non-prophylaxis group. The routine for prophylactic antibiotic treatment was a single dose of a first- or second-generation cephalosporin with or without metronidazole given in connection with the procedure.

Early pregnancy loss (EPL), procedural management — antibiotic prophylaxis: We recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for procedural management of early pregnancy loss (GRADE 1A). Infection is estimated to occur in up to 30% of patients in low-income countries, compared with 6% in middle-income countries. The Antibiotics in Miscarriage Surgery (AIMS) trial evaluated preprocedural prophylactic antibiotics using doxycycline 400 mg orally and metronidazole 400 mg orally, with the primary outcome of pelvic infection within 14 days after procedural management of EPL. In the AIMS study and cost-effectiveness analysis, approximately 70% of patients had a procedure with sharp curettage compared with 23% with vacuum aspiration; among those who underwent vacuum aspiration, infection was diagnosed in 1.3% with antibiotic prophylaxis versus 4.1% with placebo, and with sharp curettage infection was 5.3% with antibiotics versus 6.0% with placebo. A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 randomized controlled trials found a significantly lower risk of genital tract infection among those who received prophylactic antibiotics (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58–0.90); universal prophylaxis significantly reduced risk in patients from high-income countries (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53–0.84), with no significant effect in low- and middle-income countries (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.50–1.62).

### Risk of Clostridium difficile infection in hospitalized patients receiving metronidazole for a non-C. difficile infection [^116RSA3N]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Antibiotics often are given to prevent infections but also constitute a risk factor for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Metronidazole is an effective treatment for CDI. We investigated whether prophylactic administration of metronidazole to patients before they receive other antibiotics reduces the risk of CDI.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of data collected from 12,026 high-risk patients admitted to Cleveland Clinic Foundation Hospitals from 2008 through 2012. High-risk patients were defined as age 55 or older who received a broad-spectrum antibiotic (piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin) and a gastric acid suppressant (a proton pump inhibitor or a histamine-2 receptor blocker) during their hospitalization. Development of CDI was compared between patients who received metronidazole for non-CDI indications before broad-spectrum antibiotics (n = 811) and those who did not (n = 11,215). Logistic regression was used to control for patient demographics and comorbidities.

Results

The rate of CDI was 1.4% (n = 11) among the patients who received metronidazole for non-CDI indications and 6.5% (n = 728) among those who did not. This was observed to be an 80% reduction in CDI among patients who received metronidazole (odds ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.11–0.38; P < .001), adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities.

Conclusions

Based on a retrospective analysis, metronidazole might be used to prevent CDI in certain high-risk patients. Prospective controlled trials are necessary before making further recommendations.

Giardiasis — dosing recommendations for prevention and treatment in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children state that primary prophylaxis is antiretroviral therapy (ART) to avoid advanced immunodeficiency. For treatment, first-choice options are tinidazole, 50 mg/kg by mouth, administered as one dose given with food (maximum 2 g), and nitazoxanide with age-based dosing: 1–3 years: Nitazoxanide 100 mg by mouth every 12 hours with food for 3 days; 4–11 years: Nitazoxanide 200 mg by mouth every 12 hours with food for 3 days; ≥ 12 years: Nitazoxanide 500 mg by mouth every 12 hours with food for 3 days. An alternative is metronidazole 5 mg/kg by mouth every 8 hours for 5–7 days. Notes specify that recommendations are based on data from children who are HIV-negative. Tinidazole is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for children aged ≥ 3 years and is available in tablets that can be crushed, whereas metronidazole has a high frequency of GI side effects, a pediatric suspension is not commercially available but can be compounded from tablets, and metronidazole is not FDA-approved for the treatment of giardiasis. Supportive care includes hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, nutritional support, and that antimotility agents (e.g., loperamide) should be used with caution in young children.

### The timing of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis [^113kMjGR]. Annals of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To obtain precise information on the optimal time window for surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis.

Summary Background Data

Although perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis is a well-established strategy for reducing the risk of surgical site infections (SSI), the optimal timing for this procedure has yet to be precisely determined. Under today's recommendations, antibiotics may be administered within the final 2 hours before skin incision, ideally as close to incision time as possible.

Methods

In this prospective observational cohort study at Basel University Hospital we analyzed the incidence of SSI by the timing of antimicrobial prophylaxis in a consecutive series of 3836 surgical procedures. Surgical wounds and resulting infections were assessed to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standards. Antimicrobial prophylaxis consisted in single-shot administration of 1.5 g of cefuroxime (plus 500 mg of metronidazole in colorectal surgery).

Results

The overall SSI rate was 4.7% (180 of 3836). In 49% of all procedures antimicrobial prophylaxis was administered within the final half hour. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed a significant increase in the odds of SSI when antimicrobial prophylaxis was administered less than 30 minutes (crude odds ratio = 2.01; adjusted odds ratio = 1.95; 95% confidence interval, 1.4–2.8; P < 0.001) and 120 to 60 minutes (crude odds ratio = 1.75; adjusted odds ratio = 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.0–2.9; P = 0.035) as compared with the reference interval of 59 to 30 minutes before incision.

Conclusions

When cefuroxime is used as a prophylactic antibiotic, administration 59 to 30 minutes before incision is more effective than administration during the last half hour.

Table 2. Antibiotic prophylaxis regimens in patients with immediate hypersensitivity reactions to penicillin — clindamycin 900 mg (half life 2–4 h; interval to repeat 6 h) or metronidazole 500 mg (half life 6–8 h; no repeat administration is needed) PLUS gentamicin 5 mg/kg (half life 2–3 h; no repeat administration is needed) or aztreonam 2 g (half life 1.3–2.4 h; interval to repeat 4 h). The combination of clindamycin or metronidazole plus gentamicin or aztreonam is recommended. Ciprofloxacin 400 mg is an additional effective alternative, but its use should be restricted to patients for whom both gentamicin and aztreonam are not acceptable, and it does not require repeat dosage. For aminoglycoside dosing when the patient's actual weight is > 20% above ideal body weight, dosing weight can be calculated as DW = IBW+0.4 (actual weight−IBW). Patients with exfoliative dermatitis from β-lactam antibiotics should also not receive cephalosporins.

Antimicrobial prophylaxis

The prevention of SSIs is an important issue in surgery. Besides general strategies aimed at reducing the rate of SSIs (hair removal, asepsis of the operating room, glucose control, blood transfusions, and smoking cessation) antibiotic prophylaxis plays a pivotal role in reducing SSIs.

The degree of bacterial contamination during surgery, together with the ASA score and duration of surgery, define the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis: surgical procedures are classified, as well-known, into clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated and dirty.

Dirty surgery should be treated as therapy of the infection involved (no prophylaxis).

Clean surgery usually does not need prophylaxis, unless comorbidities are present and/or prostheses are used.

The main indication for prophylaxis is, therefore, clean-contaminated or contaminated surgery. The purpose of antibiotic prophylaxis is only to avoid SSIs, not to prevent any other post-operative infectious complications (pneumonia, urinary tract infections, etc.).

The choice of antibiotic for prophylaxis should be directed towards the more probable pathogens for the particular type of surgery. Furthermore, antibiotics with a broad spectrum of action should not be used, because such these are the drugs of choice to treat an infection empirically.

Prophylaxis should be administered intravenously, half an hour before the start of surgery and should not be continued for more than 24 h.

Table 6 lists the recommended antibiotics for antimicrobial prophylaxis according to the type of surgery, and the alternative drugs in case of allergy to penicillin and/or cephalosporins. It is clear that the most frequently used antibiotic is cefazolin alone, combined with metronidazole when anti-anaerobe coverage is required and with vancomycin in selected cases of cardiovascular, orthopedic or neurosurgery when devices and/or prostheses are used.

Table 6
The recommendations for antimicrobial prophylaxis

According to the guidelines, if the surgical procedure lasts more than 3–4 h, there is an indication to administer another dose of prophylactic antibiotic, during surgery. In the case of renal impairment, this interval should be modified according to the creatinine clearance.

### Ceftriaxone [^117BmusM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Compatibility and Stability

Do not use diluents containing calcium, such as Ringer's solution or Hartmann's solution, to reconstitute ceftriaxone vials or to further dilute a reconstituted vial for IV administration. Particulate formation can result.

Ceftriaxone has been shown to be compatible with Flagyl®IV (metronidazole hydrochloride). The concentration should not exceed 5 to 7.5 mg/mL metronidazole hydrochloride with ceftriaxone 10 mg/mL as an admixture. The admixture is stable for 24 hours at room temperature only in 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose in water (D5W). No compatibility studies have been conducted with the Flagyl®IV RTU®(metronidazole) formulation or using other diluents. Metronidazole at concentrations greater than 8 mg/mL will precipitate. Do not refrigerate the admixture as precipitation will occur.

Vancomycin, amsacrine, aminoglycosides, and fluconazole are incompatible with ceftriaxone in admixtures. When any of these drugs are to be administered concomitantly with ceftriaxone by intermittent intravenous infusion, it is recommended that they be given sequentially, with thorough flushing of the intravenous lines (with one of the compatible fluids) between the administrations.

Ceftriaxone solutions should not be physically mixed with or piggybacked into solutions containing other antimicrobial drugs or into diluent solutions other than those listed above, due to possible incompatibility (see WARNINGS).

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: prevention of infection after abortion and pregnancy loss [^116gSonj]. Contraception (2025). High credibility.

Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation — prevention of infection after abortion and pregnancy loss — We recommend against screening for bacterial vaginosis before abortion (GRADE 1C), and symptomatic patients with bacterial vaginosis should be treated, and abortion should not be delayed while awaiting treatment. We recommend against the use of universal antibiotic prophylaxis in the setting of medication abortion, medication management of early pregnancy loss, or self-managed abortion (GRADE 1C). We recommend universal antibiotic prophylaxis for patients undergoing procedural abortion across all gestational durations and for procedural management of pregnancy loss (GRADE 1A). We recommend clinicians initiate antibiotic prophylaxis for procedural abortion and procedural management of pregnancy loss before instrumentation to maximize efficacy (GRADE 1B), and antibiotics should be given with adequate time for absorption, but data on the optimal timing for prophylaxis are lacking. In the setting of osmotic cervical dilator use, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine antibiotic prophylaxis before osmotic cervical dilator placement. We recommend discontinuing antibiotic prophylaxis after the procedure is complete (GRADE 1B). We recommend a single dose of doxycycline 200 mg orally or azithromycin 500 mg orally before a procedural abortion or procedural management of pregnancy loss (GRADE 1B), and metronidazole is a second-line option as it has evidence to suggest lower efficacy (GRADE 2C). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against vaginal preparation with a local antiseptic solution or to recommend a specific vaginal preparation regimen before procedural abortion or procedural management of pregnancy loss, and clinicians should not delay abortion while awaiting diagnostics or treatment (GRADE 1C).

Postoperative considerations — Crohn's disease (CD) after surgery: After surgery for Crohn's disease, patients should be considered for medical therapy to treat residual active disease or to maintain disease remission, with a strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence (1B). After an ileocecectomy, endoscopic recurrence in the neoterminal ileum occurs in 70% to 90% at 1 year and by 3 years is ubiquitous; at 5 years, an estimated 50% have clinical recurrence and 25% experience surgical recurrence, and by 10 years surgical recurrence may reach 35%. Perioperative risk factors include age at diagnosis < 30 years, < 10 years between diagnosis and surgery, perianal disease, penetrating phenotype, 2 or more prior intestinal resections, and active tobacco use. In low-risk patients without ongoing active CD, pharmacologic prophylaxis is not typically recommended, although metronidazole or ornidazole can be considered; in general, metronidazole use should be limited to about 3 months. At 6 months postoperatively, low-risk patients should undergo ileocolonoscopic assessment using Rutgeerts scoring, which ranges from i0 to i4; asymptomatic patients with a Rutgeerts score < i2 should typically repeat ileocolonoscopy in 1 to 3 years, whereas scores ≥ i2 should prompt starting an anti-TNF with or without a thiopurine per gastroenterology management.

ACG Clinical Guidelines — management of CDI recurrence and prevention specify that we suggest fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) be considered for patients with severe and fulminant CDI refractory to antibiotic therapy, particularly when patients are deemed poor surgical candidates (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). For a first recurrence, we suggest tapering/pulsed dosing of vancomycin be considered after an initial course of fidaxomicin, vancomycin, or metronidazole (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence), and we recommend fidaxomicin for patients experiencing a first recurrence after an initial course of vancomycin or metronidazole (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend patients experiencing their second or further recurrence of CDI be treated with FMT to prevent further recurrences (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend FMT be delivered through colonoscopy or capsules for treatment of recurrent CDI; we suggest delivery by enema if other methods are unavailable (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest repeat FMT for patients experiencing a recurrence of CDI within 8 wk of an initial FMT (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). For patients with rCDI who are not candidates for FMT, who relapse after FMT, or who require ongoing or frequent courses of antibiotics, suppressive oral vancomycin may be used to prevent further recurrences (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Oral vancomycin prophylaxis may be considered during subsequent systemic antibiotic use in patients with a history of CDI who are at high risk of recurrence to prevent further recurrence (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest bezlotoxumab be considered for prevention of CDI recurrence in patients who are at high risk of recurrence (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest against discontinuation of antisecretory therapy in patients with CDI, provided there is an appropriate indication for their use (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### Antimicrobial prophylaxis redosing reduces surgical site infection risk in prolonged duration surgery irrespective of its timing [^117UWadZ]. World Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-duration surgery requires repeated administration of antimicrobial prophylaxis (amp). Amp "redosing" reduces incidence of surgical site infections (SSI) but is frequently omitted. Clinical relevance of redosing timing needs to be investigated. Here, we evaluated the effects of compliance with amp redosing and its timing on SSI incidence in prolonged duration surgery.

Methods

Data from > 9000 patients undergoing visceral, trauma, or vascular surgery with elective or emergency treatment in two tertiary referral Swiss hospitals were analyzed. All patients had to receive amp preoperatively and redosing, if indicated. Antibiotics used were cefuroxime (1.5 or 3 g, if weight > 80 kg), or cefuroxime and metronidazole (1.5 and 0.5 g, or 3 and 1 g doses, if weight > 80 kg). Alternatively, in cases of known or suspected allergies, vancomycin (1 g), gentamicin (4 mg/Kg), and metronidazole or clindamycin (300 mg) with or without ciprofloxacin (400 mg) were used. Association of defined parameters, including wound class, ASA scores, and duration of operation, with SSI incidence was explored.

Results

In the whole cohort, SSI incidence significantly correlated with duration of surgery (ρ = 0.73, p = 0.031). In 593 patients undergoing > 240 min long interventions, duration of surgery was the only parameter significantly (p < 0.001) associated with increased SSI risk, whereas wound class, ASA scores, treatment areas, and emergency versus elective hospital entry were not. Redosing significantly reduced SSI incidence as shown by multivariate analysis (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37–0.96, p = 0.034), but exact timing had no significant impact.

Conclusions

Long-duration surgery associates with higher SSI incidence. Irrespective of its exact timing, amp redosing significantly decreases SSI risk.

### An update on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated disease [^111VVBVx]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile is an important cause of nosocomial morbidity and mortality and is implicated in recent epidemics. Data support the treatment of colitis with oral metronidazole in a dose of 1.0 to 1.5 g/d, with oral vancomycin as a second-line agent, not because its efficacy is questioned but because of environmental concerns. Nitazoxanide and other drugs are currently under intense study as alternatives. Treatment of asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Current management strategies appear to be increasingly ineffective, especially for patients who experience multiple recurrences. Biotherapy and vaccination are currently being explored as treatment options for patients who have recurrent disease. Greater attention should be paid to hospital infection control policies and restriction of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
