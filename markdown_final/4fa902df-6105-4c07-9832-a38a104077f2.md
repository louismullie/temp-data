## Question

How does Meloxicam 15mg daily affect blood pressure in patients with hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how meloxicam 15 mg daily affects blood pressure in patients with hypertension and what the clinical implications are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of meloxicam and its COX-1/COX-2 inhibition. Then, I should verify the direct evidence on meloxicam and blood pressure from labels and trials. Next, I will review class effects of NSAIDs on blood pressure and interactions with antihypertensives. After that, I need to consider dose-response and patient-specific risk modifiers. Finally, I will translate this into practical monitoring and mitigation strategies, including guideline-based recommendations and alternatives if NSAIDs cannot be avoided.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic basis of concern. Meloxicam is a nonselective NSAID that inhibits COX-1 and COX-2, reducing prostaglandin synthesis; prostaglandins normally mediate renal vasodilation and natriuresis, so their inhibition can promote sodium retention, volume expansion, and blunt vasodilatory responses, all of which can raise blood pressure, particularly in susceptible patients [^1138fvAy] [^112iSTeW].

> I need to check the direct evidence on meloxicam and blood pressure. Multiple FDA labels explicitly warn that NSAIDs, including meloxicam, can cause new-onset or worsening hypertension and may blunt the effects of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics; they advise monitoring blood pressure during initiation and throughout therapy, which directly applies to meloxicam 15 mg daily use in hypertensive patients [^1158SqMh] [^111xg9U2] [^112Kp4Ba]. Wait, let me verify the dose context: the labeled maximum daily dose is 15 mg, so using 15 mg daily is at the upper end of the recommended range, which may amplify blood pressure effects compared with 7.5 mg, although head-to-head dose–BP data are limited in the provided materials [^111GwLED] [^111pmYGF].

> Next, I should review class effects to estimate magnitude. Meta-analytic and trial data show NSAIDs as a class can increase systolic blood pressure by about 3–5 mmHg on average, with larger effects in hypertensive patients and those on renin–angiotensin system blockade. PRECISION-ABPM showed ibuprofen increased 24-hour systolic BP by about 3.7 mmHg versus a small decrease with celecoxib, and ibuprofen nearly doubled the incidence of new hypertension compared with celecoxib, underscoring clinically meaningful heterogeneity among NSAIDs and patient populations [^112iSTeW] [^115c7s2y]. Hold on, I should verify whether meloxicam-specific magnitude is available; I don't see a dedicated meloxicam ambulatory BP trial in the provided sources, so I will rely on class data and label cautions to infer risk at 15 mg daily [^1158SqMh].

> I will now examine interactions with antihypertensives, because that is pivotal in hypertensive patients. NSAIDs can attenuate the antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics, and may worsen renal hemodynamics in those with volume depletion or renal impairment; this pharmacodynamic interaction can destabilize blood pressure control and precipitate edema or acute kidney injury, especially at higher NSAID doses or in older adults [^1158SqMh] [^112Evzbb]. Let me consider exceptions: calcium channel blockers appear less affected by NSAID coadministration, so blood pressure may be relatively better preserved with CCB-based regimens when NSAIDs are unavoidable, though this is based on limited comparative data and should be individualized [^115GaZun].

> But wait, what about dose and duration. I initially thought there were robust dose–response data for meloxicam and blood pressure, but I should double-check; I don't see meloxicam-specific dose–BP trials here, so I will infer from class principles and labeling that higher daily doses and longer exposure plausibly increase risk of blood pressure elevation and edema, and that using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration is prudent, particularly in patients with hypertension or cardiovascular risk [^111mtPfG] [^1126jbP2] [^111X1Brb]. Let me reconsider: while some NSAIDs show clearer dose–BP relationships, the mechanistic rationale and label warnings support minimizing meloxicam dose and duration when possible in this population [^112iSTeW].

> Next, I should review patient-specific modifiers that heighten risk. Older age, preexisting hypertension, CKD, heart failure, volume depletion, and concomitant ACE inhibitor, ARB, or diuretic therapy increase susceptibility to NSAID-induced blood pressure elevation and renal complications. In such patients, even modest NSAID effects can be clinically consequential and may necessitate closer monitoring or alternative analgesic strategies [^112Evzbb] [^1158SqMh]. Hold on, I should verify whether any subgroup data exist for meloxicam; the provided materials do not include meloxicam-specific subgroup analyses, so I will apply class-based risk stratification and monitoring principles [^111X1Brb].

> I need to ensure the clinical implications are framed correctly. A 3–5 mmHg rise in systolic blood pressure from NSAIDs can translate into meaningful increases in cardiovascular event risk at the population level, and in patients with borderline control or high absolute risk, such changes can shift patients above treatment thresholds and worsen outcomes. Guidelines emphasize avoiding systemic NSAIDs when possible in patients with hypertension and, if used, monitoring blood pressure and renal function carefully [^113Bc5Dp] [^117LByx6] [^111X1Brb]. Let me verify guideline language: contemporary guidance advises avoiding systemic NSAIDs when possible, limiting acetaminophen, and considering topical NSAIDs or nonpharmacologic options, with explicit BP monitoring if NSAIDs are initiated [^117LByx6] [^111X1Brb].

> Now, I should translate this into practical management. Before starting meloxicam 15 mg daily, I should confirm baseline blood pressure control, review antihypertensive regimen, assess renal function and volume status, and discuss risks and alternatives. If NSAID therapy is necessary, consider starting at 7.5 mg daily and reassess blood pressure within 1–2 weeks, with earlier checks in high-risk patients, and monitor for edema, weight gain, and symptoms of worsening hypertension or renal function [^1158SqMh] [^112Evzbb]. If blood pressure rises or antihypertensive control deteriorates, I should adjust antihypertensive therapy, preferably favoring agents less affected by NSAIDs such as calcium channel blockers, and consider switching to a lower-risk NSAID like naproxen or celecoxib if an NSAID must be continued, recognizing that celecoxib may have a more favorable BP profile than some nonselective agents in certain populations, though individual responses vary [^115GaZun] [^115c7s2y] [^111X1Brb]. I should confirm that any escalation in antihypertensive therapy follows guideline-based titration and monitoring practices to avoid overtreatment or misattribution of variability [^111McRkr].

> Finally, I should consider alternatives and mitigation. Topical NSAIDs, acetaminophen with caution, physical therapy, weight management, and joint injections can reduce reliance on systemic NSAIDs. If systemic NSAIDs are unavoidable, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, avoid combining with multiple agents that affect hemostasis or renal perfusion, and maintain close follow-up for blood pressure and renal function, aligning with multidisciplinary recommendations for high-risk patients [^117LByx6] [^111X1Brb]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about acetaminophen being benign; recent data suggest acetaminophen can raise blood pressure in some patients, so even "safer" analgesics warrant monitoring in hypertension, reinforcing the principle of minimizing systemic NSAID exposure when possible [^112mKam5].

> In summary, meloxicam 15 mg daily is expected to increase blood pressure or worsen hypertension control in susceptible patients via prostaglandin inhibition, sodium retention, and interactions with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics. While meloxicam-specific ambulatory BP magnitude is not defined in the provided sources, class data suggest average systolic increases around 3–5 mmHg with greater effects in hypertensive patients on renin–angiotensin blockade, so I should use the lowest effective dose, monitor blood pressure and renal function closely after initiation, and be prepared to adjust antihypertensive therapy or choose alternatives if control deteriorates [^1158SqMh] [^112iSTeW] [^115c7s2y] [^117LByx6].

---

Meloxicam 15 mg daily can **raise blood pressure** in hypertensive patients by about 3–5 mmHg on average, with larger increases in those on ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics [^112iSTeW] [^1158SqMh]. This effect is due to reduced renal prostaglandins, sodium retention, and blunted antihypertensive efficacy, and may precipitate **hypertensive crises** in vulnerable patients [^112Evzbb] [^1158SqMh]. Use the lowest effective dose, monitor BP closely, and consider alternatives (topical NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or COX-2 inhibitors) if BP control worsens [^117LByx6] [^111X1Brb].

---

## Mechanisms of blood pressure elevation

Meloxicam elevates BP through **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Renal prostaglandin inhibition**: Reduced vasodilatory prostaglandins impair renal perfusion, triggering sodium/water retention and volume expansion [^112Evzbb].

- **Blunted antihypertensive effects**: NSAIDs can diminish the efficacy of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics, complicating BP control [^1158SqMh].

- **Increased vascular resistance**: Reduced prostaglandin-mediated vasodilation increases systemic vascular resistance and BP [^112iSTeW].

---

## Clinical evidence of blood pressure elevation

Clinical studies and reviews show NSAIDs, including meloxicam, can **raise BP**, particularly in hypertensive patients:

- **Meta-analysis findings**: NSAIDs increase mean BP by ~3–5 mmHg, with larger effects in hypertensive patients on ACE inhibitors or diuretics [^112iSTeW].

- **COX-2 inhibitor data**: Celecoxib and rofecoxib raise BP and increase new hypertension risk, especially with ACE inhibitors or diuretics [^111inJmF] [^117MoUGu].

- **Meloxicam-specific data**: Meloxicam 15 mg daily is associated with new or worsening hypertension, particularly in patients with pre-existing hypertension or renal impairment [^112Kp4Ba] [^111xg9U2].

---

## Magnitude of blood pressure increase

The average BP increase with meloxicam 15 mg daily is **approximately 3–5 mmHg**, though larger increases (> 10 mmHg) can occur in susceptible patients, such as those with uncontrolled hypertension, renal impairment, or high cardiovascular risk [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and risks

Even modest BP increases can increase cardiovascular risk, particularly in hypertensive patients. Meloxicam-associated BP elevation may precipitate **hypertensive crises** in vulnerable patients, including those with renal impairment or on interacting antihypertensives [^114xqidb] [^111mtPfG].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing blood pressure response

Several factors modulate the **BP response to meloxicam**:

| **Patient factor** | **Influence on bp response** |
|-|-|
| Age | Older patients have higher risk of BP elevation |
| Baseline BP | Higher baseline BP increases risk of worsening hypertension |
| Renal function | Impaired renal function increases risk of BP elevation |
| Concurrent medications | ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics increase risk of BP elevation |
| Comorbidities | Cardiovascular disease and diabetes increase risk |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines advise **caution and monitoring** when prescribing meloxicam to hypertensive patients:

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^112PotZ1].

- **Blood pressure monitoring**: Monitor BP closely during initiation and throughout therapy [^112Kp4Ba].

- **Alternative analgesics**: Consider topical NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or COX-2 inhibitors if BP control is compromised [^117LByx6] [^111X1Brb].

- **Medication review**: Regularly review and adjust antihypertensive therapy as needed [^111McRkr].

---

## Clinical management strategies

To mitigate **BP elevation** with meloxicam:

- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce dose or discontinue if BP rises significantly [^notfound].

- **Alternative analgesics**: Use topical NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or COX-2 inhibitors if appropriate [^117LByx6].

- **Antihypertensive adjustment**: Modify antihypertensive therapy to counteract NSAID effects [^111X1Brb].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients on BP monitoring and symptom recognition [^117Q5JW8].

---

Meloxicam 15 mg daily can raise BP in hypertensive patients by about 3–5 mmHg, with larger increases in susceptible patients. Use the lowest effective dose, monitor BP closely, and consider alternatives if BP control worsens.

### Efficacy and safety of dual combination therapy of blood pressure-lowering drugs as initial treatment for hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114cPNrM]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of dual combination of blood pressure (BP)-lowering drugs as initial treatment for hypertension.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL were searched until August 2017 for randomized, double-blind trials of dual combination therapy vs. monotherapy in adults with hypertension who were either treatment naïve or untreated for at least 4 weeks. Regimens were classified with reference to usual daily 'standard-dose'; for example, < 1+ < 1 for a combination of two drugs both at less than one standard-dose. Random-effects models were used for meta-analysis.

Results

Thirty-three trials (13095 participants) with mean baseline mean BP 155/100mmHg were included. Compared with standard-dose monotherapy, dual combinations of < 1+ < 1, 1+ < 1 and 1+1 (i.e. low-to-standard dose), showed a dose-response relationship in reducing SBP [mean differences (95% confidence interval) of 2.8 (1.6–4.0), 4.6 (3.4–5.7) and 7.5 (5.4–9.5)mmHg, respectively], and in improving BP control [risk ratio (RR) (95% confidence interval) 1.11 (0.92–1.34), 1.25 (1.16–1.35) and 1.42 (1.27–1.58), respectively]. Withdrawals due to adverse events were uncommon with low-to-standard dose dual combinations, with no significant difference compared with standard-dose monotherapy [2.9 vs. 2.2%; RR 1.28 (0.85 to 1.92)]. There were fewer data for higher dose dual combinations, which did not appear to produce substantial additional efficacy and could potentially be less tolerable.

Conclusion

Compared with standard-dose monotherapy, initiating treatment with low-to-standard dose dual combination therapy is more efficacious without increasing withdrawals due to adverse events.

Resistant hypertension (RHT) fourth-line therapy — spironolactone is supported only by a "Weak for" recommendation due to imprecision or risk of bias; ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) showed significant reductions in 24-hour systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) but not office DBP, and a comparison with clonidine found no significant differences; the evidence base included three SRs or meta-analyses and two RCTs; when carefully selected and closely monitored, the benefits of taking once-daily spironolactone outweigh the potential for AEs in RHT patients not controlled on three drugs.

### Meloxicam (Vivlodex) [^113sEDRZ]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of meloxicam PO (also known as Vivlodex, Mobic):
- **Anemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of anemia. Monitor hemoglobin levels and for signs of bleeding.
- **Edema**: use caution in patients taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, as meloxicam may blunt the cardiovascular effects of these agents. Avoid using in patients with severe HF unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening HF.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of elevations of serum transaminases and, rarely, severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure. Monitor liver enzymes periodically in patients on long-term treatment.
- **HF**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, hospitalization for HF, and death.
- **Hypertension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of new-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension. Monitor BP.
- **Increased serum potassium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia.
- **Mask symptoms of infection**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs reduce inflammation and fever, potentially diminishing the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.
- **Renal toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term use of NSAIDs has been associated with an increased risk of renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, AKI, and other renal injury, especially in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration or hypovolemia, taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, and in the elderly. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration, or hypovolemia.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### Melatonin reduces night blood pressure in patients with nocturnal hypertension [^1143m9QG]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Nocturnal hypertension is associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality. A blunted nocturnal surge in melatonin excretion has been described in nondipping hypertensive patients. We therefore studied the potency of melatonin to reduce nighttime blood pressure (BP) in treated hypertensive patients with nocturnal hypertension.

Patients and Methods

Thirty-eight treated hypertensive patients (22 males, mean age 64 ± 11 years) with confirmed nocturnal hypertension (mean nighttime systolic BP > 125 mm Hg), according to repeated 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either controlled release (CR)-melatonin 2 mg or placebo 2 hours before bedtime for 4 weeks. A 24-hour ABPM was then performed.

Results

Melatonin treatment reduced nocturnal systolic BP significantly from 136 ± 9 to 130 ± 10 mm Hg (P = 0.011), and diastolic BP from 72 ± 11 to 69 ± 9 mm Hg (P = 0.002), whereas placebo had no effect on nocturnal BP. The reduction in nocturnal systolic BP was significantly greater with melatonin than with placebo (P = 0.01), and was most prominent between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM (P = 0.002).

Conclusions

Evening CR-melatonin 2 mg treatment for 4 weeks significantly reduced nocturnal systolic BP in patients with nocturnal hypertension. Thus, an addition of melatonin 2 mg at night to stable antihypertensive treatment may improve nocturnal BP control in treated patients with nocturnal hypertension.

### Diclofenac sodium [^112Dr5Bu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension

NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazides diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

Heart Failure and Edema

The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalization for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.

Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

Avoid the use of diclofenac in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

There is limited experience with meloxicam overdose. In four reported cases of meloxicam overdose, patients took 6 to 11 times the highest available dose of meloxicam tablets (15 mg); all recovered. Cholestyramine is known to accelerate the clearance of meloxicam.

Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Accelerated removal of meloxicam by 4 g oral doses of cholestyramine given three times a day was demonstrated in a previous clinical trial. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.

For additional information about overdosage treatment contact a poison control center (1–800–222–1222).

Laboratory Values, Vital Signs, Wound Healing

Laboratory assessments related to bleeding risk and to renal and hepatic function were of interest because these are known to be class effects of NSAIDs. All laboratory measures that were out of normal range and assessed by the site investigator to be clinically relevant were recorded as AEs. Shift plots were used to evaluate changes in clinical laboratory values. Shifts from normal were similar between meloxicam IV- and placebo-treated subjects for hematocrit (60.8% versus 59.5%), hemoglobin (56.8% versus 50.0%), and platelets (28.5% versus 31.1%). The incidence of clinically significant vital sign parameters that were reported as AEs was low and was generally similar between the meloxicam IV and placebo groups, respectively (hypotension 2.8% versus 4.2%; pyrexia 3.5% versus 3.1%; postoperative fever 1.8% versus 3.1%; hypertension 1.1% versus 1.0%; tachycardia 0.7% versus 0%; hypoxia 0.4% versus 1.0%; orthostatic hypotension 0.4% versus 0%; procedural hypotension 0.4% versus 0%; respiratory rate decreased 0% versus 1.0%; and tachypnea 0.4% versus 0%). None of the ECG shifts from normal to abnormal was considered clinically significant in either treatment group.

The mean assessment score of investigator satisfaction with wound healing 1 day following the last study dose prior to discharge was similar for meloxicam IV-treated subjects and placebo-treated subjects (Table 6). There was a low incidence of clinically significant findings on wound evaluation, with an incidence generally similar between the meloxicam IV and placebo groups (Table 6).

### Aged garlic extract reduces blood pressure in hypertensives: a dose-response trial [^1117TrEB]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background/objectives:

Hypertension affects about 30% of adults worldwide. Garlic has blood pressure-lowering properties and the mechanism of action is biologically plausible. Our trial assessed the effect, dose–response, tolerability and acceptability of different doses of aged garlic extract as an adjunct treatment to existing antihypertensive medication in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

Subjects/methods:

A total of 79 general practice patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension participated in a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled dose–response trial of 12 weeks. Participants were allocated to one of three garlic groups with either of one, two or four capsules daily of aged garlic extract (240/480/960 mg containing 0.6/1.2/2.4 mg of S -allylcysteine) or placebo. Blood pressure was assessed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks and compared with baseline using a mixed-model approach. Tolerability was monitored throughout the trial and acceptability was assessed at 12 weeks by questionnaire.

Results:

Mean systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced by 11.8 ± 5.4 mm Hg in the garlic-2-capsule group over 12 weeks compared with placebo (P = 0.006), and reached borderline significant reduction in the garlic-4-capsule group at 8 weeks (−7.4 ± 4.1 mm Hg, P = 0.07). Changes in systolic blood pressure in the garlic-1-capsule group and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly different to placebo. Tolerability, compliance and acceptability were high in all garlic groups (93%) and highest in the groups taking one or two capsules daily.

Conclusions:

Our trial suggests aged garlic extract to be an effective and tolerable treatment in uncontrolled hypertension, and may be considered as a safe adjunct treatment to conventional antihypertensive therapy.

### Effect on blood pressure of lumiracoxib versus ibuprofen in patients with osteoarthritis and controlled hypertension: a randomized trial [^115oufyq]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs vary in their impact on blood pressure and the effect of lumiracoxib 100 mg once daily has not been studied previously. To examine whether lumiracoxib 100 mg once daily would result in lower 24-h mean systolic ambulatory blood pressure than ibuprofen 600 mg three times daily in osteoarthritis patients with controlled hypertension, a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted in 79 centres in nine countries.

Methods

Hypertensive osteoarthritis patients of 50 years at least whose office blood pressure was less than 140/90 mmHg on stable antihypertensive treatment were randomized to lumiracoxib (n = 394) 100 mg once daily or ibuprofen 600 mg three times daily (n = 393) and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed at baseline and end of study. The primary outcome measure was a comparison of the change in 24-h mean systolic ambulatory blood pressure from baseline to week 4. Secondary analyses included other blood pressure-related endpoints and efficacy (pain) measurements.

Results

Compared with baseline, the 24-h mean systolic ambulatory blood pressure (least square mean) decreased in lumiracoxib-treated patients (-2.7 mmHg) and increased in ibuprofen-treated patients (+2.2 mmHg) at 4 weeks, estimated difference -5.0 mmHg (95% confidence interval -6.1 to -3.8) in favour of lumiracoxib. The 24-h mean diastolic ambulatory blood pressure changes were -1.5 mmHg (lumiracoxib), +0.5 mmHg (ibuprofen), difference -2.0 mmHg (95% confidence interval -2.7 to -1.3). Efficacy results were comparable.

Conclusions

Treatment with lumiracoxib 100 mg once daily resulted in clinically significant lower blood pressure compared with ibuprofen 600 mg three times daily in osteoarthritis patients with well controlled hypertension.

### Acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and hypertension [^112mKam5]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Acetaminophen is widely regarded as a safe therapy for pain and fever in patients with cardiovascular disease and those taking anticoagulants. However, recent studies report that acetaminophen, like most other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, increases blood pressure, and a formulation containing sodium increases cardiovascular risk. Those findings call into question guidelines recommending acetaminophen for patients with cardiovascular disease and pain, and those taking anticoagulants. We review evidence that acetaminophen has effects in common with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and its influence on coagulation via effects on vitamin K metabolism. Possible alternatives to acetaminophen for patients with pain are discussed.

### Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of an intravenous nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam in the management of moderate-to-severe pain after bunionectomy [^115GMBZK]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Safety findings

All randomized subjects received at least one dose of study medication; 57 subjects (96.6%) received two doses, and 30 (50.8%) received a third dose after the 48-hour assessment. The findings indicated that both doses of meloxicam IV (30 and 60 mg) were generally well tolerated. Although most subjects experienced at least one treatment-emergent AE (Table 2), the majority of AEs were rated as mild and there were no meaningful differences between the study groups. No deaths or other serious AEs were reported, and no subject was discontinued from the study due to an AE. Moreover, there were no injection-related events and no apparent trends in clinically meaningful abnormal laboratory results between the study groups.

The results of liver function tests were normal in subjects who received meloxicam IV, as were all findings of renal function tests and urinalyses. The only clinically meaningful laboratory abnormality among recipients of meloxicam IV was a decreased white blood cell count in one subject. Because the subject had a history of this blood disorder, the abnormality was not considered related to the study treatment. Three subjects in the placebo group had clinically meaningful laboratory abnormalities (including two with increased gamma-glutamyl transferase levels), all of which resolved subsequently. There were no clinically meaningful changes in blood pressure or heart rate in subjects who received meloxicam IV or placebo.

Two subjects, one who received meloxicam IV 60 mg and one who received placebo, had abnormal wound healing. The subject who received meloxicam IV had local cellulitis (reported as an AE) associated with erythema and edema, none of which were considered treatment related. The placebo subject's wound was described as slightly macerated; this finding was not considered clinically significant or an AE. No clinically significant abnormal ECG findings were detected during the study, and there were no injection-related AEs reported.

### Effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy on blood pressure and peripheral edema [^112iSTeW]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used drugs with potential effects on systemic blood pressure. NSAIDs act by inhibiting synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid via cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2, the 2 isoforms of COX. NSAIDs may affect blood pressure via the renin-angiotensin pathway, alterations in sodium and water retention in the kidneys, inhibition of vasodilating PGs, and production of various vasoconstricting factors, including endothelin-1 and P450-mediated metabolites of arachidonic acid. In 2 meta-analyses, it was found that NSAIDs have small but significant effects on blood pressure, most notably in hypertensive patients on antihypertensive medication. NSAIDs cause small (< 5 mm Hg) elevations in systolic blood pressure, and little or no change in diastolic blood pressure. The incidence rates of hypertension and peripheral edema were low, ranging from < 1% to > 9% of patients. The incidence and levels of hypertension associated with COX-2 inhibitors are within the range of those observed with nonspecific NSAIDs. Apparent differences between the COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib may be functions of differences in study population susceptibilities to NSAID-mediated hypertensive effects.

### Long term monitoring in patients receiving treatment to lower blood pressure: analysis of data from placebo controlled randomised controlled trial [^117M4Cfk]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

We have shown that the probability of correctly identifying true increases in blood pressure of moderate magnitude using a typical monitoring regimen is poor, with a large proportion of observed increases in blood pressure being false positives. Monitoring at shorter time intervals increases the probability of identifying false positive increases in blood pressure attributable to short term within person variability of blood pressure. Longer intervals between measurements increase the probability that an observed increase in blood pressure is real, but the capacity of monitoring to distinguish true increases in blood pressure is poor even if monitoring is left for several years. Clinicians need better information about the value of different monitoring strategies, and future evidence based monitoring guidelines would be invaluable.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors for primary hypertension [^116RrMfd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a chronic condition associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Renin is the enzyme responsible for converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II. Renin inhibitors are a new class of drugs that decrease blood pressure (BP) by preventing the formation of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II.

Objectives

To quantify the dose-related BP lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors compared to placebo in the treatment of primary hypertension. To determine the change in BP variability, pulse pressure, and heart rate and to evaluate adverse events (mortality, non-fatal serious adverse events, total adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse effects and specific adverse events such as dry cough, diarrhoea and angioedema).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. There was no restriction by language or publication status. We also searched the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for clinical study reports, the Novartis Clinical Study Results Database, bibliographic citations from retrieved references, and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies evaluating BP lowering efficacy of fixed-dose monotherapy with renin inhibitor compared with placebo for a minimum duration of three to 12 weeks in adult patients with primary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

This systematic review is a comprehensive update which includes four additional studies and extensive detail from nine clinical study reports (CSRs) of previously included studies obtained from EMA. The remaining three CSRs are not available. Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data. In all cases where there was a difference between the CSR and the published report, data from the CSR was used. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs.

Main Results

12 studies (mean duration of eight weeks) in 7439 mostly Caucasian patients (mean age 54 years) with mild-to-moderate uncomplicated hypertension were eligible for inclusion in the review. Aliskiren was the only renin inhibitor evaluated. All included studies were assessed to have high likelihood of attrition, reporting and funding bias. Aliskiren has a dose-related systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) lowering effect as compared with placebo MD with 95% CI: aliskiren 75 mg (MD -2.97, 95% CI -4.76 to -1.18)/(MD -2.05, 95% CI -3.13 to -0.96) mm Hg (moderate-quality evidence), aliskiren 150 mg (MD -5.95, 95% CI -6.85 to -5.06)/ (MD -3.16, 95% CI -3.74 to -2.58) mm Hg (moderate-quality evidence), aliskiren 300 mg (MD -7.88, 95% CI -8.94 to -6.82)/ (MD -4.49, 95% CI -5.17 to -3.82) mm Hg (moderate-quality evidence), aliskiren 600 mg (MD -11.35, 95% CI -14.43 to -8.27)/ (MD -5.86, 95% CI -7.73 to -3.99) mm Hg (low-quality evidence). There was a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure for aliskiren 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg. The blood pressure lowering effect of aliskiren 600 mg was not different from 300 mg (MD -0.61, 95% CI -2.78 to 1.56)/(MD -0.68, 95% CI -2.03 to 0.67). Aliskiren had no effect on blood pressure variability. Due to very limited information available regarding change in heart rate and pulse pressure, it was not possible to meta-analyze these outcomes. Mortality and non-fatal serious adverse events were not increased. This review found that in studies of eight week duration aliskiren may not increase withdrawal due to adverse events (low-quality evidence). Diarrhoea was increased in a dose-dependent manner (RR 7.00, 95% CI 2.48 to 19.72) with aliskiren 600 mg (low-quality evidence). The most frequent adverse events reported were headache, nasopharyngitis, diarrhoea, dizziness and fatigue.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared to placebo, aliskiren lowered BP and this effect is dose-dependent. This magnitude of BP lowering effect is similar to that for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). There is no difference in mortality, nonfatal serious adverse events or withdrawal due to adverse effects with short term aliskiren monotherapy. Diarrhoea was considerably increased with aliskiren 600 mg.

### Effects of COX inhibition on blood pressure and kidney function in ACE inhibitor-treated blacks and hispanics [^112fs5Dm]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors attenuate the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and reduce kidney function. The study tests the hypothesis that these two classes of drugs have similar effects on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and 24-hour blood pressure. The primary endpoint was change in 24-hour systolic blood pressure. Using a randomized crossover design, 25 black and Hispanic hypertensive participants (mean age 58 ± 3 years) with osteoarthritis were studied. All participants received an ACE inhibitor at baseline. Once systolic blood pressure was < 140 mm Hg, either celecoxib 200 mg/d or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily for 4 weeks was started. After measurements were obtained, all participants underwent a 2-week washout period and crossed over to the other drug for 4 weeks. A significant difference in mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure was noted between groups at 4 weeks (+4.1 ± 1.1 mm Hg diclofenac versus +0.6 ± 0.6 mm Hg celecoxib; P = 0.01). However, because celecoxib has duration of action shorter than 24 hours, we compared ambulatory values at celecoxib trough and peak activities. At peak, no difference in systolic blood pressure was noted between agents (+3.6 ± 0.04 mm Hg diclofenac versus +4.2 ± 1.9 mm Hg celecoxib; P = 0.67). GFR was also differentially affected at 24 hours (-9.9 ± 2.4 mL/min diclofenac versus -0.4 ± 1.2 mL/min celecoxib; P = 0.01). We conclude that diclofenac and celecoxib increase systolic blood pressure at peak levels; however, these agents differ in their 24-hour effects. Differences observed in blood pressure response between COX inhibitors may not be related in their sensitivity but rather their dosing frequency.

### Trandolapril (mavik) [^111NCfqk]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension

Four placebo-controlled dose response studies were conducted using once-daily oral dosing of MAVIK in doses from 0.25 to 16 mg per day in 827 black and non-black patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The minimal effective once-daily dose was 1 mg in non-black patients and 2 mg in black patients. Further decreases in trough supine diastolic blood pressure were obtained in non-black patients with higher doses, and no further response was seen with doses above 4 mg (up to 16 mg). The antihypertensive effect diminished somewhat at the end of the dosing interval, but trough/peak ratios are well above 50% for all effective doses. There was a slightly greater effect on the diastolic pressure, but no difference on systolic pressure with b.i.d. dosing. During chronic therapy, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is achieved within one week. Following 6 weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once-daily doses of 2 to 4 mg lowered supine or standing systolic/diastolic blood pressure 24 hours after dosing by an average 7–10/4–5 mmHg below placebo responses in non-black patients. Once-daily doses of 2 to 4 mg lowered blood pressure 4–6/3–4 mmHg in black patients. Trough to peak ratios for effective doses ranged from 0.5 to 0.9. There were no differences in response between men and women, but responses were somewhat greater in patients under 60 than in patients over 60 years old. Abrupt withdrawal of MAVIK has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure.

Administration of MAVIK to patients with mild to moderate hypertension results in a reduction of supine, sitting and standing blood pressure to about the same extent without compensatory tachycardia.

Symptomatic hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt- and/or volume-depleted. (see WARNINGS .) Use of MAVIK in combination with thiazide diuretics gives a blood pressure lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone, and the additional effect of trandolapril is similar to the effect of monotherapy.

Once-daily doses of 2 to 4 mg lowered blood pressure 4 to 6/3 to 4 mmHg in black patients. Trough to peak ratios for effective doses ranged from 0.5 to 0.9. There were no differences in response between men and women, but responses were somewhat greater in patients under 60 than in patients over 60 years old. Abrupt withdrawal of trandolapril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

See Table 3 for clinically significant drug interactions with meloxicam. See also Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6, 5.12) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).

Table 3 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Meloxicam

Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g., warfarin, aspirin, SSRIs/SNRIs): Monitor patients for bleeding who are concomitantly taking meloxicam with drugs that interfere with hemostasis. Concomitant use of meloxicam and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended.

ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) or Beta-Blockers: Concomitant use with meloxicam may diminish the antihypertensive effect of these drugs. Monitor blood pressure.

ACE Inhibitors and ARBs: Concomitant use with meloxicam in elderly, volume-depleted, or those with renal impairment may result in deterioration of renal function. In such high risk patients, monitor for signs of worsening renal function.

Diuretics: NSAIDs can reduce natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics. Monitor patients to assure diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects.

### Antihypertensive drug effects on long-term blood pressure: an individual-level data meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials [^113mV2US]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study highlights the role of pharmacological agents in effectively reducing BP over several years across individuals with a wide range of characteristics, although the achieved between-group reductions, even with the intensive BP-lowering regimens, were relatively modest. Given that large-scale trials have shown the effects of pharmacological BP reduction on improving clinical outcomes, the modest BP reductions estimated in our study should still be clinically meaningful. Indeed, the estimates of long-term BP reduction in this study could inform treatment strategies and help in setting realistic treatment goals in the pharmacologic management of raised BP.

### Effects of celecoxib on ambulatory blood pressure in hypertensive patients on ACE inhibitors [^115uNBhw]. Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been shown to attenuate the antihypertensive efficacy of ACE inhibitors with average increases in systolic blood pressure (BP) of 5 to 10 mm Hg. Less is known about the specific cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors now widely used for the treatment of arthritis. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of celecoxib compared with placebo on 24-hour BP levels in ACE inhibitor-treated patients with hypertension. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial involving 178 men and women (mean age, 53 years) with essential hypertension who were treated and controlled with lisinopril monotherapy (10 to 40 mg daily). Baseline BP values were obtained using 24-hour ambulatory recordings. Patients received either celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily (twice the recommended dose for osteoarthritis) (n = 91), or placebo (n = 87) for 4 weeks, and changes in the 24-hour BP, body weight, and clinical laboratory parameters were assessed. Mean changes from baseline in the 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP were 2.6/1.5 ± 0.9/0.6 mm Hg on celecoxib versus 1.0/0.3 ± 1/0.6 mm Hg on placebo (P = 0.34 for systolic BP; P = 0.45 for diastolic BP). The proportion of patients whose 24-hour BP increased by at least 5, 10, 15, or 20 mm Hg were also similar on celecoxib and placebo. No changes in body weight, serum creatinine, or potassium occurred in either group. Thus, these data demonstrate that high doses of celecoxib have no significant effect on the antihypertensive effect of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. The placebo-subtracted changes observed in 24-hour BP (1.6/1.2 mm Hg) are less than what has been reported for nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents in ACE inhibitor-treated patients.

### Effects of celecoxib and rofecoxib on blood pressure and edema in patients ≥ 65 years of age with systemic hypertension and osteoarthritis [^111inJmF]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) specific inhibitors, with antihypertensive medication is common practice for many patients with arthritis. This study evaluated the effects of celecoxib 200 mg/day and rofecoxib 25 mg/day on blood pressure (BP) and edema in a 6-week, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind study in patients ≥ 65 years of age with osteoarthritis who were treated with fixed antihypertensive regimens. One thousand ninety-two patients received study medication (celecoxib, n = 549; rofecoxib, n = 543). Significantly more patients in the rofecoxib group compared with the celecoxib group developed increased systolic BP (change > 20 mm Hg plus absolute value ≥ 140 mm Hg) at any time point (14.9% vs 6.9%, p < 0.01). Rofecoxib caused the greatest increase in systolic BP in patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or beta blockers, whereas those on calcium channel antagonists or diuretic monotherapy receiving either celecoxib or rofecoxib showed no significant increases in BP. Clinically significant new-onset or worsening edema associated with weight gain developed in a greater percentage of patients in the rofecoxib group (7.7%) compared with the celecoxib group (4.7%) (p < 0.05). Thus, in patients with controlled hypertension on a fixed antihypertensive regimen, careful monitoring of BP is warranted after the initiation of celecoxib or rofecoxib therapy.

### Cardio-rheumatology insights into hypertension: intersection of inflammation, arteries, and heart [^116tpvNa]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

IMPACT OF MEDICATIONS USED IN IRD ON HYPERTENSION

The effect of medications used for the treatment of underlying IRD must also be considered. All NSAIDs, both nonselective and selective, at doses required to control inflammation, can increase blood pressure though the effect on BP is variable.NSAIDs can also diminish the efficacy of many antihypertensive medications, with the exception of calcium channel blockers (CCB). There has been an ongoing interest in identifying which NSAIDs have the best safety profile with regard to HTN and CV outcomes, but this remains uncertain. A meta-analysis of randomized trials studying the effect of NSAIDs on blood pressure found that when pooled, NSAIDs elevated mean blood pressure by 5.0 mmHg (95% CI, 1.2–8.7 mmHg). Additionally, long-term NSAID use may also have a negative impact on kidney function, further contributing to HTN. Using the smallest dose required for the shortest duration of time possible with careful monitoring of BP is therefore recommended with all NSAIDs. There are no RCTs evaluating the effect of corticosteroids on BP in patients with IRD. Long-term (> 6 months) and moderate-to-high doses (prednisone > 7.5 mg daily) have been associated with increased risk of developing HTN in RA, independently of other risk factors. The DMARD leflunomide has been reported to induce HTN in 2–5% of patients with RA, thought to be related to an increase in autonomic sympathetic tone, displacement of free fraction of any concomitant NSAID from protein binding, and increasing salt and water retention. Cyclosporine can also induce HTN through vasoconstrictive effect on the renal circulation resulting in reduced kidney function and should be avoided if possible in patients with HTN. The effect of biologic therapies on BP remains uncertain due to paucity of data, though TNF inhibitors have been shown to have beneficial effects on arterial stiffness in RA. In a small study of patients with RA, treatment with the TNF inhibitor infliximab was shown to result in a significant reduction in BP which was also associated with reduction in disease activity, although the study was limited by short duration of follow up.

### Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in adults aged 18 to 59 years [^116gxaYu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is an important risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events including stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure and renal failure. The main goal of treatment is to reduce these events. Systematic reviews have shown proven benefit of antihypertensive drug therapy in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality but most of the evidence is in people 60 years of age and older. We wanted to know what the effects of therapy are in people 18 to 59 years of age.

Objectives

To quantify antihypertensive drug effects on all-cause mortality in adults aged 18 to 59 years with mild to moderate primary hypertension. To quantify effects on cardiovascular mortality plus morbidity (including cerebrovascular and coronary heart disease mortality plus morbidity), withdrawal due adverse events and estimate magnitude of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) lowering at one year.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to January 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of at least one year' duration comparing antihypertensive pharmacotherapy with a placebo or no treatment in adults aged 18 to 59 years with mild to moderate primary hypertension defined as SBP 140 mmHg or greater or DBP 90 mmHg or greater at baseline, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality, total cardiovascular (CVS) mortality plus morbidity, withdrawals due to adverse events, and decrease in SBP and DBP. For dichotomous outcomes, we used risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and a fixed-effect model to combine outcomes across trials. For continuous outcomes, we used mean difference (MD) with 95% CI and a random-effects model as there was significant heterogeneity.

Main Results

The population in the seven included studies (17,327 participants) were predominantly healthy adults with mild to moderate primary hypertension. The Medical Research Council Trial of Mild Hypertension contributed 14,541 (84%) of total randomized participants, with mean age of 50 years and mean baseline blood pressure of 160/98 mmHg and a mean duration of follow-up of five years. Treatments used in this study were bendrofluazide 10 mg daily or propranolol 80 mg to 240 mg daily with addition of methyldopa if required. The risk of bias in the studies was high or unclear for a number of domains and led us to downgrade the quality of evidence for all outcomes. Based on five studies, antihypertensive drug therapy as compared to placebo or untreated control may have little or no effect on all-cause mortality (2.4% with control vs 2.3% with treatment; low quality evidence; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.13). Based on 4 studies, the effects on coronary heart disease were uncertain due to low quality evidence (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.19). Low quality evidence from six studies showed that drug therapy may reduce total cardiovascular mortality and morbidity from 4.1% to 3.2% over five years (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.91) due to reduction in cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity (1.3% with control vs 0.6% with treatment; RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.64). Very low quality evidence from three studies showed that withdrawals due to adverse events were higher with drug therapy from 0.7% to 3.0% (RR 4.82, 95% CI 1.67 to 13.92). The effects on blood pressure varied between the studies and we are uncertain as to how much of a difference treatment makes on average.

Authors' Conclusions

Antihypertensive drugs used to treat predominantly healthy adults aged 18 to 59 years with mild to moderate primary hypertension have a small absolute effect to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity primarily due to reduction in cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. All-cause mortality and coronary heart disease were not reduced. There is lack of good evidence on withdrawal due to adverse events. Future trials in this age group should be at least 10 years in duration and should compare different first-line drug classes and strategies.

### Melatonin for blood pressure control in adults [^1158J4CS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Certainty of the evidence assessment

The formal summary of findings table will prioritise the comparison of any oral melatonin supplementation (IR and CR/SR; all eligible doses pooled) versus placebo or no treatment in adults at the end‑of‑treatment time point.

We will assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. GRADE considers five domains that may lower certainty (risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias) and, where relevant, three factors that may increase certainty for non‑randomised evidence (large effect, dose‑response gradient, and effect of all plausible residual confounding). Because this review will include randomised trials, we will begin at high certainty for each outcome and downgrade as warranted; upgrading domains rarely apply but will be noted if clearly met (e.g. a consistent dose‑response gradient emerging from our planned DRMA). Two review authors will make domain‑level and overall certainty judgements independently, resolving any differences by discussion or third review author arbitration.

Outcomes to be displayed in the primary summary of findings table

The following outcomes were prioritised a priori for decision‐making and will be displayed in the primary summary of findings table irrespective of data availability (outcomes lacking data will be shown as "no evidence").

Change in SBP (mmHg) – critical
Change in DBP (mmHg) – critical
Change in MAP (mmHg) – important
Change in PP (mmHg) – important

### Lisinopril [^111jFMkL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Hypertension

Two dose-response studies utilizing a once-daily regimen were conducted in 438 mild to moderate hypertensive patients not on a diuretic. Blood pressure was measured 24 hours after dosing. An antihypertensive effect of lisinopril was seen with 5 mg of lisinopril in some patients. However, in both studies blood pressure reduction occurred sooner and was greater in patients treated with 10 mg, 20 mg or 80 mg of lisinopril than patients treated with 5 mg of lisinopril.

In controlled clinical studies of patients with mild to moderate hypertension, patients were treated with lisinopril 20 mg to 80 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg to 50 mg daily or atenolol 50 mg to 200 mg daily; and in other studies of patients with moderate to severe hypertension, patients were treated with lisinopril 20 mg to 80 mg daily or metoprolol 100 mg to 200 mg daily. Lisinopril demonstrated superior reductions of systolic and diastolic compared to hydrochlorothiazide in a population that was 75% Caucasian. Lisinopril was approximately equivalent to atenolol and metoprolol in reducing diastolic blood pressure, and had somewhat greater effects on systolic blood pressure.

Lisinopril had similar blood pressure reductions and adverse effects in younger and older (> 65 years) patients. It was less effective in reducing blood pressure in Blacks than in Caucasians.

### Management of mild hypertension in adults [^116uip38]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Elevated blood pressure is a common risk factor for cardiovascular disease and affects one in three adults. Blood pressure lowering drugs substantially reduce the risk of stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and premature death, but most clinical trials showing benefits have primarily included patients with moderate to severe hypertension, known cardiovascular disease, or elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. The benefits of treating mild hypertension in patients without cardiovascular disease are less clear, but recent meta-analyses offer some insights. Pooled data from trials that include a large percentage of participants with mild hypertension show significant reductions in stroke, death from cardiovascular disease, and total mortality. Meta-analyses comparing lower blood pressure targets also suggest a benefit of treating patients with mild hypertension, although net benefits are greater for patients at higher absolute levels of cardiovascular disease risk. Before starting drug treatment, most patients should have out-of-office monitoring to confirm hypertension. Lifestyle modifications for reducing blood pressure are appropriate for all patients and may be recommended while delaying drug treatment for those at lower absolute levels of cardiovascular disease risk. Patient level control of blood pressure is supported by home monitoring and by once daily, low cost drug. Control of blood pressure for a population of patients is enhanced by system level interventions such as registries, implementation of evidence based protocols, drug titration visits, and performance metrics.

### Effects of high salt intake on blood pressure and cardiovascular disease: the role of COX inhibitors [^1143JqPV]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Sodium has a bidirectional effect on blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). High sodium intake increases both BP and CVD, whereas low sodium intake decreases them. The significance of this association has been debated for years, mostly due to the inconsistency of data, but recently it has been revived due to new evidence about the harmful effects of sodium. Recent studies have indicated that high sodium intake was associated with an increase in BP and CVD, which in 2010 was estimated to have accounted for 1.65 million deaths worldwide. Based on this evidence, the American Heart Association has issued a Science Advisory statement regarding the significance of high sodium intake in relation to the incidence of hypertension and CVD. In addition to high sodium intake, experimental studies have shown that the coadministration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs further aggravates the harmful effects of high sodium intake. The interrelationship of high sodium intake and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs will be discussed in this commentary.

### Indomethacin (Indomethacin er) [^112PotZ1]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective
NSAIDs of up to 3 years duration have shown an increased risk of serious
cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which
can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a
similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may
be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in
patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the
shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the
development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms.
Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events
and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the
increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The
concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI
events (see WARNINGS:
Gastrointestinal Effects).

Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the
treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an
increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

NSAIDs, including indomethacin, can lead to onset of new
hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may
contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or
loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs.
NSAIDs, including indomethacin, should be used with caution in patients with
hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the
initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients
taking NSAIDs. Indomethacin should be used with caution in patients with fluid
retention or heart failure.

In a study of patients with severe heart failure and hyponatremia,
indomethacin was associated with significant deterioration of circulatory
hemodynamics, presumably due to inhibition of prostaglandin dependent
compensatory mechanisms.

### Effect of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors on blood pressure [^112Ucqo2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors (CSIs) on blood pressure.

Data Sources

Clinical literature accessed through MEDLINE (1966-May 2002). Key search terms included COX-2 selective inhibitors; anti-inflammatory agents, nonsteroidal; celecoxib; rofecoxib; and hypertension.

Data Synthesis

Data from prospective studies on the effects of CSIs on blood pressure are conflicting. Several studies have reported increased blood pressure as an adverse effect of CSIs.

Conclusions

Additional studies are needed to evaluate the effects of CSIs on blood pressure. CSIs should be used with caution in hypertensive patients and blood pressure monitored closely if a CSI is indicated.

5.3	Hepatotoxicity

Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.

Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including meloxicam.

Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue XIFYRM immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.4	Hypertension

NSAIDs, including XIFYRM, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

5.5	Heart Failure and Edema

The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.

Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of meloxicam may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Avoid the use of XIFYRM in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If XIFYRM is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.

### Daily nighttime melatonin reduces blood pressure in male patients with essential hypertension [^112pADHm]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with essential hypertension have disturbed autonomic cardiovascular regulation and circadian pacemaker function. Recently, the biological clock was shown to be involved in autonomic cardiovascular regulation. Our objective was to determine whether enhancement of the functioning of the biological clock by repeated nighttime melatonin intake might reduce ambulatory blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in 16 men with untreated essential hypertension to investigate the influence of acute (single) and repeated (daily for 3 weeks) oral melatonin (2.5 mg) intake 1 hour before sleep on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and actigraphic estimates of sleep quality. Repeated melatonin intake reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure during sleep by 6 and 4 mm Hg, respectively. The treatment did not affect heart rate. The day-night amplitudes of the rhythms in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were increased by 15% and 25%, respectively. A single dose of melatonin had no effect on blood pressure. Repeated (but not acute) melatonin also improved sleep. Improvements in blood pressure and sleep were statistically unrelated. In patients with essential hypertension, repeated bedtime melatonin intake significantly reduced nocturnal blood pressure. Future studies in larger patient group should be performed to define the characteristics of the patients who would benefit most from melatonin intake. The present study suggests that support of circadian pacemaker function may provide a new strategy in the treatment of essential hypertension.

### Effects of nabumetone, celecoxib, and ibuprofen on blood pressure control in hypertensive patients on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [^112P5r8B]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs interfere with certain antihypertensive therapies. In a double-blind study, 385 hypertensive patients stabilized on an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor were treated with nabumetone, celecoxib, ibuprofen, or placebo for 4 weeks. Ibuprofen caused significantly greater increases in systolic (P < .001) and diastolic (P < .01) blood pressures (BPs) compared to placebo, but not nabumetone or celecoxib. The proportion of patients with systolic BP increases of clinical concern at end point was significantly higher (P < .001) for the ibuprofen group (16.7%; 15 of 90), but not for the nabumetone group (5.5%; 5 of 91) or the celecoxib group (4.6%; 4 of 87) compared to the placebo group (1.1%; 1 of 91).

### Blood pressure elevation in a patient treated with salsalate [^112pQ5xF]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of increased blood pressure associated with the use of salsalate in an elderly patient with no prior history of hypertension.

Case Summary

A 78-year-old white man with no prior history of hypertension initiated salsalate therapy for low-back pain. Over the 15 months prior to the initiation of salsalate, his blood pressure averaged 127 ± 7 mm Hg systolic and 84 ± 6 mm Hg diastolic (mean ± SD). After initiation of salsalate, he experienced significant elevations in blood pressure, which led to a preliminary diagnosis of hypertension. Blood pressure after initiation of salsalate averaged 150 ± 13 mm Hg systolic and 95 ± 5 mm Hg diastolic. No changes in medications or medication doses (with the exception of warfarin) occurred in the 18 months prior to or during salsalate therapy. His weight remained stable. A detailed review of his medical records and history revealed no other causes for these elevations in blood pressure. Salsalate therapy was discontinued and his blood pressure returned to normotensive levels (119 ± 2 mm Hg systolic and 81 ± 2 mm Hg diastolic).

Discussion

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced elevations in blood pressure have been well documented in patients receiving antihypertensive medications. Due to its relative weak inhibition of cyclooxygenase and lack of published literature in hypertensive patients, salsalate is considered to have little or no effect on blood pressure. Our report documents a possible case of salsalate-induced hypertension in a previously normotensive elderly man. Observational studies suggest that NSAID use may increase the risk of developing hypertension in older patients.

Conclusions

Clinicians should be aware of the possible effects of NSAIDs on blood pressure. Blood pressure monitoring following the initiation of salsalate may be warranted, particularly in older patients.

### Effect of sibutramine on blood pressure in patients with obesity and well-controlled hypertension or normotension [^114TgVR7]. Endocrine Practice (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the short-term effects of sibu-tramine on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) in normotensive and controlled hypertensive obese patients by using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM).

Methods

Before and 5 to 7 days after the initiation of sibutramine treatment (10 mg or 15 mg daily), when steady-state concentrations of sibutramine had been reached, ABPM was performed in 81 obese patients. Of this overall study group, 47 patients (26 with normoten-sion and 21 with controlled hypertension) received sibu-tramine in a dosage of 10 mg/day, and 34 patients (18 with normotension and 16 with controlled hypertension) received sibutramine in a dosage of 15 mg/day.

Results

Office-measured systolic and diastolic BPs in normotensive and controlled hypertensive groups of patients with obesity were not significantly different before and after treatment with both doses of sibutramine. ABPM results for normotensive obese groups showed that mean systolic and diastolic BPs were not significantly different after treatment with either 10-mg or 15-mg daily doses of sibutramine, in comparison with baseline. Similarly, in the controlled hypertensive obese groups, the ABPM results were not significantly different before and after sibutramine treatment. Moreover, the mean HR did not change significantly after versus before sibutramine treatment in both dosage groups.

Conclusion

Sibutramine did not induce or exacerbate hypertension and had no effect on HR in normotensive and controlled hypertensive obese patients when used in either of two suggested daily doses (10 mg or 15 mg).

Adverse Events of Special Interest

The incidence of AEs of special interest is summarized in Table 5. Across treatment groups, the number and frequency of bleeding, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, wound healing, and injection site events were generally similar. Renal events in meloxicam IV subjects included acute kidney injury (n = 2 [0.7%]) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) increased (n = 2 [0.7%]). One report of acute kidney injury occurred 14 days after administration of meloxicam IV in a subject with an elevated creatinine value and 2+ urine protein before dosing. The other report occurred 1 day after the first dose of meloxicam IV and resolved the next day in a subject whose creatinine values were within the reference range before and after dosing. Investigators assessed renal events as mild or moderate in intensity. One event of increased BUN was considered possibly related to study treatment; all other renal events were assessed as not related to study medication. Thrombotic events in meloxicam IV subjects included post-procedural pulmonary embolism (n = 2 [0.7%]) and deep vein thrombosis (n = 1 [0.4%]). All three subjects underwent knee surgery and had concomitant medical conditions (coronary artery disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia with a previous myocardial infarction) that predisposed them for thromboembolic phenomena.

17. PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with celecoxib and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy.

17.1 Medication Guide

Patients should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide for NSAIDs that accompanies each prescription dispensed, and should be instructed to read the Medication Guide prior to using celecoxib.

17.2 Cardiovascular Effects

Patients should be informed that celecoxib may cause serious CV side effects such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Patients should be informed of the the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and to seek immediate medical advice if they observe any of these signs or symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Patients should be informed that celecoxib can lead to the onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, and that celecoxib may impair the response of some antihypertensive agents. Patients should be instructed on the proper follow up for monitoring of blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.4)].

17.3 Gastrointestinal Effects

Patients should be informed that celecoxib can cause gastrointestinal discomfort and more serious side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and to seek immediate medical advice if they observe any signs or symptoms that are indicative of these disorders, including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

17.4 Hepatic Effects

Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). Patients should be instructed that they should stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy if these signs and symptoms occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### Aged garlic extract reduces blood pressure in hypertensives: a dose-response trial [^1115GXkh]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Hypertension affects about 30% of adults worldwide. Garlic has blood pressure-lowering properties and the mechanism of action is biologically plausible. Our trial assessed the effect, dose-response, tolerability and acceptability of different doses of aged garlic extract as an adjunct treatment to existing antihypertensive medication in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

Subjects/Methods

A total of 79 general practice patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension participated in a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled dose-response trial of 12 weeks. Participants were allocated to one of three garlic groups with either of one, two or four capsules daily of aged garlic extract (240/480/960mg containing 0.6/1.2/2.4mg of S-allylcysteine) or placebo. Blood pressure was assessed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks and compared with baseline using a mixed-model approach. Tolerability was monitored throughout the trial and acceptability was assessed at 12 weeks by questionnaire.

Results

Mean systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced by 11.8 ± 5.4mmHg in the garlic-2-capsule group over 12 weeks compared with placebo (P = 0.006), and reached borderline significant reduction in the garlic-4-capsule group at 8 weeks (-7.4 ± 4.1mmHg, P = 0.07). Changes in systolic blood pressure in the garlic-1-capsule group and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly different to placebo. Tolerability, compliance and acceptability were high in all garlic groups (93%) and highest in the groups taking one or two capsules daily.

Conclusions

Our trial suggests aged garlic extract to be an effective and tolerable treatment in uncontrolled hypertension, and may be considered as a safe adjunct treatment to conventional antihypertensive therapy.

### Meloxicam, rizatriptan (Symbravo) [^1138fvAy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

SYMBRAVO contains meloxicam and rizatriptan.

Meloxicam has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of meloxicam, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).

Meloxicam is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Meloxicam concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because meloxicam is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.

Rizatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT1B/1Dreceptors. Rizatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache by binding to 5-HT1B/1Dreceptors located on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Cardiac Electrophysiology

Rizatriptan

The effects of rizatriptan on QT prolongation have not been studied; however, arrhythmias have occurred after administration of 5-HT1agonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Blood Pressure

Rizatriptan

Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients treated with rizatriptan, with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

### Antihypertensive drug effects on long-term blood pressure: an individual-level data meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials [^115SPTjv]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical guidelines for managing hypertension have invariably lowered the recommended blood pressure (BP) targets for patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease, informed by evidence from large-scale randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and their meta-analyses showing substantial reductions in cardiovascular risk with more intensive BP-lowering treatment and independently of baseline BP values. For most hypertensive patients, the lowered BP targets inevitably lead to a larger gap between their usual BP and the recommended target value, requiring more intensive pharmacological treatment.

Attributing changes to treatment based on repeated measures of BP of an individual patient can be unreliable since measurements are subject to random fluctuations, regression to the mean, non-pharmacological effects and other sources of variability that can exceed true variability in treatment response. However, it would be useful to have reliable information about the expected effects of drug treatment on BP levels over time from randomised comparisons to help interpret BP readings such as those obtained during clinical encounters. To date, randomised evidence on the effect of antihypertensive drugs on BP has come from efficacy trials with small numbers of highly selected participants and short follow-up durations. Pooled evidence from RCTs using information from individual participants' repeated BP measurements currently does not exist, which might explain why there is no guidance on the expected magnitudes of BP reduction with the various proposed treatment strategies and whether these reductions are expected to vary among people with different characteristics.

We addressed this evidence gap by using information from 52 trials involving 363 684 participants with individual-level data on repeated BP measurements over several yearsto conduct a meta-analysis to quantify the unconfounded effects of BP-lowering drugs on BP over time and examine these effects across different subgroups.

5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs, including meloxicam, has resulted in renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, acute renal failure, and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

The renal effects of meloxicam may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease. Because some meloxicam metabolites are excreted by the kidney, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating meloxicam. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of meloxicam [see Drug Interactions (7)].

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of meloxicam in patients with advanced renal disease. Avoid the use of meloxicam in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If meloxicam is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions

Meloxicam has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to meloxicam and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.

### Ibuprofen [^11386PNv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension

NSAIDs including ibuprofen tablets, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including ibuprofen tablets, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

Heart Failure and Edema

The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.

Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of ibuprofen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions [e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (see DRUG INTERACTIONS).

Avoid the use of ibuprofen tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If ibuprofen tablets is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.

### The impact of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on blood pressure, with an emphasis on newer agents [^111mtPfG]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Both nonselective and selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported to increase blood pressure (BP).

Objective

This review summarizes the most recent data regarding the BP changes that may occur with routine dosing of nonselective or selective NSAIDs, with a focus on the latter. The review includes both clinical trials and studies having more naturalistic designs.

Methods

Relevant articles were identified through a search of MEDLINE emphasizing NSAIDs and hypertension.

Results

It is well established that NSAIDs increase BP in certain patients. Patients with existing hypertension seem to be at greatest risk for this adverse event. There seem to be differences between nonselective NSAIDs with regard to their effect on BP; indomethacin, naproxen, and piroxicam have been associated with clinically significant changes in BP. Most of the available evidence concerning the selective NSAIDs suggests that rofecoxib is more likely than celecoxib to raise systolic BP. Based on the results of trials in the treatment of BP, increases in systolic BP produced by these NSAIDs may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The adverse effects of NSAIDs on BP may be related to the specific drug or to the dose or duration of therapy, as well as to patient-specific characteristics.

Conclusions

Clinically significant BP changes may occur after treatment with either nonselective or selective NSAIDs. The observed BP changes are not the same for all products, however.

### The effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other commonly used non-narcotic analgesics on blood pressure level in adults [^115GaZun]. Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

This review explores the blood pressure effects of three non-narcotic analgesics: non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), paracetamol and aspirin. The current evidence suggests that in normotensive, otherwise healthy adults, short-term use (1–2 weeks) of NSAIDs is not associated with a significant increase in blood pressure. Those with existing hypertension are more likely to see a blood pressure elevation, although the magnitude of the effect is less predictable and may vary with age, baseline blood pressure, type of NSAID and concurrent antihypertensive therapy. The magnitude of the blood pressure increase appears to be similar for both NSAIDs and paracetamol, while low-dose aspirin may have more modest effects. In hypertensive adults who experience deterioration of blood pressure control on NSAIDs, there is some, albeit suboptimal, evidence that the blood pressure-raising effects of NSAIDs are less when used in conjunction with dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

### Meloxicam (Xifyrm) [^112Wmy4E]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Symptoms following acute NSAID overdoses have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6)].

Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may be employed but are not likely to be useful due to high protein binding.

There is limited experience with meloxicam overdose. In four reported cases of meloxicam overdose, patients took 6 to 11 times the highest available oral dose of meloxicam tablets (15 mg); all recovered. Cholestyramine is known to accelerate the clearance of meloxicam.

Accelerated removal of meloxicam by 4 g doses of cholestyramine given three times a day was demonstrated in a clinical trial. Administration of cholestyramine may be useful following an overdosage.

In case of an overdosage, discontinue XIFYRM therapy and contact a regional poison control center at 1–800–222–1222.

### Differential blood pressure effects of ibuprofen, naproxen, and celecoxib in patients with arthritis: the PRECISION-ABPM (prospective randomized evaluation of celecoxib integrated safety versus ibuprofen or naproxen ambulatory blood pressure measurement) trial [^115c7s2y]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), both non-selective and selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, are among the most widely prescribed drugs worldwide, but associate with increased blood pressure (BP) and adverse cardiovascular (CV) events. PRECISION-ABPM, a substudy of PRECISION was conducted at 60 sites, to determine BP effects of the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib vs. the non-selective NSAIDs naproxen and ibuprofen.

Methods and Results

In this double-blind, randomized, multicentre non-inferiority CV-safety trial, 444 patients (mean age 62 ± 10years, 54% female) with osteoarthritis (92%) or rheumatoid arthritis (8%) and evidence of or at increased risk for coronary artery disease received celecoxib (100–200mg bid), ibuprofen (600–800mg tid), or naproxen (375–500mg bid) with matching placebos in a 1: 1: 1 allocation, to assess the effect on 24-h ambulatory BP after 4months. The change in mean 24-h systolic BP (SBP) in celecoxib, ibuprofen and naproxen-treated patients was -0.3mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI), -2.25, 1.74], 3.7 (95% CI, 1.72, 5.58) and 1.6mmHg (95% CI, -0.40, 3.57), respectively. These changes resulted in a difference of-3.9mmHg (P = 0.0009) between celecoxib and ibuprofen, of-1.8mmHg (P = 0.12) between celecoxib and naproxen, and of-2.1mmHg (P = 0.08) between naproxen and ibuprofen. The percentage of patients with normal baseline BP who developed hypertension (mean 24-h SBP ≥ 130 and/or diastolic BP ≥ 80mmHg) was 23.2% for ibuprofen, 19.0% for naproxen, and 10.3% for celecoxib (odds ratio 0.39, P = 0.004 and odds ratio 0.49, P = 0.03 vs. ibuprofen and naproxen, respectively).

Conclusions

In PRECISION-ABPM, allocation to the non-selective NSAID ibuprofen, compared with the COX-2 selective inhibitor celecoxib was associated with a significant increase of SBP, and a higher incidence of new-onset hypertension.

### Meloxicam, rizatriptan (Symbravo) [^114xqidb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Hypertension/Increase in Blood Pressure

NSAIDs, including meloxicam, a component of SYMBRAVO, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Significant elevation in blood pressure (BP), including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension receiving 5-HT1agonists, including rizatriptan, a component of SYMBRAVO. In healthy young adult male and female patients who received maximal doses of rizatriptan (10 mg every 2 hours for 3 doses), slight increases in BP (approximately 2–3 mmHg) were observed. SYMBRAVO is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)].

Monitor BP during the initiation of SYMBRAVO treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

5.10 Heart Failure and Edema

The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately 2-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.

Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of SYMBRAVO may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Avoid the use of SYMBRAVO in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If SYMBRAVO is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.

### Administration time-dependent effects of aspirin on blood pressure in untreated hypertensive patients [^111XoXy1]. Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Previous studies on the potential influence of aspirin on blood pressure have not taken into consideration the chronopharmacological effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This pilot study investigates the effects of aspirin on blood pressure in untreated hypertensive patients who received aspirin at different times of the day according to their rest-activity cycle. We studied 100 untreated patients with mild hypertension (34 men and 66 women), 42.5 ± 11.6 (mean ± SD) years of age, randomly divided into 3 groups: nonpharmacological hygienic-dietary recommendations; the same recommendations and aspirin (100 mg/d) on awakening; or the same recommendations and aspirin before bedtime. Blood pressure was measured every 20 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes at night for 48 consecutive hours before and after 3 months of intervention. The circadian pattern of blood pressure in each group was established by population multiple-component analysis. After 3 months of nonpharmacological intervention, there was a small, nonsignificant reduction of blood pressure (< 1.1 mm Hg; P > 0.341). There was no change in blood pressure when aspirin was given on awakening (P = 0.229). A highly significant blood pressure reduction was, however, observed in the patients who received aspirin before bedtime (decrease of 6 and 4 mm Hg in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively; P < 0.001). Results indicate a statistically significant administration time-dependent effect of low-dose aspirin on blood pressure in untreated patients with mild hypertension. The influence of aspirin on blood pressure demonstrated in this study indicates the need to quantify and control for aspirin effects in patients using this drug in combination with antihypertensive medication.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^1148paiZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of this review first published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors usually try to achieve a blood pressure target. That target is the blood pressure value below which the optimal clinical benefit is supposedly obtained. "The lower the better" approach that guided the treatment of elevated blood pressure for many years was challenged during the last decade due to lack of evidence from randomised trials supporting that strategy. For that reason, the standard blood pressure target in clinical practice during the last years has been less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population of patients with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials published in recent years have reintroduced the idea of trying to achieve lower blood pressure targets. Therefore, it is important to know whether the benefits outweigh harms when attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target.

Objectives

The primary objective was to determine if lower blood pressure targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (less than or equal to 140/ 90 mm Hg) for the treatment of patients with chronic arterial hypertension. The secondary objectives were: to determine if there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP associated with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension; and to determine if there is a change in withdrawals due to adverse events with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets", in patients with elevated blood pressure.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to May 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2019, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients allocated to lower or to standard blood pressure targets (see above).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JAA, VL) independently assessed the included trials and extracted data. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, end stage renal disease, and other serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean SBP and DBP, withdrawals due to adverse effects, and mean number of antihypertensive drugs used. We assessed the risk of bias of each trial using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: This update includes 11 RCTs involving 38,688 participants with a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. This represents 7 new RCTs compared with the original version. At baseline the mean weighted age was 63.1 years and the mean weighted blood pressure was 155/91 mm Hg. Lower targets do not reduce total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 11 trials, 38,688 participants; high-certainty evidence) and do not reduce total serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.08; 6 trials, 18,165 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that the benefits of lower targets do not outweigh the harms as compared to standard blood pressure targets. Lower targets may reduce myocardial infarction (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96; 6 trials, 18,938 participants, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.4%, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 250 over 3.7 years) and congestive heart failure (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92; 5 trials, 15,859 participants, ARR 0.6%, NNTB 167 over 3.7 years) (low-certainty for both outcomes). Reduction in myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure was not reflected in total serious adverse events. This may be due to an increase in other serious adverse events (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.59; 6 trials. 18,938 participants, absolute risk increase (ARI) 3%, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 33 over four years) (low-certainty evidence). Participants assigned to a "lower" target received one additional antihypertensive medication and achieved a significantly lower mean SBP (122.8 mm Hg versus 135.0 mm Hg, and a lower mean DBP (82.0 mm Hg versus 85.2 mm Hg, than those assigned to "standard target".

Authors' Conclusions

For the general population of persons with elevated blood pressure, the benefits of trying to achieve a lower blood pressure target rather than a standard target (≤ 140/90 mm Hg) do not outweigh the harms associated with that intervention. Further research is needed to see if some groups of patients would benefit or be harmed by lower targets. The results of this review are primarily applicable to older people with moderate to high cardiovascular risk. They may not be applicable to other populations.

### Lorundrostat efficacy and safety in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [^116nqxea]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Aldosterone dysregulation contributes to hypertension. Lorundrostat is an aldosterone synthase inhibitor, but data on its efficacy and safety in patients with hypertension are limited.

Methods

In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned participants who were receiving two to five antihypertensive medications and had a blood-pressure measurement of 140/90 mm Hg or higher obtained during an office visit to undergo a standardized antihypertensive regimen for 3 weeks. Subsequently, participants with an average 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg or higher were assigned to receive placebo, lorundrostat at a stable dose of 50 mg daily (the stable-dose group), or lorundrostat at a starting dose of 50 mg daily, with an increase to 100 mg daily if systolic blood pressure was 130 mm Hg or higher after 4 weeks (the dose-adjustment group). The primary end point was the change in 24-hour average systolic blood pressure from baseline to week 12, assessed as the least-squares mean difference from placebo (the placebo-adjusted change) in each lorundrostat group. A key secondary end point was the change in 24-hour average systolic blood pressure from baseline to week 4, assessed as the placebo-adjusted change in the combined lorundrostat groups.

Results

A total of 285 participants underwent randomization; 94 were assigned to the stable-dose group, 96 to the dose-adjustment group, and 95 to the placebo group. The mean age was 60 years, and 150 participants (53%) were Black. After 12 weeks, the least-squares mean change in 24-hour average systolic blood pressure was -15.4 mm Hg in the stable-dose group, -13.9 mm Hg in the dose-adjustment group, and -7.4 mm Hg in the placebo group. The placebo-adjusted change in blood pressure was -7.9 mm Hg (97.5% confidence interval [CI] -13.3 to -2.6) in the stable-dose group and -6.5 mm Hg (97.5% CI, -11.8 to -1.2) in the dose-adjustment group. The placebo-adjusted change in 24-hour average systolic blood pressure from baseline to week 4 in the combined lorundrostat groups was -5.3 mm Hg (95% CI, -8.4 to -2.3). A potassium level above 6.0 mmol per liter occurred in 5 participants (5%) in the stable-dose group, 7 participants (7%) in the dose-adjustment group, and no participants in the placebo group.

Conclusions

Lorundrostat was associated with greater reductions in 24-hour average blood pressure than placebo in participants with uncontrolled and treatment-resistant hypertension. (Funded by Mineralys Therapeutics; Advance-HTN ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05769608.).

### Do COX-2 inhibitors raise blood pressure more than nonselective NSAIDs and placebo? An updated meta-analysis [^117MoUGu]. Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Both COX-2 selective inhibitors (coxibs) and nonselective (ns)-NSAIDs elevate blood pressure (BP) and this may contribute to excess cardiovascular (CV) events. A number of recent large-scale randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing coxibs (including newer agents, lumiracoxib and etoricoxib) to both ns-NSAIDs and placebo have been reported, permitting an update to earlier BP analyses of these agents.

Data Sources/Synthesis

Our search yielded 51 RCTs involving coxibs published before April 2008 with a total of 130 541 participants in which BP data were available. The Der Simonian and Laird random effects method for dichotomous variables was used to produce risk ratios (RR) for development of hypertension.

Results

For coxibs versus placebo, there was a RR of 1.49 (1.18–1.88, P = 0.04) in the development of new hypertension. For coxibs versus ns-NSAIDs, the RR was 1.12 (0.93–1.35, P = 0.23). These results were mainly driven by rofecoxib, with a RR of 1.87 (1.63–2.14, P = 0.08) versus placebo, and etoricoxib, with a RR of 1.52 (1.39–1.66, P = 0.01) versus ns-NSAID.

Conclusion

On the basis of this updated meta-analysis, coxibs appear to produce greater hypertension than either ns-NSAIDs or placebo. However, this response was heterogeneous, with markedly raised BP associated with rofecoxib and etoricoxib, whereas celecoxib, valdecoxib and lumiracoxib appeared to have little BP effect. The relationship of this increased risk of hypertension to subsequent adverse CV outcomes requires further investigation and prospective RCTs.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) values ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values ≥ 90 mmHg. In most people with hypertension, there is no clear cause, called essential hypertension, which accounts for more than 90% of all people with hypertension. High blood pressure significantly increases the incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease and is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease and premature death worldwide. In 2019, approximately 1.2 billion people globally were estimated to have hypertension — twice as many as in the year 1990, Particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries, prevalence is higher, severely increasing the burden and cost of the disease to global health systems. Preventing and controlling hypertension is a major global public health strategy for reducing premature mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Therefore, it is essential to control high blood pressure. However, the overall global hypertension control rate remains low. Studies have shown that patients with treated but uncontrolled hypertension have a significantly increased risk of all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, so increasing the rate of blood pressure control may reduce the incidence of related complications.

### Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of an intravenous nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam in the management of moderate-to-severe pain after bunionectomy [^115j8Apj]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Safety endpoints

These included the occurrence of AEs and serious AEs; wound-healing status; changes in vital signs from baseline and the incidence of clinically significant changes in vital signs; changes from baseline in clinical laboratory test parameters and the incidence of abnormal values; and the incidence of clinically significant abnormal ECG findings. Vital signs including resting blood pressure, resting pulse, respiratory rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation were measured and recorded 15 minutes before dosing and 0.5, 1, 2, and 6 hours after dosing (± 15 minutes). Vital signs were also recorded at Hour 48 and at Day 7. A 12-lead ECG was completed at screening, at check-in on Day −1 (if screening ECG was done > 7 days prior to Day −1), at Hour 48 prior to discharge, at the Day 7 visit, and at time of early discontinuation. Urine and blood samples were collected for routine clinical laboratory testing during the screening visit, on Day −1 during check-in, at the Day 7 visit, and in the event of subject early discontinuation.

Methods

Study design and subjects

This Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed at a single center in the United States (Chesapeake Research Group, Pasadena, MD) in males and females aged 18–75 years in good health (American Society of Anesthesiology class 1 or 2) who were scheduled to undergo a primary, unilateral, first metatarsal osteotomy and internal fixation (without collateral procedures) during the period August 10 to November 20, 2015.

On the first postoperative day, subjects eligible for study participation were required to have moderate-to-severe pain on a 4-point Likert scale and a score of ≥ 4 on the 11-point numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) after cessation of a popliteal sciatic nerve block and discontinuation of other pain management measures.

Ineligible participants included those with known hypersensitivity to aspirin, NSAIDs, or any of the peri- or postoperative medications used in the study; active gastrointestinal bleeding or a history of peptic ulcer disease; known bleeding disorders affecting coagulation; evidence of respiratory insufficiency, hypotension, or bradycardia; a history of migraine, frequent headaches, seizures, or significant renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurologic, or psychiatric disease; or a history of alcohol or drug abuse, hepatitis B or C, or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Further ineligibility criteria included subjects with other painful physical conditions that could interfere with the assessment of postoperative pain; those with a body mass index > 35 kg/m 2; and pregnant or lactating females. Subjects receiving various other medications were also excluded, including those taking opioids long term (ie, for > 30 consecutive days in the past year) and those taking antiepileptic and antidepressant drugs, neuroleptics, systemic or intra-articular corticosteroids (within 6 weeks prior to the study), sedative/hypnotic drugs, warfarin, lithium, and/or combinations of furosemide with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Also prohibited were other analgesics (except prespecified drugs for postoperative rescue use), prophylactic antiemetics, epidural or spinal anesthetics, and pre-, intra-, or postoperative corticosteroids.

The study was approved by an independent institutional review board (Sterling IRB, Atlanta, GA, USA). All subjects enrolled provided written informed consent prior to their participation. All clinical work was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (as referenced in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guideline E6), local regulatory requirements, and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Pregnancy hypertension — common oral antihypertensive agents and dosing: Labetalol is dosed 200–2400 mg/d orally in 2 to 3 divided doses and is commonly initiated at 100–200 mg twice daily; it has potential bronchoconstrictive effects and should be avoided in women with asthma, preexisting myocardial disease, decompensated cardiac function, and heart block and bradycardia. Nifedipine (extended release) is dosed 30–120 mg/d orally of an extended- release preparation and commonly initiated at 30–60 mg once daily (extended release); do not use sublingual form, and immediate-release formulation should generally be reserved for control of severe, acutely elevated blood pressures in hospitalized patients and should be avoided in tachycardia. Methyldopa is dosed 500–3000 mg/d orally in 2 to 4 divided doses and is commonly initiated at 250 mg 2 or 3 times daily; safety data extend up to 7 y of age in offspring, though it may not be as effective as other medications — especially in control of severe hypertension — and use is limited by side effects (sedation, depression, dizziness). Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–50 mg daily is considered a second- or third-line agent.

BP levels

BP levels at baseline and 16 weeks after OLM administration are presented in Table 7. BP at 16 weeks is presented to show BP control status, similar to a second baseline. The first measurement of morning HBP at baseline was 151.6 ± 16.4/87.1 ± 11.8 mm Hg; the second measurement was 150.1 ± 16.2/86.6 ± 11.4 mm Hg. The first measurement of bedtime HBP was 144.3 ± 16.8/82.8 ± 11.9 mm Hg, and the second measurement was 143.8 ± 16.8/82.6 ± 11.5 mm Hg, whereas the CBP was 153.6 ± 19.0/87.1 ± 13.4 mm Hg. The first measurement of morning HBP at 16 weeks was 135.0 ± 13.7/78.8 ± 9.9 mm Hg; the second measurement was 133.0 ± 13.5/78.1 ± 9.9 mm Hg. The first HBP measurement at bedtime was 129.7 ± 13.8/74.7 ± 10.1 mm Hg; the second measurement was 127.6 ± 13.7/73.9 ± 10.0 mm Hg, whereas the CBP was 135.6 ± 15.4/77.6 ± 10.9 mm Hg.

Differences between the first and second measurement of morning systolic HBP at baseline and 16 weeks after OLM administration were calculated in patients who measured both a first and second morning HBP at baseline or at 16 weeks. Differences at baseline representing increases that were > 10 mm Hg, 5 < to 10 mm Hg and 0 < to 5 mm Hg as well as decreases 0– < 5 mm Hg, 5– < 10 mm Hg, 10– < 15 mm Hg and ≥ 15 mm Hg were 2.1, 4.4, 19.8, 42.1, 20.0, 7.4 and 4.2%. Differences at 16 weeks were 1.8, 5.3, 22.7, 43.1, 18.9, 5.7 and 2.5%.

Of those whose systolic HBP was measured twice, the proportion of patients who had a systolic BP 150 mm Hg or more at the first HBP measurement and a reduction of 15 mm Hg or more at the second HBP measurement was 3.3% at baseline and 1.0% at 16 weeks.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular, renal or gastrointestinal comorbidities: joint APAGE / APLAR / APSDE / APSH / APSN / PoA recommendations [^111X1Brb]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most commonly prescribed medications, but they are associated with a number of serious adverse effects, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney injury and GI complications.

Objective

To develop a set of multidisciplinary recommendations for the safe prescription of NSAIDs.

Methods

Randomised control trials and observational studies published before January 2018 were reviewed, with 329 papers included for the synthesis of evidence-based recommendations.

Results

Whenever possible, a NSAID should be avoided in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, high risk of cardiovascular disease and severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). Before treatment with a NSAID is started, blood pressure should be measured, unrecognised CKD should be screened in high risk cases, and unexplained iron-deficiency anaemia should be investigated. For patients with high cardiovascular risk, and if NSAID treatment cannot be avoided, naproxen or celecoxib are preferred. For patients with a moderate risk of peptic ulcer disease, monotherapy with a non-selective NSAID plus a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), or a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor should be used; for those with a high risk of peptic ulcer disease, a selective COX-2 inhibitor plus PPI are needed. For patients with pre-existing hypertension receiving renin-angiotensin system blockers, empirical addition (or increase in the dose) of an antihypertensive agent of a different class should be considered. Blood pressure and renal function should be monitored in most cases.

Conclusion

NSAIDs are a valuable armamentarium in clinical medicine, but appropriate recognition of high-risk cases, selection of a specific agent, choice of ulcer prophylaxis and monitoring after therapy are necessary to minimise the risk of adverse events.

### Intravenous meloxicam for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain: a pooled analysis of safety and opioid-reducing effects [^115oGaHw]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

To describe the safety and tolerability of intravenous meloxicam compared with placebo across all phase II/III clinical trials.

Methods

Safety data and opioid use from subjects with moderate to severe postoperative pain who received ≥ 1 dose of intravenous meloxicam (5–60 mg) or placebo in 1 of 7 studies (4 phase II; 3 phase III) were pooled. Data from intravenous meloxicam 5 mg, 7.5 mg and 15 mg groups were combined (low-dose subset).

Results

A total of 1426 adults (86.6% white; mean age: 45.8 years) received ≥ 1 dose of meloxicam IV; 517 (77.6% white; mean age: 46.7 years) received placebo. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in intravenous meloxicam and placebo-treated subjects was 47% and 57%, respectively. The most commonly reported TEAEs across treatment groups (intravenous meloxicam 5–15 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg and placebo, respectively) were nausea (4.3%, 20.8%, 5.8% and 25.3%), headache (1.5%, 5.6%, 1.6% and 10.4%), vomiting (2.8%, 4.6%, 1.6% and 7.4%) and dizziness (0%, 3.5%, 1.1% and 4.8%). TEAE incidence was generally similar in subjects aged > 65 years with impaired renal function and the general population. Similar rates of cardiovascular events were reported between treatment groups. One death was reported (placebo group; unrelated to study drug). There were 35 serious adverse events (SAEs); intravenous meloxicam 15 mg (n = 5), intravenous meloxicam 30 mg (n = 15) and placebo (n = 15). The SAEs in meloxicam-treated subjects were determined to be unrelated to study medication. Six subjects withdrew due to TEAEs, including three treated with intravenous meloxicam (rash, localized edema and postprocedural pulmonary embolism). In trials where opioid use was monitored, meloxicam reduced postoperative rescue opioid use.

Conclusions

Intravenous meloxicam was generally well tolerated in subjects with moderate to severe postoperative pain.

### Risk of serious upper gastrointestinal and cardiovascular thromboembolic complications with meloxicam [^112vXNAA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the risk of serious gastrointestinal and thromboembolic complications with approved doses of meloxicam.

Methods

We pooled data from clinical trials of meloxicam at doses of 7.5 or 15 mg/d. A blinded gastrointestinal adjudication committee used prespecified criteria to identify gastric or duodenal perforation, gastric outlet obstruction, or hemodynamically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding. For analysis of thromboembolic complications, investigator-reported events were analyzed without adjudication.

Results

We analyzed data from 24,196 patients from 28 trials, most of whom had been followed for up to 60 days. Of these patients, 13,118 received meloxicam (10,158 received a daily dose of 7.5 mg and 2960 received 15 mg), 5283 were treated with diclofenac 100 mg, 181 received diclofenac 150 mg, 5371 were treated with piroxicam 20 mg, and 243 received naproxen 500 mg twice daily. Patients who received 7.5 mg of meloxicam daily had a 0.03% risk of serious upper gastrointestinal events, which was significantly lower than the risk in those who received diclofenac, naproxen, or piroxicam (P < 0.02). With the 15 mg daily dose of meloxicam, this risk was significantly different only when compared with piroxicam (P = 0.03). The risk of thromboembolic events in patients treated with meloxicam at either dose was lower than with diclofenac, but similar to that observed with piroxicam and naproxen.

Conclusion

This pooled analysis of 24,196 patients demonstrates that meloxicam has a favorable gastrointestinal and thromboembolic safety profile. However, only a small number of patients were followed for more than 60 days, and meaningful comparisons were not possible in this subgroup.

Cardiovascular Effects

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (see GI WARNINGS).

Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hypertension

NSAIDs, including piroxicam capsules, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including piroxicam capsules, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

Congestive Heart Failure and Edema

Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients taking NSAIDs. Piroxicam capsules should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure.
