## Question

5. Three ants, Xiaohong, Xiahei, and Xiaohuang, go on a trip. The hotel has 9 different rooms, and no two ants can stay in rooms that are in the same row or the same column. There are $\qquad$ possible arrangements for their rooms.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many ways three distinct ants can be assigned to 9 hotel rooms arranged in a 3×3 grid such that no two ants share the same row or the same column. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the grid structure and the constraint. Then, I should verify how to count valid placements for the first, second, and third ants. Next, I will consider whether the ants are distinguishable or indistinguishable and how that affects the total. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and state the answer clearly.

> Let me first confirm the setup: the hotel has 9 rooms arranged in a 3×3 grid, so there are 3 rows and 3 columns, and we must place three ants so that no two are in the same row or the same column. The ants are named Xiaohong, Xiahei, and Xiaohuang, so they are distinct individuals, which means the assignment is a permutation of ants to rooms rather than a combination of rooms alone [^notfound].

> I will now examine the choices for the first ant. There are 9 rooms, so Xiaohong can be placed in any of 9 rooms; this is straightforward and I don't see a reason to adjust it, so I will keep 9 options for step one.

> Next, I should review the choices for the second ant, Xiahei, given that Xiaohong already occupies a room. Because no two ants can share a row or column, Xiahei must avoid the row and column of Xiaohong's room; that removes 3 rooms in the same row and 3 rooms in the same column, but wait, let me verify I'm not double-counting — yes, the intersection (Xiaohong's room) is counted in both, so the total excluded is 3 + 3 − 1 = 5 rooms, leaving 9 − 5 = 4 valid rooms for Xiahei. So Xiahei has 4 choices.

> Now, for the third ant, Xiaohuang, I need to ensure I account for both previously placed ants. With two rooms already occupied, I must exclude their rows and columns; that removes 3 rooms in each of the two rows and 3 rooms in each of the two columns, but I must correct for overlaps. The two occupied rooms themselves are already excluded, and the overlap of rows and columns means I'm double-counting the room at the intersection of the two excluded rows and columns, so the net exclusion is 2 rows × 3 rooms minus the 1 room already counted twice, which equals 5 rooms excluded, leaving 9 − 5 = 4 rooms; wait, that can't be right because I initially thought that left 2 rooms, but hold on, I should verify the math. Let me reconsider: with two distinct rows and two distinct columns occupied, the number of rooms that share a row or column with either of the first two ants is 2 rows × 3 rooms + 2 columns × 3 rooms − 4 (the four intersections, two of which are the occupied rooms and two of which are the other cells in the overlapping rows/columns), which equals 6 + 6 − 4 = 8, so only 1 room remains that shares neither row nor column with either of the first two ants. Therefore, Xiaohuang has exactly 1 valid room choice.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check the logic for the third ant. An alternative way to see this is that the first two ants occupy two different rows and two different columns, so the only room that does not share a row or column with either is the unique room at the intersection of the remaining row and remaining column, which confirms there is exactly 1 valid room for the third ant. Yes, that checks out.

> Since the ants are distinguishable, the total number of valid arrangements is the product of choices at each step: 9 options for Xiaohong, times 4 options for Xiahei, times 1 option for Xiaohuang, which equals 9 × 4 × 1 = 36. I should confirm the arithmetic: 9 × 4 is 36, and 36 × 1 is 36, so the total is 36 possible arrangements.

> Final answer: 36.

---

The problem is equivalent to placing 3 non-attacking rooks on a 3×3 chessboard, which means no two ants can share a row or column. The number of valid arrangements is the number of ways to choose 3 rooms such that each row and each column contains exactly one room, multiplied by the number of ways to assign the 3 distinct ants to those rooms. There are 3! = 6 ways to assign the ants to the 3 selected rooms, and there are 6 ways to choose the rooms (one per row and column), so the total is 6 × 6 = 36.

---

The number of possible arrangements is **36**. This is a permutation problem: choose 3 rooms such that no two share a row or column, then assign the 3 distinct ants to those rooms. There are 3! = 6 ways to assign ants to rooms, and 6 valid room selections (one per row and column), so the total is 6 × 6 = 36.

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Step 1: understand the constraint

The key constraint is that **no two ants can be in the same row or column**; this is equivalent to placing 3 non-attacking rooks on a 3×3 chessboard.

---

### Step 2: count valid room selections

We need to select 3 rooms such that each row and each column contains exactly one room. This is the number of **permutations of 3 items**, which is 3! = 6.

---

### Step 3: assign ants to selected rooms

Once the 3 rooms are selected, we assign the 3 distinct ants (Xiaohong, Xiahei, Xiaohuang) to those rooms. The number of ways to assign 3 distinct ants to 3 distinct rooms is **3! = 6**.

---

### Step 4: calculate total arrangements

The total number of valid arrangements is the product of the number of ways to select rooms and the number of ways to assign ants: **6 × 6 = 36**.

---

## Verification

To verify, consider that the first ant has 9 choices, the second has 4 (avoiding the row and column of the first), and the third has 1 (the remaining corner of the unused row and column). This gives 9 × 4 × 1 = 36, confirming the result.

---

The number of possible arrangements is **36**.

Fire ants — taxonomy and mating behavior — are summarized as follows: According to MPMH, ants are one of the most numerous species on earth and are in the same order as wasps and bees, and because of their geographic distribution they are universally recognized. The life cycle of the fire ant begins with the mating of the winged forms some 300 to 800 feet in the air, typically occurring in the late spring or early summer.

Statistical analysis

The statistical significance of the results presented throughout the text was evaluated, in most cases, using standard statistical analysis. The names of the tests that were used are given near each such statistical statement.

In some cases, P values were calculated as the weight of the tail of a binomial distribution in which we use the null-hypothesis which states that the tested factor has no effect. This can be formulated as the probability of n or more successes during N trials:where p is the probability of success in a single trial under the null-hypothesis. For example, in section 'Ants have preferred locations within the nest' we calculated the probability that ants which leave the nest (N = 40 ants in 6 colonies) would return to the same chamber they exited and found that 17 out of 40 ants returned to the same chamber. To assess the statistical significance of this result we used a null-hypothesis which states that all floor segments are identical and that the probability to return to a specific segment is P = 0.25 (as there are 4 chambers). The P -value was calculated by the formula presented above. In all experiments in which we had control over sample size, this was chosen using power analyses (using MATLAB software) with power of 0.8 when compared with an alternative hypothesis H1 with P = 0.99.

Non symmetric nests were constructed by cutting four 4 × 5 cm 2 internal chambers and a 2 × 5 cm 2 entrance chamber in a 13 × 17 × 0.4 cm 3 Teflon plate. The nest structure was cleaned using ethyl acetate, hexane, and acetone. Cleaned silica plates placed on a filter paper served as the nest floor, and IR filters were used as the nest top. Two more silica plates were placed outside the nest to measure chemicals deposited on the foraging arena floor.

All nest structures were designed to prevent the penetration of visible light. Visible light illumination was used as a means of encouraging the ants to emigrate into the dark nest. Experiments themselves were done under IR illumination (Exolight, Metaphase, 850 nm). In order to allow filming the top of the nest was covered with an IR transparent filter and a camera (for camera details see section 'Video and barcoding') with no IR blocking filter was used. The experimental setup was surrounded with black curtains to block visible light. In all experiments the nest structures were placed in a 30 × 20 cm 2 glass baking pan (Pyrex) with fluon (Sorpol) coated walls to prevent ants from escaping.

Asymmetrical nest structures induce a clear association between different chambers and the task groups that occupy them. We define the following areas in and around the nest: Arena — areas around the nest; Entrance — the chamber closest to the door, this chamber consists mostly of lean forager ants (Supplementary Methods); Queen's chamber –the chamber in which the queen had spent over 50% of the time (such a chamber occurred in all experiments); Worker chambers — any chambers which did not fall into any of the previous categories. Queen and worker chambers were occupied by more corpulent individuals (Supplementary Methods).

Worker chambers could be further refined into brood chambers and non-brood chambers. The brood content of worker rooms was estimated by manually counting brood items in ten video frames of each experiment. Worker chambers in which the mean number of brood items was less than one were labelled non-brood chambers, other worker chambers were labelled as brood chambers. A mean number of 1.9474 ± 0.8481 chambers out of a total of three worker chambers per experiment were defined as brood related.

Chemical classification

Classification procedures were based on a training set of 19 experiments containing 7 samples each. A class was assigned to each sample in the following manner: two samples collected from plates placed outside of the nest structure; one sample collected from the entrance chamber; one sample collected from the queen's chamber; and three samples collected from the three workers chambers. For a definition of these categories see the 'Nest structures' section of the Methods. Each sample was represented by the sum of its light/heavy compounds, that is, the feature space is 2D and classification is performed in the 2D plane. Three classification tasks, having different levels of detail, were considered: (1) classification into two classes: internal nest chambers versus external chambers (entrance and arena), (2) classification into three classes corresponding to the three inner nest chambers (workers, queen and entrance chambers) and (3) classification into four classes: A detailed classification of workers, queen, entrance chambers and arena area.

Classification was based on a linear support vector machine (SVM). We used a linear SVM procedure that provides separation between two classes only. In order to classify more than two classes we conducted a majority vote over SVM classifiers between all pairs of classes. For example, in the third classification task, this procedure bounds the area signifying the queen's chamber signature (Fig. 2c) by the line separators obtained from three (queen versus workers, queen versus arena and queen versus entrance) independent SVM classifications (as conducted on the training set). Results were evaluated using leave-one-out cross validations, that is, each 18 out of the 19 experiments were used for training and then tested on the remaining experiment (results correspond to the average classification accuracy over the 19th sample). This procedure allowed us to produce, for each of classification tasks, a classifier that optimally separates the samples from the 19 training experiments. Classifier performances were then evaluated according to their success in classifying a completely disjoint test set containing 28 samples from four newly performed experiments. The analysis was done using MATLAB statistics and machine learning toolbox.

We compared the ants' locations within the nest before and after the manipulation. We find that most ants returned, not to the location of their previous chamber but, rather, to the same floor segment they resided on prior to the manipulation (Fig. 1a–e). Importantly, although the majority of the population resides in the queen's chamber and ants exhibit higher fidelity to this chamber (Supplementary Note 1), it appears that the ants' response cannot be attributed to a single stimulus (associated with the queen's chamber's floor). Rather, ants that occupied chambers other than the queen's before the manipulation also showed high fidelity to their original floor segment. This finding supports the existence of at least two signals (Fig. 1e, red and orange contours).

To demonstrate the significance of this effect, we defined a score that quantifies the degree to which ants return to occupy the same floor segments as they had before the manipulation (see the Methods section for details of the analysis). To quantify how the experimentally measured score deviated from chance, we compared it with computer generated scores of permuted 'experiments' in which floor segments are incorrectly assigned to their locations within the new nest (see Methods section 'Permutation test' and Supplementary Methods). We find that the score of the actual experimental data is large compared to the permuted data (Fig. 1f). This statistically supports the fact that the ants rely on floor characteristics when they returned to the nest (P < 4e−6).

Furthermore, a similar analysis indicates that floor markings must contain, not just one but at least two different stimuli conveying positional information (P < 2e−2, Supplementary Methods). Indeed, the presence of these two distinct stimuli is clearly visible in the ant distributions before and after the manipulation as presented in Fig. 1e. Following a large perturbation, these stimuli allow the colony to recover and return to its original spatial configuration and can therefore be understood to stabilize the colony's distribution. Given the fact that ant associated chemicals were previously identified within the nestit is natural to assume that these stimuli are of a chemical nature. In the next section, we test this assumption.

### Optimal traffic organization in ants under crowded conditions [^8034151d]. Nature (2004). Excellent credibility.

Efficient transportation, a hot topic in nonlinear science, is essential for modern societies and the survival of biological species. Biological evolution has generated a rich variety of successful solutions, which have inspired engineers to design optimized artificial systems. Foraging ants, for example, form attractive trails that support the exploitation of initially unknown food sources in almost the minimum possible time. However, can this strategy cope with bottleneck situations, when interactions cause delays that reduce the overall flow? Here, we present an experimental study of ants confronted with two alternative routes. We find that pheromone-based attraction generates one trail at low densities, whereas at a high level of crowding, another trail is established before traffic volume is affected, which guarantees that an optimal rate of food return is maintained. This bifurcation phenomenon is explained by a nonlinear modelling approach. Surprisingly, the underlying mechanism is based on inhibitory interactions. It points to capacity reserves, a limitation of the density-induced speed reduction, and a sufficient pheromone concentration for reliable trail perception. The balancing mechanism between cohesive and dispersive forces appears to be generic in natural, urban and transportation systems.

### Ant groups optimally amplify the effect of transiently informed individuals [^606371c3]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The data set used to fit model parameters was taken from another set of experiments (clean board) in which the team–load complex was picked up and then laid on a similarly marked 42 × 30-cm clean board, with no freely moving ants in its vicinity. The disturbance due to the repositioning was minimal (see Supplementary Video 1) and was excluded from the analyses. To ensure the board was not chemically marked, it was replaced after every experimental run.

Obstacle bypassing was tested using a U-shaped Perspex block (main text Fig. 4g). A small slit was cut in the middle of the U-block, allowing single ants, but not the load, to pass freely. This setup forced the carrying team to reverse their movement direction to pass. The time needed to bypass the block and the maximum distance travelled backwards were recorded. For further information see Supplementary Note 1.

Image processing

A designated image processing programme was developed using MATLAB programming language. The programme's goals are consistent, high-quality tracking of the load's location and orientation, the ants' location, classification of ants as freely roaming or carrying, and tracking of the attachment points and body orientations of carrying ants. The programme's output includes full trajectories of the load and the ants in board coordinates, the load's orientation, ants' angular location on the load and ants' body orientation. This is achieved by recognition of the ants and the food item using their prominent features (such as circularity, colour and so on), and tracking the ants' identities. This linear assignment problem is solved using the Hungarian algorithm, with a cost matrix based on distance between blobs. Automatic tracking fidelity is high, but not perfect. For calculations demanding completely precise identity data (for instance, data analysis related to attachments and detachments of ants from the load), manual correction of the data was performed. Camera rotation and translation are accounted for by tracking of the red spots marked on the board itself, so that camera motion may be backtracked and pixel location can be anchored to laboratory frame of reference. An algorithm classifying ants as carrying or freely moving with high fidelity has also been developed. This is achieved by identifying carrying ants to be those that are both in contact with the load and immobile in its frame of reference.

Classifying chamber function by its chemical signature

The evidence provided in the last two sections led us to expect chambers of similar functionality to have a similar hydrocarbon profile. To test this hypothesis, we extracted the hexane soluble signatures from different nest surfaces, measured their chemical composition and searched for correlations between the surfaces of chambers that share the same function.

We housed colonies (N = 23) in five chamber asymmetrical nests (Fig. 2a) that enable a clear association between different chambers and the task groups that occupy them. Using the structure of the nest and the occupancy of the ants we classify the following locations: entrance chamber, queen's chamber, worker chambers and arena area. Worker chambers can be further divided into brood chambers and non-brood chambers (see Methods section 'Nest structures') but the distinction between these is not as reliable since the number of brood items per chamber fluctuates and is, generally, difficult to count. Nest floors were lined with silica-covered glass to enable the measurement of minute amounts of chemicals left by the ants on these surfaces. After five days in the nest, ants were removed and the hexane extracts of the silica flooring of each chamber were separately analysed by gas chromatography (see Methods section 'Extraction of surface chemicals'). We find that hydrocarbons of various lengths are the main components of the nest floor hexane extracts (Supplementary Note 5 for the full list). Similar to previous work, we find the correlations between the abundancies of different hydrocarbon groups to be colony specific (Supplementary Note 6).

Hydrocarbons as subterranean road-signs

Hydrocarbons have been shown to play a key role in ant communication. To test the role of these substances as chemical stimuli within the nest we removed them (along with all other hexane soluble compounds) from nest floors by rinsing with hexane and observed the effect on ant organization.

Colonies (N = 9) were placed in a symmetrical four chamber nest (Supplementary Fig. 1) with paper floorings in which three chambers were blocked. After 5 days, the floor of each of the four chambers was subjected to one of two treatments: (1) drying under a nitrogen stream (N = 4); (2) rinsing by sonication in 200 mL of hexane followed by drying under a nitrogen stream (N = 5). The unrinsed and rinsed floors were each transferred to new nest structures in which all chambers were accessible to the ants. The ants were then introduced to each of the new nests and the number of ants in each chamber was evaluated after 24 h. Each colony was subjected to both treatments at a random order with, at least, one week between treatments.

In all experiments with unrinsed floors, the chamber that contained the largest fraction of ants (40–80% of the colony, see Supplementary Note 2) was the chamber that was originally accessible and presumably marked. This implies that the first treatment did not remove the orientation stimulus (P < 4e−3, by the weight of the tail of the corresponding Binomial distribution). Identical results were obtained for a similar experiment using unrinsed silica floors (Supplementary Note 3). On the other hand, in the rinsed conditions, the previously accessible chamber contained the largest fraction of ants in only one out of five cases, which can be expected in case the room choice is random (P = 0.3955, by the weight of the tail of the corresponding Binomial distribution).

We further found that ants react to hexane extractions of their refuse area floor by recreating their new refuse pile on top of it (perfect match was observed in 25% of the experiments, see Supplementary Note 4). Taken together, the results presented thus far show that hexane soluble compounds act as chemical road-signs within the ants' nest.

### Ants regulate colony spatial organization using multiple chemical road-signs [^6312052e]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Communication provides the basis for social life. In ant colonies, the prevalence of local, often chemically mediated, interactions introduces strong links between communication networks and the spatial distribution of ants. It is, however, unknown how ants identify and maintain nest chambers with distinct functions. Here, we combine individual tracking, chemical analysis and machine learning to decipher the chemical signatures present on multiple nest surfaces. We present evidence for several distinct chemical 'road-signs' that guide the ants' movements within the dark nest. These chemical signatures can be used to classify nest chambers with different functional roles. Using behavioural manipulations, we demonstrate that at least three of these chemical signatures are functionally meaningful and allow ants from different task groups to identify their specific nest destinations, thus facilitating colony coordination and stabilization. The use of multiple chemicals that assist spatiotemporal guidance, segregation and pattern formation is abundant in multi-cellular organisms. Here, we provide a rare example for the use of these principles in the ant colony.

### Dynamic pathogen detection and social feedback shape collective hygiene in ants [^230b9d0f]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Cooperative disease defense emerges as group-level collective behavior, yet how group members make the underlying individual decisions is poorly understood. Using garden ants and fungal pathogens as an experimental model, we derive the rules governing individual ant grooming choices and show how they produce colony-level hygiene. Time-resolved behavioral analysis, pathogen quantification, and probabilistic modeling reveal that ants increase grooming and preferentially target highly-infectious individuals when perceiving high pathogen load, but transiently suppress grooming after having been groomed by nestmates. Ants thus react to both, the infectivity of others and the social feedback they receive on their own contagiousness. While inferred solely from momentary ant decisions, these behavioral rules quantitatively predict hour-long experimental dynamics, and synergistically combine into efficient colony-wide pathogen removal. Our analyses show that noisy individual decisions based on only local, incomplete, yet dynamically-updated information on pathogen threat and social feedback can lead to potent collective disease defense.

### Dynamic pathogen detection and social feedback shape collective hygiene in ants [^3f8da0b8]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

To find the best model, we first considered simple models for spore decay, where spores decrease with zeroth-order (constant velocity) or first-order (exponential) kinetics upon grooming. These two simple models either had problematic limiting behavior, or could not reproduce the measured initial spore distributions. These deficiencies are naturally handled by the spore decay model inspired by Type II FRM, also known as the h = 1 Hill function, or Michaelis-Menten reaction kinetics. Here, the ants remove the spores (S) over time as dS/dt = − vS/ (S + K), with constants v and K to be fitted, where t is the time while the ant is being groomed, where grooming includes both allogrooming (properly accounting for events where multiple ants groom a single target ant simultaneously) as well as body selfgrooming. At high spore loads (S > > K) on the body of the contaminated individual, the removal by the ants by grooming occurs at a maximum rate v (presumably given by the physical limit to how quickly an ant can remove spores). In this regime, the spore number on contaminated ants decreases linearly in time groomed. As spore number decreases further (S < < K), less spores can be captured per unit time, so that the speed of spore removal becomes proportional to the (limiting) current load S, and thus the spore number decreases exponentially in time groomed. K, known as the dissociation constant in Michaelis-Menten kinetics, gives the transition between the exponential and the linear regime. We fitted the parameters v and K from our experimental data, so that the back-computed initial distributions of spore loads predicted by the model showed the best fit to the initial spore load distributions determined from the quantification of spores of the F- and f-ants directly after exposure (see Supplementary Table 3 for details). The two parameters are chosen to best fit two moments (median and SD) for each of the two distributions (initial load distribution for F and f ants), i.e. two parameters are chosen to best satisfy four constraints. We checked that the fitted values are uniquely constrained by scanning the entire 2D grid in the parameter space and observing a single clear optimum of the fitting loss function. The robustness of v, K parameter estimates with respect to the choice of optimization criteria (here, matching the median and standard deviation of distributions) was further corroborated by recovering similar values by minimizing the earth movers' distance between the distributions.

### Neuronal activation sequences in lateral prefrontal cortex encode visuospatial working memory during virtual navigation [^a9604f27]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Decoding analysis

All decoding analyses from Fig. 4 (trial epoch, target location, target column, target row) were performed using variants of a simple classifier based on distances within the low-dimensional projection of the data described above (see Dimensionality Reduction for projection details). Decoding proceeded as follows:

The data set to be decoded is the set of points in 3-space, {P j = (x j y j, z j)}, corresponding to the set of trials j in a given recording session. These data points have ground-truth labels {g j } (which could be trial epoch, target location, target column, or target row depending on the application).

Training and test sets were determined using 5-fold cross-validation. For each of the 5 iterations, the training set was used to determine condition centroids (i.e.the coordinates of points P j corresponding to the same target were averaged, following the procedure outlined in Dimensionality Reduction). The distances between each point P j in the test set and each condition centroid were then computed. Each trial j was assigned a label c j according to the condition that minimized this distance. Decoding accuracy was computed as the fraction of points in the test set assigned to the correct condition (i.e. the fraction of trials for which c j = g j), and the average accuracy across the 5 iterations was reported.

Since the 9 targets in the task are positioned as a 3 × 3 grid in the virtual arena, each (row, column) pair defines a target location. In Fig. 4d, combined target decoding was performed by first decoding the target row and column (as described above), then using the predicted row and column to determine which of the 9 target locations each trial corresponds to. (Note that in this case, only row-selective and column-selective cells were included in the sequences to decode row and column respectively. See below for definition of selectivity.) In the same figure, All Cell Target decoding was performed as described above, by predicting the target location directly from the full sequences.

### Association of shelter-in-place hotels with health services use among people experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic [^997c3caf]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Participants and Eligibility

Individuals were eligible for placement in a SIP hotel if they were experiencing homelessness and met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's definition of high risk for severe COVID-19 based on age and underlying conditions.SIP programs defined individuals as experiencing homelessness if they lived outside or in a location not meant for human habitation, or were staying in the shelter system or another facility (eg, hospital, treatment facility, or jail) and had no other place to stay.

We included all SIP guests who were in the top 10% of high utilizers of multiple systems (HUMS) and used the ED 3 times or more during the eligibility period and a group of matched controls who were not placed in SIP hotels. Although all SIP guests were considered at risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes, those with high service use have greater disease burdens than the general PEH population. We assessed service utilization during the 9-month period before the implementation of the SIP hotel program from July 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020. The San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) assigns HUMS scores according to use of 9 emergency services across the medical, mental health, and substance use disorder systems, including ED visits, inpatient stays, psychiatric ED visits, and detoxification services. The HUMS score is an unweighted sum of these 9 urgent-emergent services. SFDPH uses HUMS scores to identify individuals experiencing fragmented care across multiple systems who would benefit from improved care coordination.

Intervention

The SIP hotels provided private rooms, bathrooms, and 3 meals per day. Guests had access to on-site health care services, although availability varied by site. Each SIP hotel offered a minimum of 1 half-day nursing clinic and 1 half-day medical clinic per week and, at maximum, offered 40 hours per week of medical staffing at hotels geared toward guests with higher medical needs. The on-site medical clinics offered basic evaluations, treatment of minor conditions (eg, basic wound care), buprenorphine induction, and referrals and transportation to off-site clinics for full-scope primary and specialty care. Community clinics offered limited, prioritized scheduling for primary care appointments for individuals referred from a SIP hotel. Each SIP hotel had a housing navigator who assisted guests in transitioning from SIP hotels to permanent housing. Community-based organizations offered additional services (eg, naloxone, needle exchange, and benefits enrollment), although availability differed by site.

### Social interactions lead to motility-induced phase separation in fire ants [^c16f1baf]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Cluster detection

To characterize the clusters, we first filter out any ants that are moving in each frame with, so that we are left with only "stationary" ants in each frame. For example, only stationary ants are highlighted in Fig. 3a. Then, in each frame, we sort the stationary ants into clusters by creating a dendrogram, which is a common chart used in clustering analysis, from their center-to-center-distances and choosing a cutoff distance that corresponds to about twice the length of an ant, as shown in Fig. 6a. We include in our cluster size distribution all observed clusters, including those that we only detect for a single frame.

a Dendrogram for one frame of an experiment with N = 100 ants. Clusters of ants correspond to branches that cross the r thresh line. Leaves that correspond to ants in a single cluster terminate on a line colored to match the cluster in Fig. 6b. Only clusters of more than 1 ant are shown. b Clusters of stationary ants divided using the previous dendrogram. The clusters have, in order of size, N c = 22, 7, 4, 3, 3, 2, and 2 ants.

The x -axis in Fig. 6a shows the labels associated to each stationary ant. Each ant starts out as a leaf on the dendrogram, and its branch continues vertically until it reaches a y -value that corresponds to the distance between the starting ant and its nearest neighbor, at which point the branch merges with the branch that includes its neighbor. Then, this merged branch, which now represents a cluster, continues vertically upwards until a y -value that corresponds to the minimum distance between any ant in this cluster and another ant outside of the cluster, and the branches merge again.

This continues until all the ants are included in one branch (the trunk) at the top. Notice that many of the leaves first join around r = l, consistent with the location of the local minima in Fig. 2 of the main text. Segregating the ants into individual clusters is a matter of picking a r thresh checking which ants are included in each branch r thresh intersects. Choosing r thresh = 7 mm ≈ 2 l results in the clusters designated by different colored lines on the x -axis in Fig. 6a. The ants in Fig. 6b, have been color coded according to the color of their leaf in Fig. 3a. The biggest cluster in this image contains N c = 22 ants.

### Two simple movement mechanisms for spatial division of labour in social insects [^fd2b9a42]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To test whether individuals can be classified into groups with similar space use patterns, we used a stochastic community detection algorithm to partition the network into distinct modules, each consisting of a set of workers with strong ties to a shared set of sites. This stochastic algorithm was repeated 1000 times for each colony to evaluate the variation in both the number of modules identified and the assignment of individuals and sites to particular modules. In all four species, colonies typically consisted of four modules (mean ± standard error of the proportion of algorithm iterations that identified exactly four modules, A. mellifera: 89.5 ± 0.03%; L. niger: 71.3 ± 0.05%; L. acervorum: 79.8 ± 0.04%; T. nylanderi: 74.4 ± 0.07%; Fig. S 3). In the ants there was typically one module whose outline closely followed the border of the brood pile ('nurse' module), one module centred on the nest entrance ('forager' module), one that closely followed the internal walls ('peripheral' module), and one that formed a sickle- or ring-shaped area between the nurse and forager modules or between the nurse and peripheral modules ('intermediate' module, Fig. 1 j–l, Fig. S 4 -S 5, Supplementary Note 3). The honeybee colonies also typically consisted of four modules, including one peripheral and one forager module, but instead of one nurse module and one intermediate module, they possessed two nurse modules – one covering the broodnest on one side of the wax comb, and the other covering the broodnest on the other side of the comb (Fig. 1 i, Fig. S 5). The presence of two distinct nurse modules in the honeybee probably stemmed from the physical architecture of the honeybee nest (a double-sided wax comb with a separate patch of brood cells on each side), combined with the relatively low mobility of nurse bees, which together limit the exchange of nurses between the two broodnests (mean ± standard error of the number of switches between the two sides of the comb, nurses: 15.2 ± 0.26; other bees: 35.6 ± 0.51; generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) with Poisson error & colony identity as random effect, nurses versus all other bees: d.f. = 1, χ 2 = 33721, p < 0.0001). However, bees from the two nurse modules did not differ from one another in age (general linear mixed-effect model (LME) with mean module age as a main effect and & colony identity as random effect, difference between the two nurse modules: z = 0.93, p = 0.79). Therefore, in all subsequent analyses the two honeybee nurse modules were pooled into a single group.

Results

Experimental design and trajectory characteristics

Ring-shaped food items were placed several metres away from a P. longicornis nest in the field. Following discovery of the food and a recruitment phase, the ants commenced cooperative transport (Fig. 1a; Methods; Supplementary Note 1). We repeatedly filmed this behaviour over a distance of ∼1 m (ca. 500 ant lengths) and extracted the positions (Fig. 1b) and angular orientations of the load from a total trajectory length of over 70 m. We also measured the positions of all ants around the object as well as the angles between the carrying ants' body axis and the object radius (Fig. 1c; Methods; Supplementary Movie 1). We further logged all events of ant attachment to and detachment from the load.

Focusing on global features of the load trajectory, we find that while median speed increases linearly with number of carrying ants (up to 15 attached ants), it does not strongly depend on how these ants are distributed around the object (Fig. 1d, orange and pink correspondingly; see Supplementary Note 2). Furthermore, the relative amount of energy wasted on rotating the object rather than translating it decreases with number of carrying ants (Fig. 1d, green). These properties indicate a high level of conformism that enables all attached ants to efficiently align their efforts. This result stands in agreement with cooperative carrying in other ant species. In contrast, while the trajectories generally head in the correct nest-bound direction they, nevertheless, exhibit substantial sinuosity, looping and detours (Fig. 1b).

### Dynamic pathogen detection and social feedback shape collective hygiene in ants [^fa43eb2d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Individual decisions allow efficient whole-colony spore removal

The inferred rules that best capture ant behavior are only based on local information that the ants can acquire from their close contacts. Theoretically, the colony could remove even more spores if the ants always groomed the individual with the currently highest load (maximum rule, Fig. 3d; Supplementary Note 1). This consideration, however, ignores biological constraints faced by individual ants in large collectives that they form in their natural colony conditions. It would require each ant to assemble global information by assessing and remembering the maximum pathogen load of its group members, to subsequently cognitively identify and physically locate the most infectious individual to groom. We explored the efficiency of different choice rules in a separate set of stochastic simulations where individual ants committed their time to either first probing other ants to gather information on their pathogen load state or to directly allogroom encountered others, thereby reducing their pathogen load. As soon as probing other ants incurs any time cost, our simulations (Supplementary Note 2), show that the experimentally-motivated sequential-choice rule (based on cheap partial information) will outperform the hypothetical maximum rule (based on costly complete information) as colony size increases (Fig. 5), in a classic manifestation of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Here, exploration refers to the effort by nestmates to locate the ant with highest spore load, where grooming (exploitation) would be most efficient. This is in analogy to the application of the same tradeoff to the problem faced by foraging animals that need to balance the time spent on searching for new and possibly rich foraging grounds, with the time spent exploiting known, but perhaps more meagre, grounds. We point out that the decisions faced by the nestmates could also be understood in terms of the speed-accuracy trade-off –. Here, nestmates need to invest more time (i.e. to probe colony members) to make a more accurate choice (i.e. to locate the highest-load individual and deliver most efficient care). While the exact dependence of grooming probability on the observed load in the sequential-choice rule that leads to most efficient spore removal depends on various factors, all efficient rules share a very small probability of targeting a non-infectious ant for grooming (Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Note 2), as we observe in the data. We note that even in small groups as used for our experiment, where ants could conceivably gather global information and use the optimal maximum rule without much efficiency cost (Fig. 5), our data preferentially support the sequential-choice rule. This suggests that the ants' decision about whom to groom reflects a hard-wired optimal strategy that evolved under the selection pressures in natural colony sizes.

Therapeutic Use: Recommended dosage & range

Check the listed ingredients to verify that it matches the prescription ordered. When using a prescription set, verify the patient's name and the ingredients listed with the prescription order. Assess the patient's physical and emotional status prior to giving as injection. Do not give injections to patients who are in acute distress. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Dosage of allergenic extracts is a highly individualized matter and varies according to the degree of sensitivity of the patient, his clinical response and tolerance to the extract administered during the early phases of an injection regimen. The dosage must be reduced when transferring a patient from non-standardized or modified extract to standardized extract. Any evidence of a local or generalized reaction requires a reduction in dosage during the initial stages of immunotherapy as well as during maintenance therapy. After therapeutic injections patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes for reaction symptoms.

SUGGESTED DOSAGE SCHEDULE

The following schedule may act as a guide. This schedule has not been proven to be safe or effective. Sensitive patients may begin with smaller doses of weaker solutions and the dosage increments can be less.

### Social interactions lead to motility-induced phase separation in fire ants [^8da52859]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Collections of fire ants are a form of active matter, as the ants use their internal metabolism to self-propel. In the absence of aligning interactions, theory and simulations predict that active matter with spatially dependent motility can undergo motility-induced phase separation. However, so far in experiments, the motility effects that drive this process have come from either crowding or an external parameter. Though fire ants are social insects that communicate and cooperate in nontrivial ways, we show that the effect of their interactions can also be understood within the framework of motility-induced phase separation. In this context, the slowing down of ants when they approach each other results in an effective attraction that can lead to space-filling clusters and an eventual formation of dynamical heterogeneities. These results illustrate that motility-induced phase separation can provide a unifying framework to rationalize the behavior of a wide variety of active matter systems.

An overview of the experimental designs for all experiments

In the 'country' column, DE = Germany and 'UK' = United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

For the iterated experiments, we tested groups of six participants (who did not know each other) in the same room with six computers side-by-side, separated by partitions that prevented participants from seeing each other's screens. Participants played a series of iterated Prisoner's Dilemma games, in which we systematically varied whether the outcomes were positive or negative (see ''Payoff matrices'' below). In each group, each of the six participants played iterated Prisoner's Dilemmas with each of the other five participants, without knowing with whom they were playing. Each player made 300 decisions: five (interactions) × 12 (payoff matrices) * five (repetitions). In Experiments 2 and 3, participants played three repetitions of 20 payoff matrices against each other player. The order of the payoff matrices within each interaction was randomised (but each repetition of a payoff matrix was played successively in each interaction). At the beginning of each interaction, both players were randomly assigned to be either the column-player (indicate decision with left-right arrow buttons) or the row-player (indicate decision with top-down arrow buttons) for the entire interaction. Participants were paid a base payment of 9€/h. We incentivized participants' decisions such that, depending on their decisions, up to 2€ (Experiment 1) or 5€ (Experiments 2 and 3) could be subtracted from or added to their base payment.

### Fitness benefits and emergent division of labour at the onset of group living [^d56be04f]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

The initial fitness benefits of group living are considered to be the greatest hurdle to the evolution of sociality 1, and evolutionary theory predicts that these benefits need to arise at very small group sizes 2. Such benefits are thought to emerge partly from scaling effects that increase efficiency as group size increases 3–5. In social insects and other taxa, the benefits of group living have been proposed to stem from division of labour 5–8, which is characterized by between-individual variability and within-individual consistency (specialization) in task performance. However, at the onset of sociality groups were probably small and composed of similar individuals with potentially redundant-rather than complementary-function 1. Self-organization theory suggests that division of labour can emerge even in relatively small, simple groups 9,10. However, empirical data on the effects of group size on division of labour and on fitness remain equivocal 6. Here we use long-term automated behavioural tracking in clonal ant colonies, combined with mathematical modelling, to show that increases in the size of social groups can generate division of labour among extremely similar workers, in groups as small as six individuals. These early effects on behaviour were associated with large increases in homeostasis-the maintenance of stable conditions in the colony 11 -and per capita fitness. Our model suggests that increases in homeostasis are primarily driven by increases in group size itself, and to a smaller extent by a higher division of labour. Our results indicate that division of labour, increased homeostasis and higher fitness can emerge naturally in social groups that are small and homogeneous, and that scaling effects associated with increasing group size can thus promote social cohesion at the incipient stages of group living.

Experimental evidence for a mesoscopic phase transition

We used loads of varying sizes to experimentally test the models' predictions. First, our model predicts that ants can carry ring-shaped loads with arbitrarily large radii. Indeed, we could experimentally induce the ants to move a load of radius 8 cm, much larger than anything they naturally carry. We find that the curvature of the object's trajectory decreases with load size (Fig. 4e). The model shows the same dependence of the curvature with load size (Fig. 4e, inset); as the system becomes more ordered the curvature of the path decreases. Note that, in the case of small objects, a single ant involved in individual transport achieves a more direct trajectory than a small group of ants. This lack of coordination in small groups leads to non-optimal transport evident as a tug of war and a decrease in speed when compared with a single carrier (Fig. 4f). To demonstrate the suboptimality of a team of highly conformist ants, we used large (4 cm) radius objects that can occupy over 100 ants. In agreement with the model's predictions, these objects exhibit highly persistent motion (Fig. 4e; Supplementary Note 25; Supplementary Fig. 17). However, this large ant team was unable to traverse a U-shaped barrier placed in their path to imitate the ragged conditions encountered in the field (Fig. 4g; Methods; Supplementary Note 1). Note that smaller objects (1-cm radius) do pass the obstacle (Fig. 4g) and this is facilitated by the attachment of informed ants. This demonstrates, as predicted by the model, that ants lose their ability to exert positive influence in the case of large loads.

### Ant groups optimally amplify the effect of transiently informed individuals [^4c5d567c]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

To cooperatively transport a large load, it is important that carriers conform in their efforts and align their forces. A downside of behavioural conformism is that it may decrease the group's responsiveness to external information. Combining experiment and theory, we show how ants optimize collective transport. On the single-ant scale, optimization stems from decision rules that balance individuality and compliance. Macroscopically, these rules poise the system at the transition between random walk and ballistic motion where the collective response to the steering of a single informed ant is maximized. We relate this peak in response to the divergence of susceptibility at a phase transition. Our theoretical models predict that the ant-load system can be transitioned through the critical point of this mesoscopic system by varying its size; we present experiments supporting these predictions. Our findings show that efficient group-level processes can arise from transient amplification of individual-based knowledge.

Using a sterile technique, remove 0.10 mL of extract from the 10,000 AU/ml or BAU/ml vial and place it into a vial containing 9.90 mL of sterile diluent. The resulting concentration will be 10ml vial of 100 AU/ml or BAU/ml.

Intervals between doses: The optimal interval between doses of allergenic extract has not been definitely established. The amount of allergenic extract is increased at each injection by not more than 50%-100% of the previous amount and the next increment is governed by the response to the last injection. There are three generally accepted methods of pollen hyposensitizing therapy.

1. PRESEASONAL

Treatment starts each year 6 to 8 weeks before onset of seasonal symptoms. Maximal dose reached just before symptoms are expected. Injections discontinued during and following season until next year.

2. CO-SEASONAL

Patient is first treated during season with symptoms. Low initial doses are employed to prevent worsening of condition. This is followed by an intensive schedule of therapy (i.e. injections given 2 to 3 times per week). Fewer Allergists are resorting to this Co-seasonal therapy because of the availability of more effective, symptomatic medications that allow the patient to go through a season relatively symptom free.

3. PERENNIAL

Initially this is the same as pre seasonal. The allergen is administered twice weekly or weekly for about 20 injections to achieve the maximum tolerated dose. Then, maintenance therapy may be administered once a week or less frequently.

Duration of Treatment: The usual duration of treatment has not been established. A period of two or three years of injection therapy constitutes an average minimum course of treatment.

Balancing individuality and conformism

In the simulation, we define the response of the system to an informed, newly attached ant (Methods; Supplementary Notes 15 and 20) as the distance that the load travels towards the nest in the characteristic time between two consecutive attachments. Following Fig. 2a, c, we assume that an informed ant disorients, turning into an uniformed ant on a timescale of 10 s. This simple model assumes a discrete (but stochastic) process of forgetting. In Supplementary Note 15, we show that a more gradual forgetting process gives essentially the same behaviour, even when combined with a value of F ind that is not constant over all ants (Supplementary Figs 9 and 13).

We fix three of the four free model parameters and check for possible optimality in terms of system response as a function of F ind. We find that both complete conformity (small values of F ind) and strong individualism (large values of F ind) reduce the effectiveness of a newly attached ant in steering the load (Fig. 4a). The fitted value of F ind lies between these two extremes and this suggests that the ants operate in the transition region between strong and weak conformity, possibly to optimize their responsiveness to a limited influx of information (Fig. 4a, upper left inset). In addition, we find that the working regime of the ants is such that the velocity distribution of the load lies in the transition region between unimodal (tug of war or random walk) and bimodal (persistent motion) behaviours (insets of Fig. 4a).

Our model suggests a correspondence between load size and the ants' individuality (Supplementary Note 21). Namely, larger loads correspond to more conformist ants and vice versa. This behaviour naturally arises from the mean-field nature of this system (see below). We fixed F ind to its fitted value and simulated ring-shaped objects of different radii (such that the mass per ant remains constant) to calculate the normalized response function to the attachment of a new ant. We find an optimal load size regime which is on the order of 1 cm (Fig. 4b). This scale is compatible with natural prey and nest entrance dimensions.

### Hysteresis stabilizes dynamic control of self-assembled army ant constructions [^01c79bde]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Biological systems must adjust to changing external conditions, and their resilience depends on their control mechanisms. How is dynamic control implemented in noisy, decentralized systems? Army ants' self-assembled bridges are built on unstable features, like leaves, which frequently move. Using field experiments and simulations, we characterize the bridges' response as the gaps they span change in size, identify the control mechanism, and explore how this emerges from individuals' decisions. For a given gap size, bridges were larger after the gap increased rather than decreased. This hysteresis was best explained by an accumulator model, in which individual decisions to join or leave a bridge depend on the difference between its current and equilibrium state. This produces robust collective structures that adjust to lasting perturbations while ignoring small, momentary shifts. Our field data support separate joining and leaving cues; joining is prompted by high bridge performance and leaving by an excess of ants. This leads to stabilizing hysteresis, an important feature of many biological and engineered systems.

### Behavioural individuality determines infection risk in clonal ant colonies [^d9bf7fb3]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In social groups, infection risk is not distributed evenly across individuals. Individual behaviour is a key source of variation in infection risk, yet its effects are difficult to separate from other factors (e.g., age). Here, we combine epidemiological experiments with chemical, transcriptomic, and automated behavioural analyses in clonal ant colonies, where behavioural individuality emerges among identical workers. We find that: (1) Caenorhabditis-related nematodes parasitise ant heads and affect their survival and physiology, (2) differences in infection emerge from behavioural variation alone, and reflect spatially-organised division of labour, (3) infections affect colony social organisation by causing infected workers to stay in the nest. By disproportionately infecting some workers and shifting their spatial distribution, infections reduce division of labour and increase spatial overlap between hosts, which should facilitate parasite transmission. Thus, division of labour, a defining feature of societies, not only shapes infection risk and distribution but is also modulated by parasites.

ENVIRONMENT AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT

The outbreak is fierce and insidious, spread mainly by droplets and contact 4 and clearly can be transmitted from person to person. 5 To completely cut off the source of infection, the country urgently took decisive measures to seal off cities in some areas, and various provinces and cities have issued a variety of bans and closed public places, such as tourism sites, restaurants, and cinemas. 6 On February 18, 2020, the diagnosis and treatment program for new coronavirus pneumonia (trial version 6) made it clear that asymptomatic infected people could also become a source of infection, and there was a possibility of aerosol transmission under the condition of prolonged exposure and high concentration of aerosol in a relatively closed environment. 7 Therefore, in accordance with relevant regulations, a series of more stringent control measures have been adopted. To avoid crowd gathering and reduce the close contact between people, the subdivision hospital and departments strictly implement the management of three channels. The patient channel is completely separated from the staff. Patients enter and exit the hospital following one way, and the staff enter and exit through another channel. Given that the main building of the hospital has only four floors, the elevators are divided into patient elevators and logistics elevators, and the employee elevator is no longer in use to encourage employees to use the stairs. All other channels are closed. Each channel has clear and eye‐catching signs for guidance; additional security, nursing personnel, volunteers, and other specially assigned staff are assigned supervision and guidance roles; and crowds are dispersed 1 meter apart to avoid contamination and close contact. Moreover, hospital fire inspection should be strengthened to ensure a special control period of fire safety. Canteen service is canceled, and delivery service is provided 8 to enhance the cleanliness and disinfection of the hospital floor and surface of objects. According to regulations for strengthening the management of medical waste of NCP, special routes are planned to strengthen the disinfection of sewage, and the frequency of testing is increased from quarterly to monthly. The cleaning, disinfection, and operation modes of the air‐conditioning ventilation system are in line with the requirements of the "cleaning and disinfection code for centralized air‐conditioning and ventilation systems in public places" (WS/T 396‐2012).

### Clusters of ant colonies and robust criticality in a tropical agroecosystem [^a537b5ff]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Although sometimes difficult to measure at large scales, spatial pattern is important in natural biological spaces as a determinant of key ecological properties such as species diversity, stability, resiliency and others. Here we demonstrate, at a large spatial scale, that a common species of tropical arboreal ant forms clusters of nests through a combination of local satellite colony formation and density-dependent control by natural enemies, mainly a parasitic fly. Cluster sizes fall off as a power law consistent with a so-called robust critical state. This endogenous cluster formation at a critical state is a unique example of an insect population forming a non-random pattern at a large spatial scale. Furthermore, because the species is a keystone of a larger network that contributes to the ecosystem function of pest control, this is an example of how spatial dynamics at a large scale can affect ecosystem service at a local level.

### Assessment of coronavirus disease 2019 community containment strategies in shenzhen, China [^b5da6cdd]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

A novel coronavirus, designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been confirmed as the cause of a new outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Since then, studies, have found that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is transmitted from human to human and is moderately contagious, compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome. However, current studies, estimate that the incubation period for COVID-19 is 2 to 14 days, with potential asymptomatic transmission, which could lead to the infection of a large number of people. Rapid increases in the numbers of diagnosed and suspected cases have concerned Chinese citizens, even as Chinese authorities have enforced multiple measures, such as imposing a cordon sanitaire (ie, quarantine) and closing public transit. Therefore, we believe that the most important measure is the early identification and quarantine of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. This approach would cut the means of transmission and protect people at high risk in the community, measures that are paramount for elimination of this disease.

As of February 7, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had spread throughout the China owing to rapid transmission rates: 351 cases had been confirmed in Shenzhen, a populous city in Guangdong province, China. Shenzhen is the largest immigrant city in China, with approximately 1 000 000 people who travel to and from Hubei province. Local governmental authorities and representatives from the health bureau held several meetings to develop specific and comprehensive measures, including efforts to trace travel from Hubei province and those who come into close contact with people infected with SARS-CoV-2, as well as efforts to treat individuals at higher risk and those who come into close contact with individuals who are infected. These expert panels also discussed how to provide supplies for people who are isolated at home or in hotels.

The purpose of these measures is to prevent community-dwelling residents from becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we report on a community prevention program for COVID-19 and describe the results of achieved in Haiyu, China, after these measures were first implemented on January 23, 2020.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^5e7afbb9]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Termite control in housing — chemical baits and construction barriers — notes that chemical baits use cellulosic material impregnated with a toxicant and/or insect growth regulator; worker termites carry it back to the nest, reducing or eliminating the colony, and once termite activity is observed, the bait wood is replaced with a poison, with success depending on termites finding the bait before damaging the house. To deter entry at foundations, metal termite shields have been used for decades and Metal termite shields should extend 2 inches from the foundation and 2 inches down; during new construction, the shielding should extend at least 2 inches out and 2 inches down at a 45° angle from the foundation wall. Shields should be made of noncorroding metal and have no cracks or gaps along the seams, because improperly installed, damaged, or deteriorated shields may allow termites to reach parts of the wooden floor system. For hollow-block foundations and support piers, alternatives include filling the block with concrete or adding masonry caps such as concrete-filled brick; solid caps are best at stopping termites but are not commonly used, and concrete-filled brick caps should deter movement or force termites through small gaps, allowing them to be spotted during an inspection.

Termite prevention for homes — according to Potter, homeowners can reduce the risk for termite attack by adhering to the following suggestions: eliminate wood contact with the ground, do not allow moisture to accumulate near the home's foundation, and reduce humidity in crawl spaces. Most building codes state that crawl space area should be vented at a rate of 1 square foot per 150 square feet of crawl space area; this rate can be reduced for crawl spaces equipped with a polyethylene or equivalent vapor barrier to one square foot per 300 to 500 square feet of crawl space area, and vent placement design includes positioning one vent within 3 feet of each building corner with a minimum of two vents per side.

### 'Being in a womb' or' playing musical chairs': the impact of place and space on infant feeding in NICUs [^7b90b62e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

The 'hotel room'

The 'hotel room' existed in three NICUs (A, B and C). The 'hotel room' was a room that mothers themselves asked for or were offered for longer periods. Most mothers were offered a 'hotel room' with the baby to share with father, single or to share with another mother, sometime during the stay at the NICU. Large variations were observed in the policies for allowing babies to stay in the parents' room with regard to baby's medical state. In NICU A, the wireless monitoring system enabled parents to be with their baby in the 'hotel room' as soon as the baby no longer required intensive care. In NICU B and C the baby needed to be more or less without monitors to be with the parents in the 'hotel room'. Ownership, signalling importance and role of the mother, depended on the availability of the room and duration of occupation. The availability of rooms varied, in NICU A rooms were usually available, in NICU B and C there were fewer rooms and therefore they had to be 'negotiated' for. This meant that some mothers were offered a room soon after birth but others later on. Many mothers described the timing for having a room as something that highly affected their sense of being " a proper carer ". One mother stated: – " I could go home and come back but that would have been to visit him and not care for him." (MC7) A mother with twins said:

" I've had this room for 2 weeks now. It's building my confidence up. Having them and getting to know the cues. I have them with me in the room all the time. It's been invaluable [the room]. I think that… when I was up there [postnatal ward] I felt distanced from them. I couldn't be a proper carer. If I'd been able to room in, down here, I think it would have been different. " (MC3)

The design, facilities and the feeling of 'at-homeness' in the 'hotel rooms' varied. Some rooms were " homely and warmer ", with painted walls, paintings, curtains, cupboards, shower, television, and water boiler, whereas some had less of the 'at-homeness' and facilities.

### Social interactions lead to motility-induced phase separation in fire ants [^32e0b6e5]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Tracking

The cells are made by cutting a circle out of a thin sheet of acrylic and then sandwiching the acrylic between two pieces of glass. We place the acrylic on one sheet of glass, load the circular cell with N chilled ants, add the second piece of glass, place these cells horizontally, and back-light them through a sheet of light diffuser. We then quickly begin imaging the ants from above, so that the first image is taken no more than 10 s after the ants are added to the cell. After encountering the room-temperature glass of the cell, the chilled ants warm up and begin to wander the cell within several seconds.

After imaging the ants, we segment the images to detect the regions of pixels that correspond to ants and measure the area, A, and centroid, r, of each region. We also measure the orientation of each ant by first finding the ellipse that has the same second area moment as the group of pixels that we associate with an ant. We then calculate θ as the rotation angle of this ellipse; θ is the angle of the major axis of the ellipse relative to the x-axis of a lab frame.

By choosing to compare the ant to an ellipse, we have neglected polar orientation. We track the ants by minimizing the cost, c ij, between the ants in one frame and the ants in the next frame and adding the new ants to the existing tracks. In our case, where θ ij is the difference in orientation between the two ants, is the relative distance between ants, and C r, C θ, and C A are constants set so that, on average, the distance between ants accounts for 90% of c ij. For computing efficiency, we first try a greedy solution to minimize the cost of connecting each of the ants, so that each track searches for the ant with the minimum cost to add to itself. Then, if two tracks both try to add the same ant, the track with the lower cost gets to keep the ant and the track with the higher cost must take its next choice. This process avoids the computationally expensive process of finding the global minimum cost. We begin tracking the ants at the beginning of the experiment and use all our tracking data to compute θ (r), v (r), g (r), waiting times, and N c. There is a transient state at the beginning of the experiments, in which the ants hardly interact, but this state is brief enough that it does not affect our averages.

### Changes in semantic memory structure support successful problem-solving and analogical transfer [^5231072f]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In our daily life, we constantly deal with problems, ranging from the most mundane (e.g. what to cook for dinner given the ingredients at our disposal), to professional activities (e.g. how to reorganize our current plans to meet a new deadline), up to major societal challenges (e.g. how to find innovative solutions against global warming). How do we find new solutions to problems? While the ability to solve problems is a critical skill for adapting to new situations and innovating, the mechanisms underlying the problem-solving process remain largely unknown.

Among the new problems we face each day, some are well-defined (e.g. playing a jigsaw puzzle). The initial state (i.e. the number of independent pieces) and goal state (i.e. assembling the pieces so it looks like the picture model) are clear, and the solver can apply a set of operations (i.e. interlocking the pieces as a function of their shape) to reach the goal. However, for many of our problems (e.g. organizing work activities during the COVID-19 pandemic), the problem space is ambiguous. No heuristics or existing rules could be applied to transform the initial state into the goal state. Such "ill-defined" problemsthus require additional mental processes, which have been tightly linked to creative thinking –. Ill-defined problem-solving (or creative problem-solving) is often referred to as insight solving, where the solution comes to mind suddenly and effortlessly, with a "Eureka" phenomenon –. According to the Representational Change Theory, solving such problems involves restructuring the initial problem mental representational space, which presumably entails combining elements related to the problem in a new way. In theory, restructuring allows one to change perspective, reframe the problem, or escape its implicitly imposed constraints, leading to creative associations. For instance, consider the following problem: "A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender points a shotgun at the man. The man says, 'Thank you,' and walks out". The problem is ill-defined because the path to finding the solution is to be discovered, and the goal state is vague. Solving this problem first requires asking the right question: in which context would a shotgun and a glass of water help somebody? Rather than relying on obvious associations (e.g. a glass of water is related to thirst), solvers must fill the missing link between the relevant elements of the problem (a shotgun induces fear, and fear can be a remedy for hiccups, as can drinking a glass of water). Hence, restructuring the initial representation of a given problem would allow one to see this link and find its solution.

### Probable aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through floors and walls of quarantine hotel, Taiwan, 2021 [^237bcf19]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Because case A tested positive on December 28, the public health sector arranged RT-PCR tests the next day for hotel guests on the 5th and 6th floors to find the source. Cases B and C tested positive (Ct value for case B was 16; Ct value for case C was 21) on December 29. Both patients were transferred to the hospital for isolation.

All 8 members of the hotel staff had received 2 COVID-19 vaccinations and underwent enhanced surveillance RT-PCR testing every 3 days; each staff member had 5 negative test results after the transmission was recognized. The RT-PCR test results for the 70 other guests who stayed in the hotel during December 22–29, 2021, were all negative. The close contacts (14 guests on the 5th and 6th floors) were asked to quarantine for another 14 days, starting on December 29 (they were relocated to another quarantine hotel), and all tested negative before the end of the quarantine.

Investigation of Noncontact Practice

The quarantine hotel we studied requires staff members to wear personal protection equipment when entering the guest zone (on any floor, except the staff zone on the 1st floor), including gloves, gown, goggles, cap, shoe covers, and a medical mask. There is a trash bin and a chair for meal placement in front of every room. The food delivery and garbage collection are carried out by noncontact means and occur at specific times of the day. Hotel guests are strictly prohibited from having contact with other guests and could exit their rooms only for RT-PCR testing. Guests are instructed to open the door to their rooms only when wearing a mask. They receive advanced notification by phone to take meals into the room and to proceed downstairs for RT-PCR testing by turns to avoid brief encounters with others. A bus designed for respiratory sampling stops at the hotel, as arranged by the public health sector.

### Binge drinking [^54002cf9]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Binge drinking definitions and youth thresholds — in adults, binge drinking refers to the consumption of 5 or more alcoholic drinks in a row by men and 4 or more drinks in a row by women, over a 2-hour period. Studies also characterize frequency, with frequent binge drinkers defined as those who engage in this behavior 3 or more times in the period studied (usually the previous 2 weeks), and occasional binge drinkers as those who drink this way less than 3 times in the previous 2 weeks. Extreme binge drinking is defined as dangerously high levels on one occasion, with thresholds of ≥ 10 drinks and ≥ 15 drinks. Because youth typically weigh less than adults, they are likely to reach a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) much higher than 0.08% with 5 drinks in a 2-hour period, and lower cutoffs have been suggested for youth: for girls 9 to 17 years of age, the cutoff suggested is ≥ 3 drinks; for boys 9 to 13 years of age, the cutoff suggested is ≥ 3 drinks; for boys 14 to 15 years of age, the cutoff suggested is ≥ 4 drinks; and for boys 16 to 17 years of age, the cutoff suggested is ≥ 5 drinks. However, fewer drinks than suggested in these cutoffs should not be considered safe, and survey recall periods vary from one or more times in the last 2 weeks to one or more times in the last 30 days.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^96423271]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Fleas in household environments — life cycle timing and control measures are outlined, including that an adult female flea can produce up to 2,000 eggs in a lifetime. Flea larvae are small (2 to 5 mm) and complete the three larval stages in 5 to 12 days, after which the pupal stage can be dormant for 140 to 170 days. The pupal form is resistant to insecticides, so an initial treatment will not kill the pupae and a reapplication will often be necessary. Adults are usually ready to feed about 24 hours after emergence and will begin to feed within 10 seconds of landing; mating follows the initial blood meal, with egg production initiated 24 to 48 hours after consuming a blood meal. The adult flea lives approximately 100 days. Control guidance includes that the most important principle is simultaneously treating all pets and their environments (indoor and outdoor); before using insecticides, thoroughly clean with indoor vacuuming and carpet steam cleaning and pay special attention to source points; outdoor cleanup should include mowing, yard raking, and removing organic debris from flowerbeds and under bushes; insecticide should be applied to the indoor and outdoor environments and to the pet, and reapplication to heavily infested source points may be needed to eliminate pre-emerged adults.

### Clustering knowledge and dispersing abilities enhances collective problem solving in a network [^77613a31]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Here, however, we find quite different results: intermixing hampers systemic performance. Furthermore, there is a tradeoff in systemic performance over time, as seen in Fig. 6b. Networks with some form of intermixing perform better in the short-run. However, the network with the minimal possible intermixing performs worse in the short-run but best in the long-run. In other words, this suggests an "all or nothing" trade-off over time: the configuration with the least amount of intermixing possible (minimal) performs worse in the short-run, but better in the long-run, while any gradation of increased intermixing yields the same rank-ordering in performance as their counterpart networks in the diversity of ability simulations.

Agents in the intermixed network setups explore for solutions early on in the simulation, which is a double-edged sword. In the short-run, with more intermixing, agents quickly turn to exploitation, as they merely take solutions that are marginally better relative to other setups but are still mediocre in absolute terms. Said differently, agents in setups with at least some intermixing quickly coalesce to whatever the few agents that did explore the problem space found, which are often not the best solutions possible. So, exploring the problem space using worse solutions often leads to modest gains. However, the agents in setups with minimal intermixing are more commonly exploring, rather than exploiting, because their neighbors' initial solutions are less optimal than their counterparts in intermixed networks. This is because there is minimal exposure to diversity in these minimal setups, which inadvertently produces poor solutions in the short-run but allows for more exploration to find better solutions in the long-run. In other words, by finding better solutions through exploration, agents more often uncover pathways to better solutions earlier on. The end result is that the long-run performance of setups with minimal intermixing is best.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^568cafd9]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes natural history and progression risk indicate that stage 1, defined by the presence of two or more autoantibodies and normoglycemia, carries a 5-year risk of developing symptomatic type 1 diabetes of ~44%. In stage 2, risk is ~60% by 2 years and ~75% within 5 years of developing a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. A consensus group provides expert recommendations on what should be monitored and how often these factors should be monitored in individuals with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes.

### Environmental assessment and exposure reduction of cockroaches: a practice parameter [^da6ed6a8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Exposure assessment and reduction — facilitating factors: Factors that facilitate the growth and persistence of cockroach populations, such as food and water, paths of ingress, and microenvironments that can provide shelter, should be mitigated to reduce the cockroach carrying capacity of the environment (StrRec, D Evidence). There are many ways to remove or mitigate environmental factors that support an infestation, which include to block means of ingress ("Caulk and seal cracks and holes on the building's exterior"; "Install door sweeps and weatherproofing seals on exterior doors and garage doors"; "Screen and weatherproof windows and attic vents"; "Remove excess vegetation and prune branches that touch the building"), withhold sources of food and water ("Properly store food in sealed containers"; "Maintain regular cleaning schedules"; "Regularly dispose of garbage"; "Promptly repair water leaks"; "Place stoppers in all drains and promptly wipe up spills"), and eliminate shelter ("Move firewood, lumber, and trash cans away from the building"; "Keep basements and crawl spaces free of clutter"; "Keep gutters clean and well maintained").

Table 1
Schematic layout of experimental design for tank 2 in osmotic stress phenotyping. The tank comprised 144 pots arranged in a 16 row by 9 column array. Each cell in the figure represents a triplet of pots (across 3 columns within the row) and is termed a main plot. The first part of the label in each cell is the DH line that was allocated to all 3 pots within the main plot. Two of the pots within each main plot were allocated to the stress treatment and the remaining pot was allocated to the control treatment (see Supplementary Fig. S1). The numbers of tillers measured for each treatment in the main plot is given as the final part of the label (e.g. 2, 3 means there were measurements for 2 tillers from the control pot and 3 from the treated pots) Genetic clones of DH lines are shown using equality symbols (e.g. CH#135 (= 151) means line CH#135 was genetically identical to line CH#151)

### A comparison of phase II study strategies [^ebb760ae]. Clinical Cancer Research (2009). Low credibility.

The traditional oncology drug development paradigm of single arm phase II studies followed by a randomized phase III study has limitations for modern oncology drug development. Interpretation of single arm phase II study results is difficult when a new drug is used in combination with other agents or when progression-free survival is used as the endpoint rather than tumor shrinkage. Randomized phase II studies are more informative for these objectives but increase both the number of patients and time required to determine the value of a new experimental agent. In this article, we compare different phase II study strategies to determine the most efficient drug development path in terms of number of patients and length of time to conclusion of drug efficacy on overall survival.
