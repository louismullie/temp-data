## Question

4.072 The lengths of the sides of a triangle are three consecutive terms of a geometric progression. Compare the common ratio of this progression with the number 2.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to compare the common ratio of a geometric progression formed by the three side lengths of a triangle with the number 2. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to model the three side lengths using a geometric sequence. Then, I should verify the triangle inequality constraints that must hold for any valid triangle. Next, I will solve the resulting inequality for the common ratio and check the boundary cases. Finally, I will compare the valid range of the ratio with 2 and state the conclusion clearly, making sure I don't miss any edge cases or sign conventions.

> Let me first model the sides. If the three consecutive terms of a geometric progression are a, ar, and ar², then the triangle has sides of lengths a, ar, and ar², where a > 0 and r is the common ratio. I should confirm that a is positive because lengths must be positive, and r can be any positive real number initially, though the triangle inequality will constrain it further [^notfound].

> Now, I need to apply the triangle inequality. For three positive lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must exceed the third side. That gives me three inequalities: a + ar > ar², a + ar² > ar, and ar + ar² > a. Wait, let me verify the third one; I initially thought it might simplify to r + r² > 1, but that's not quite right because I need to divide by a, which is positive, so the correct simplification is r + r² > 1, which is the same as the first two after dividing by a. Hold on, I should double-check that I'm not mixing up the order of terms; yes, dividing by a preserves the inequality direction, so the three inequalities reduce to 1 + r > r², 1 + r² > r, and r + r² > 1. But wait, 1 + r² > r is always true for r > 0 because r² − r + 1 has a negative discriminant and is always positive, so the binding constraints are 1 + r > r² and r + r² > 1, which are actually the same inequality written two ways, so I only need to solve r² − r − 1 < 0 and r² + r − 1 > 0 [^notfound].

> Next, I should solve r² − r − 1 < 0. The roots of r² − r − 1 = 0 are r = (1 ± √5)/2, so the quadratic is negative between its roots. Since r > 0, this gives 0 < r < (1 + √5)/2. I should confirm the numerical value; (1 + √5)/2 is the golden ratio, approximately 1.618, so the upper bound is about 1.618 [^notfound].

> Then, I should solve r² + r − 1 > 0. The roots of r² + r − 1 = 0 are r = (−1 ± √5)/2, so the quadratic is positive when r > (−1 + √5)/2 or r < (−1 − √5)/2. Since r > 0, the relevant part is r > (−1 + √5)/2, which is approximately 0.618. So the lower bound is about 0.618 [^notfound].

> Combining these, the common ratio r must satisfy (√5 − 1)/2 < r < (√5 + 1)/2, which is roughly 0.618 < r < 1.618. I should confirm that this interval is symmetric around 1; yes, the bounds are reciprocals of each other, which makes sense given the symmetry of the geometric progression when reversed. Hold on, I should verify that both bounds are indeed positive and that the interval is non-empty; yes, both bounds are positive and the interval is valid [^notfound].

> Now, I will compare this with 2. Since the upper bound is approximately 1.618, which is less than 2, the common ratio r must be strictly less than 2. Therefore, r < 2. I should double-check that I'm not overlooking any case where r could equal 2; if r were 2, the sides would be a, 2a, 4a, and the triangle inequality would fail because a + 2a = 3a is not greater than 4a, so r = 2 is not allowed, confirming r < 2 [^notfound].

> Final answer: The common ratio r must satisfy (√5 − 1)/2 < r < (√5 + 1)/2, so r is less than 2. In other words, the common ratio is strictly less than 2 [^notfound].

The common ratio (r) of a geometric progression forming the sides of a triangle must satisfy the **triangle inequality**, which restricts (r) to the interval (\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2} < r < \\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{2}) (approximately 0.618 < r < 1.618). Since this interval lies entirely below 2, the common ratio is **always less than 2**. Therefore, for any triangle with sides in geometric progression, the common ratio is strictly less than 2.

---

## Mathematical formulation

Let the three consecutive terms of the geometric progression be (a), (ar), and (ar²), where (a > 0) and (r > 0). The triangle inequality requires:

- (a + ar > ar²)
- (a + ar² > ar)
- (ar + ar² > a)

Simplifying these inequalities by dividing by (a) (since (a > 0)) gives:

- (1 + r > r²)
- (1 + r² > r)
- (r + r² > 1)

---

## Solving the inequalities

### Inequality 1: (1 + r > r²)

Rearranging gives (r² − r − 1 < 0). The roots of (r² − r − 1 = 0) are:

r = [(1 ± √5)/2]

Thus, the inequality holds for ([(1 − √5)/2] < r < [(1 + √5)/2]). Since (r > 0), we consider only (0 < r < [(1 + √5)/2]).

---

### Inequality 2: (1 + r² > r)

Rearranging gives (r² − r + 1 > 0). The discriminant is ((−1)² − 4(1)(1) = −3 < 0), so the quadratic is always positive; thus, this inequality is satisfied for all real (r).

---

### Inequality 3: (r + r² > 1)

Rearranging gives (r² + r − 1 > 0). The roots of (r² + r − 1 = 0) are:

r = [(-1 ± √5)/2]

Thus, the inequality holds for (r < [(-1 − √5)/2]) or (r > [(-1 + √5)/2]). Since (r > 0), we consider only (r > [(-1 + √5)/2]).

---

## Combining the inequalities

Combining the valid ranges from inequalities 1 and 3, we obtain:

[(√5 − 1)/2] < r < [(√5 + 1)/2]

Numerically, this is approximately (0.618 < r < 1.618).

---

## Comparison with the number 2

The upper bound of the valid interval for (r) is ([(√5 + 1)/2] ≈ 1.618), which is **less than 2**. Therefore, the common ratio (r) of a geometric progression forming the sides of a triangle is **always less than 2**.

---

## Conclusion

The common ratio of a geometric progression forming the sides of a triangle must lie in the interval ([(√5 − 1)/2], [(√5 + 1)/2]), which is approximately (0.618, 1.618). Since this interval is entirely below 2, the common ratio is **strictly less than 2**.

### Trigonometry in daily ultrasound practice [^c806ac21]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

We have read with interest the editorial by Piton et al. regarding application of Pythagoras' theorem in central venous cannulation. Geometry is at the base of our daily life and we should apply his theorems and axioms to obtain the best result in our daily practice.

We believe that trigonometry is another important branch of geometry in addition to Pythagoras' theorem that has to be taken into consideration while performing invasive procedures under ultrasound guidance. Sine, cosine and tangent are the basis of trigonometry, they represent the ratio between the sides of a right-angled triangle. Sin(α) is the ratio between side B and the hypotenuse (H) (Fig. 1), Cos(α) is the ratio between side A and the hypotenuse (H), and Tan(α) is the ratio between side B and side A. It is important to note that, for a given angle α, the ratio between the sides is unconnected from the triangle size.

Fig. 1
Internal jugular vein ultrasound anatomy. H hypotenuse; A and B are catheti of the triangle

As already stated by Piton, in our ultrasound daily practice, we constantly build right-angled triangles: the hypotenuse is the needle route, side A is the distance measured on the skin between needle insertion point and target projection on the skin, and side B is the depth of the target.

Side B is determined by the patient's anatomy and the operator cannot modify it. As reported by Schulman et al. needle/skin angulation between 30° and 45° is considered to be ideal while performing ultrasound procedure.

Trigonometry is helpful in determining which targets can be reached with such needle angulation. At 45° angulation tan(α) is equal to 1, meaning that side A and side B have to be equal. For example, if our target jugular internal vein is 2 cm deep, the needle has to be inserted 2 cm from the target. Generalizing, we have a good needle visualization whenever Tan(α) ≤ 1 with side B equal to or shorter than side A.

In conclusion, physicians have to take into account target depth while choosing the ultrasound linear probe of appropriate size to be able to visualize all needle routes and the needle skin entrance site.

Methods

Creating regular grids on fundamental domains

First, a regular grid, as depicted in Fig. 1a, is created over the surface of a group's fundamental domain. Nodes are placed along each edge with as close to the same spacing as possible such that there exist nodes at the termini of each edge. If this domain is triangular, the number of nodes along each edge must be identical so that interior nodes fall on the resulting parallelogram's diagonals. This happens regardless of the relative lengths of the sides. If this domain is a parallelogram, the number of nodes placed along adjacent edges may sometimes be different if the two sides have unequal lengths, as allowed by symmetry constraints. This scheme covers different wallpaper groups differently, but in a consistent fashion which is commensurate with each group's unique symmetry.

Different groups have differently shaped fundamental domains, with the number of domains per primitive cell ranging from 1 to 12; therefore, we cannot simply place nodes at a fixed spacing along the edges of each group's fundamental domain and compute all possible resulting primitive cells as they would vary significantly in size. A more even-handed comparison can be made by working in reverse to compute the requisite grid spacings for each group's fundamental domain so that their primitive cells all cover a similar area. Although fundamental domains vary in shape, an approximate comparison may be made as follows.

As a reference, we consider a p1 primitive cell containingtotal nodes, and attempt to make the primitive cells of other groups have the same number of nodes. The number of nodes per edge of a group's fundamental domain may be estimated aswhere N 1 is the number of nodes along the shorter of the two edges which define the group's primitive cell, r ≥ 1 is the ratio of the lengths of these edges, N d is the number of fundamental domains per primitive cell, and N s is the number of sides the fundamental domain has. The number of nodes on the longer edge is given by. A more detailed derivation is presented in the Supplementary Methods. The result is always a lattice that has no more thantotal nodes; consequently, N g should be viewed as a parameter that simply provides a way to compare the groups to each other by making their primitive cells congruent.

### Quantitative verification of the keyhole concept: a comparison of area of exposure in the parasellar region via supraorbital keyhole, frontotemporal pterional, and supraorbital approaches [^48bddfbc]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Object

This study was designed to determine if the "keyhole concept", proposed by Perneczky's group, can be verified quantitatively.

Methods

Fourteen (3 bilateral and 8 unilateral) sides of embalmed latex-injected cadaveric heads were dissected via 3 sequential craniotomy approaches: supraorbital keyhole, frontotemporal pterional, and supraorbital. Three-dimensional cartesian coordinates were recorded using a stereotactic localizer. The orthocenter of the ipsilateral anterior clinoid process, the posterior clinoid process, and the contralateral anterior clinoid process are expressed as a center point (the apex). Seven vectors project from the apex to their corresponding target points in a radiating manner on the parasellar skull base. Each 2 neighboring vectors border what could be considered a triangle, and the total area of the 7 triangles sharing the same apex was geometrically expressed as the area of exposure in the parasellar region.

Results

Values are expressed as the mean ± SD (mm(2)). The total area of exposure was as follows: supraorbital keyhole 1733.1 ± 336.0, pterional 1699.3 ± 361.9, and supraorbital 1691.4 ± 342.4. The area of exposure on the contralateral side was as follows: supraorbital keyhole 602.2 ± 194.7, pterional 595.2 ± 228.0, and supraorbital 553.3 ± 227.2. The supraorbital keyhole skull flap was 2.0 cm(2), and the skull flap size ratio was 1:5:6.5 (supraorbital keyhole/pterional/supraorbital).

Conclusions

The area of exposure of the parasellar region through the smaller supraorbital keyhole approach is as adequate as the larger pterional and supraorbital approaches. The keyhole concept can be verified quantitatively as follows: 1) a wide area of exposure on the skull base can be obtained through a small keyhole skull opening, and 2) the side opposite the opening can also be visualized.

### Systematic inference and comparison of multi-scale chromatin sub-compartments connects spatial organization to cell phenotypes [^4a51d7b9]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Step 3: Calling for nested subdomains

A stochastic approach was developed to call nested subdomains within each compartment domain exclusively based on short-range contacts. The basic idea is to determine whether a hierarchical structure of smaller domains can be further inferred from local contact patterns within a given compartment domain. In this step of the Calder (and unlike what is done in the previous step) hierarchies of nested domains contained in a domain are anchored to the genome sequence, i.e. adjacent nested domain in the hierarchy are also contiguous along the genome sequence. This step can be split into two major tasks: (1) finding the best-fitting dendrogram D; (2) trimming D to get meaningful nested domains.
Finding the best-fitting dendrogram: We assume the contact probability between bins from two sibling domains in the dendrogram D follows a mixture log-normal distribution with parameterwhereis the density function of a degenerate distribution which has P(X = 0) = 1; is the density of a log-normal distribution which has. Given the contact matrix, the likelihood function of the dendrogram and the associated parameters is given by We computed the best-fitting dendrogram and corresponding parameters using maximum likelihood estimation which can be computed via dynamic programming and has a computation complexity of, whereis the number of bins in the chromatin domain under investigation (Supplementary Fig. 10c — left).
Trimming the dendrogram to get meaningful nested domains: Given the best-fitting dendrogram D, we extracted meaningful nested domains by splitting iteratively a domain into subdomains as described below. First, we compute the observed vs. expected contact matrix A oe to eliminate distance-bias of the contact matrix A oe is defined as the ration between the contact maps A and E, where E is the expected contact matrix with: A oe within a given domain is split into four parts: A: the triangle delimited by the off-diagonal corner of the domain and the two off-diagonal corners of the candidate nested domains; B: the triangle comprising the contacts between the two nested domains that are not included in (a); C–D: contacts within the two nested domains (Supplementary Fig. 10c — right). Finally, a given split was accepted if (1) contacts within A were significantly higher than those in B and (2) contacts in C and D were significantly higher than contacts in B. Contact differences are tested using a one-tailed Wilcoxon test and considered as significant if p -value < 0.05 andbetween the compared regions is greater than 0.1 (0.1 is equivalent to 10% of relative difference given that the expected mean in any region of the distance-corrected matrix A oe is 1).

### The representation of geometric cues in infancy [^3bf27a75]. Infancy (2008). Low credibility.

There is evidence that, from an early age, humans are sensitive to spatial information such as simple landmarks and the size of objects. This study concerns the ability to represent a particular kind of spatial information, namely, the geometry of an enclosed layout-an ability present in older children, adults, and nonhuman animals (e.g. Cheng, 1986; Hermer & Spelke, 1996). Using a looking-time procedure, 4.5- to 6.5-month-olds were tested on whether they could distinguish among the corners of an isosceles triangle. On each trial, the target corner was marked by a red dot. The stimulus (triangle with dot) appeared from different orientations across trials, ensuring that only cues related to the triangle itself could be used to differentiate the corners. When orientations were highly variable, infants discriminated the unique corner (i.e., the corner with the smaller angle and two equal-length sides) from a nonunique corner; they could not discriminate between the two nonunique corners. With less variable orientations, however, infants did discriminate between the nonunique corners of the isosceles triangle. Implications for how infants represent geometric cues are discussed.

### Increased tortuosity of basilar artery might be associated with higher risk of aneurysm development [^b21fb957]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The fourth is triangular index (TI), for which the curve is again divided into equal subcurves. Then, a triangle is built with vertices on each end of the subcurve and in its middle point. TI is defined as:where n is the number of subcurves, a and b are sides of triangles and c is its base. The last of the tortuosity descriptors is the inflexion count metrics (ICM), defined as:where n I represents the number of the curve's inflexion points. All used tortuosity descriptors are all presented in Fig. 1.

Additional measurements

We additionally measured diameters of both P1 segments of posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs) and diameters of both vertebral arteries (VAs) at a distance of 5 mm from the origin of BA. We also measured the diameter of BA in three locations: 2 mm from its origin, 2 mm before its bifurcation and halfway between those two locations. Additionally, we obtained the angle of BA bifurcation and its configuration, introduced by Rashad et al including hands-up, hands-neutral and hands-down configurations, as well as its mixed variants (hands-up/hands-neutral, hands-up/hands-down, hands-neutral/hands-down). Among patients with BA aneurysm, we measured aneurysm dome height and width, as well as its neck size. We also calculated dome-to-neck ratio, defined as aneurysm dome height/neck size.

### Feasibility and coexistence of large ecological communities [^02d41162]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Shape of the feasibility domain

So far, we have focused on the volume of the parameter space resulting in feasiblity. However, two systems having the same Ξ can still have very different responses to parameter perturbations, just as two triangles having the same area need not to have sides of the same length (Fig. 1). The two extreme cases correspond to (a) an isotropic system in which if we start at the barycentre of the feasibility domain, moving in any direction yields roughly the same effect (equivalent to an equilateral triangle); (b) anisotropic systems, in which the feasibility domain is much narrower in certain directions than in others (as in a scalene triangle). For our problem, the domain of growth rates leading to coexistence is — once the growth rates are normalized — the (S −1)-dimensional generalization of a triangle on a hypersphere. For S = 3, this domain is indeed a triangle lying on a sphere as shown in Fig. 1. If all the S (S −1)/2 sides of this (hyper-)triangle are about the same length, then different perturbations will have similar effects on the system. On the other hand, if some sides are much shorter than others, then there will be changes of conditions which will more likely have an impact on coexistence than others. We therefore consider a measure of the heterogeneity in the distribution of the side lengths (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 10). The larger the variance of this distribution, the more likely it is that certain perturbations can destroy coexistence, even when Ξ is large and the perturbation small. This way of measuring heterogeneity is particularly convenient because it is independent of the initial conditions. Moreover, the length of each side can be directly related to the similarity between the corresponding pair of species (Supplementary Note 10), drawing a strong connection between the parameter space allowing for coexistence and the phenotypic space. As in the case of Ξ, this measure is a function of the interaction matrix and corresponds to a geometrical property of the coexistence domain.

### On-demand tailoring soliton patterns through intracavity spectral phase programming [^8dba5ce2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Soliton patterns with geometric/arithmetic sequence separations

The key to tailoring multi-pulse soliton patterns involves the precise manipulation of sub-pulses and spectral phase-associated potential wells. According to the Fourier transform principle, the superposition of spectra with multiple periodic triangular spectral phases generates sub-pulses exhibiting unequal separations due to interference (lower panel of Fig. 1a). This, in turn, leads to unequally spaced potential wells that trap solitons, thereby facilitating the generation of multiple solitons with arbitrary distributions.

We first demonstrate quadruple solitons with geometric sequence separations in the fibre laser (Fig. 5a–d), where the spectral phase exhibits three distinct periods: 0.1, 0.033, and 0.014 THz, corresponding to sub-pulse separations of 10, 20, and 40 ps, respectively (the detailed parameters of the spectral phase are provided in Supplementary Note 2). Owing to the interference of multiple solitons with unequal separations, the spectrum displays intricate beating fringes while the envelope features a quasi-Sech 2 profile, a typical fingerprint of solitons in anomalous-dispersion regime (Fig. 5b). By incorporating the frequency control actuator into the cavity, the mode-locked fibre laser may generate a customised optical frequency comb on demand.

Unlike equally spaced solitons, the AC traces show gradually decreasing multi-peak structures (Fig. 4b), the AC trace in Fig. 5c displays one main peak and multiple side peaks, from which the pulse distribution in the soliton pattern can be extracted based on the autocorrelation theory(see details in Supplementary Note 10). As shown in Fig. 5d, the soliton pattern is composed of four pulses with separations of 10.36, 22.29, and 42.02 ps, which correspond to the most prominent sub-pulses induced by the spectral phase (indicated by the green triangles).

### The geometric nature of weights in real complex networks [^42ad36a1]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Results

Interplay between weights and triangles in real networks

Clustering, as a reflection of the triangle inequality, is the key topological property coupling the bare topology of a complex system and its effective underlying metric space. In this context, the triangle inequality stipulates that if nodes A and B are close, and nodes A and C are also close, we expect nodes B and C to be close as well; triangles are therefore more likely to exist between nodes that are nearby. Consequently, we expect that if the weights of connections depend on the distance between the connected nodes in the underlying metric space, they should be quantitatively different depending on the clustering properties of the connections. However, weights and clustering are known to be strongly influenced by the degrees of end point nodes, which prevents from a direct detection of the metric properties of weights due to the typical heterogeneity in the degrees of nodes in real networks. Thus, to compare links on an equal footing, we define the normalized weight of an existing link connecting nodes i and j as, whereis the average weight of links as a function of the product of degrees of their end point nodes. By doing so, we decouple the weights and the topology, leaving the normalized weights seemingly randomly fluctuating around 1 (see uniform sampling on Fig. 1).

Figure 1 shows, however, that these fluctuations are not uniform as links involved in triangles tend to have larger normalized weights than the average link. Indeed, in some cases the difference can reach > 30%. Sampling links over triangles is equivalent to sampling links proportionally to their multiplicity m (the number of triangles to which a link participates). Therefore, the results in Fig. 1 indicate that ω norm and m are positively correlated variables, as corroborated by their Pearson correlation coefficient (Supplementary Table 1). In ref. the authors also found local correlations between the multiplicity of links and the weights for different real networks. However, note that in that study weights were not normalized to discount the effects of the heterogeneity in the degrees of the nodes, so that the detected weighted organization cannot be taken as a signature of underlying metric properties.

### Ventricular septum curvature ratio: a novel imaging marker to predict clinical deterioration in normotensive acute pulmonary embolism [^70cee2d7]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Measurement of VS curvature ratio and VS deviation to LV in CTPA

The CTPA imaging protocols are detailed in Supplementary Method S1. CTPA reconstructions were performed using the Mimics Medical software (version 19.0, Mimics Medical Software, Leuven, Belgium). The short-axis view of the RV was reconstructed using double-oblique multiplanar reformation. For VS bowing to the RV, the VS curvature ratio was calculated as the ratio of the VS curvature radius to the LV free wall curvature radius (Fig. 1 A). VS curvature ratio was segmented according to its curve-fitting relationship with deterioration risk. As VS curvature radius increasing until a point where no curvature radius can be calculated, VS straight & bowing to the LV was defined (Fig. 1 B). For VS bowing to the RV, the following measurements were taken: (1) locating the two intersection points between the VS and the LV free wall, and use them as common points for measuring the curvature radii of the VS and the LV free wall. (2) finding the third point, which can be combined with the first two intersection points to create a circle that best fits the VS, and then calculate the VS curvature radius. (3) finding the fourth point, which can be combined with the first two intersection points to create a circle that best fits the LV free wall, and then calculate the LV free wall radius (Fig. 1 C).

Fig. 1
Measurement method of measurement VS curvature ratio and typical examples. (A) VS bowing to RV and VS curvature ratio was 1.16, which was calculated as VS curvature radius (34.1 mm)/LV free wall radius (29.35 mm) at double oblique plane; (B) VS straightness and VS bowing to LV at double oblique plane; (C) Segmentation of VS and LV free wall to measure VS curvature ratio at double oblique plane.

Supplementary Figure S2 and Supplementary Appendix outline a simplified method for measuring the three side lengths of the triangle inscribed in the LV to calculate the VS curvature. This method allows the VS and LV free wall curvature radius to be measured using Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS), which are commonly available in most hospitals (Supplementary Video).

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials of neuraxial, intravenous, and inhalational anesthesia for external cephalic version [^354bf943]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analyses

Network meta-analysis was performed to incorporate multiple comparisons for each available outcome using multivariable meta-analyses under the frequentist framework, where the within-network heterogeneity was assumed common and the heterogeneity variance was estimated using restricted maximum likelihood (REML). For multiarmed studies, side-splitting model was used to estimate parameters for both sides. Direct evidence on effect sizes was reported from pairwise meta-analysis using random-effects model, when limited studies existed to estimate the indirect comparison (ie, ≥ 3 studies for adjacent edges with common comparison treatment in a closed loop). Zero cells were adjusted using Haldane–Anscombe correction. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated for binary outcomes. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs were calculated for continuous outcomes. The pooled OR is considered statistically significant if 95% CI did not contain 1, and the pooled SMD is considered statistically significant if 95% CI did not contain 0. Individual and pooled estimates were illustrated using forest plots. For any closed triangle loop among 3 anesthesia comparisons (where ≥ 2 studies were reported for each of the pairwise comparison), the direct and indirect comparisons were integrated to evaluate the effect sizes (ORs, SMDs) and 95% CIs. For open triangle loop among 3 anesthesia comparisons (if any pairwise comparison had < 2 studies), direct estimates from pairwise meta-analysis were reported including ORs, SMDs, and 95% CIs. Global tests for inconsistency were performed using the Wald test statistic, which follows a χ 2 distribution under the consistency assumption. P value > .05 indicates no evidence of inconsistency. The cumulative rankings of treatment effect sizes were computed to identify superiority. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots. Sensitivity analysis was conducted by excluding studies that were considered to have different designs (or anesthesia interventions) compared to other enrolled studies. All analyses were conducted using Stata 14 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX).

Sequential Bayesian inference can be rewritten in a form that more closely resembles a sum of evidence by taking the logarithm of equation (8):For each of the n -choices, the accumulated evidence is the log posterior, with n distinct evidence incrementsand a common subtractive log-marginal term. Calculation of this log-marginal is necessary for multiple (n > 3) choice optimal decision-making, but can be avoided for n = 2 by using the SPRT as mentioned above. A similarterm in a theory of basal ganglia function has been interpreted as suppressing evidence accumulation when choices are ambiguous –.

Within this framework, using that probabilities sum to unity ∑ i P i (t) = 1, the evidence accumulation takes place within an (n − 1)-dimensional linear subspace spanning n vertices { P i = 1, P j ≠ i = 0} of an N -dimensional unit hypercube. This is most easily seen for N = 3 choices, where the decision variables P = (P 1, P 2, P 3) vary within a triangle passing through three vertices {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)} of the unit cube (Fig. 1, top right panel). So rather than representing evidence accumulation trajectories as a random walk constrained to two dimensions, for multiple alternatives the random walk moves in higher dimensions (a line for two alternatives, a plane/triangle for three, and so on). For simplicity, this vector is initialized with equal prior probabilities 1/ n and updated sequentially until one of the elements reaches a boundary, P i > θ.

Both the SPRT and two-choice sequential Bayesian inference give optimal decisions in that they give the fastest decisions for a given level of accuracy on single trials of known difficulty. Formally, they optimize a cost function, the Bayes risk, that is linear in the mean error rate e and mean decision time T over many trialswith error costs W i > 0 and cost of time c, scaling the expected error and decision time,… This cost function represents the trade-off between speed and accuracy of decision-making: slow but accurate or fast but inaccurate decisions are both costly, and so a balance must be found. For equal decision costs, W 0 = W 1, there is a single threshold that is free parameter, which for optimal decision-making is tuned according to the relative cost c / W of accuracy and time.

### Universality in long-distance geometry and quantum complexity [^7fa0611b]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

More generally, we can imagine adjusting this criterion in various directions. For example, we could require that a and c are not independent of n but have a mild n dependence. In the Supplementary Information, we mention a boundthat was proved in the context of nilpotent Lie groups of the formwhere 0 < α < 1. This implies that the fractional error vanishes at large d at a rate no slower than d α −1. This is a stronger statement than equation (22) if c is left unspecified, but it is a slightly weaker statement than equation (22) if it requires c = 1.

In the context of discrete groups, an elementary result is that the coarse geometry defined by the Cayley graph is independent of the choice of generating set. That is, we can consider a group G that is generated by some set of easy elements g 1,…, g k. The distance from the identity to some group element g is the minimum length of the word formed from g 1,…, g k that expresses g. Although the metric depends on the choice of generating set (or more generally, the penalty factors associated with each group element), the claim is that different choices of generating sets give distance functions that satisfy equation (22). Furthermore, we can consider properties of the geometry that depend on only the equivalence class. A particularly interesting property is δ -hyperbolicity, which is a notion of negative curvature that applies even in this discrete context. We can identify negative curvature by observing that all triangles in negatively curved spaces are slim — that is, any point on one side of the triangle is close to some point on another side of the triangle, with the maximum separation set by the curvature scale. This property defines what is known as Gromov hyperbolic groupsand is the subject of ongoing mathematical work. A simple example is a free group, where the Cayley graph is an infinite tree. This notion of negative curvature may explain our conjecture that the critical metric has negative sectional curvatures. In particular, the notion of δ -hyperbolicity shows that the concept of large-scale curvature is not a contradiction. In the context of Lie groups, we expect that although many members of a given equivalence class exhibit extreme local curvatures, their large-scale curvatures (for example, that probed by large triangles) should approximately agree with the large-scale curvatures of the critical metric.

Manifold property changes by network building blocks.

Changes in the relative manifold properties between the input and the output of different network building blocks, shown as change in dimension vs change in center correlations (top) and change in radius vs change in center correlations (bottom). Each panel pools results from a specific building block in AlexNet (blue markers) and VGG-16 (green markers) for both point-cloud manifolds (full class, top 10%) and smooth manifolds (1-d and 2-d, translation and shear). Marker shape represents layer type (square — convolution layer, right-triangle — max-pooling layer, hexagon — fully connected layer). For layer sequences marker shape represents the last layer in the sequence. For isolated ReLU marker shape represent previous layer type; pentagon — ReLU after fully connected layer, up-triangle — ReLU after convolution layer. Color changes from dark to light along the network. a Changes in manifold properties for isolated ReLU operations. b Changes in manifold properties for isolated Max-pooling operations. c Changes in manifold properties for a common sequence of operations: one or more repetitions of convolution, ReLU operations, with or without intermediate normalization operation, ending with a max-pooling operation. d Changes in manifold properties for a common sequence of operations: fully connected, ReLU operations. The data analyzed here correspond to the first set of objects used in the analysis of the mean and confidence interval presented in Figs. 6 and 7, and include additional intermediate values not presented in those plots, notably the inputs of ReLU operations.

In contrast to single operations, we find that the networks' computational building blocks perform consistent transformation on manifold properties (Fig. 8 c, d). The initial building blocks consist of sequences of convolution, ReLU operation followed by pooling, which consistently act to decrease correlations and tend to decrease both manifolds' radii and dimensions (Fig. 8 c). On the other hand, the final building block, a fully connected operation followed by ReLU, decreases manifolds' radii and dimensions, but may increase correlations (Fig. 8 d), similarly to the max-pooling operation (Fig. 8 b). Furthermore, as composite building blocks show more consistent behavior than individual operations, we understand why DCNNs with randomly initialized weights do not improve manifold properties. Only by appropriately trained weights, the combination of operations with often opposing effects yields a net improvement in manifold properties.

### Deep transfer learning for inter-chain contact predictions of transmembrane protein complexes [^a8123102]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The application of triangle-aware module

The state-of-the-art AlphaFold2proposes the evoformer module including the intra-molecular triangular multiplication update and triangular self-attention, which can reduce the unsatisfied region by the geometric triangular inequality. Therefore, we have also applied the triangle-aware module after the ResNet-Inception module to reduce the geometric inconsistency and more effectively capture the correct inter-chain interactions. The triangle-aware module includes a triangle update, two triangle self-attention, and a transition layer (Fig. 1d).

The triangle-aware module requires three kinds of input features including receptor, ligand, and complex features, which are the corresponding output hidden features generated by the last ResNet-Inception module. The receptor features are the same as ligand features due to the fact that homo-oligomeric TMPs have identical sequences. In addition, the architecture can also be applied to the case of heterodimer. In that case, the receptor, ligand, and complex features are represented as, and, where d is a hyperparameter with a value of 64. Therefore, we also used an inter-molecular triangle multiplicative mechanism to update the interchain residue-residue interaction by treating one monomer as the receptor and the other as the ligand. Namely, if residue A of the receptor contacts with residue C of the ligand, the residue B away from residue A in the receptor will not contact with residue C due to the distance constraint.

Laboratory detection and initial diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies — key disease and protein terms are defined as follows: Monoclonal gammopathy is "a condition in which monoclonal immunoglobulin proteins circulate in the blood", and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is "the most common category of monoclonal gammopathy, which is asymptomatic and requires no intervention in the vast majority of cases". Monoclonal immunoglobulin protein (M‑protein) are "immunoglobulin proteins produced by monoclonal plasma cells", and the M spike or M‑spike "refers to the narrow, isosceles triangle appearance of the monoclonal immunoglobulin protein seen on protein electrophoresis". Multiple myeloma is described as "a cancer of plasma cells" in which "multiple myeloma caused the plasma cells to accumulate in the bone marrow and crowd out the healthy blood cells". The free kappa/free lambda ratio is "the ratio of two types of immunoglobulin light chains (kappa and lambda) when not bound to immunoglobulin heavy chains" and "is used to assess risk of harboring a monoclonal protein and its likelihood for progression". Cross‑references indicate "M-component — see monoclonal immunoglobulin protein", "Monoclonal Protein — see monoclonal immunoglobulin protein", and "Paraproteins — see monoclonal immunoglobulin protein".

### The geometric nature of weights in real complex networks [^16d6fe49]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Hidden metric spaces underlying real weighted networks

At the beginning of this section, we showed that the normalized weights of links participating in triangles are higher, thus suggesting a coupling between the weighted organization of real weighted complex networks and an underlying metric space. We then presented a model that has the critical ability to fix the joint degree–strength distribution, while independently varying the level of coupling between the weights and the metric space (parameter α). This opens the way to a definite proof of the geometric nature of weights in real complex networks, which inevitably must involve the triangle inequality: the most fundamental property of any metric space.

For unweighted networks, a direct verification of the triangle inequality based on the topology without an embedding in a metric space is not possible, due to the probabilistic nature of the relationship between the binary structure and the distance between nodes. In contrast, weights do contain information about their distances in the metric space (via equation (2)) such that a direct verification of the triangle inequality is possible. To ensure that the metric properties of triples in the network are in correspondence to the metric properties of the corresponding triangles in the underlying space, only triples of nodes forming triangles in the network are taken into account to evaluate the triangle inequality. There are however two main challenges when one tries to apply this methodology. The first one is related to the fact that connections in the weightedmodel depend not only on angular distances but also on hidden degrees, such that we need a purely geometrical formulation of the weighted hidden metric space network model, in which angular distances and degrees are combined into a single distance measure. The second issue is related to the intrinsic noise present in the system due to the stochastic nature of the processes conforming it, which may blur the evaluation of the triangle inequality. Below, we propose a way to overcome these two issues.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### The groin triangle: a patho-anatomical approach to the diagnosis of chronic groin pain in athletes [^1b6a8642]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic groin pain is a common presentation in sports medicine. It is most often a problem in those sports that involve kicking and twisting movements while running. The morbidity of groin pain should not be underestimated, ranking behind only fracture and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in terms of time out of training and play. Due to the insidious onset and course of pathology in the groin region it commonly presents with well-established pathology. Without a clear clinical/pathological diagnosis, the subsequent management of chronic groin pain is difficult. The combination of complex anatomy, variability of presentation and the non-specific nature of the signs and symptoms make the diagnostic process problematical. This paper proposes a novel educational model based on patho-anatomical concepts. Anatomical reference points were selected to form a triangle, which provides the discriminative power to restrict the differential diagnosis and form the basis of ensuing investigation. This paper forms part of a series addressing the three-dimensional nature of proximal lower limb pathology. The 3G approach (groin, gluteal and greater trochanter triangles) acknowledges this, permitting the clinician to move throughout the region, considering pathologies appropriately.

### A geometric framework for evaluating rare variant tests of association [^dbaf7328]. Genetic Epidemiology (2013). Low credibility.

The wave of next-generation sequencing data has arrived. However, many questions still remain about how to best analyze sequence data, particularly the contribution of rare genetic variants to human disease. Numerous statistical methods have been proposed to aggregate association signals across multiple rare variant sites in an effort to increase statistical power; however, the precise relation between the tests is often not well understood. We present a geometric representation for rare variant data in which rare allele counts in case and control samples are treated as vectors in Euclidean space. The geometric framework facilitates a rigorous classification of existing rare variant tests into two broad categories: tests for a difference in the lengths of the case and control vectors, and joint tests for a difference in either the lengths or angles of the two vectors. We demonstrate that genetic architecture of a trait, including the number and frequency of risk alleles, directly relates to the behavior of the length and joint tests. Hence, the geometric framework allows prediction of which tests will perform best under different disease models. Furthermore, the structure of the geometric framework immediately suggests additional classes and types of rare variant tests. We consider two general classes of tests which show robustness to noncausal and protective variants. The geometric framework introduces a novel and unique method to assess current rare variant methodology and provides guidelines for both applied and theoretical researchers.

### Impact of single eyelid on superior visual field [^124d2c7b]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 2
Calculation of the SVF. Based on the lengths of the 2 sides " d 1 " and " d 2 " of triangle A1, with an angle of 15 degrees formed at the apex between " d 1 " and " d 2", the area of the triangle can be determined as "1/2 sin15° × d 1 × d 2". Area of SVF can be approximated as the sum of the area of the 12 triangles.

Because the important value is not the absolute value of aSVF, but rather the comparison between preoperative and postoperative aSVF, the value of 1/2 sin15° (which can be assumed to represent a coefficient) was omitted from our calculation. We then compared variables, that is, the sum of the product of both sides of triangles (d 1 d 2 + d 2 d 3 + d 3 d 4… d 12 d 13), which we subsequently defined as aSVF.

After defining the visual field of the upper 90-degree meridian on the GP as the superior visual angle (SVA), we inspected differences in ERD, BRD, aSVF, and SVA between preoperatively and postoperatively. To evaluate the difference in SVF between single and double eyelids with an equivalent ERD range, we compared preoperative and postoperative aSVF among patients with ERD, which ranged between 2.0 and 4.0 mm. We then evaluated the correlation both between ERD and aSVF and between ERD and SVA.

This study was approved by our institutional review board (approval no. #424) and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent for participation was obtained before patient inclusion in the study.

Statistical Analysis

Comparisons between preoperative and postoperative ERD and BRD, and comparisons for SVA and aSVF between preoperative natural, taped, and postoperative values were performed using the Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Correlations between ERD and aSVF and between ERD and SVA were estimated using Spearman correlation coefficient rank test. P values less than 0.01 were considered significant in all statistical tests. All statistical analyses were performed using JMP 10 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

### Posterior infundibular dissection: safety first in laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^bb7844ef]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

A fourth method introduced by Strasberg in 1995 for LC is "the critical view of safety". The CVS consists of three criteria. "First, the triangle of Calot must be cleared of fat and fibrous tissue. It does not require that the common bile duct be exposed. The second requirement is that the lowest part of the gallbladder be separated from the cystic plate, the flat fibrous surface to which the non peritonealized side of the gallbladder is attached. The cystic plate, which is sometimes referred to as the liver bed of the gallbladder, is part of the plate/sheath system of the liver. The third requirement is that 2 structures, and only 2, should be seen entering the gallbladder. Once these 3 criteria have been fulfilled, CVS has been attained". The first clarification to be made is an anatomical one and relates to the definition of Calot's triangle. Calot's triangle as described by Calot is "an isosceles triangle with the common hepatic duct as its base, the inferior edge of the cystic duct and the superior border to the cystic artery as its sides". The "modern" or current definition of the triangle of Calot differs from what Calot originally described. The modern triangle Calot is better referred to as the hepatocystic triangle and is bound by the common hepatic duct medially, cystic duct caudally, and the liver edge cranially. CVS effectively requires skeletonization of the cystic artery and cystic duct and dissecting the cephalic aspect of the hepatocystic triangle. Our technique leaves the node of Lund intact protecting the proximal aspect of the cystic artery posterior to it. More importantly, it avoids the need to dissect the trapezoid area seen in Fig. 5 a and b thereby reducing the potential injury to the common hepatic duct, right hepatic duct, and right hepatic artery. This trapezoid is actually the subtraction of the triangle of Calot from the hepatocystic triangle. To take this discussion a step further, we examined the rationale for the CVS. The CVS is meant to identify the cystic duct and artery similar to what is done in open surgery; however, it was felt that technical difficulties arise when trying to free the gallbladder completely from the cystic plate. Therefore, dissection of a third of the cystic plate provided the anatomical proof needed without the technical issues. Our technique uses the same rationale and achieves the same goal again without dissection of the trapezoid and with emphasis on initial posterior dissection. Moreover, and as shown in Figs. 8 and 9, complete dissection of the gallbladder of the cystic plate replicating open surgery is achieved routinely in our technique without difficulties ligating the cystic duct and artery and again without complete dissection of the hepatocystic triangle.

### Geometric and electromyographic assessments in the evaluation of curve progression in idiopathic scoliosis [^5657a866]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

The natural history of patients with idiopathic scoliosis was analyzed radiographically and electromyographically in a prospective longitudinal study.

Objectives

To identify changes in geometric variables and the sequence in which these changes occur during curve progression in the natural history of patients with idiopathic scoliosis. In addition, to study the relationship between several geometric variables and electromyographic (EMG) measurements to determine their predictive value as risk factors to curve progression of the scoliotic deformity.

Summary Of Background Data

The main area of concern in treating children with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is the unpredictability of curve progression during the early development of the deformity.

Methods

The changes in radiographic geometric and EMG variables between the first presentation and consecutive 4-6-month follow-up periods were analyzed in 105 patients with idiopathic scoliosis. Statistical analyses were performed to elucidate in more detail how spinal geometry evolves during curve progression.

Results

Curve severity was associated with remaining growth potential expressed as an increasing spinal growth velocity (SGV). With increasing SGV, an enhanced EMG activity at the lower part on the convex side of the curve expressed as EMG ratio was found. High EMG ratio was associated with increased axial rotation and diminished kyphosis before the rapid increase in Cobb angle. Lateral deviation, wedge angle, and axial rotation all increased during periods of progression. Changes in tilt angle and lordosis were not associated with curve progression.

Conclusions

In the natural history of idiopathic scoliosis, SGV and EMG ratio at the lower end vertebra are prominent risk factors of curve progression. The asymmetric muscle activity is associated with increased axial rotation, which in its turn is associated with increasing Cobb angle and diminishing kyphosis. The combination of these variables provides insight in the physiologic and 3-dimensional biomechanical evolution of the natural history of curve progression in idiopathic scoliosis.

### The geometric nature of weights in real complex networks [^72348287]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Since triangles are a reflection of the triangle inequality in the underlying metric space, we expect nodes forming triangles to be close to one another. Thus, the higher average normalized weight observed on triangles strongly suggests a metric nature of weights, which is not a trivial consequence of the relation between weights and topology. This leads us to formulate the hypothesis that the same underlying metric space ruling the network topology — inducing the existence of strong clustering as a reflection of the triangle inequality in the underlying geometry — is also inducing the observed correlation between ω norm and m. To prove this, we develop a realistic model of geometric weighted random networks, which allows us to estimate the coupling between weights and geometry in real networks.

A geometric model of weighted networks

Many models have been proposed to generate weighted networks. Among them, growing network modelsand the maximum-entropy class of models. However, none of them is general enough to reproduce simultaneously the topology and weighted structure of real weighted complex networks. We introduce a new model based on a class of random networks with hidden variables embedded in a metric spacethat overcomes these limitations. In this model, N nodes are uniformly distributed with constant density δ in a D -dimensional homogeneous and isotropic metric space (Supplementary Methods), and are assigned a hidden variable κ according to the probability density function (pdf) ρ (κ). Two nodes with hidden variables κ and κ ′ separated by a metric distance d are connected with a probability

where μ > 0 is a free parameter fixing the average degree and p (χ) is an arbitrary positive function taking values within the interval (0, 1). The free parameter μ can be chosen such that(κ) = κ. Hence, κ corresponds to the expected degree of nodes, so the degree distribution can be specified through the pdf ρ (κ), regardless of the specific form of p (χ) (Supplementary Methods). The freedom in the choice of p (χ) allows us to tune the level of coupling between the topology of the networks and the metric space, which in turn allows us to control many properties such as the clustering coefficient and the navigability.

### The relationship between foveal outer nuclear layer thickness in the active and resolved phases of central serous chorioretinopathy treated with half-dose photodynamic therapy [^413493f7]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The study showed that the foveal ONL thickness increased in the majority of resolved CSC eyes, and the degree of increase was associated with the ratio of the height of the retinal detachment to the width of the subretinal space.

Previously, Ohkuma has observed that the foveal ONL thickness increased by about 11 μm in some resolved CSC eyes compared with that in their active phase, which is consistent with our findings. Although the exact mechanism of the increase in ONL thickness remains unclear, the following scenario is possible. Normally, the retina is attached to the RPE, thus, the retina and the underlying RPE are the same in length. While, in CSC, the hyperpermeability of the choroid causes hydrostatic pressure increase and leakage through the RPE rupture, resulting in neurosensory retinal detachment. On an OCT image, the border of the subretinal space appears approximately as a triangle: the underlying RPE forms the base of the triangle, i.e. the bottom side, the outer border of the detached retina forms the other two sides, and the fovea is the top vertex of the triangle. Based on triangle inequality, the outer border of the detached retina is longer than the underlying RPE. Thus, we speculate that the retina is stretched when it is detached, and then recovers when it reattaches to the RPE. Previously, the elastic properties of the human retina have been examined in donated eyes under physiological conditions. Moreover, in this study, the association between the ratio of retinal detachment height to subretinal space width and the increase degree of foveal ONL thickness difference further support the hypothesis.

### Edge-oriented and steerable hyperbolic polaritons in anisotropic van der waals nanocavities [^f00b6661]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

On this basis, we extend the concept of edge-tailored hyperbolic PhP modes in Fig. 1 to a closed nanocavity composed by the lowest number of edges, i.e. triangular α-MoO 3 nanocavities. For simplicity, we used isosceles triangle shapes (SEM image shown in Supplementary Fig. 1b). Such triangular shapes are intentionally designed with their bottom edge perpendicular to the [001] crystal direction of α-MoO 3 (Tr1–Tr5, see the measured near-field signals in Fig. 1e). In general, the polariton distribution of such triangle nanocavities can be regarded as the interference of PhPs reflected from two edges. Firstly, no polariton fringes parallel to the bottom edge are observed, as expected, since this edge is equivalent to Ed7 in Fig. 1c and thus does not contribute to the polariton distribution in the nanocavity. In sharp contrast, this property does not exist in the similar triangular nanocavities made of grapheneor hBN (see our simulations in Supplementary Fig. 3a and Supplementary Notes 2 and 4), because of their in-plane isotropy: in such geometries we always find polaritons reflected from every edge. Secondly, when the apex angle of the triangle increases, the edge orientation angle θ of their equal sides accordingly grows. The polariton distribution determined by the oblique sides is expected to be very small when the edge orientation angle θ (Tr5) is larger than the open angle, and the whole triangle manifests a forbidden zone without polaritonic signature, a feature that can be traced back to Fig. 1c (Ed5). More verifications of such triangular shapes with a bottom edge along the [100] crystal directions can be found in Supplementary Fig. 3b, which further validates our discussions. Our experimental results are also corroborated with full-wave simulations using finite-difference time domain method (see Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Note 3). Hence, we can conclude that the polariton distribution within a geometric nanocavity strongly depends on the edge orientation in α-MoO 3.

### Structural puzzles in virology solved with an overarching icosahedral design principle [^5f77ba37]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Methods

The construction of the polyhedral models and their duals is described below.

Construction of polyhedral designs

Consider two lines intersecting at an angle of 60° at the centre of one of the hexagons in the hexagonal (sub)lattice of a given Archimedean lattice. Counting steps between midpoints of adjacent hexagons along these lines via the integer coordinatesand, thencharacterises the positions of other hexagons in the (sub)lattice with respect to the original one, i.e. Using the line connecting the midpoints of these hexagons as the edge of an equilateral triangle of an icosahedral face (Supplementary Fig. 1), the position of the remainder of that surface is uniquely determined, andthus defines a planar embedding of an icosahedral surface into the Archimedean lattice (see examples in Fig. 2). The corresponding polyhedral shape in three dimensions is an icosahedron, obtained via identification of edges of the planar embedding. The numbers of pentagonal, hexagonal, triangular and square faces in the Archimedean lattice overlapping with this icosahedral surface for different values ofandare provided in Supplementary Tables 1–4 for the hexagonal, trihexagonal, snub hexagonal and rhombitrihexagonal lattice, respectively. In particular, an icosahedral face given bycontains either no additional face (hexagonal case), one triangle (trihexagonal case), four triangles (snub hexagonal case), or one triangle and a square (rhombitrihexagonal case), that each form the start of an infinite series of polyhedra.

Construction of the dual lattices

For each polyhedron in the above classification, we construct a dual polyhedron. For this, vertices are positioned at the centres of the polyhedral faces, and vertices associated with adjacent faces connected by straight lines. Since Archimedean lattices have a single type of vertex environment, these dual polyhedra each have a single type of face that corresponds to the fundamental domain of a Laves lattice. These faces are triangles, rhombs, florets and kites for the hexagonal, trihexagonal, snub hexagonal and rhombitrihexagonal lattice, respectively. Using again the planar embedding of an icosahedral surface into the associated Archimedean lattice, we determine the numbers of each such face for polyhedra characterised byandas above; their numbers are listed in Supplementary Table 5.

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^031312fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^7e0b2d1d]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Basic stereological measurements for lung imaging — first-order parameters, probes, and reference space are specified. First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap", where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.

### Deep transfer learning for inter-chain contact predictions of transmembrane protein complexes [^785445c5]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Motivated by the success of intra-protein contact predictions in monomer structure prediction –, various advanced deep learning methods have been developed to predict the inter-chain contacts for protein complexes –. Our previous work, DeepHomo, utilizes sequence and structure features to predict inter-chain contacts with ResNet2 architectures. With the progress of protein language models, DeepHomo2.0, GLINTER, and CDPredapply the embedding vector and multi-head attention features from the ESM-MSA-1b modelto capture the interfacial interaction. However, these deep learning-based methods are only trained on the data set of mainly soluble proteins, which are different from the TMPs. Therefore, it is urgent to specially develop a deep learning model to predict the inter-chain contacts for the homo-oligomers of TMPs.

However, compared with thousands of soluble protein complexes, the number of transmembrane protein complexes is rather limited. For example, there are only < 350 non-redundant homo-oligomeric transmembrane protein complexes in the PDBTM database, which poses a major obstacle to direct training on transmembrane proteins. Addressing the challenge, we here develop a deep transfer learning method to predict the inter-chain contacts of transmembrane proteins, named DeepTMP, which first trains an initial model on a large number of soluble proteins and then transfers it to transmembrane proteins by utilizing the features of protein language model and the geometric triangle-aware module. Compared with the common ResNet and attention mechanism, the geometric triangle module can efficiently consider the many-body effect and reduce the geometric inconsistency, which helps the pre-trained model to more effectively capture the interfacial interaction from the evolution information generated by the ESM-MSA-1b model and better predict the inter-chain contacts of TMPs.

### A general method for the creation of dilational surfaces [^6025b588]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Dilational structures can change in size without changing their shape. Current dilational designs are only suitable for specific shapes or curvatures and often require parts of the structure to move perpendicular to the dilational surface, thereby occupying part of the enclosed volume. Here, we present a general method for creating dilational structures from arbitrary surfaces (2-manifolds with or without boundary), where all motions are tangent to the described surface. The method consists of triangulating the target curved surface and replacing each of the triangular faces by pantograph mechanisms according to a tiling algorithm that avoids collisions between neighboring pantographs. Following this algorithm, any surface can be made to mechanically dilate and could, theoretically, scale from the fully expanded configuration down to a single point. We illustrate the method with three examples of increasing complexity and varying Gaussian curvature.

### Nature of power electronics and integration of power conversion with communication for talkative power [^266bc70c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fig. 3
Output voltage spectrum of a buck/boost converter with PI-compensated output voltage control.

The red components are the dc component, the switching frequency component and the high-order harmonics. f s denotes the switching frequency and f c denotes the cut-off frequency of the control loop. The dotted blue lines are the side-band components induced by the PI-compensated voltage control loop. They are distributed on both sides of the red components at frequency intervals equal to the cut-off frequency of the control loop.

Note that at the moment of the switching frequency shift, the output current may exhibit a small distortion, which is undesirable for power conversion. To avoid this distortion, the switching frequency shift should be selected to occur at the average-current-crossing instant of the inductor. The PWM sequence is generated by comparing the dc reference signal with a triangle or sawtooth wave sequence. For the case of a triangle wave sequence, the moment of the frequency shift should be selected to lie at the peak of the triangle wave, as shown in Fig. 4a. However, for a sawtooth wave sequence, the moment of the frequency shift should be selected to lie on the upward ramp, and the exact time should be calculated according to the duty cycle, as shown in Fig. 4b. Consequently, for PWM/2FSK, a triangle wave sequence is the preferred choice for ease of implementation.

### Mining extreme properties from a large metamaterial database [^358b2580]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Mining extreme Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio from the resulting database composed of 1,846,182 truss metamaterials.

A The range of effective Young's moduli E x and E y along the horizontal and vertical directions is visualized with extreme examples marked. Compared with the reported range composed of classic metamaterials (triangle scatters), the number of new metamaterials with superior effective Young's moduli (star scatters) is up to 2939. The reported range refers to the properties of the classic metamaterials,– (Fig. 2, insets c1 ~ c12), which are generated by the design method and included in the database. B The range of Poisson's ratios is visualized with extreme examples highlighted. ν xy and ν yx characterize the lateral contraction for loading along the x and y directions, respectively. The scales of the scatter represent the magnitude of Poisson's ratios. C Mechanism for enhancing effective Young's moduli. The diamond with reinforced struts presents the stretching-dominated behavior, which contributes to the superior effective Young's moduli. D Mechanism for extreme Poisson's ratio. The larger displacements of the struts on either side of the virtual fulcrum are responsible for the extreme Poisson's ratio. E1 ~ E4 Trade-off bound and extreme examples for different couples of mechanical properties. Extreme modulus and Poisson's ratio are inherent contradictions. The generated database can effectively mine the bounds of coupling properties. Source data are provided in the Source Data file.

The core principle underlying the high modulus in truss metamaterials is the stretching-dominated theory, which maximizes the stiffness by efficiently transferring loads along the axial direction of the struts. Classic metamaterials (insets c1 ~ c6 in Fig. 2) are designed from crystal-inspired architectures to realize stretching-dominated behavior. Among them, anisotropic moduli (in the classic metamaterials c1 and c3) are commonly considered to approach the Voigt bound more readily. However, they only achieve up to 50% (5 × 10 −3) of the Voigt bound (Supplementary Table 6 provides the detailed values) due to their specified symmetry and regularity. Therefore, directly designing stretching-dominated architectures only through intuitive or manual approaches is still highly challenging. Further investigation is required to elucidate the relationship between architectures and extreme modulus.

### The greater trochanter triangle; a pathoanatomic approach to the diagnosis of chronic, proximal, lateral, lower limb pain in athletes [^43ab7675]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic pain experienced in the proximal, lateral, lower limb may arise from the femoro-acetabular joint, from the muscles and tendons that act upon it, from any of the structures that traverse the area, and from more remote structures such as the lumbar spine. The aetiology of pathology in this area is not confined to either trauma or overuse. As a result many different sporting activities may have a causal role. Without a clear clinical/pathological diagnosis, the subsequent management of chronic groin pain is difficult. The combination of complex anatomy, variability of presentation and the non-specific nature of the signs and symptoms makes the diagnostic process problematic. The paper proposes a novel educational model based on pathoanatomic concepts. Anatomical reference points were selected to form a triangle, which provides the discriminative power to restrict the differential diagnosis, and form the basis of ensuing investigation. This paper forms part of a series addressing the three-dimensional nature of proximal lower limb pathology. The 3G approach (groin, gluteal, and greater trochanter triangles) acknowledges this, permitting the clinician to move throughout the region, considering pathologies appropriately.

### Universality in long-distance geometry and quantum complexity [^e343ca2d]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

This implies that we can approximate the operatorwith a total cost of about. This operator agrees with our target operatorat leading order in z, and has an inner-product error of about z 2. This can be improved to z 3 by using the next order in the Suzuki–Trotter expansion, but going to even higher orders becomes prohibitively expensive. It is at this point that we make our heuristic step. In the Euclidean group example, we saw that the complexity geometry has so many degrees of freedom that by making minor deformations of the path we can correct small errors at small extra cost, in a way that is not captured by any finite order of the Suzuki–Trotter expansion, and is instead an emergent feature in the IR. Compared with the SU(2) example in the section ' Berger sphere ', the task of compiling in U(2 N) is complicated by the fact that there are many more directions in which to err; on the other hand, there are correspondingly more directions in which we can wiggle the path to eliminate the error, and as a statistical matter, we expect that to dominate. If the small inner-product errors can be corrected by wiggling the path, then we can synthesizefor z < 1 at cost k n 2 (k). To generateat larger values of z, the triangle inequality (for any) guarantees that the complexity grows no faster than linearly with coefficient k n 2 (k). This argument heuristically shows that the binomial metric is in the same universality class as the infinite-cliff metric, and therefore upper-bounds the critical schedule:The upper-bound equation (17) holds at all but the largest k, where the analysis becomes unreliable. Note also that although the binomial metric does not have a curvature as small as the exponential metric, it is still very moderate ∣ κ ∣ ≤ O (N) compared to the cliff metric. The reasoning that leads to equation (17) is heuristic, because to eliminate error it appeals to a statistical argument. In ref. it is shown that there is a weaker result that can be proved. The study also shows that any unitary that can be reached with a path that in the binomial metric has a lengthcan be approximated to within inner-product error ϵ by a path that in the infinite-cliff metric has a lengthOur conjectures imply that this can be improved from polynomial to linear-with-additive-constant and from approximate to exact.

### The significance of the interleaflet triangles in determining the morphology of congenitally abnormal aortic valves: implications for noninvasive imaging and surgical management [^a61a37fe]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Low credibility.

A comprehensive understanding of the normal and abnormal aortic root is paramount if we are to improve not only our assessment of the aortic root and its components but also the surgical approach to reconstructing this complex structure when congenitally malformed. Most anatomic and imaging-based classifications of the normal root recognize and describe the basic components, which include the shape and size of the three aortic sinuses and their three valvar leaflets, as well as the sinutubular junction and proximal ascending aorta. However, the three interposing fibrous interleaflet triangles, which share an intimate relationship with all elements of the root, are often ignored. In consequence, the important role the interleaflet triangles play in determining the function of the normal and congenitally malformed aortic root is underappreciated. Additionally, the subtle asymmetries found in the normal aortic root, such as differences between the sizes of the described components, underlie its hemodynamic efficiency. In this review the authors describe the complex structure of the normal aortic root, contrasting these normal characteristics with those found in the unicuspid and bicuspid variants of congenitally malformed aortic valves. Many of these features are readily recognizable using current imaging modalities and so should become a standard part of the description of aortic valvar disease. The authors believe that this thorough morphologic approach will provide a framework for the re-creation of a more normal aortic root at the time of repair or replacement, thereby improving current outcomes.

### Plaque distribution correlates with morphology of lenticulostriate arteries in single subcortical infarctions [^12122cb0]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

LSA Morphometry

LSA images were generated using coronal minimum intensity projection with 10 to 20 mm thickness on WB-VWI. To delineate the distributions of the LSAs, signal measurements of the LSAs were performed on the consecutive minimum intensity projection images, ensuring the vascular skeleton by manually tracing reflected the full length of the visualized LSAs. An LSA tracing continued only when the artery could be demonstrated as a continuous, linear low signal and clear contrast with surrounding tissue, and pointed toward the anterior perforated substance. The morphological characteristics of the visible LSAs were quantitatively analyzed on both the symptomatic and asymptomatic sides on the coronal slab minimum intensity projection image, including the number of stems and branches, length, distance, and tortuosity. Stems were defined as the portion of the LSAs that originated directly from the MCA. Branches are defined as daughter vessels originating from parent LSA stems or as stems with no branches (single vessel). LSA stems 5 mm or more in length were included for analysis. When an artery branched within 5 mm of the origin of the MCA, each stem was counted separately, because > 70% of branches were found to originate from common trunks. When an artery branched at a more distal site, the stem was counted and measured using the longest branch. The LSA tortuosity was defined as the ratio of 2 measurements: the actual path length divided by the linear distance. The schematic in Figure 2 illustrates the method used for counting stems and branches and for measuring LSAs.

Task 4: Number flankers

Target letters (n = 24) were flanked on each side by an Arabic numeral, chosen from a range between 2 and 9.

Task 5: Same-polarity flankers

Target letters (n = 24) were flanked on each side by black letters; presentation was as Task 2 except that items were presented on a grey background to match Task 6 (see below).

Task 6: Reverse-polarity flankers

Target black letters (n = 24) were flanked on each side by white letters, all presented on a grey background.

The edge-to-edge distance between the target letter and flankers was 0.1° of visual angle in the condensed condition and 1.0° in the spaced condition at a viewing distance of 50 cm; the height of stimuli (10.5 mm) corresponded to a visual angle of 1.20°. Participants were given one prompt for each trial where they named the flanker ('Is that the letter in the middle?'); this prompt was intended to limit errors resulting from visual disorientation. The same combination of flankers was used for each target letter under both spatial conditions within each flanker condition. Alphabetic items occurred with equal frequency within each task. The stimuli were presented in blocks of six items, with blocks being administered in an ABBA design. All flanked stimuli were presented in the centre of the screen within a fixation box (6.4° in width, 2.9° in height). All 26 patients with PCA completed Tasks 1, 2 and 4; 24 completed Task 3; and 22 completed Tasks 5 and 6. Naming latencies were manually determined from the onset of each letter using Audacity.

### From molecular to macroscopic via the rational design of a self-assembled 3D DNA crystal [^7b5f59e7]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

We live in a macroscopic three-dimensional (3D) world, but our best description of the structure of matter is at the atomic and molecular scale. Understanding the relationship between the two scales requires a bridge from the molecular world to the macroscopic world. Connecting these two domains with atomic precision is a central goal of the natural sciences, but it requires high spatial control of the 3D structure of matter. The simplest practical route to producing precisely designed 3D macroscopic objects is to form a crystalline arrangement by self-assembly, because such a periodic array has only conceptually simple requirements: a motif that has a robust 3D structure, dominant affinity interactions between parts of the motif when it self-associates, and predictable structures for these affinity interactions. Fulfilling these three criteria to produce a 3D periodic system is not easy, but should readily be achieved with well-structured branched DNA motifs tailed by sticky ends. Complementary sticky ends associate with each other preferentially and assume the well-known B-DNA structure when they do so; the helically repeating nature of DNA facilitates the construction of a periodic array. It is essential that the directions of propagation associated with the sticky ends do not share the same plane, but extend to form a 3D arrangement of matter. Here we report the crystal structure at 4 A resolution of a designed, self-assembled, 3D crystal based on the DNA tensegrity triangle. The data demonstrate clearly that it is possible to design and self-assemble a well-ordered macromolecular 3D crystalline lattice with precise control.

### Turbulent coherent structures and early life below the kolmogorov scale [^51bdbaf6]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Division and merging

Calculating the FTLE field is quite computationally costly, and counting elliptic LCSs without fear of error would require an extremely high spatial resolution, and therefore making full evaluation of the flow properties in a simulation is a much more involved process than a full evaluation of the biological properties. Furthermore, it is easy to predict when demographic changes are not due to the biological process from this evaluation. For instance, we can assign a minimum and maximum probability to the number of birth–death events occurring within a certain timespan given the approximate population size, and can also predict the extremal probabilities of the outcome in which all (or most) such birth–death events were either birth or death. The latter is particularly easy; the likelihood of M death events in a row before a birth must be bounded above by NB(1, d /(s i + d), M), where NB(a, b, c) denotes the value of the negative binomial distribution giving the probability of c deaths before 1 birth, given that the probability of a death in a population of size n where no individual is catalyzed (hence, the situation in which the probability of death is always maximized, giving the maximal probability of M deaths before a birth) is dn /(ns i + nd). Using our standard kinetic rates, a sequence of 10–15 deaths without a birth is already an extremely unlikely event, so that a dip in the largest cluster size of 10–15 would indicate a flow-based event (division of coherent structure) with high probability. In each of 1000 simulations, we paid attention only to monotonic changes in the size of the largest cluster with absolute value bigger than 10. The statistics of these changes are plotted in Fig. 6.

Migration and diversity

For Supplementary Fig. 1, seven vortices were used and were assigned an integer label which was maintained throughout the simulations. The curves shown were generated by simulating 1000 runs per metabolism, initializing 100 of each particle species in the vortices labeled 1–3 (therefore implicitly assuming that the metabolism had experienced some reproductive success in one vortex). Simply tracking the dynamics of particles from the three original lineages over time generated the left-hand side of Fig. 7. The right-hand side was given by counting the number of components (with 10 or more particles included) in a geometric graphinduced by drawing an edge between two particles iff they were at a distance (in the Euclidean metric) < R int.

### Predictive ability of pressure-corrected arterial stiffness indices: comparison of pulse wave velocity, cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), and CAVI0 [^546d7e4d]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

CAVI 0

Similar to haPWV and CAVI, no left–right CAVI 0 difference was observed. CAVI 0 crude survival curves were very similar to CAVI survival curves (compare Figure 1e vs. c and Figure 1f vs. d), with R-CAVI 0 showing smaller P values for DHFA prediction than L-CAVI 0. In Cox regression analyses (Table 2), left–right differences in P value persisted, and L-CAVI 0 and R-CAVI 0 were only significantly predictive in an unadjusted model.

Comparison of predictive powers of haPWV, CAVI, and CAVI 0

Figure 2 shows the results of Cox regression from Table 2 as volcano plots. In all 3 panels, a trend emerged suggesting that, with increasing blood pressure correction (i.e. from haPWV to CAVI to CAVI 0), predictive power decreases as visualized by the arrows (standardized hazard ratio decreases while P increases, noting that the y -axis shows negative log-transformed P values).

Right-pointing triangles indicate right-sides measures; left-pointing triangles indicate left-sided measures. Small horizontal lines are drawn to clarify triangle direction. Long-tailed, diagonal arrows illustrate that, with increasing blood pressure correction, power to predict outcome decreases, suggesting that part of the predictive power of blood pressure-dependent stiffness metrics arises from the predictive power of blood pressure per se. This trend persists in unadjusted (a), MAGGIC and HF status-adjusted (b), and additionally SBP-adjusted (c) analyses.

### Wetting and complex remodeling of membranes by biomolecular condensates [^86e585fa]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The tension triangle in Fig. 2c also implies the relationships

between the surface tensions and the contact angles, as follows from the law of sines for the tension triangle in Fig. 2c. When we take the difference of the two equations in Eq. (10), the affinity contrast, in Eq. (9) becomes equal to

Thus, the rescaled affinity contrast, which is a mechanical quantity related to the adhesion free energies of the membrane segments, is equal to the factor, which is a purely geometric quantity that can be obtained from the three contact angles, as determined by analysing the optical images (Fig. 2a, e). The inequalities in Eq. (9) imply the inequalitiesfor the geometric factor, where the interpretation for the limiting values offollows from the limiting cases for the affinity contrast, in Eq. (9). The smallest possible value ofcorresponds to complete wetting of the membrane by the condensate phase, while the largest possible value ofcorresponds to dewetting of the membrane by this phase. The dimensionless factor, is negative if the membrane prefers the condensate over the exterior buffer and positive otherwise. It then follows from the data in Fig. 2d that the membrane prefers the condensate for molar salt concentrations93 mM and the exterior buffer for. For, the geometric factor, vanishes, corresponding to equal contact angles, and no affinity contrast between the condensate and the exterior buffer. Therefore, by measuring the geometric factor, as a function of the salinity or another control parameter, we obtain the affinity contrast, in units of the interfacial tension, as a function of this control parameter.

Note that the geometric factor is scale-invariant and does not depend on the sizes of a given vesicle-condensate couple, as exemplified in Supplementary Fig. 12.

### Experimental nonclassicality in a causal network without assuming freedom of choice [^eafe4a5f]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The infeasibility witness obtained by the program for our data yields an inequality of the form of Eq. (7), which is violated by the experimental data by several standard deviations: in this way, we unambiguously demonstrate the emergence of nonclassicality in the triangle network, without relying on Bell's theorem. We depict the particular coefficientsdefining the inequality that we obtained from the adapted LP in Fig. 5 (b). Denoting the value that the data gives for the left-hand-side of this inequality by, we obtain V exp = − 0.02436 ± 0.00016 (using a 6-fold coincidence window w 2 ~ 20 μs), corresponding to a violation of the inequality by 152 standard deviations. In Fig. 6, we plotas a function of the choice of the 6-fold coincidence window w 2. As expected, by increasing w 2, we increase the detection rate of 6-fold events, in turn decreasing the statistical error on the computed value of V exp, shown in the figure with the red shadowed area.

### Major variation in carotid bifurcation anatomy: a possible risk factor for plaque development? [^294a5f1a]. Stroke (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Why is carotid plaque often so strikingly asymmetrical within individuals, and why does the extent of disease vary so considerably between individuals with similar systemic risk factors? Variability of carotid bifurcation anatomy is a possible explanation. Flow models suggest that vessel anatomy, in particular vessel diameter and area ratios, affects plaque formation at arterial bifurcations. However, carotid bifurcation anatomy could only be a major risk factor for plaque formation if it was sufficiently variable. Since very few data exist on the extent of interindividual and intraindividual variability of bifurcation anatomy, we studied 5395 angiograms from the European Carotid Surgery Trial.

Methods

To minimize changes in bifurcation anatomy secondary to atherosclerosis, we excluded vessels with ≥ 30% stenosis. We measured arterial diameters at disease-free points and calculated the following ratios: internal to common carotid (ICA/CCA), external to common carotid (ECA/CCA), external to internal carotid (ECA/ICA), and outflow/inflow area. For intraindividual asymmetry, we compared the ratios on both sides.

Results

Each ratio varied markedly between individuals. The 95% ranges were as follows: ICA/CCA, 0.44 to 0.86; ECA/CCA, 0.34 to 0.80; ECA/ICA, 0.55 to 1.33; and outflow/inflow area, 0.38 to 1.28. The results were very similar in 407 bifurcations with no disease. Among the 755 patients with < 30% stenosis bilaterally, side differences of ≥ 25% were present in 17% (95% CI, 15% to 20%) for the ICA/CCA ratio, 27% (95% CI, 24% to 30%) for the ECA/CCA ratio, 32% (95% CI, 28% to 35%) for the ECA/ICA ratio, and 42% (95% CI, 38% to 45%) for the outflow/inflow area ratio.

Conclusions

We found large interindividual differences in carotid bifurcation anatomy. For example, there was 4-fold variation of the ratio of outflow to inflow area. Intraindividual variation was also considerable. These data highlight the potential importance of anatomic variation as a risk factor for atheroma and provide a firm basis for flow modeling studies.

### Algorithms to measure carotid intima-media thickness in trials: a comparison of reproducibility, rate of progression and treatment effect [^9559b1b5]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Current ultrasound protocols to measure carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) in trials differ considerably. The best CIMT protocol would be one that combines high reproducibility, a large and precise estimate of the rate of CIMT progression and a large and precise estimate of the treatment effect. We performed a post-hoc analysis to determine the best algorithm for determining CIMT using data from the METEOR study, a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effect of rosuvastatin on CIMT progression in 984 low coronary heart disease risk individuals with increased CIMT.

Methods

CIMT information was collected from two walls (near and far wall), three segments (common carotid, bifurcation and internal carotid artery), five different angles (for the right carotid artery - 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 degrees on the Meijer's carotid arc; for the left - 300, 270, 240, 210, and 180 degrees) of two sides (left and right carotid artery), resulting in possibly (2 × 3 × 5 × 2 =) 60 measurements. On the basis of combinations of these measurements, we built 66 different ultrasound protocols to estimate a CIMT for each individual (22 protocols for mean common CIMT, 44 protocols for mean maximum CIMT). For each protocol we assessed reproducibility [intraclass correlation (ICC), mean difference of duplicate scans], 2-year progression rate in the placebo group with its corresponding standard error and treatment effect (difference in CIMT progression between rosuvastatin and placebo) and its corresponding standard error.

Results

Data of duplicate ultrasound examinations at baseline and end of study were available for 688 participants (70% of 984). The ICC based on duplicate baseline examinations ranged from 0.81 to 0.95. CIMT progression rates in the placebo group ranged from 0.0046 to 0.0177 mm/year, with SE ranging from 0.00134 to 0.00337. Treatment effects ranged from 0.0141 to 0.0388 mm/year. The protocols with highest reproducibility, highest CIMT progression/precision ratio and highest treatment effect/precision ratio were those measuring both near and far wall for at least two angles.

Conclusion

Ultrasound protocols that include CIMT measurements at multiple angles of both near and far wall give the best balance between reproducibility, rate of CIMT progression, treatment effect and their associated precision in this low-risk population with subclinical atherosclerosis.

HCWs with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between three and six months after third dose (n = 12) were separated (red dots and triangles; infected 3D6mo). Half-maximal inhibitory dilutions (ID 50) were calculated, and titers < 10 were marked as 5. Geometric mean titers for vaccine groups are indicated above each time point and shown as lines with geometric SDs. g – l Sequential serum samples of each individual are connected with lines.

Black-outlined boxes highlight loop combinations observed in natural Ig domains. On the right, examples of changes in cross-β motif geometry linked to β-arch loop geometry. d β-arch helices are formed by a short ɑ-helix connected to the adjacent β-strands with short loops, and are complementary to β-arch loops for connecting cross-β motifs. e Topology diagram of a 7-stranded Ig domain. β-strands and β-arch loops are indicated as S i and L i, respectively, where i is the corresponding number. f Examples of de novo designed Ig backbones generated with different geometries and β-arch connections following the described rules, colored from N-terminus (blue) to C-terminus (red).

### Experimental nonclassicality in a causal network without assuming freedom of choice [^e83d6c77]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Violation of a causal compatibility inequality

In order to demonstrate the nonclassicality of the experimental data relative to the triangle causal network, we seek to identify some causal inequalities, which must be satisfied by all distributions compatible with the classical triangle network but which are violated by our experimental statistics. To this end, we turn to the inflation technique for causal inference introduced in ref.

As detailed in the Methods, the inflation technique relates compatibility with a given causal structure to feasibility of a linear program (LP). If the LP related to an inflation of(see Fig. 5 (a)) is found to be infeasible, then evidently p is incompatible with. In our case, is taken to be the classical triangle scenario causal structure depicted in Fig. 1 (b).

Fig. 5
Inflation technique for the triangle network.

a The second order inflation graph of the triangle network. Such an inflation doubles the number of latent variables relative to the triangle scenario, having six latent variables. The inflation quadruples the number of observable random variables of the triangle scenario, having twelve observable random variables { a (1), b (1), c (1), a (2), b (2), c (2), a (3), b (3), c (3), a (4), b (4), c (4) }. Distributions compatible with this inflated structure satisfy symmetry properties, and have marginals corresponding to products of triangle-compatible distribution. This can be exploited to derive suitable causal compatibility inequalities that are violated by the experimental data. b This plot depicts the 64 × 64 coefficientsfor a quadratic inequality of the form of Eq. (7) such that the left-hand side is nonnegative on all distributions compatible with the classical triangle scenario, but which evaluates to the negative number V e x p = − 0.02436 ± 0.00016 on our experimental data. The x -axis ranges over the values of (a 1, b 1, c 1) while the y -axis ranges over the values of (a 2, b 2, c 2), and the color at a given point denotes the value ofaccording to the mapping set out in the legend.

### Topological phonon transport in an optomechanical system [^7b3dbeed]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Robustness against backscattering

While the triangle geometry is the simplest closed-loop geometry, already producing a topological mechanical cavity, we also sought to test the robustness and immunity to waveguide imperfections in more complex cavity structures where we could independently vary the length of waveguide segments between sharp corners. The effects of such variations should be most pronounced in geometry with appreciable backscattering at the corners, eventually producing separate standing wave patterns in the segments whose free spectral range would depend on the segment length. By contrast, the ideal case of robust topological transport should only be sensitive to the overall length of the domain wall circumference. Producing samples with different local geometrical details, but the same circumference, allows us to test these ideas by comparing their spectra.

To this end, we designed and fabricated two tree-shaped cavity structures. Each of these has a total domain wall circumference of 96 unit cells and includes seven 60° corners, but individual segment lengths differ. Figure 3 c shows the mechanical spectra measured near the horizontal edge of both tree geometries, superimposed onto each other. The most important observation is that, outside of the gray region, the two spectra agree almost perfectly, despite the different geometries. This is a clear and direct experimental signature of the near-perfect absence of backscattering, as predicted for the topological edge states. The gray region is close to the bandgap for the horizontal edge, where no suppression of backscattering is expected (see above).

### Solving olympiad geometry without human demonstrations [^47a1942c]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Traceback for geometric-rule deduction

To do this, we record the equality transitivity graph. For example, if ' a = b ', ' b = c ', ' c = d ' and ' a = d ' are deduced, which results in nodes a, b, c and d being connected to the same 'equality node' e, we maintain a graph within e that has edges [(a, b), (b, c), (c, d), (a, d)]. This allows the traceback algorithm to perform a breadth-first search to find the shortest path of transitivity of equality between any pair of variables among a, b, c and d. For collinearity and concyclicity, however, the representation is more complex. In these cases, hypergraphs G (V, E) with 3-edges or 4-edges are used as the equality transitivity graph. The traceback is now equivalent to finding a minimum spanning tree (denoted MST in the following equation) for the target set S of nodes (three collinear nodes or four concyclic nodes) whose weight is the cardinality of the union of its hyperedges e ′:

Such optimization is NP-hard, as it is a reduction from the decision version of vertex cover. We simply use a greedy algorithm in this case to find a best-effort minimum spanning tree.

Traceback for algebraic deduction

Traceback through Gaussian elimination can be done by recognizing that it is equivalent to a mixed integer linear programming problem. Given the coefficient matrix of input equations A constructed as described in the previous sections and a target equation with coefficients vector b ∈ R N, we determine the minimal set of premises for b by defining non-negative integer decision vectors x, y ∈ Z M and solve the following mixed-integer linear programming problem:

The minimum set of immediate parent nodes for the equality represented by b will be the i th equations (i th rows in A) whose corresponding decision value (x i − y i) is non-zero.

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^53dbc2ff]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Observing that GA lesions tend to enlarge along their margins, researchers proposed the perimeter-adjusted growth rate metric, as an extension of the effective radius growth rate to more general, noncircular geometries:

Conveniently, this metric has been well studied in the computer-aided geometric design community in the context of offset curves. It can be shownthat for isotropic, time-invariant growth fields, = Λ for lesions having concave curvatures whose absolute values are small relative to the lesion growth (an illustration of concave and convex margin segments, as well as the precise definition of small, is provided in Appendix 3 and Figure S1). Briefly and informally, a concave margin segment corresponds to an inward bulge in the lesion, and a convex margin segment corresponds to an outward bulge in the lesion). Intuitively, this condition requires that no intrafocus merging occurs. Of note, = Λ for any convex lesion undergoing isotropic, time-invariant growth (a lesion is convex if the entirety of its margin is convex, that is, the lesion has no inward bulges; for example, ellipse-shaped lesions are convex).

Although the above results demonstrate the usefulness of the atrophy-front growth model for interpreting length-type growth rate metrics, they pertain to simplistic geometries and growth patterns. Analysis of arbitrary geometries and growth patterns, for which analytical results are unwieldy or intractable, can be approached numerically, which is the focus of the subsequent section.

Generating Datasets for Numerical Evaluation of Metric Accuracy

Compared with clinically observed GA data, for which the complete growth dynamics are not well understood, simulated GA data have the advantage that the true growth parameters can be precisely specified. Importantly, an observed data set comprising images of a GA lesion acquired at a sequence of follow-up visits does not provide direct information related to the underlying growth field; different growth fields can result in the same observed growth data. This ambiguity is particularly acute for common clinical datasets, for which the intervisit times are relatively lengthy (e.g. 6 months or longer). Because of these challenges, we outline below our growth simulation approach, and then we construct a set of highly simplified lesion geometries and growth fields that highlight inherent limitations of the square-root-transformed and perimeter-adjusted metrics. Finally, we present a semisimulated approach to generating realistic GA growth configurations using real lesion geometries and simulated random growth fields.

A framework for studying the effects of global change on DOM-microbe associations.

a DOM-microbe associations are affected by the three proximal drivers, namely energy supply and both the diversity and traits of DOM and microbes. The relationships among the three drivers and their influences on the associations are shown with single-sided arrows. The DOM-microbe associations, indicated by double-sided arrows, are measured by bipartite interactions between DOM molecules (circles C 1 –C i) and microbial taxa (circles M 1 –M j). The size of circles indicates the abundance of DOM molecules or microbial species, and the width of arrows is the magnitude of associations. Commonly used indices summarise the specialization of individual molecule i and microbial species j, which describes the levels of "vulnerability" of DOM molecules and "generality" of microbial species. b Conceptual framework for understanding DOM-microbe associations under distal drivers such as global change via the three proximal drivers. For better 3D visualization, the sizes of triangles decrease towards the top-right, and the colour changes towards different corners of the triangles represent variations in the relative importance of different proximal drivers under a global change scenario. The background depicts the primary motivation of this study in examining distal drivers of climate change and eutrophication in Taihu Lake, China. The left and right waters indicate clean and cyanobacteria-dominated lake states, respectively, and are separated by a road having the shapes of western lakeshore and northern Zhushan and Meiliang Bays of Taihu Lake. We established field microcosms on mountainsides by adding sediments collected from the lake centre, and designed nutrient levels and N/P ratio based on nutrient conditions of this lake.

### Voxel volume overlap: voxel-size sensitive indicators of subject motion in functional MRI [^5d16f703]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

When calculating subject motion, it is important to be precise about the respective reference frame. If motion is calculated w.r.t. the first image in a timeseries, this measure is known as total displacement (TD). It describes how far away from the original position a subject moved in the course of the session. This, however, is not necessarily the most relevant measure, as slow movements are more easily accounted for than rapid motion spikes (Maknojia et al.). For the latter in particular, scan‐to‐scan displacement (STS) is more relevant, which uses the individually preceding volume as the reference frame. The way these two indicators are calculated is similar, using a 3D expansion of Pythagoras theorem (Wilke) to calculate the joint displacement resulting from all shifts and all rotations.

2.1 Open Questions

While it is trivial to estimate the volumetric effects of simple shifts (see example in the introduction), it is far from trivial to account for rotations as there is a multitude of possible rotatory effects, and their combinations, on a 3D volume. Computing the exact overlap between two arbitrarily‐rotated cubic volumes, therefore, is mathematically highly challenging. However, while no elegant algebraic solution exists, it is possible to assess the overlap by using a geometric approach. Here, the reference voxel is defined as the intersection of six planar boundaries, with each plane dividing space into two categories: "definitely outside" and "potentially inside"; the intersection of all "potentially inside" volumes then unequivocally defines the cube. For example, consider a dice on a table and its top surface showing, for example, "1". Everything above that surface is outside of the dice, while everything below may be inside. The lower (opposite) surface will then be defined by the face of the dice showing "6", which in our example is facing the table. Again, everything below that surface is outside. Repeating this process of exclusion with the "4 & 3" and the "2 & 5" faces will unequivocally define the space, and hence, the volume of the dice. The intersection of a moved cube with a reference cube can therefore be calculated by iteratively looping over all six planes (of the reference cube) and by therewith removing all "definitely outside" sections (of the moved cube). The remaining part constitutes the overlapping remnant of the moved cube, the volume of which can then be computed.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on the management of calcified coronary lesions [^ec150ece]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2024). High credibility.

SCAI calcified coronary lesions — consensus tips for bifurcation lesions advise that "For calcification restricted to the main branch, the calcium modification strategy is similar to that described for any calcified lesion". Procedural precautions include "During RA of the main branch, remove the side branch guidewire to avoid cutting the wire". Sequencing guidance notes to "Determine the sequence of main and side branch RA based on the severity of stenosis and propensity for acute closure". For extensive disease, "For bifurcation lesions with calcification of both main and side branches that require atherectomy, serial RA can be performed in both branches", and as an alternative, "For bifurcation lesions with calcification of both branches, IVL for discrete calcification allows maintenance of both guide wires".

### How are dysplastic hips different? A three-dimensional CT study [^2f67787d]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical correction of acetabular dysplasia can postpone or prevent joint degeneration. The specific abnormalities that make up the dysplastic hip are controversial.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What are the relative size, shape, and orientations of the typical nondysplastic hip? (2) How do these variables differ in the developmentally dysplastic hip? (3) Are there version differences between the acetabuli of dysplastic and nondysplastic hips? (4) Are there pairs of variables in which the change in one is always accompanied by a change in the other for both nondysplastic and dysplastic acetabuli?

Methods

Of 117 consecutive three-dimensional (3-D) CT scans performed for hip dysplasia between March 1988 and October 1995, 48 met criteria of developmentally dysplastic hips by plain radiography. These were retrospectively compared with 55 pelvic 3-D CT scans culled from 81 consecutive scans performed for reasons other than hip dysplasia (ie, hip pain, trauma, infection) that did not affect the hip or pelvic landmarks. The 3-D reconstructions were orientated anatomically for standardization of the measurements to be compared. Representative 3-D volumes of the acetabular space were constructed from which we could measure anatomic positions and dimensional information. One author performed all image orientation and measurements.

Results

Nondysplastic acetabuli are essentially hemispheric with height equal to width and twice the depth. The dysplastic acetabuli were elongated in females (52.4 ± 6.2 mm for dysplastic versus 46.5 ± 4.6 mm for nondysplastic (mean difference, 5.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9–8.0; p = 0.002) and shallower in both females (18.7 ± 4.9 mm for dysplastic versus 23.6 ± 4.0 mm for nondysplastic; mean difference, 6.5; 95% CI, 4.4–8.5; p < 0.0001) and males (21.1 ± 4.8 mm for dysplastic versus 25.0 ± 4.3 mm for nondysplastic, mean difference, 5.3; 95% CI, 2.6–8.1; p = 0.0002); width was similar to that of nondysplastic hips. Acetabular openings were slightly more vertical than nondysplastic hips in females (5°; 95% CI, 1.9–8.1; p = 0.002) but not in male subjects. The dysplastic acetabuli were smaller in volume (18% in females, p = 0.002, and 19% in males, p = 0.0012) and had less space occupied by the femoral head compared with nondysplastic hips (p < 0.0001 for females, p < 0.0001 for males). Dysplastic hip midacetabulum was 4° more anteverted in females (95% CI, 0.5–6.8; p = 0.022) but not for males (p = 0.538). The upper dysplastic acetabulum was more retroverted in females and males (10.2°; 95% CI, 5.5–15; p < 0.0001, and 7.0°; 95% CI, 0.6–13.4; p = 0.032, respectively). Acetabular volumes in nondysplastic and dysplastic hips were related to acetabular width but not to length.

Conclusions

Developmentally dysplastic acetabuli are not deficient in merely a single dimension but are globally deficient. The subluxated femoral head lies in the elongated and retroverted superior acetabulum, which becomes progressively shallower as the acetabulum increases in length. Focally deficient anterior or posterior femoral head coverage is uncommon. Current procedures that redirect the acetabulum, no matter how technically successful, cannot fully compensate for the incongruence of a spherical femoral head within a shallow and elongated acetabulum unless corrected at an early age when acetabular remodeling is possible. Early detection and treatment of acetabular dysplasia should be emphasized.

### Measuring external rotation of the fibula and fibular length in bilateral computed tomography scans: how reliable is this method? [^a1e790de]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Patients

There were 83 bilateral CT scans retrieved. Therefore, a total of 166 ankles were measured. The mean age of these patients was 47 years (SD 13.5), and 77.1% were male patients.

Side-to-side Comparisons

Table 1 summarizes the mean external rotation and mean fibular length per observer, including SD and range. The mean external rotation ranged from 6.6 to 7.7 degrees between the 4 observers (range 0.1–22.0 degrees and SD 3.0–4.9 degrees). The mean side-to-side difference in external rotation between ankles ranged from 1.4 to 3.4 degrees for the 4 observers (range 0.0–12.4 degrees). The mean ratio in external rotation between ankles ranged from 1.1 to 1.5 for the 4 observers (range 0.1–12.1). The mean fibular length ranged from 24.6 to 25.8 mm between the 4 observers (range 13.0–33.6 mm). The mean side-to-side difference in fibular length ranged from 0.5 to 2.1 mm between the 4 observers (range 0.0–12.4 mm). The mean ratio in fibular length between ankles ranged from 1.0 to 1.1 for the 4 observers (range 0.8–2.0).

TABLE 1.
Mean External Rotation, Difference, and Ratio. And Fibular Length, Difference and Ratio for Different Observers

Interobserver Variability

Table 2 summarizes the ICC for interobserver variability. The overall interobserver variability for external rotation was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.32–0.57) and ranged from 0.27 to 0.65 between different observers. The highest ICC for external rotation (0.65) was between the 2 trauma surgeons and the ICCs between the 2 surgeons and the resident were 0.54 and 0.51. The overall interobserver variability for fibular length was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.47–0.70) and ranged from 0.45 to 0.73 between different observers. The highest ICC for fibular length (0.73) was between one of the surgeons and the resident, followed by the ICC between the 2 surgeons (0.60).

### Experimental nonclassicality in a causal network without assuming freedom of choice [^d5aea7de]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In a Bell experiment, it is natural to seek a causal account of correlations wherein only a common cause acts on the outcomes. For this causal structure, Bell inequality violations can be explained only if causal dependencies are modeled as intrinsically quantum. There also exists a vast landscape of causal structures beyond Bell that can witness nonclassicality, in some cases without even requiring free external inputs. Here, we undertake a photonic experiment realizing one such example: the triangle causal network, consisting of three measurement stations pairwise connected by common causes and no external inputs. To demonstrate the nonclassicality of the data, we adapt and improve three known techniques: (i) a machine-learning-based heuristic test, (ii) a data-seeded inflation technique generating polynomial Bell-type inequalities and (iii) entropic inequalities. The demonstrated experimental and data analysis tools are broadly applicable paving the way for future networks of growing complexity.

### Pharmacokinetics of intravenously (DIZ101), subcutaneously (DIZ102), and intestinally (LCIG) infused levodopa in advanced parkinson disease [^6bd0754c]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

A power analysis indicated that n = 14 would be sufficient for establishing dose-adjusted bioequivalence (2-sided CI) and n = 18 for ascertaining noninferiority (one-sided CI) about COV. This was based on a similar study regarding 16-hour intestinal infusion of LCIGand data from the 5 patients assessed in the interim analysis that led to a restart of this trial.

To compare the 3 treatments about levodopa and carbidopa levels, including the initial phase of increasing levels and the decline after the termination of infusion, comparisons of levodopa and carbidopa AUC 0–last, AUC 0–∞, AUC 0–16, AUC 2–16, AUC 0–2, and AUC 8–16 (subscript: hours) were undertaken using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of logarithmic values with the resulting point estimates and CIs being reported after back-transformation to nominal values. The terms in the ANOVA were sequence, patient within sequence, period, and treatment. To compare levodopa and carbidopa systemic exposure, standard average bioequivalence testing based on the 90% CI for the ratio of the population means (test/reference) was used. The acceptance range for the AUC ratio of the 90% CI for levodopa was 0.8000–1.2500. Bioequivalence tests were undertaken for DIZ101 and DIZ102 vs LCIG (reference) and for DIZ102 and LCIG vs DIZ101 (reference).

### De novo design of modular peptide-binding proteins by superhelical matching [^21ab3a00]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

General approaches for designing sequence-specific peptide-binding proteins would have wide utility in proteomics and synthetic biology. However, designing peptide-binding proteins is challenging, as most peptides do not have defined structures in isolation, and hydrogen bonds must be made to the buried polar groups in the peptide backbone 1–3. Here, inspired by natural and re-engineered protein-peptide systems 4–11, we set out to design proteins made out of repeating units that bind peptides with repeating sequences, with a one-to-one correspondence between the repeat units of the protein and those of the peptide. We use geometric hashing to identify protein backbones and peptide-docking arrangements that are compatible with bidentate hydrogen bonds between the side chains of the protein and the peptide backbone 12. The remainder of the protein sequence is then optimized for folding and peptide binding. We design repeat proteins to bind to six different tripeptide-repeat sequences in polyproline II conformations. The proteins are hyperstable and bind to four to six tandem repeats of their tripeptide targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities in vitro and in living cells. Crystal structures reveal repeating interactions between protein and peptide interactions as designed, including ladders of hydrogen bonds from protein side chains to peptide backbones. By redesigning the binding interfaces of individual repeat units, specificity can be achieved for non-repeating peptide sequences and for disordered regions of native proteins.

### Ten years of progress towards universal health coverage: has China achieved equitable healthcare financing? [^90dab25b]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

It can be seen from the health-financing triangle presented in figure 1 that the ratio of OOP payments to total expenditure on health decreased over the period 2008–2018 in China, while social health insurance made a more substantial contribution over the same period. Thus, UHC has largely been achieved, with more than 95% of the Chinese population being covered by health insurance since 2013, but the overall picture of China's healthcare financing equity has never been fully explored. First, no studies have evaluated financing equity during the 10 years of progress towards UHC in China. Second, the equity of healthcare financing depends not only on its degree of progressivity, but also on the extent of any pure horizontal inequity and reranking resulting from it. Previous studies on healthcare financing in China have only focused on vertical equity, and a comprehensive analysis of healthcare financing equity has never been undertaken. To our knowledge, only one study has examined the horizontal equity of healthcare financing in China between 2003 and 2008. To date, no studies have systemically examined both vertical and horizontal equity during the progress towards UHC in China. This is a serious omission. This study seeks to address this gap in the literature by evaluating the progressivity, horizontal equity and reranking associated with healthcare financing in China during the progress towards UHC. We conducted three surveys in 2008, 2013 and 2018. The aim of our analysis is to systemically evaluate equity of healthcare financing during the 10 years of progress toward UHC in China, including vertical equity, pure horizontal equity and reranking.

### Solving olympiad geometry without human demonstrations [^08fd1141]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Fig. 2
AlphaGeometry advances the current state of geometry theorem prover from below human level to near gold-medallist level.

The test benchmark includes official IMO problems from 2000 to the present that can be represented in the geometry environment used in our work. Human performance is estimated by rescaling their IMO contest scores between 0 and 7 to between 0 and 1, to match the binary outcome of failure/success of the machines. For example, a contestant's score of 4 out of 7 will be scaled to 0.57 problems in this comparison. On the other hand, the score for AlphaGeometry and other machine solvers on any problem is either 0 (not solved) or 1 (solved). Note that this is only an approximate comparison with humans on classical geometry, who operate on natural-language statements rather than narrow, domain-specific translations. Further, the general IMO contest also includes other types of problem, such as geometric inequality or combinatorial geometry, and other domains of mathematics, such as algebra, number theory and combinatorics.

### Solving olympiad geometry without human demonstrations [^2d70710f]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

We present an alternative method for theorem proving using synthetic data, thus sidestepping the need for translating human-provided proof examples. We focus on Euclidean plane geometry and exclude topics such as geometric inequalities and combinatorial geometry. By using existing symbolic engines on a diverse set of random theorem premises, we extracted 100 million synthetic theorems and their proofs, many with more than 200 proof steps, four times longer than the average proof length of olympiad theorems. We further define and use the concept of dependency difference in synthetic proof generation, allowing our method to produce nearly 10 million synthetic proof steps that construct auxiliary points, reaching beyond the scope of pure symbolic deduction. Auxiliary construction is geometry's instance of exogenous term generation, representing the infinite branching factor of theorem proving, and widely recognized in other mathematical domains as the key challenge to proving many hard theorems. Our work therefore demonstrates a successful case of generating synthetic data and learning to solve this key challenge. With this solution, we present a general guiding framework and discuss its applicability to other domains in Methods section 'AlphaGeometry framework and applicability to other domains'.

We pretrain a language model on all generated synthetic data and fine-tune it to focus on auxiliary construction during proof search, delegating all deduction proof steps to specialized symbolic engines. This follows standard settings in the literature, in which language models such as GPT-f (ref.), after being trained on human proof examples, can generate exogenous proof terms as inputs to fast and accurate symbolic engines such as nlinarith or ring, using the best of both worlds. Our geometry theorem prover AlphaGeometry, illustrated in Fig. 1, produces human-readable proofs, substantially outperforms the previous state-of-the-art geometry-theorem-proving computer program and approaches the performance of an average IMO gold medallist on a test set of 30 classical geometry problems translated from the IMO as shown in Fig. 2.

### Impact of the aortomitral positional anatomy on atrioventricular conduction disorder following mitral valve surgery [^4f2f3fa7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Definitions of aortomitral positional anatomy diagnosed by 3‐dimensional transesophageal echocardiography.

Preoperative 3‐dimensional transesophageal echocardiography reveals the aortic root located at the center of the anterior mitral leaflet (center appearance) or shifted to the left fibrous trigone side (lateral appearance). The center appearance is further classified as center, lateral, or medial rotation according to the left and noncoronary commissures (orange circles). This variation affects the distance and positional relationship (red double arrow) between the membranous septum (star) and the right fibrous trigone (blue triangle), which might be synonymous with variations in the conduction system location. L‐N commissure indicates commissure of the left and noncoronary aortic leaflet.

Notably, previous literature has used expressions such as "clockwise, counterclockwise", and "left/rightward" deviation of the commissure of the left and noncoronary aortic leaflet to describe the aortic root rotational position. However, these expressions are typically used to assess the aortic valve from an apical perspective, often in the context of CT scans or similar methods. In contrast, we opted to use the terms lateral and medial in our classification on the basis of 3‐dimensional TEE images as they correspond to the perspectives of viewing the aortic and mitral valves from the aortic and left atrial sides, respectively, as in the surgical context.

The preoperative diameter of the ascending aorta was measured using CT scans in all cases, and its relationship with aortomitral anatomic variations (center/lateral appearance and center/lateral/medial rotation) diagnosed using 3‐dimensional TEE was investigated.

### Medial packing and elastic asymmetry stabilize the double-gyroid in block copolymers [^8119125e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Medial strong segregation theory for double gyroid

The medial strong segregation theory calculation optimizes the SST free energy, Supplementary Eq. (11), over the variational family of generating gyroidal surfaces to determine and analyze thermodynamically preferred DG chain packing. Complete details on the construction of tessellating chain configurations and the variational algorithm are given in Supplementary Note 3–4.

We begin with a broad set of generating surfaces G withsymmetry; here we have chosen G as level sets of a three Fourier-mode expansion of the gyroid symmetry. From the medial map of G (for the double network) we generate the terminal boundaries of both domains, T A and T B, referring to the tubular and matrix domains respectively. The induced map between T A and T B approximates the mean trajectories of domain-spanning chains, which occupy local volumes approximated by triangular prismatic wedges, thus providing a complete tessellation of the DG structure. The location of the IMDS is then determined along each trajectory according to the constraints of volume balance and chain composition, resulting in mutually compatible terminal boundaries, IMDS, and trajectories, as shown in Fig. 2 b, from which we compute the geometric contribution to the free energy in Eq. (1). Notably, local volume balance generally requires some measure of tilt between trajectories and the IMDS, such that the terminal surfaces of the ultimate volume-balanced packing deviate at least slightly from the medial surfaces of the final IMDS. As shown in Fig. 2 c, variation of the generating surface leads to variation in compatible IMDS shapes and variable spreading of the terminal boundaries for fixed block composition f, which we then optimize over (see Supplementary Note 4).

Skeletal strong segregation theory ansatz for double gyroid

We employ a variant of the medial SST approach to model the DG assemblies whose terminal sets are constrained to lie along the skeletal graphs of the double network, in a effort to closely recapitulate and compare to prior results from ref. Complete details are provided in Supplementary Note 5. In brief, we construct a variational set of skeletal tessellations via projection of the terminal positions in the tubular domains from the "web-like" medial surfaces of double-gyroids to the nearby positions along the skeletal graph. Finally, we optimize the free energy over the free parameters of the map that takes points on the tubular domain medial surface to points on the skeletal graph.

Children 5 Through 17 Years of Age

In a US study5(Study 5), a single dose of Prevnar 13 was administered to children 5 through 9 years of age, who were previously vaccinated with at least one dose of Prevnar, and to pneumococcal vaccine-naïve children 10 through 17 years of age.

In children 5 through 9 years of age, serotype-specific IgG concentrations measured 1 month after vaccination were noninferior (i.e., the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] of > 0.5) to the corresponding IgG concentrations in toddlers (Study 3) 1 month after a fourth pneumococcal vaccination (after the 4thdose of Prevnar for the 7 common serotypes and after the 4thdose of Prevnar 13 for the 6 additional serotypes) as shown in Tables 22 and 23 respectively.

In children 10 through 17 years of age OPA GMTs, as measured by the mcOPA assay, 1 month after vaccination were noninferior (i.e., the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR of > 0.5) to mcOPA GMTs in the 5 through 9 year old group for 12 of 13 serotypes (except for serotype 3), as shown in Table 24.

### Balancing the anteroposterior diameters of the nostril lengths in cleft rhinoplasty [^6c36f7fc]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteocartilaginous deformities in cleft rhinoplasties may be restored with numerous techniques. However, the anteroposterior (AP) diameter lengths of the nostrils may still be unequal and should also be addressed. A technique was designed to balance nostril AP diameter lengths and apical shapes.

Materials and Methods

Balance between AP nostril diameters was accomplished by reduction of the AP diameter of the nostril at the non-cleft side by medial crural reduction and augmentation of the AP diameter of the nostril at the cleft side by three-parted mini-flap reconstruction at the soft triangle. The cleft-side AP diameter length was divided by the non-cleft-side AP diameter length of the same preoperative, per-operative and 1-year postoperative base view photographs of each patient, and "nostril balancing ratio" was obtained. The more this ratio was near to "one", the more the AP nostril diameters were equal.

Results

Seventy-eight unilateral-cleft rhinoplasty were performed between January/2019 and May/2022. Forty-two of them required nostril AP diameter equalization. Twenty-nine patients were female, thirteen were male. Thirty-three of them were operated for a primary cleft rhinoplasty. Nine of them for secondary cleft rhinoplasty. Mean age was 28 years (22–39 years). Mean follow-up was 25 months (6–40 months). The preoperative, per-operative and postoperative mean "nostril balancing ratios" were 0.714 (0.621–0.813), 0.743 (0.721–0.752) and 0.971 (0.943–0.976), respectively.

Conclusion

Balancing AP diameter symmetry with MCO at the non-cleft side and three-parted mini skin flap reconstruction at the cleft side may provide the satisfactory results. Three mini-flaps at the soft triangle may remold the nostril apex in an oval shape, which may result in a better shape symmetry.

### A fast multislice sequence for 3D MRI-CEST pH imaging [^fdc7354f]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

4.4 Single‐slice and multislice sequence comparison

Figure 5 compares the single‐slice and the proposed multislice sequences. In particular, Figure 5A shows the Z‐spectra of phantom #1 (pH = 6.7), acquired by iterating the conventional single‐slice RARE sequence (TS = 5 seconds) over the slices in a contiguous way. In comparison, Figure 5B shows the same Z‐spectra collected with the optimized multislice sequence (TS 1 = 3 seconds; TS 2 = 1 second). In both the acquisition schemes the Z‐spectra are fully overlapped for all eight slices. The relative differences between each slice and the mean volumetric Z‐spectrum showed percentage variations in the range ± 0.9% for the single‐slice sequence (Figure 5C) and ± 1.3% for the multislice one (Figure 5D), with comparable changes versus slices. Moreover, the two sequences were compared for image quality and quantitatively in terms of CEST contrast. Figure 5E, F shows the acquired images at 4.2 ppm for the third slice: for both approaches, the images appear well defined, with no evident artifacts or geometrical distortions, exploiting one of the RARE readout advantages. The ST% maps for slice 3 are shown in Figure 5G, H. The average ST% at 4.2 ppm and 5.5 ppm were 8.25 ± 0.4% and 10.4% ± 0.4% for the single‐slice approach, whereas they were 8.4% ± 0.7% and 10.7% ± 0.6% for the multislice acquisition scheme. Additional images for all slices for the two sequences are shown in the Supporting Information Figure S2, and the corresponding CEST contrast maps at 4.2 ppm and at 5.5 ppm are shown in Supporting Information Figure S3. These findings highlight that the measured CEST contrasts, even when using shorter saturation periods, compare with those obtained with the conventional single‐slice approach. The CEST contrast‐to‐noise ratio was evaluated along the slices for both methods (Figure 5I). The contrast‐to‐noise ratio mean values were 16.9 ± 0.9 and 12.0 ± 1.4 for the single‐slice and multislice approaches, respectively. The calculated contrast‐to‐noise ratio was lower for the multislice approach when compared with the single‐slice approach, but still high and homogeneous along the slices. Moreover, by using the proposed sequence, the total acquisition time for a single Z‐spectrum sampled with 46 offsets in eight slices covering a volume of 30 × 30 × 12 mm 3 with a spatial resolution of 0.47 × 0.47 × 1.5 mm 3 was 9 minutes and 29 seconds for the multislice scheme compared with 36 minutes and 48 seconds for the conventional approach (repeated single‐slice acquisition).

### Deep transfer learning for inter-chain contact predictions of transmembrane protein complexes [^02bbfc9b]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The triangle update utilizes an attention mechanism on the pair representations of three residues to enforce that the pair representation satisfies the geometric triangle inequality. The detailed formulations of the triangle update are as follows.where k is the number of blocks in the triangle update, the function ofis a sigmoid function followed by a linear transformation, and the function ofis a layernorm function followed by a linear transformation.

Next, the triangle self-attention is applied with an attention mechanism to calculate the relative strength of the interaction between the pairs of residues. First, we used a multi-head attention on the row dimension which considers the pair representations between one residue of the receptor with all residues of the ligand. The corresponding formulation is described as follows, where q ij, k ij, v ij is the linear transformation of the output from the triangle update, d is the intra-protein distance, and λ is set to 8 Å. Second, we also updated the pair representation in the column dimension. In addition, we used the Naccess programto calculate the solvent-accessible surface area of the monomer and defined the surface residues. Then, we used the mask mechanism like transformer for the surface residues in the triangle update and triangle self-attention.

After that, we used the transition layer which includes two layers of linear transformation, to update the pair representationas the input of the next triangle-aware block.

Field of view (FOV) planning — the FOV should be tailored to patient size and the structures examined. To screen the entire pelvis, a 35- to 45-cm FOV is typical and images should include enough lateral tissue to encompass the gluteal insertions and trochanteric bursae. Entire-pelvis images are useful for side-to-side comparisons. When symptoms are unilateral, include at least 1 sequence with a large enough FOV to detect contralateral disease, which is frequently present. For hip or groin pain, a larger FOV may be required to evaluate the source of pain.

### Femoral head-neck offset measurements in 339 subjects: distribution and implications for femoroacetabular impingement [^42f34d47]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The α-angle is a frequently used measurement to quantify head-neck offset pathology in cam-type femoroacetabular impingement. However, diverging norm values and reference intervals have been described, especially in men.

Methods

The α-angle, the head-neck offset ratio and the triangular index were measured on anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of 339 (170 men and 169 women) subjects without evident underlying hip pathology.

Results

For male subjects, the mean α-angle was 49.4° (SD 10.5°) on anteroposterior and 49.1° (SD 10.6°) on lateral radiographs, whereas for female subjects, it was 45.0° (SD 8.0°) and 46.1° (SD 9.9°), respectively. Thus, calculated upper limits of reference intervals in the population screened were 70° for both radiographic projections in men and 61° (anteroposterior) and 66° (lateral) in women.

Conclusion

These data substantiate recent findings that the pathological threshold of the α-angle in male subjects may be lower than that previously assumed.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^f7895f80]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Stereological principles in quantitative image analysis — Stereology is the statistical science providing practical methods for extracting accurate and precise quantitative structural information from imaging data sets of irregular objects. Stereological methods make no assumptions regarding shape, size, orientation, or spatial distribution of objects and are unbiased by design instead of relying on geometric model assumptions that may introduce bias. Stereology is the method of choice for quantifying lung structure in microscopy with rigorously defined standards, principles, and practical applications, and the same principles apply to CT, micro-CT, PET, MRI, and other modalities ("in vivo morphometry"), with use documented in the brain, heart, and lung.

The red curve with triangles describes the following data where test specificity is the same as in Fig. 1, but sensitivity has been increased. Here, assuming a rating of 3 or more conveys a diagnosis of cancer, then three positive cases are missed (sensitivity 94%) and 17 negative cases are labeled positive (specificity 66%); the AUC is 0.89:The blue ROC curve with squares describes the following data where test sensitivity is the same as Fig. 1, but specificity has been increased. Here, assuming a rating of 3 or more conveys a diagnosis of cancer, then seven positive cases are missed (sensitivity 86%) and eight negative cases are labeled positive (specificity 84%); the AUC is 0.89:The black ROC curve with solid circles describes the following data where test sensitivity is increased to the same level as the red curve but with specificity dropped by a corresponding amount. Assuming a rating of 3 or more conveys a diagnosis of cancer, then just three cases are missed (sensitivity 94%) but 47 negative cases are labelled positive (specificity 6%). The empirical ROC AUC is 0.50 and the "curve" is actually a straight line:

Fig. 3
Distribution of confidence scores (data from Fig. 1). Patients with cancer are represented by the dotted line and patients without cancer by the solid line. In this example using a threshold at greater or equal to a confidence rating of 3 provides the best separation between patients with and without cancer and is optimally balanced between sensitivity versus specificity. Moving this boundary to the right or left of the graph corresponds to raising or lowering the diagnostic threshold, respectively. If CT were perfect at discriminating between patient groups, the two distributions would not overlap. The less good a test at discriminating between patients with and without an abnormality, the more the two distributions will overlap

ROC AUC

ROC AUC, the area under the ROC curve, is often used to summarise test performance across all thresholds in the plot. Simplistically, AUC represents how likely it is that the test will rank two patients; one with a lesion and one without, in the correct order, across all possible thresholds. More intuitively, AUC is the chance that a randomly selected patient with a lesion will be ranked above a randomly selected normal patient. A perfect test would have 100% sensitivity with zero false-positives (100% specificity), across all thresholds. This point lies at the extreme top left-hand corner of the ROC plot; AUC = 1 · 0. Such tests don't exist in real life, and we expect some failure to separate normal and abnormal patients. A straight line connecting the extreme bottom-left (sensitivity, FPR: 0,0) and top-right (1,1) corners (the "chance diagonal") describes a test with no discrimination; AUC = 0.5.

### Is the fibular station on lateral ankle radiographs symmetric? A retrospective observational radiographic study [^85e9c061]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Precise reduction of a syndesmosis after disruption is critical to improve patient physical function. Intraoperative lateral radiographs of the unaffected ankle are often used in clinical practice as a template for anatomic syndesmotic reduction because sagittal plane malreduction is common. However, there is little data to suggest fibular station, or the position of the fibula in the AP plane on the lateral radiograph, is symmetric side-to-side in patients.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Is the position of the fibula in the AP plane (fibular station) on lateral ankle radiographs symmetric in an individual? (2) Do the measurements used to judge the position of the fibula on lateral radiographs have good inter- and intraobserver reliability?

Methods

Over the period from August 2016 to October 2018, we identified 478 patients who presented to an orthopaedic clinic with forefoot and midfoot complaints. Skeletally mature patients with acceptable bilateral lateral ankle radiographs, which are common radiographs obtained for new patients to clinic for any complaint, were included. Based on that, 52% (247 of 478 patients) were included with most (22%, 107 patients) excluded for poor lateral radiographs. The most common diagnosis in the patient cohort was midfoot OA (14%, 35 patients). The median (range) age of the included patients was 54 years (15 to 88), and 65% (159 of 247) of the patients were female. Fibular station, defined as the position of the fibula in the AP plane, and fibular length were measured using a digital ruler and goniometer on lateral radiographs. A paired t-test was used to determine if no difference in fibular station existed between the left and right ankles. With 247 paired-samples, with 80% power and an alpha level of 0.05, we could detect a difference between sides of 0.008 for the posterior ratio, 0.010 for the anterior ratio, and 0.012 for fibular length. Two readers, one fellowship-trained orthopaedic traumatologist and one PGY-4, measured 40 patients to determine the inter- and intraobserver reliability by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

Results

The posterior fibular station (mean right 0.147 [σ = 0.056], left 0.145 [σ = 0.054], difference = 0.03 [95% CI 0 to 0.06]; p = 0.59), anterior fibular station (right 0.294 [σ = 0.062], left 0.299 [σ = 0.061], difference = 0.04 [95% CI 0 to 0.08]; p = 0.20), and fibular length (right 0.521 [σ = 0.080], left 0.522 [σ = 0.078], difference = 0.05 [95% CI 0.01 to 0.09]; p = 0.87) ratios did not differ with the numbers available between ankles. Inter- and intraobserver reliability were excellent for the posterior ratio (ICC = 0.928 and ICC = 0.985, respectively) and the anterior ratio (ICC = 0.922 and ICC = 0.929, respectively) and moderate-to-good for the fibular length ratio (ICC = 0.732 and ICC = 0.887, respectively).

Conclusion

The use of lateral radiographs of the contralateral uninjured ankle appears to be a valid template for determining the position of the fibula in the sagittal plane. However, further prospective studies are required to determine the efficacy of this method in reducing the syndesmosis over other methods that exists.

### Pharmacokinetic evaluation of a drug transporter cocktail consisting of digoxin, furosemide, metformin, and rosuvastatin [^2c7895f4]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Statistical methods

The relative bioavailabilities of digoxin, furosemide, metformin, and rosuvastatin in the probe cocktails (test T1, T2, and T3) compared to the single substances (reference) were estimated from the ratios of the geometric means (test/reference) and their two‐sided 90% CIs for the primary (AUC 0‐tz, C max) and secondary (AUC 0‐∞) endpoints. The statistical model used was an analysis of variance (ANOVA) on log‐transformed endpoints including effects for sequence, subjects within sequences, period, and treatment. The effect "subjects within sequences" was considered random, whereas the other effects were considered fixed. CIs were determined from the ANOVA residual error. No adjustment for a first‐order carryover effect was included in the statistical analyses, as the occurrence of such an effect was highly unlikely due to the chosen study design and procedures. The statistical analyses were performed on the pooled pharmacokinetic set (all subjects from the treated set who provided at least one primary or secondary endpoint value in any period) using SAS (v. 9.2, by SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

The sample size calculation for this exploratory trial was not based on a power calculation but on the expected precision, defined as the ratio of upper to lower confidence limits of the 90% CI around the geometric mean ratio. For N = 24 evaluable subjects, the precision ranges for geometric coefficients of variation of 25% to 40% were from 1.35 to 1.61. The calculation was performed as described by Kupper and Hafner 33 using R version 2.14.2.

### The SNMMI and EANM practice guideline for small-bowel and colon transit 1.0 [^3e00f389]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Colon transit patterns — geometric center thresholds define abnormal patterns as follows: Colonic inertia is suggested with failure of radiotracer progression beyond the splenic flexure, with a geometric center of less than 4.1 at 48 and 72 h. Functional outlet obstruction is present when activity reaches the rectosigmoid but is not expelled, with a geometric center of more than 4.1 at 48 h and less than 6.2 at 72 h. Figure 7 summarizes these patterns compared with a normal colon transit pattern and labels them as generalized slow colon transit, colonic inertia, and functional rectosigmoid obstruction.
