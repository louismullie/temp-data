## Question

In the context of ankylosing spondylitis, is there any implication of the disease starting in the achilles tendon or bursa instead of the SI joints?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ankylosing spondylitis can start in the Achilles tendon or bursa instead of the sacroiliac joints, and what the evidence shows about that possibility. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the canonical disease model and where inflammation typically begins. Then, I should verify whether peripheral enthesitis, including Achilles involvement, can precede axial disease. Next, I will examine imaging and epidemiologic data that might show subclinical enthesitis before sacroiliitis. After that, I need to consider juvenile-onset disease, where the sequence often differs. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion and outline diagnostic implications, making sure I anchor each point to the best available references.

> Let me first confirm the standard model. Classic ankylosing spondylitis is characterized by inflammation beginning in the sacroiliac joints and progressing to the spine, with enthesitis as a hallmark but typically in the context of established axial disease. This is consistently described in authoritative reviews and textbooks, and it remains the foundation for classification and diagnosis in adults [^2b4e84c0] [^0d81a6c3].

> Wait, let me verify whether peripheral enthesitis can be an early or even initial manifestation. Several cohorts and imaging studies show that Achilles enthesitis and retrocalcaneal bursitis are common in spondyloarthritis and can appear before or alongside axial symptoms. In the DESIR early axSpA cohort, peripheral enthesitis was present in over half of patients at baseline, with Achilles involvement frequent, and additional patients developed enthesitis over follow-up, indicating that peripheral disease can precede or accompany axial disease rather than always follow it [^0b125296]. Ultrasound and MRI series also detect subclinical Achilles enthesitis and bursitis in a substantial fraction of patients, including some with minimal or no axial symptoms at the time of imaging, reinforcing that entheseal inflammation can be an early signal of SpA biology [^af54492f] [^7c9ea912].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should distinguish frequency from causality. While enthesitis can precede axial symptoms, most adult-onset AS still declares itself with sacroiliac involvement early, and current classification frameworks emphasize MRI sacroiliitis and HLA-B27 to capture pre-radiographic axial disease, which underscores that the sacroiliac joints remain the canonical starting point in the majority of cases [^c3e76ef8] [^b5fc5473]. So, I need to be careful not to overstate that Achilles-first disease is typical; rather, it is a recognized, albeit less common, early pattern that can mislead clinicians if they only screen for axial pain [^0b125296].

> I will now examine juvenile-onset disease, where the sequence is more often peripheral-first. In enthesitis-related arthritis, children frequently present with lower-extremity enthesitis and peripheral arthritis, and sacroiliac or spinal involvement evolves later. Achilles and plantar fascia enthesitis are among the most common early sites, and pelvic enthesitis on MRI can even predict later sacroiliitis, which is a key reason pediatric SpA is conceptualized differently from adult-onset AS [^d6ff2dd0] [^38a9e18a] [^17b7419f]. This pattern supports the biological plausibility that entheseal inflammation can precede axial disease in a subset of patients, particularly in younger populations [^d6ff2dd0].

> Let me consider the pathophysiology to ensure internal consistency. The enthesis organ concept and biomechanical stress models explain why mechanically loaded sites like the Achilles and sacroiliac joints are vulnerable to inflammation in SpA, and mechano-immune coupling at entheses can drive both peripheral and axial disease, which makes it biologically plausible for Achilles enthesitis to be an early manifestation in some patients, even if sacroiliitis remains the more common initial site in adults [^0d81a6c3] [^66d70d11].

> Next, I should review diagnostic implications so I don't miss cases. If a patient presents with isolated Achilles enthesitis or retrocalcaneal bursitis, especially with inflammatory features or HLA-B27 positivity, I need to check for axial symptoms and consider MRI of the sacroiliac joints, because early sacroiliitis may be clinically silent yet detectable by imaging, and guidelines endorse MRI when suspicion for axSpA remains high despite normal radiographs [^b5fc5473] [^d491053c]. Conversely, in children with enthesitis, I should anticipate potential evolution to axial disease and monitor accordingly, given the higher prevalence of peripheral-first presentations in juvenile SpA [^d6ff2dd0].

> Putting this together, I should double-check my bottom line. Yes, ankylosing spondylitis can occasionally start with Achilles tendon or bursa involvement, particularly in juvenile-onset disease or in a minority of adults with early peripheral enthesitis, but this is not the typical sequence. In most adults, inflammation originates in the sacroiliac joints, so Achilles-first disease should be viewed as an atypical but recognized early phenotype that warrants evaluation for evolving axial spondyloarthritis rather than dismissed as isolated tendinopathy [^2b4e84c0] [^0b125296] [^d6ff2dd0].

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) **does not typically begin in the Achilles tendon or bursa**; it characteristically starts with sacroiliac joint inflammation [^2b4e84c0] [^0d81a6c3]. However, **Achilles enthesitis and bursitis can be early peripheral manifestations** of AS or axial spondyloarthritis, especially in younger patients or those with HLA-B27 positivity [^0b125296] [^af54492f]. These peripheral features may precede or accompany axial symptoms but are not the primary site of disease initiation [^0b125296]. Early recognition of Achilles involvement can aid diagnosis, but **imaging of the sacroiliac joints remains essential** for confirming axial disease [^b5fc5473].

---

## Typical onset of ankylosing spondylitis

AS typically begins with **inflammation of the sacroiliac (SI) joints**, causing inflammatory back pain and stiffness [^2b4e84c0]. This axial involvement is a hallmark of AS and is usually detected by MRI or radiographs showing sacroiliitis [^b5fc5473]. Peripheral manifestations, such as enthesitis and arthritis, can occur but are generally secondary to axial disease [^notfound].

---

## Achilles tendon and bursa involvement in AS

Enthesitis — inflammation at tendon or ligament insertion sites — is a characteristic feature of AS and other spondyloarthropathies [^0d81a6c3]. The Achilles tendon insertion at the calcaneus is a **common site of enthesitis** in AS, and retrocalcaneal bursitis (inflammation of the bursa between the Achilles tendon and the calcaneus) is also frequently observed [^af54492f]. These peripheral manifestations can cause significant pain, swelling, and functional impairment [^0b125296].

---

## Evidence for Achilles involvement as an early manifestation

Several studies suggest that Achilles enthesitis and bursitis can occur early in the course of AS or axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA):

- **DESIR cohort**: In a prospective study of 708 patients with recent-onset axSpA, 55.8% had peripheral enthesitis at baseline, with the Achilles tendon being one of the most commonly involved sites (38.5%) [^0b125296]. During 5-year follow-up, an additional 71% developed peripheral enthesitis, indicating that enthesitis can be an early feature of axSpA [^0b125296].

- **Juvenile-onset AS**: Juvenile AS often presents with peripheral enthesitis, including Achilles involvement, before axial symptoms or sacroiliitis become apparent [^d6ff2dd0] [^f409ffff]. This pattern suggests that Achilles enthesitis can be an initial manifestation in younger patients [^notfound].

- **Imaging studies**: MRI and ultrasound studies have demonstrated subclinical enthesitis and bursitis at the Achilles insertion in patients with AS or axSpA, even in the absence of clinical symptoms [^7c9ea912] [^f9b7e7d9]. These findings support the concept that Achilles involvement can precede overt axial disease [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

The involvement of the Achilles tendon and bursa in AS is thought to reflect the **enthesitis-based model** of spondyloarthropathies. This model proposes that inflammation originates at entheses — sites where tendons, ligaments, or joint capsules attach to bone — due to mechanical stress and immune-mediated mechanisms [^0d81a6c3]. The Achilles tendon insertion is particularly susceptible to mechanical stress, making it a frequent site of enthesitis in AS [^f9b7e7d9].

---

## Clinical implications and diagnostic considerations

While Achilles enthesitis and bursitis can be early manifestations of AS, they are **not specific** to AS and can occur in other conditions, such as psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, and mechanical overuse injuries [^87023117] [^39c34b15]. Therefore, clinicians should consider AS in patients presenting with Achilles enthesitis, particularly if they have additional features such as inflammatory back pain, HLA-B27 positivity, or a family history of spondyloarthropathies [^36cb9b6a].

Imaging modalities, including ultrasound and MRI, are valuable for detecting and characterizing Achilles enthesitis and bursitis, as well as for identifying subclinical inflammation [^7c9d4b3a]. However, **definitive diagnosis of AS still relies on imaging evidence of sacroiliitis** or fulfillment of classification criteria, such as those developed by the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) [^c3e76ef8].

## Summary of evidence

| **Evidence source** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|
| DESIR cohort | - 38.5% of patients with recent-onset axSpA had Achilles enthesitis at baseline <br/> - 71% developed peripheral enthesitis over 5 years [^0b125296] |
| Juvenile-onset AS studies | - Achilles enthesitis is common and may precede axial symptoms [^d6ff2dd0] [^f409ffff] |
| Imaging studies | - Subclinical Achilles enthesitis and bursitis detected by MRI and ultrasound [^7c9ea912] [^f9b7e7d9] |
| Pathophysiological models | - Enthesitis-based model explains Achilles involvement in AS [^0d81a6c3] |

## Conclusion

Ankylosing spondylitis **does not typically begin in the Achilles tendon or bursa**; it usually starts with sacroiliac joint inflammation [^2b4e84c0]. However, Achilles enthesitis and bursitis can be early peripheral manifestations of AS, particularly in younger patients or those with HLA-B27 positivity [^0b125296] [^af54492f]. These peripheral features may precede or accompany axial symptoms but are not the primary site of disease initiation. Early recognition of Achilles involvement can aid in the diagnosis of AS, but definitive diagnosis still requires imaging evidence of sacroiliitis or fulfillment of classification criteria [^b5fc5473].

Introduction

The term spondyloarthritis (SpA) covers non-radiographic axial SpA (nr-axSpA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and peripheral spondyloarthritis (pSpA). The SpAs are characterised by inflammatory and structural changes in the axial skeleton and in peripheral joints and entheses. Enthesopathy of the lower limbs and especially of the heels is a typical feature of SpA, which is predominant in pSpA, while nr-axSpA and AS mainly affect the axial skeleton. Clinical assessment of peripheral symptoms, including peripheral enthesitis, is included in the core set of the Assessment of SpA international Society (ASAS)for evaluation of SpA disease controlling and treatment. The term enthesitis is commonly used for referring to inflammatory entheseal involvement and is included in the overall term of enthesopathies, together with the occurrence of tendon or ligament pathology detected as loss of normal echostructure and/or thickening, as described in a consensus definition of the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials Ultrasound Group. In daily practice, patient's complaints and clinical investigation are the features that most physicians will rely on for decision-making with respect to individual treatment of patients with enthesopathy. Due to the increasing availability and knowledge about the use of imaging procedures in the last decade, imaging techniques such as ultrasound (US)including power Doppler (PD) USand MRIare playing and increasing role in the assessment of axial and peripheral symptoms in patients with SpA. Scoring systems for the evaluation and quantification of enthesitic lesions especially in the lower limbs have been introduced.

However, and despite these efforts, imaging has an essential role in the new SpA classification criteria for axialbut not for peripheralmanifestations. This is largely due to limited knowledge about the value of imaging to detect peripheral arthritis and enthesitis in SpA and also about its ability to differentiate SpA from other rheumatic or non-rheumatic conditions (non-SpA).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of imaging procedures commonly used in daily practice for the differential diagnosis of patients with peripheral involvement of the lower limbs in pSpA versus non-SpA, with a primary hypothesis that the two conditions can be differentiated. In addition, the influence of imaging on treatment decision in those patients was evaluated.

Impact of imaging on the patient's treatment

After evaluation of US/PD and MRI, a change of medication based on the imaging findings (while the examining physician was still blinded for diagnosis) was decided in an additional 4/30 patients (additional 13.3%) in the SpA group, as compared with the decision based on clinical examination only. In all of these cases, the treatment modification was made towards a more intense anti-inflammatory treatment. In contrast, in the non-SpA group, the initial clinical decision for intensification of treatment by the clinical investigation was confirmed in only 8/17 patients (47%) after imaging, while in the remaining 9/17 patients, the clinical decision was not supported by the imaging result. As noted by the examiner, treatment modification was based on the general impression of the image, without a specific lesion having more or less impact on treatment decisions. Findings on conventional radiographs did not contribute to any change of medication in either group.

Objectives

This paper aims to assess the prevalence and relevance of the bursa-synovial lesion in spondyloarthritis (SpA).

Methods

A transversal blind and controlled two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) study of Achilles enthesis bursa in early SpA was undertaken. Clinical outcome measures were collected.

Results

Bilateral Achilles enthesis of 66 early SpA patients (34 women) and 46 control patients (23 asymptomatic healthy subjects and 23 rheumatoid arthritis [RA] patients) were analysed. Mean BASDAI, BASFI and BASRI-spine were 4.55 ± 2.08, 2.16 ± 1.95 and 0.65 ± 0.77, respectively. Mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 10.93 ± 12.35 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP) was 6.46 ± 10.09 mg/l. The κ-values for intra-reader agreement for 2D and 3D images and bursa measurement were 0.82 and 0.98, respectively. Bursas were visualised in 89/132 SpA enthesis (67.4%) vs. 27/46 enthesis (58.7%) of healthy controls (p < 0.01), and 10/46 enthesis (21.7%) of RA controls (p < 0.01). When the thicknesses of the bursas were analysed, the SpA group had a mean of 1.52 ± 1.47 mm versus 0.76 ± 0.76 mm in the healthy control group (p < 0.0001), and 0.38 ± 0.62 mm in the RA control group (p < 0.0001). A positive likelihood ratio of 4.6 with a cut-off point of bursa > 2 was found. No Doppler signal was detected in controls, but 6.6% of SpA Achilles enthesis had Doppler bursitis. Heel pain was more frequent when bursa was present (p < 0.05). When Doppler was present, male predominance, HLA B27 positive, heel pain, and higher number of swollen joints, CRP levels, disease activity by the patient and BASDAI questions 2 and 3 achieved statistical significance (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

The presence of bursa and Doppler signal at retrocalcaneal bursa level could have a relevant contribution to differentiate SpA patients, and were correlated with clinical outcomes of SpA disease activity.

Imaging findings

In the analysis on a basis per lesion, significant differences between patients with pSpA and those with no SpA were found for bone erosions at the insertion of the Achilles' tendon as assessed by US, with 59.5% lesions found in patients with pSpA versus 26.5% lesions found in non-SpA patients (P = 0.008). After adjusting for symptom duration, this difference remained significant (P = 0.041). In contrast, other comparisons including erosions of the Achilles' tendon as assessed by MRI or inflammatory changes in and around tendons as assessed by both imaging techniques did not show any difference between pSpA and non-SpA. Findings on conventional radiographs could not differentiate between diagnoses at any of the painful sites. Detailed data of all lesions as detected by the different imaging techniques are shown in table 2A, B. An overview about the prevalence of chronic and inflammatory lesions on both US/PD and MRI is shown in figures 1–3.

In the analysis on the prevalence of lesions on a per patient basis, similar results were found, with 62.5% patients with pSpA versus 28.6% non-SpA showing bone erosions at the insertion of the Achilles' tendon (P = 0.036) as assessed by US/PD, while all the other analyses revealed no statistically significant differences between the two groups.

### Chronic but not inflammatory changes at the achilles' tendon differentiate patients with peripheral spondyloarthritis from other diagnoses-results from a prospective clinical trial [^006e813f]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical evaluation

Of the 30 patients with pSpA, 17 (56.7%) reported heel symptoms only, 6 (20%) reported knee symptoms only and 7 (23.3%) reported symptoms in at least one heel and at least one knee. In comparison, of the 30 patients with non-SpA, 14 (46.7%) reported heel symptoms only, 8 (26.7%) reported knee symptoms only and another 8 (26.7%) reported symptoms in at least one heel and at least one knee.

Of the 105 entheses, 37 heels and 13 knees were assessed in patients with pSpA and 34 heels and 21 knees were assessed in patients with non-SpA.

No single findings in the clinical assessment were able to differentiate between pSpA and non-SpA, but there was a numerical trend towards lower scores in patients' global assessment in patients with pSpA (5.6 ± 1.6) versus non-SpA (6.5 ± 2.5), which was similar also in the physicians' global assessment (table 1).

After the clinical evaluation, a modification of the current treatment for enthesitic pain was proposed in 14/30 (46.7%) patients with pSpA and in 17/30 (56.7%) non-SpA patients (P = 0.53).

### Chronic but not inflammatory changes at the achilles' tendon differentiate patients with peripheral spondyloarthritis from other diagnoses-results from a prospective clinical trial [^657c195d]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

After fulfilling the inform consent, all patients were sent to the Rheumazentrum Ruhrgebiet where they were examined clinically by another experienced rheumatologist ('examiner') for assessment of pain in the sites that were previously reported to be painful. This examination was performed within 2 working days after the examination of the recruiting rheumatologist. The 'examiner' was blinded for the patient's diagnosis throughout the study. In case of more than one painful heel or knee per patient, all painful heels or knees of the same patient were assessed by the examiner. Non-painful areas were not examined by the 'examiner' and not included in the study. At the time of presentation to the 'examiner', also patient's pain level and physician's judgement of impairment due to enthesitic pain on a 0–10 Numeric Rating Scale in the symptomatic sites were recorded.

### Chronic but not inflammatory changes at the achilles' tendon differentiate patients with peripheral spondyloarthritis from other diagnoses-results from a prospective clinical trial [^afa2d713]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

For patients with pSpA, disease activity (Bath AS Disease Activity Index) and function (Bath AS Functional index), AS Disease Activity Scoreand the AS Quality of Life Questionnairewere assessed but were not shown to the 'examiner' and were entered in the electronic data analysis sheet at the end of the study. In addition, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) intake of all patients was calculated according to recently proposed ASAS indexand documented in the same manner as for the patient's reported outcomes described above.

After clinical examination of the enthesitic pain (performed without knowledge of the patient's diagnosis), the 'examiner' set a decision on the possible further treatment (eg, analgesics only, local corticosteroid injection, non-steroidal antirheumatic drugs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)) of each patient based on his clinical findings and diagnostic assumption only and recorded this decision. Thereafter, on the same day, a conventional radiograph and US/PD of all painful sites was performed by the 'examiner'. MRI examinations of the same sites were also performed either on the same day or during the following day (without change of medication prior to performance of MRI) and were evaluated also by the 'examiner'. Documentation of the US/PD and MRI findings was performed by a standardised scoring sheet that included all possible imaging findings for inflammatory and chronic lesions (see the Evaluation of imaging section and also the description of the lesions in table 2). After performance and evaluation of all imaging procedures, the 'examiner' took the imaging results into consideration and re-evaluated his initial treatment decision. Changes in this decision were documented for more intensive versus equal versus less intensive treatment. The examiner also noted the imaging findings that lead to the decision of adjustment of treatment.

Imaging protocols

Conventional radiographs were performed using the sagittal view for the heel and both the sagittal and the anteroposterior view for the knee.

US/PD examinations were performed with the patients lying prone and their feet hanging relaxed over the edge of the examination table.

MRI examinations were performed in T1-sequences before and after injection of contrast agent (gadolinium), with a slice thickness of 3–4 mm and sagittal, coronal and axial slice orientation, according to the standard protocol of our hospital.

### Chronic but not inflammatory changes at the achilles' tendon differentiate patients with peripheral spondyloarthritis from other diagnoses-results from a prospective clinical trial [^8984b9d3]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

As mentioned above, we did not identify any significant differences in the prevalence of other US/PD and MRI findings and no major differences between these techniques. This is different from what has been reported in other studies, where both focal thickening and very early calcification foci in the tendon of the heel or knee area could be more frequently detected by grey-scale US than by MRI. With respect to conventional radiographs, it may have been expected that erosive changes in heels and knees should have been more frequently detected. However, probably also due to the young age of the patients, this was not the case here.

Another interesting finding of our study is the different impact of the clinical examination and the imaging results on the physician's treatment decisions in patients presenting with entheseal pain of the lower limbs. Based on clinical examination, there was only a slight difference in the proportion of patients with pSpA (47%) versus non-SpA (57%) in whom the blinded physician failed the decision of treatment modification. However, after inclusion of imaging, this decision changed the result only in patients with pSpA (additional 13%), while in the non-SpA group, the clinical decision of treatment modification could not be confirmed based on imaging. Interestingly, none of the lesions (neither inflammatory nor structural) assessed was found to be primarily responsible for these decisions, but it was rather the overall impression of the MRI and US/PD examination that drove this decision, while conventional radiographs were not considered to be helpful. In contrast to the inability in differentiation between diagnoses, these findings confirm an important role of US/PD and MRI for decision-making in daily clinical rheumatology practice in patients with SpA in general and with pSpA in particular. Furthermore, and since imaging in pSpA leads to an increase in the proportion of patients needing more intensive treatment, our findings confirm the knowledge that clinical examination underestimates (the frequently silent) enthesitic involvement, as compared with findings obtained by imaging.

Discussion

This study is the first to examine and compare clinical findings of patients with peripheral SpA and controls who both had heel and/or knee pain with the results of established imaging techniques such as conventional radiographs, US/PD and MRI. In addition, the influence of imaging on clinical decision-making for treatment was analysed in a daily practice setting.

The most interesting finding of this study is that it was rather the erosive changes at the heel enthesis and not the active inflammatory changes that were more frequent in patients with pSpA. This is in contrast to the landmark paper of McGonagle et al who reported enthesitis to be the main differentiating factor in patients with symptomatic knee arthritis with rheumatoid arthritis versus SpA (mostly PsA). Since the patients participating in the present study were included only with apparent clinical symptoms, we think that it fits to the imaging finding that there was a significant difference in the mean age between the groups and this, although the patients were all included based on their current age < 45 years. However, formal proof of that will have to include a reinvestigation of the patients after some time to confirm the higher prevalence of chronic, postinflammatory changes in patients with pSpA compared with other diseases with similar symptoms and pathology. Our observation and the associated hypothesis may imply that, in patients with pSpA with an entheseal affection of the lower limbs, structural changes at these sites occur more frequently and probably earlier than in other diseases, which would also explain the longer symptom duration. However, we think that, if confirmed in other studies, our findings may become clinically even more important, since they indicate that, in patients, the item 'enthesitis', which is important in the ASAS classification criteria, may have to be reversed to 'enthesopathy confirmed by imaging'.

### Pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis [^eb826ff1]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The hallmark of ankylosing spondylitis is acute and chronic spinal inflammation initiating in the sacroiliac joints, often coupled with enthesitis, presenting as chronic inflammation at the sites of ligamentous and tendinous insertions into bone. Peripheral joint synovitis can be a prominent feature as well. Reactive arthritis is a sterile synovitis arising after an extra-articular infection of enteric or urogenital tracts. HLA-B27 has been known for about the past 30 years to be associated with ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis, but the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis is still not well defined. Although the clinical manifestations of ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis may differ, this update discusses the two diseases together and focuses on recent evidence in both.

Recent Findings

With respect to HLA-B27 several recent studies address arthritogenic peptides, molecular mimicry, and aberrant forms of B27. Several candidate genes in addition to B27 have been implicated in recent genetic studies. With respect to bacterial infection, recent findings in bacterial antigenicity, host response through interactions of antigen-presenting cells, T cells, and cytokines are providing new understanding of host-pathogen interactions and the pathogenesis of arthritis. Endogenous host factors such as proteoglycans may play a role as autoantigens and contribute to chronic inflammation on that basis.

Summary

Recent advances provide additional new insights into distinct pathogenetic mechanisms in AS and ReA that arise from a complex interplay between genetic factors including HLA-B27 and environmental factors.

Methods

All patients gave informed consent for participation in the study (study number: 3988–11). All patients gave written consent to participate in the study and for publication of their data as results of the study.

Patient selection and examination procedures

Patients were recruited either by their treating rheumatologists working in a private setting or by the outpatient clinic of our tertiary rheumatology hospital (Rheumazentrum Ruhrgebiet). According to the study protocol, patients were asked to participate in the study if they either visited their rheumatologist because of a painful heel or knee or if there was a finding of heel or knee pain after taking a history or at the physical examination (the sites of interest are described in table 2A, where also the imaging examinations were performed in a standardised manner). In addition, the physician had to confirm based on the clinical examination that the pain was located in the enthesis of the same sites. However, the physicians were told to not proactively provoke tenderness at these sites in order not to include patients in the study without an appropriate reason. 'Enthesitic' pain was defined as pain precisely localised at the area of the tendon insertion at the bone, which was also present or worsened by local pressure at exactly the same area. Any signs of tendinopathy differing from this definition were not taken into account. In addition, patients with swelling in the respective painful joints were also not recruited, in order to avoid painful sites due to swelling and misinterpretation of the clinical and imaging results.

All patients had to be ≤ 45 years of age at the time point of the investigation to be included in the study. Furthermore, the recruiting rheumatologist had to set the diagnosis of pSpA or non-SpA. In addition, the study protocol required that all patients with the diagnosis of pSpA had also to fulfil the classification to pSpA as described in ASAS. Even though some patients recognised with pSpA also had axial involvement, they were all classified as pSpA because their predominant symptoms were peripheral (heel or knee). Non-SpA patients could have any other rheumatological diagnosis. Exclusion criteria were a contraindication for conventional radiographs and MRI examinations, the primary diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and any previous surgery in the heel or knee that was currently painful for enthesitis.

### Chronic but not inflammatory changes at the achilles' tendon differentiate patients with peripheral spondyloarthritis from other diagnoses-results from a prospective clinical trial [^db11a92f]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

This study has some limitations. First of all, we did not assess the asymptomatic sites of the patients included but concentrated only on the sites where patients claimed to be painful prior to examination and which were the reasons for them to visit a rheumatologist. Definitely, an analysis of the clinically not painful sites of the same patients would have been interesting for examination of so-called 'silent' lesions. However, due to the limited resources especially for MRI examinations for all tendons in all patients, this analysis was not possible in the present study, and therefore, this information was not collected. The fact that all examinations were performed by one physician could also be considered as a limitation. Nevertheless, the examining physician is an experienced person in the use and interpretation of imaging with the different techniques used here. In addition, this physician was blinded for the diagnosis of the patients during the entire period of the examinations, in order not to influence the interpretation of the images and treatment decision before and after imaging. In fact, we believe that this approach is rather an advantage, since this person could perform US/PD and evaluate imaging results also from radiographs and MRI based on the clinical complaints and his own findings after clinical examinations before the final treatment decision. This procedure excludes faults in interpretation, if secondary physicians who were not involved in clinical examination would have evaluated the images.

In conclusion, i n symptomatic patients with peripheral knee or heel involvement, the prevalence of inflammatory lesions, including enthesitis, was similar in patients classified as peripheral SpA based on the ASAS classification criteria and in those with other diagnoses. Imaging modalities such as MRI and US/PD could not differentiate between diagnoses; however, erosive changes were more frequently prevalent in patients with pSpA. Together with the higher prevalence of HLA-B27 in patients with pSpA, it seems that it is rather the chronicity than the susceptibility of the symptoms that is associated with SpA. Furthermore, imaging (US/PD and MRI) of symptomatic sites was associated with an increase in anti-inflammatory treatment in patients with pSpA but not in those with non-SpA.

Overall, these findings add to the up to now only limited knowledge about the role of imaging in patients with pSpA according to the ASAS classification criteria.

### Diagnositic value of pelvic enthesitis on MRI of the sacroiliac joints in enthesitis related arthritis [^38a9e18a]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Spondyloarthropathies (SpA) are a group of related inflammatory diseases characterized by enthesitis and arthritis. There is a strong association with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B27. The presentation of juvenile spondyloarthropathies (JSpA) differs in children and adults; most notably, spinal involvement is uncommon, while hip arthritis and enthesitis are frequently seen in juvenile-onset disease, with the calcaneal insertion, the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia, being the most commonly affected sites.

Currently, the classification of SpA in adults and children is different; using the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) system for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, most childhood SpA is classified as Enthesitis-Related Arthritis (ERA).

Entheses are sites where tendons, ligaments, capsules or fascia are attached to bone providing a mechanism for reducing stress at the bony interface. According to the concept of 'enthesis organ' and 'functional entheses', inflammatory changes in the immediate vicinity of the insertion are also considered to represent enthesitis.

Enthesitis is a primary feature of JSpA but is often difficult to diagnose clinically. Deep-seated entheses are difficult to palpate. MRI is excellent for demonstrating enthesitis, depicting not only bone marrow oedema but also soft tissue inflammation and joint effusion/bursitis, as has been shown in adult SpA patients. In patients with enthesitis-related enthesitis (ERA), it has been shown that the number of active entheses and joints at onset can predict sacroiliitis at follow-up. Assessment of entheses on pelvic MRI therefore can be of great value.

Routine MRI detects active and structural lesions of sacroiliitis via semicoronal T1 and short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences. Some pelvic entheses can also be evaluated on these sequences and on the axial sequences frequently obtained.

As in adult SpA, early diagnosis in children has become more important to alter the course of the disease. This requires early detection of inflammatory changes. Unlike adults, there is little published regarding MRI assessment of sacroiliitis and pelvic findings such as enthesitis in children.

The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and diagnostic value of pelvic enthesitis on MRI of the SI joints in enthesitis-related arthritis.

### A short-term follow-up of enthesitis and arthritis in the active phase of juvenile onset spondyloarthropathies [^f409ffff]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the characteristics of enthesitis and arthritis in the active inflammatory stage of juvenile onset spondyloarthropathies (SpA) during a short-term follow-up.

Patients and Methods

The study group included data of 33 patients with juvenile-onset SpA with enthesitis in ≥ 3 sites, arthritis in ≥ 4 joints, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of ≥ 25 mm/h despite treatment, who participated in a 26-week, double-blind, sulfasalazine versus placebo trial that showed no significant differences between groups in regard to enthesitis and arthritis.

Results

Twenty-seven boys and 6 girls (mean age: 15.3 ± 3.5 years; mean disease duration: 4.1 ± 2.7 years) with the seronegative enthesopathy and arthropathy (SEA) syndrome (n = 20) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS; n = 13) comprised the group. Throughout the study, the mean (± SD) number of swollen joints and tender entheses were 4.6 ± 2.5 and 8.3 ± 5.4. The entheses and joints most frequently involved were the calcaneal attachments of the plantar fascia (87.9%) and Achilles tendon (81.8%) and the ankle (87.9%) and knee (72.7%), respectively. There was pain in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine in 39.4%, 69.7%, and 63.6% of patients and in the sacroiliac joints in 48.5%. Mid-foot involvement (or tarsitis) occurred in 29 patients (87.9%). Except for the feet, the simultaneous occurrence of enthesitis and arthritis in other sites was rare. Overall, there were no significant differences between SEA syndrome and AS patients.

Conclusions

Disease activity shows a significant trend for entheses and joints of the feet and a significant prevalence of axial enthesitis in juvenile onset SpA. Mid-foot involvement appears to be the most characteristic and potentially, the most severe form of disease in these patients.

### Can we use enthesis ultrasound as an outcome measure of disease activity in spondyloarthritis? A study at the achilles level [^e7a8b44e]. Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the construct validity of enthesis US in the assessment of disease activity in SpA.

Methods

A longitudinal Achilles enthesis US study in patients with early SpA was undertaken. Achilles US examinations were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 months and compared with clinical outcome measures collected at the baseline visit.

Results

Bilateral Achilles enthesis of 146 early SpA patients (68 women) were analysed. Basal mean BASFI, BASRI-spine, BASDAI and Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) were 2.44 (s.d. 2.05, range 0–8), 0.67 (s.d. 0.74, range 0–3), 4.60 (s.d. 2.07, range 0–9.5) and 2.51 (s.d. 1.16, range 0–5), respectively. The mean ESR was 15.0 mm/h (s.d. 16.99, range 0–109) and the mean CRP was 8.67 mg/l (s.d. 16.98, range 1–90). At baseline, the Achilles Doppler signal and US structure alteration were significantly associated with higher CRP and ESR levels. Patients who had very high disease activity at baseline, as assessed by the ASDAS (> 3.5), had a significantly higher Achilles total US score at baseline (P = 0.04), and ASDAS < 1.3 predicted no Doppler signal at 6 and 12 months. Overall, the Achilles total US score was significantly higher in patients with higher levels of CRP (baseline P = 0.04, 6 months P = 0.006, 12 months P = 0.03) and ESR (baseline P = 0.02, 6 months P = 0.04, 12 months P = 0.005) at baseline. The Doppler signal at the baseline visit predicted a higher total US score at 6 and 12 months.

Conclusion

Doppler US has significant associations with other commonly accepted disease activity measures, such as ESR, CRP and ASDAS, and seems to be an objective outcome measure for enthesitis.

### Clinical peripheral enthesitis in the DESIR prospective longitudinal axial spondyloarthritis cohort [^0b125296]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to describe the prevalence and characteristics of peripheral enthesitis in recent onset axial spondyloarthritis, estimate the incidence of peripheral enthesitis over time, and determine the factors associated with the presence of peripheral enthesitis.

Methods

708 patients with recent onset axial spondyloarthritis were enrolled in the DESIR cohort (prospective multi-centre, longitudinal). Data regarding the patients and spondyloarthritis characteristics at baseline with a specific focus on enthesitis and occurrence of peripheral enthesitis were collected during the five years of follow-up.

Results

At inclusion, 395 patients (55.8%) reported peripheral enthesitis. The locations were mainly the plantar fascia (53.7%) and the Achilles tendon (38.5%). During the 5-year follow-up period, 109 additional patients developed peripheral enthesitis resulting in an estimated (Kaplan-Meier method) percentage of 71% (95% CI: 68–75). Variables associated with peripheral enthesitis in the univariate analysis were: older age, male gender, absence of HLA B27, MRI sacroiliitis and fulfilled Modified NY criteria, presence of anterior chest wall pain, peripheral arthritis, dactylitis, psoriasis, high BASDAI, BASFI, mean score ASAS-and the use of NSAIDs. Only the history of anterior chest wall pain and of peripheral arthritis were retained in the multivariate analysis (odds ratio (OR) = 1.6 [95% confidence interval [1.1–2.3], and OR = 2.1 [1.4–3.0], respectively).

Conclusions

This study highlights the high prevalence of peripheral enthesitis in recent onset axial spondyloarthritis, and suggests that in combination with peripheral arthritis, enthesitis might have an impact on the burden of the disease.

### Relationships between ultrasound enthesitis, disease activity and axial radiographic structural changes in patients with early spondyloarthritis: data from DESIR cohort [^24866cf8]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

Study population

The DESIR cohort has already been described before. Briefly, DESIR is a French prospective longitudinal cohort study monitoring 708 patients (aged between 18 and 50 years) over time with IBP suggestive of axial SpA according to the rheumatologist opinion for ≥ 3 months and < 3 years in 25 centres across France between 2007 and 2010. All patients included in the study had a collection of clinical data, blood samples, pelvis and spine plain X-rays, SIJ and spine MRI at baseline. Among these patients, 402 had also a peripheral enthesis US and were selected for the present study. The present study involved the baseline database of the DESIR cohort.

Ethics, consents and permission

The study complied with Good Clinical Practice Guidelines (: NCTO 164 8907,) and was approved by the appropriate medical ethic committee (CPP Ile-de-France III, submission number P070302). Patients gave informed consent before the start of the study including permission to publish any individual data treated anonymously.

Clinical and biological data

For the present study, demographic characteristics including age, sex, disease duration and disease activity data were analysed at the outset. The disease activity included the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score-C reactive protein (ASDAS-CRP), the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI), the Health Assessment Questionnaire for Ankylosing Spondylitis (HAQ-AS), the spondyloarthritis classification criteria including ASAS 2009, Amor criteria, European Spondylarthropathy Study Group criteriaor modified New York criteriathe HLA-B27 status and CRP levels.

Clinical enthesitis presence was assessed according to three different outcomes: 1) presence (yes/no) of an enthesis pain during the physical examination of one of the entheses that had had an US (including Achilles, lateral epicondyle, superior patellar ligament, inferior patellar ligament); 2) history of enthesis pain (yes/no) from one of the entheses that had had an US (same entheses); 3) the Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Entheses Score (MASES: 0–13). The data set locked on 30 June 2010 was used for this study.

### Does shockwave therapy lead to better pain and function than sham over 12 weeks in people with insertional achilles tendinopathy? A randomised controlled trial [^7273d5b6]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Participants aged 18 years or older with unilateral or bilateral insertional Achilles tendinopathy for more than 3 months were recruited via local clinicians (General practitioners, sports physicians, allied health clinicians) and paid social media advertising. To be diagnosed with insertional Achilles tendinopathy, participants met the following criteria: (a) pain localised to the posterior calcaneum; (b) progressive commencement of pain in this area; (c) pain within or following Achilles tendon loading activities (e.g. walking, running); and (d) absence of signs or symptoms of posterior ankle impingement or ankle joint pathologies (e.g. osteoarthritis). Ultrasound imaging was used to confirm the presence of Achilles tendon insertional pathology which could include hypoechoic areas either with or without tendon thickening or fluid inside the retrocalcaneal bursa. Participants were excluded if they had previously received radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy for any condition or had a history of Achilles tendon surgery or rupture (on the most painful side if pain was bilateral), inflammatory arthropathy (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis), neurological disorders that may affect calf function (e.g. Parkinson's disease, stroke), genetic connective tissue disorders (i.e. Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Marfan's syndrome), fluoroquinolone antibiotics use over the previous 2 years, or a serious mental health condition or other medical/social reasons (e.g. homelessness) that could impact on safety or adherence with the treatment.

Participants were recruited (from April 2021 to November 2022) via the following channels: (a) a social media that included Facebook and Instagram posts; and (b) advertisement of the trial to the researchers' large network of clinical partners.

Participants were block-randomised (computer-generated permuted blocks of 4, 6 or 8) into radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy or sham at their baseline visit. Randomisation was done by a researcher (remote to the clinic centre) who had no contact with the participants. This researcher informed the physiotherapists delivering the treatments (via text message) of the group allocation. The physiotherapists delivering the radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy or sham were not masked, but they followed a script (described below) to minimise differences in the delivery of each treatment. A separate physiotherapist who was masked to group allocation delivered exercise and education to both groups and administered the outcome measures. Participants were masked for group allocation.

### Progress in our understanding of the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis [^204e64d9]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

AS is a common chronic immune-mediated disease characterized by inflammation of the axial skeleton, with early involvement of the SI joints. In AS inflammation likely originates at the tendon–bone interface (an example of enthesitis), leading to erosion and bone proliferation through mechanisms that are poorly understood. Extra-articular manifestations are common, with uveitis among the most frequent, as well as co-occurrence of psoriasis and IBD, which indicates a shared genetic predisposition for these conditions.

This review delineates our current understanding of the pathogenesis of AS. We summarize recent genetic and immunologic literature and argue that SpA constitutes a type 17 immune-driven disease. SpA lies, together with psoriasis and IBD, on the spectrum of immune-mediated diseases between autoimmunity and autoinflammation. Here, we argue that these diseases likely share many pathogenic features.

### Profile of HLA-B27-positive enthesitis / spondylitis-related arthritis in Senegal, west Africa [^81c50610]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

This retrospective cohort study was carried out at the rheumatology department of Aristide Le Dantec Hospital in Dakar, from January 2012 to December 2022. All patients who fulfilled the 2019 PRINTO preliminary criteria of enthesitis/spondylitis-related JIA: arthritis for ≥ 6 weeks, enthesitis, inflammatory back pain > 3 months, sacroiliac joint tenderness, anterior uveitis, history of a SpA in relative, positive HLA-B27, with age of onset under 18 years were enrolled in the study. Exclusion criteria were systemic JIA, juvenile psoriasis arthritis, RF-positive JIA (childhood-onset rheumatoid arthritis), acute rheumatic fever, and post-infectious arthritis. The following data were collected:

Age at symptom onset and at diagnosis (presentation), duration of symptoms (defined as the delay between symptom onset and presentation at rheumatology department), sex (female, male) and ethnicity.
Clinical features: arthritis (defined as swelling within a joint or limitation in the range of joint movement with joint pain or tenderness), enthesitis (defined as tenderness on palpation of entheseal sites; Heel enthesitis is defined as past or present spontaneous pain or tenderness at the examination of the site of the insertion of the Achilles tendon or plantar fascia at the calcaneus), Sacroiliac tenderness (defined as tenderness on palpation of the SI joints and/or pain on SI manoeuvres) and Uveitis (defined as past or present uveitis anterior, confirmed by an ophthalmologist).
Laboratory investigations: positive HLA-B27, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, first hour; raised if > 20 mm/hour), C-reactive protein (CRP; positive if > 6 mg/l).
Imaging investigations: radiographs and/or computed tomography of sacroiliac Joints. Sacroiliitis is defined as the presence of erosions and/or sclerosis in accordance with the modified New York criteria (at least grade 2 bilateral or grade 3 unilateral). In our context MRI was unavailable.
Disease activity was assessed by: Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS by ESR or CRP, ASDAS ≥ 2.1 defined as active disease), and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI ≥ 4/10 defined as active disease).
Physical function at diagnosis was assessed using the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI ≥ 4/10 is defined as high disability).
Treatment options were noted: conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs): methotrexate, sulfasalazine. Corticoids (intra-articular injections). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Follow-up: after initiation of treatment, we follow up patients for six months. Disease activity and physical function were assessed after this period of therapy using the BASDAI and BASFI.

### Chronic but not inflammatory changes at the achilles' tendon differentiate patients with peripheral spondyloarthritis from other diagnoses-results from a prospective clinical trial [^b3761d29]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Evaluation of imaging

All images were evaluated by the examiner, who is an experienced reader for interpretation of conventional radiographs and MRIs.

Conventional radiographs were evaluated for any pathological findings at the clinically painful sites.

Assessment of enthesitic pain by US/PD and MRI included the following sites, based on the features collected as proposed in different US scoring systems for enthesitis in SpAand using the definitions of(used similarly for both US/PD and MRI):

Inflammatory changes

Intratendinous or peritendinous inflammatory signal.

Bone marrow oedema at the painful sites (MRI examinations only).

Chronic changes

Thickness of the painful tendon at the area of clinical enthesitic symptoms. For patients with heel pain, the thickness of the Achilles' tendon and plantar fascia was measured, while for patients with knee pain, the thickness of the quadriceps tendon at the upper and the lower patellar pole and at the tibial tuberosity was measured.

Normal versus pathological finding of fibrous structure including rupture of the painful tendon.

Bone erosion (defined as cortical disruption and loss of continuity) or calcification/enthesophyte formation at the site of examination.

In cases where not only sole chronic or only sole inflammatory findings but a combination of different chronic or different inflammatory findings was found (eg, combination of erosions and calcification and/or osteophytes in the calcaneus), this was considered as one chronic finding. Similarly, the combination of intratendinous and/or peritendinous inflammatory involvement and bone marrow oedema (on MRI) was considered as one inflammatory finding. In case of coexisting inflammatory and chronic changes, both changes were recorded separately for chronic and for inflammatory changes.

Statistical analysis

Comparisons of imaging findings were performed on patient basis but also based on single enthesitic sites. Continuous data are presented in a descriptive manner, and binary data (presence of a lesion yes/no) are presented as proportion of patients or sites being positive or negative. Comparisons of the baseline characteristics between both diagnoses were made by Mann-Whitney U test. Since from all baseline characteristics the duration of enthesitic symptoms, gender distribution and human leucocyte antigen (HLA) B27 status were found to be different between groups, comparison of the imaging findings was performed by univariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for these parameters. All analyses were performed using SPSS V.21.0.

### Effect of enthesitis on 1505 Brazilian patients with spondyloarthritis [^abad3aeb]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the clinical effect of enthesitis in a large Brazilian cohort of patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA).

Methods

A common protocol of investigation was prospectively applied to 1505 patients with SpA in 29 centers in Brazil. Clinical and demographic variables and disease indexes were investigated. The Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score was used to investigate the enthesitis component. Ankylosing spondylitis was the most frequent disease in the group (65.4%). Others were psoriatic arthritis (18.4%), undifferentiated SpA (6.7%), reactive arthritis (3.3%), and enteropathic arthritis (3.2%).

Results

At least 1 affected enthesis was observed in 54% of the patients with SpA, with a mean of 2.12 ± 2.98 entheses affected. According to the clinical presentation, enthesitis was significantly more frequent in patients with axial + peripheral joint involvement compared to isolated axial or peripheral involvement (p < 0.001). There was a statistical association between the presence of enthesites and axial symptoms (buttock pain, cervical pain, and hip pain), and peripheral symptoms (lower limb arthritis, number of painful and swollen joints; p < 0.05). Patients with enthesitis also presented higher mean scores of Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI; p < 0.001), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (p < 0.001), and Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL; p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed that BASFI (p < 0.0001; OR 74.839), ASQoL (p = 0.0001; OR 14.645), and Achilles tendonitis (p = 0.0059; OR 7.593) were associated with work incapacity.

Conclusion

The clinical presence of enthesitis in this large cohort of patients with SpA was frequent and was associated with a significant increase in disease activity and decline in functional capacity and quality of life.

### Course of patients with juvenile spondyloarthritis during 4 years of observation, juvenile part of GESPIC [^0717ea81]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Outcome assessments

Outcome assessments are based on questionnaires for patients with juvenile SpA that were completed by physicians and patients or their parents, respectively. Peripheral arthritis was defined as a joint with swelling not due to deformity or joints with loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness. Enthesitis was assessed clinically at the iliac crest, greater trochanter, medial condyle, lateral condyle, achilles tendon and plantar fascia; additional enthesitic sites could be documented as well. Physician's global assessment of disease activity, patient's global assessment and global pain were assessed on 0–10 numerical rating scales in which higher scores indicate higher disease activity or more severe pain, respectively. The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)was applied to measure disease activity. In a post hoc analysis, we furthermore calculated the Disease Activity Score for AS (ASDAS) with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)which was developed after the start of this study. Physical function was measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI, scale 0–10)and by the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ)ranging from 0 (no disability) to 3 (very severe disability). The Questionnaire for Measuring Health-Related Quality of Life in children and adolescents (KINDL)is a German self-reported instrument. It can be analysed individually in its six dimensions (physical well-being, emotional well-being, self-esteem, family, friends and everyday functioning in school), and disease as an optional subscale, or in a total score. The KINDL ranges from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate a better quality of life.

Remission was defined based on the Wallace criteria. To consider the specific characteristics of jSpA, the criteria were modified. For inactive disease, six of the following had to be fulfilled: physician's global assessment of disease activity score of 0, no joints with peripheral arthritis, no uveitis or enthesitis, morning stiffness < 15 min, no IBP and either ESR ≤ 20 mm/hour or C reactive protein (CRP) level ≤ 5 mg/L. By definition, patients who did not fulfil these criteria had active disease. We distinguished two types of remission: clinical remission on medication (defined by inactive disease for at least 6 months on medication) and remission off medication (defined by inactive disease for at least 12 months and without any medication). Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) classification criteria were assessed.

### Spondyloarthropathies… [^449e2ef1]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

1. 1–3 Their most characteristic feature is inflammatory back pain. 4 Enthesitis, another characteristic feature, involves inflammation at sites where tendons, ligaments, or joint capsules attach to bone. Enthesitis is believed to be the primary lesion in the spondyloarthropathies, whereas synovitis is the main lesion in rheumatoid arthritis. Dactylitis, commonly termed "sausage digit, " also occurs in the spondyloarthropathies and is thought to arise from joint and tenosynovial inflammation. Reactive arthritis usually begins one to four weeks after a genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract infection. Causative organisms include Chlamydia, Ureaplasma, Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, and Campylobacter species. 19 The arthritis tends to be oligoarticular, preferentially affecting the joints of the lower extremities.

Onset is typically acute: within a few days, two to four joints become painful and swollen in an asymmetric distribution. Weight loss and temperatures of up to 38. 8°C have been recorded during the acute phase. 19 Enthesitis is common, especially in the heel. Dactylitis and inflammatory back pain also are common. Extra-articular manifestations are essential in supporting the diagnosis of reactive arthritis. Conjunctivitis is present in up to 50 percent of patients and can develop at any time during the course of the disease. This feature is reported to be more common in patients with reactive arthritis subsequent to genitourinary or Shigella infection. As in ankylosing spondylitis, uveitis most often is acute, unilateral, and recurrent. Typically, the arthritis affects the lower extremities in an asymmetric fashion. Onset usually is abrupt, and the arthritis has a migratory pattern.

The arthritis generally subsides in six to eight weeks, although recurrence is common, and 10 percent of patients develop chronic arthritis. In up to 20 percent of affected patients, IBD-associated spondyloarthropathy manifests as a spondylitis that is indistinguishable from idiopathic ankylosing spondylitis. Exacerbations of peripheral arthritis and IBD tend to coincide, whereas axial disease is independent of IBD activity.

### Very early spondyloarthritis: where the inflammation in the sacroiliac joints starts [^8b928dcf]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Involvement of the sacroiliac joints (SIJ) is a major and characteristic feature of the spondyloarthritides (SpA). In early ankylosing spondylitis and undifferentiated SpA (uSpA) sacroiliitis is the most common early clinical finding and the presumed first manifestation of the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging has proved useful for visualising inflammation in the SIJ in adults and children. Recently, initial localisation of the inflammation in the SIJ has been described in some detail, but it has not been completely defined to date — either in imaging or in histopathological studies. This is mainly owing to the lack of data in very early disease and the lack of follow up studies. Here we present a patient with early disease, which may augment our understanding of this stage of SpA.

### Ultrasound assessment of entheseal sites and anterior chest wall in ankylosing spondylitis: a cross-sectional study [^8a64a58a]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The study was designed to evaluate entheseal sites and anterior chest wall (ACW) of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) using ultrasound (US) and investigate the correlation between disease activity and US score.

Methods

This prospective cross-sectional study included 104 patients with AS and 50 control subjects. Each patient underwent US scanning of 23 entheses and 11 sites of the ACW. The US features, including hypoechogenicity, thickness, erosion, calcification, bursitis, and Doppler signal, were evaluated. Disease activity was assessed based on C reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), disease activity score-C reactive protein (ASDAS-CRP), and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI).

Results

The most commonly involved entheses on US were the Achilles tendon (AT) and quadriceps tendon (QT). The most involved site of ACW was the sternoclavicular joint (SCJ). Compared with the control group, significant differences were observed in the AS group in the rates of US enthesitis and ACW in AT (P = 0.01), SCJ (P = 0.00), and costochondral joint (CCJ) (P = 0.01). Patients with high or very high disease activity had a higher erosion score (P = 0.02). The erosion score was weakly positively associated with CRP, ESR, BASDAI, ASDAS-CRP, and ASDAS-ESR (correlation coefficient: 0.22–0.45).

Conclusions

The most commonly involved entheseal sites on US were AT and QT, while the site of ACW was SCJ. The US assessment of AS should take the ACW into account. High disease activity might indicate erosion in AS.

### Ankylosing spondylitis with bilateral symmetrical uptake in the greater trochanters on bone scan [^3c0a749a]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory bone disease that commonly affects the spine and the sacroiliac joints. Ankylosing spondylitis can also cause enthesitis, or enthesopathy, which is an inflammation at the tendinous or ligamentous insertion sites on the bones. In this study, we present the case of a 37-year-old man with ankylosing spondylitis with a unique Tc-HDP bone scan finding of symmetrical increased uptake bilaterally in the greater trochanters.

### Magnetic resonance imaging in ankylosing spondylitis [^1d5f5c86]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The past 18 months has seen considerable advances in the use of MRI for assessment of ankylosing spondylitis, to quantify active inflammation in the spine and sacroiliac joints which may not otherwise be detectable and to therefore measure change due to therapeutic interventions.

Recent Findings

Characterization of the extension and morphology of inflammation in ankylosing spondylitis is now possible with MRI techniques. A number of randomized controlled trials of anti-tumour necrosis factor agents in ankylosing spondylitis have now been published showing regression of inflammatory lesions in the spine by MRI. Furthermore, the role of MRI for the early diagnosis of spondyloarthritis has become clearer. This review discusses the techniques used, the capabilities and the shortcomings of MRI in assessing ankylosing spondylitis patients.

Summary

MRI techniques have implications for early identification and intervention in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.

Results

Study group

From January 2006 to October 2014, 143 patients with inflammatory low back pain and suspected sacroiliitis were sent for MRI of the sacroiliac joints. There were 52 (36%) boys, 91 (64%) girls, with a median age of 14.3 years (range 7–16).

Fifty-eight of 143 (40%) patients were classified to have ERA based on ILAR criteria. In Table 1, clinical data were presented for all patients, and also separately for the two groups. Of all 143 patients, 38% had arthritis, 34% enthesitis (all peripheral, most frequently Achilles tendon), 46% had sacroiliac joint tenderness, 43% complained of inflammatory low back pain, and 34% were HLA-B27 positive (23% non determined).

The diagnoses of the patients without ERA were summarized in Table 2. Five patients were considered positive for JSpA according to an expert opinion of our pediatric rheumatologists but did not fulfil the criteria. As the ILAR classification was considered the gold standard, they were classified as ERA-negative in our study. Of these 5 patients, 2 showed pelvic enthesitis as well as sacroiliitis on MRI.

### New developments in ankylosing spondylitis-status in 2021 [^0d81a6c3]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Axial SpA (axSpA) is a disease characterized by inflammation and new bone formation in the spine. According to Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) classification criteria, the disease spectrum includes two types: radiographic axial SpA, called AS, and non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA). AxSpA is relatively common among inflammatory arthritides, with a prevalence of up to 1.40%. The disease typically starts in the SI joints, but can involve any part of the spine, as well as the peripheral joints and the entheses. Enthesitis is a hallmark feature of axSpA, with entheses being well-characterized as a key target of musculoskeletal inflammation. An understanding of the enthesitis-based model in disease pathogenesis has emerged as a matter of importance in AS-associated inflammation in the last 2 decades. Mechanical stress has been suggested to be important for initiation and potentially maintenance of inflammation, a notion explaining the disease distribution in the weight-bearing areas. Nearly half of axSpA patients experience extramusculoskeletal manifestations, including anterior uveitis, psoriasis and inflammation of the terminal ileum, with all these tissues representing sites subject to biomechanical stress, sharing remarkable biomechanical properties with entheses.

This analysis also reports the proportion of patients with MASES > 0 at baseline achieving complete resolution of enthesitis (MASES = 0), and patients with SJC > 0 at baseline achieving complete resolution of peripheral arthritis (SJC = 0). The proportion of patients achieving simultaneous complete resolution of SJC and TJC is also reported. We also report resolution of heel (Achilles) enthesitis at week 52 and week 104.

Finally, association analyses were conducted to assess whether resolution of enthesitis (MASES) or peripheral arthritis (SJC) by week 104 affected clinical outcomes at week 104, including the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL) questionnaire, BASDAI Q1 and Q2, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale (FACIT-Fatigue) and total and nocturnal spinal pain. These analyses were conducted in patients with enthesitis or peripheral arthritis at baseline.

### Role of diagnostic imaging in psoriatic arthritis: how, when, and why [^87023117]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Synovitis of peripheral joint in PsA is nonspecific and its solely diagnostic value in detecting joint inflammation.

Tenosynovitis is easily identified on US examination as a hypoechoic swelling surrounding the extensor digitorum tendon with or without power Dopppler signal (Fig. 5). Flexor tenosynovitis is recognized as the major contributor to clinical dactylitis. Recently, peritendon extensor tendon inflammation has emerged as another cause of metacarpophalangeal joint swelling, demonstrating to be a specific feature of PsA, of value in the differential diagnosis with other inflammatory diseases.

Enthesitis is considered a pathophysiologically important feature of SpA and in the particular case of PsA. There are two types of entheses: fibrous and fibrocartilaginous. Fibrous enthesis are the insertions of the annulus of the disk in membranous bone of the vertebral endplates by Sharpey's fibers. Fibrocartilaginous enthesis are the connection of hyaline cartilage to endochondral or subchondral bone. Enthesitis is characterized by inflammation at sites of tendon, ligament, and joint capsule fiber insertion into bone. In 2014, a consensus based definitions for US elementary lesions for enthesitis independent of spondyloarthritis (SpA) type was developed. These elementary lesions of enthesitis included presence of enthesophytes, calcifications (Fig. 6), and erosions at the insertion site (chronic changes) and increased thickness, hypoechogenicity, and Doppler activity in the enthesis (inflammatory changes).

Recent registry and clinical trial patient sets have found enthesitis occurs in approximately 30–50% of PsA patients. Enthesitis can involve almost any part of the body, although classically it is been depicted involving the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia insertion sites. Some locations are more accessible to US examination (periknee, pelvis, shoulder, and elbow) than others. Several enthesitis scoring measures have been developed, some originally developed in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), as the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) enthesitis index. While the Leeds enthesitis index (LEI) is specifically for PsA.

Entheseal involvement in patients with psoriasis, but without clinical PsA, suggests that enthesitis may be a predictor of development of PsA. However, the prognostic value of US in PsA needs further investigation. Role of US examination in PsA includes diagnosing peripheral involvement and monitoring disease activity.

### Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis: what are the similarities and differences? [^c3e76ef8]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

The development of the axial spondyloarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis (ASAS) classification criteria has had several implications for our understanding of the entire spectrum of spondyloarthritides (SpA). Going beyond the modified New York criteria, which concentrate on conventional radiographs of the sacroiliac joints (SIJ) for the classification of ankylosing spondylitis, the ASAS criteria add active inflammation of the SIJ as obtained by MRI and human leucocyte antigen (HLA) B27 to classify patients with chronic back pain starting at a young age as axial SpA (axSpA). AxSpA should be considered as one disease that includes AS, the radiographic form, as well as the non-radiographic (nr-axSpA) form. Similarities and differences between these subgroups have been described in 3 studies: 1 local study, 1 national study (German SpA Inception Cohort) and 1 international study mainly conducted to test the efficacy of a tumour necrosis factor α blocker. Most clinical features and assessments of axSpA showed the same prevalence in patients with and without radiographic changes. However, some differences have been observed: the male:female ratio, the proportion of patients with objective signs of inflammation such as bone marrow oedema as detected by MRI, and the proportion of patients with increased levels of C reactive protein were higher in patients with AS. Importantly, these factors have also been identified as prognostic factors for more severe disease in terms of new bone formation. Thus, nr-axSpA may represent an early stage of AS but may also just be an abortive form of a disease which does cause much pain but which may also never lead to structural changes of the axial skeleton. Since the cut-off between nr-axSpA and AS is artificial and unreliable, we think that the term nr-axSpA should not be used for diagnosis but only for classification for historical reasons.

### Update on spondyloarthropathies [^27008f3e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Spondyloarthropathies are a cluster of interrelated and overlapping chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases that primarily include ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, and the arthritis associated with psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases. The primary pathologic sites are the entheses (the sites of bony insertion of ligaments and tendons); the axial skeleton, including the sacroiliac joints; the limb joints; and some nonarticular structures, such as the gut, skin, eye, and aortic valve. Although spondyloarthropathies are not associated with rheumatoid factor, they show a strong association with HLA-B27; however, this association varies markedly among various spondyloarthropathies and among ethnic groups. The most widely used classification criterion, from the European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group, encompasses the currently recognized wider disease spectrum, with a sensitivity and specificity that generally exceed 85%. Spondyloarthropathies occur in genetically predisposed persons and are triggered by environmental factors, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms of inflammation are not yet fully understood. Chlamydial and many enterobacterial infections can trigger reactive arthritis, but an infectious trigger for ankylosing spondylitis has not yet been established. HLA-B27 itself is involved in enhancing genetic susceptibility, but the underlying molecular basis is still unknown; additional genes include the putative susceptibility genes for Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, and psoriasis. A specific susceptibility gene for Crohn disease, NOD2, is located on chromosome 16q12, and one of the candidate genes for psoriasis, PSORS1, has been mapped to a 60-kb fragment on chromosome 6p, which is telomeric to the HLA-C locus. This paper reviews the efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy and other therapeutic advances.

### Patients with ankylosing spondylitis present a distinct CD8 T cell subset with osteogenic and cytotoxic potential [^66d70d11]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease belonging to the group of seronegative spondyloarthritides (SpA), which is defined by radiographic signs of destructive pathologies in the sacroiliac joints and ankyloses. AS presents a disease continuum including earlier and milder disease forms and affects up to 1% of the population worldwide, with an average onset around 20–30 years of age. The aetiology of AS is poorly understood, but genetic factors, such as the human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 gene, and environmental triggers might contribute to the development of the disease. Enthesitis, the inflammation of the entheses, located at the attachment of ligaments and tendons to bone, is a hallmark of AS. These sites are prone to mechanical stress and microdamages that, in genetically predisposed subjects, might not be resolved by tissue repair mechanisms but instead represent areas of chronic inflammation and subsequent new bone formation. The progressive remodelling at sites of spinal entheses of sacroiliac spinal joints ultimately leads to bone fusion (ankylosis). Peripheral disease manifestations (arthritis, enthesitis and dactylitis) and extra-musculoskeletal manifestations, such as anterior uveitis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease, are present to different degrees in a significant proportion of patients.

By driving local inflammation with the release of several proinflammatory cytokines, mechanical stress can contribute to new bone formation. It has been recently demonstrated that exposure to tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-17, IL-22 and IL-23 aberrantly upregulates the calcium-sensing receptor in osteoblasts, a phenotype also observed in patients with AS, and promotes osteogenic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, stimulation with low doses of TNF promotes the expression of the osteoinductive molecule Wnt in preosteoblasts. IL-1β and TNF have also been reported to upregulate other osteogenic molecules, such as bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), in mesenchymal cells. Currently available treatments, ranging from non-steroidal anti-inflammatories to TNF, IL-17 and Janus Kinase inhibitors, target the ongoing inflammation and aim to minimise symptoms.

### Sacroiliac joint radiographic progression in axial spondyloarthritis is retarded by the therapeutic use of TNF inhibitors: 12-year data from the SCQM registry [^662989d4]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

The ongoing axSpA cohort within SCQM was initiated in 2005. Inclusion criteria include a clinical diagnosis of axSpA (ankylosing spondylitis or other forms of SpA with predominantly axial disease) by a rheumatologist, irrespective of age, disease duration and treatment. The questionnaires for rheumatologists include all parameters relevant to assess spondyloarthritisand the fulfilment of the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society classification criteriaincluding prior MRI positivity, disease manifestations (presence of inflammatory back pain; presence of peripheral arthritis via a 44-joint homunculus, presence of enthesitis via a homunculus reflecting the Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Scoresites (modified to include the plantar fasciae), ever dactylitis), exact measurements for the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Mobility Index), exact start and stop dates for conventional and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other analgesics as yes/no; levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate and of haemoglobin; human leucocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27) status; smoking status; information on physical activity (number of exercise units per week). There is no information on whether NSAIDs are used on demand or continuously between visits. The patient questionnaire includes the Patient Global Assessment, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity and Functional Indices (BASDAIand BASFI, respectively), assessment of quality of life (EuroQol 5 domains; EQ-5D) and the Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire (later changed to the SF-12) on numerical rating scales. The online database automatically calculates the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS)and the patient-reported outcomes as soon as the rheumatologist and the patient fill in the respective data. The patient receives a reminder to fill in the questionnaires shortly ahead of the consultation, if the visit has been scheduled via the SCQM tool, allowing a treat-to-target treatment approach.

### MRI in ankylosing spondylitis [^3daafbf1]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The past 18 months have seen multireader validation exercises assessing the reliability and discriminatory properties of MRI, longitudinal data evaluating the prognostic significance of lesions observed on MRI, and data from clinical trials assessing the predictive capacity of MRI for major clinical response. Studies using new MRI-based technologies in ankylosing spondylitis have also been described.

Recent Findings

The reliability and discrimination of scoring systems for both sacroiliac joint and spinal inflammation using MRI are now sufficiently well validated to be used in the short-term clinical trial assessment of the anti-inflammatory efficacy of novel therapeutic agents. The finding of inflammatory lesions on MRI is also of prognostic significance for structural damage. MRI examination contributes to clinical and laboratory evaluation in the selection of patients likely to respond to antitumor necrosis factor agents. Newer MRI-based techniques such as whole-body MRI permit a broader scope of diagnostic ascertainment.

Summary

MRI continues to assume an increasingly important role in the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic assessment of patients with ankylosing spondylitis.

### Early spondyloarthritis [^1931e1be]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a large family of chronic inflammatory diseases characterized by inflammation of the axial skeleton, a typically asymmetric peripheral arthritis of the lower limbs, enthesitis, typical extra-articular manifestations, and shared genetic background. The prevalence in the general population is up to 2% for the entire group. SpA, particularly ankylosing spondylitis, has been associated with a diagnostic delay of up to 10 years. Important efforts toward shortening this delay have been made, including the development of new classification criteria. This article discusses the current concept of the disease, typical manifestations, advances in diagnosis, and current treatment recommendations.

### Spondyloarthritides [^8784a08e]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

The spondyloarthritides are a diverse group of distinct yet interrelated disease processes with overlapping clinical features. They are ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease-associated arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis. Genetically, these disease processes have been linked by the presence of HLA-B27. They manifest with axial and peripheral symptoms, such as inflammatory back pain, enthesitis, oligoarthritis, and dactylitis. The onset of symptoms can begin before the age of 45; however, because of the wide range of signs and symptoms, diagnosis can be delayed, leading to unchecked inflammation, structural damage, and later, restriction in physical mobility.

### Whole-body MRI of juvenile spondyloarthritis: protocols and pictorial review of characteristic patterns [^26601bee]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Spondyloarthritides are a group of inflammatory rheumatological diseases that cause arthritis with a predilection for spinal or sacroiliac involvement in addition to a high association with HLA-B27. Juvenile spondyloarthritis is distinct from adult spondyloarthritis and manifests more frequently as peripheral arthritis and enthesitis. Consequently juvenile spondyloarthritis is often referred to as enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) subtype under the juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) classification criteria. The American College of Rheumatology Treatment Recommendations for JIA, including ERA, are based on the following clinical parameters: current treatment, disease activity and the presence of poor prognostic features. The MRI features of juvenile spondyloarthritis include marrow edema, peri-enthesal soft-tissue swelling and edema, synovitis and joint or bursal fluid. Marrow edema is nonspecific and can be seen with other pathologies as well as in healthy subjects, and this is an important pitfall to consider. With further longitudinal study and validation, however, whole-body MRI with dedicated images of the more commonly affected areas such as the spine, sacroiliac joints, hips, knees, ankles and feet can serve as a more objective tool compared to clinical exam for early detection and monitoring of disease activity and ultimately direct therapeutic management.

### ASAS definition for sacroiliitis on MRI in SpA: applicable to children? [^17b7419f]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Juvenile spondyloarthritides (JSpA) have some overlap with adult spondyloarthritis (SpA) but also important differences. JSpA are a group of related inflammatory diseases characterized by enthesitis and arthritis with a strong association to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B27. The International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) classification of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) includes seven subtypes, in which JSpA is represented in enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and some types of undifferentiated arthritis. In contrast to adult spondyloarthritis (SpA), JSpA generally presents with peripheral arthritis and enthesitis of the lower extremities in the early years of the disease, while involvement of the sacroiliac (SI) and spinal joints typically occurs later.

### Thoughts concerning the early diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis and related diseases [^232ddcbf]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis is mainly based on a radiograph of the sacroiliac joints. Thus, this is the standard imaging test. However, in the early phase of disease, conventional radiographs are often too insensitive to show sacroiliitis. In this clinical situation, HLA B27 testing and new imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful. Early forms of AS can be initially classified as undifferentiated spondyloarthritis. All subsets of spondyloarthritides may evolve later into AS. Since AS in association with psoriasis and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases is often HLA B27-negative, this test is of limited value under these circumstances. The usefulness of testing for HLA B27 and its subtypes differs among ethnic and racial groups. The value of this test for diagnosis depends on the individual pre-test probability in each setting.

Spondyloarthritis represents a heterogeneous group of inflammatory diseases that share common genetic, clinical and radiological features. Those diseases are characterised by inflammation in the spine and in the peripheral joints. Enthesitis is considered a pathological hallmark of the spondyloarthritis group of conditions but there are also many other relevant clinical manifestations. The aim of this article is to present an overview on articular and extra-articular manifestations and comorbidities associated with spondyloarthritis.

### Update on juvenile spondyloarthritis [^d6ff2dd0]. Pediatrics in Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a blanket term encompassing entities such as enthesitis-related arthritis, nonradiographic axial SpA, and ankylosing spondylitis. These diseases share many clinical features, including a predilection for inflammation of the entheses and the sacroiliac joints. The nomenclature is based on the evolution of the classification of the disease and the age of the patient. SpA has a prevalence of approximately 1% of the population of the United States, with 10% to 20% of patients experiencing the onset during childhood. Children with onset of arthritis before age 16 years are classified as having juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Children with enthesitis and/or sacroiliitis are further classified as belonging to the enthesitis-related arthritis subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The initial manifestations can be subtle and will usually include a peripheral pattern of arthritis and enthesitis. It may take several years for axial disease to develop in children. Except for an association with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA-B27) serotype, there are no laboratory markers for the disease, and the radiographic findings are often negative. A careful clinical evaluation for evidence of inflammation in the entheses and the joints and a search for comorbidities are required. Magnetic resonance imaging facilitates the early detection of sacroiliitis, an important feature that may be clinically silent. Because recent studies indicate that earlier introduction of therapy can help achieve better outcomes, rapid identification and treatment of children with SpA is essential.

Psoriatic arthritis clinical and radiographic features — Characteristic radiographic features include joint erosions, joint space narrowing, bony proliferation including periarticular and shaft periostitis, osteolysis including "pencil in cup" deformity, acro-osteolysis, ankylosis, spur formation, and spondylitis; the presence of DIP erosive changes may provide both sensitive and specific radiographic findings to support the diagnosis of PsA. In patients with PsA, the hands tend to be involved much more frequently than the feet with a ratio of nearly 2:1, and dactylitis is common and most often affects the feet in an asymmetric distribution; dactylitis is associated with a greater degree of radiologic damage than occurs in digits not affected by dactylitis. Figure images depict dactylitis of toes and a middle finger, enthesitis of the Achilles' tendon, and a radiograph of hands.

Imaging assessment

All D2T-PsA patients underwent MSUS evaluations of 42 joints (primarily hands, wrists, knees and feet), 36 tendons (hand flexors/extensors, wrist extensors and anterior/posterior tibialis), 12 entheses (epicondyles, quadriceps tendons, patellar ligaments, Achilles tendons and plantar aponeuroses) and two bursae (Achilles bursae). The full MSUS protocol and the definitions used to define the elementary lesions are published in the supplementary material (online supplemental figure 1 and table 1).

Table 1
Characteristics of D2T-PsA patients and comparison between PIPsA and NIPsA

An experienced MSUS physician was appointed at each participating centre to perform the scans, ensuring they were conducted blinded to the patient's clinical data. The MSUS assessments were performed using a high-end ultrasound system (SAMSUNG RS85) equipped with multifrequency linear transducers and a high-frequency probe of at least 14 MHz.

The criteria used to define a site as MSUS-active were as follows: (1) synovitis was considered active if there was at least grade 2 on grey scale (GS) with grade 1 on power Doppler (PD), or if GS ≥ 1 was combined with PD ≥ 2;(2) tenosynovitis was defined by the presence of at least GS ≥ 1 and PD ≥ 1;(3) paratenonitis was identified by the combination of B-mode alteration with PD signal; and (4) enthesitis was defined by the presence of PD signal in association with entheseal thickening and/or hypoechoic areas, consistent with the OMERACT definition. The reliability was evaluated using kappa statistics (κ ≥ 0.7) to ensure substantial agreement among sonographers. The results were compared with a 'gold-standard' scorer to validate the consistency of the scoring method.

In case of suspected axial involvement (ie, combination of axial inflammatory symptomsand spine or sacroiliac tenderness detected during physical examination), MRI of the sacroiliac joints and/or spine was performed based on clinical findings. MRI findings were considered positive according to the definitions proposed by the ASAS/OMERACT MRI Study Group.

### Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis [^2b4e84c0]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on axial spondyloarthritis:

- **Definition**: axSpA is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints. It includes both non-radiographic axSpA and radiographic axSpA, the latter also referred to as ankylosing spondylitis.
- **Pathophysiology**: Ankylosing spondylitis is strongly associated with the HLA-B27 genotype, although most persons with this genotype do not develop the disease. The etiology of joint inflammation in patients with ankylosing spondylitis involves the interaction of genetic predisposition and environmental factors with alterations in immune cell function, and cytokine regulation.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the annual incidence and prevalence of ankylosing spondylitis are 3.1 cases per 100,000 person-years and 197 persons per 100,000 population, respectively.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of ankylosing spondylitis include arthritis, dactylitis, ankylosis, osteoporosis of the spine and peripheral bones, uveitis, and IBD.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Patients with ankylosing spondylitis have an increased risk of mortality, with an estimated standardized mortality ratio of 1.61. CVD is the most frequent cause of death (40%), followed by malignant (27%) and infectious (23%) diseases.

Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2012). Low credibility.

This review refers to the origin and current state of the assessment of the SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria for the classification of axial and peripheral spondyloarthritis (SpA) and the possible implications in the pediatric population. The ASAS criteria evolved from the idea that the earlier the recognition of patients with ankylosing spondylitis, the better the efficacy of tumor necrosis factor blockers. Strategies included the development of new concepts, definitions, and techniques for the study of clinical signs and symptoms. Of relevance, the new definition of inflammatory back pain (IBP) and the introduction of sacroiliitis by magnetic resonance imaging represented the most important advance in the early identification of AS in the "pre-radiographic stage" of the disease. AS is considered in this paper as a disease continuum with symptoms depending on age at onset. The application of those specific strategies in children and adolescents with SpA seems limited because the most important manifestation in the early stage of disease is not IBP, but peripheral arthritis and enthesitis. In this instance, the logical approach to juvenile onset SpA according to ASAS criteria should not be through the axial criteria but rather the peripheral set of criteria.

### Ultrasound imaging in psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis [^7c9d4b3a]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal ultrasound (US) is a reliable imaging technique which has a key role in the assessment of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). US can help in the diagnosis of the disorder, in the evaluation of the extent of the joint and enthesis involvement and in therapy monitoring because it can reflect both morphostructural changes and inflammatory activity. Several studies have reported that US revealed pathological findings at joints and enthesis in a large number of PsA patients who do not complain of active pain and/or swelling at the time of the clinical examination and in psoriasis patients with no signs of musculoskeletal disease. The application of US in the evaluation of nail and skin involvement in patients affected by psoriasis, with or without arthritis, and the imaging of sacroiliac joints is an interesting approach. US has already become commonplace in both clinical and research fields, and improvements in US technology will offer further possibilities for future research.

### Psoriatic enthesitis: an update from the GRAPPA 2013 annual meeting [^defebaa1]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

The enthesis, attachment site of ligaments, tendons, and joint capsules to bone, has emerged as a complex structure or entheseal organ that dissipates stress to maintain homeostasis. Entheses are also anatomically and functionally integrated with adjacent bursa, fibrocartilage, and synovium in a synovial entheseal complex that may trigger inflammation in response to biomechanical stress. Recent studies have suggested that inflammation in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) arises in the enthesis based on imaging and anatomical data. In this review, the anatomy of the enthesis from a functional perspective is discussed, and the data that support a central role for enthesitis in PsA are outlined. In addition, new animal models that implicate Th17 and tumor necrosis factor pathways in enthesitis are highlighted along with new data that question the primacy of the enthesis in the early stages of PsA. Finally, future studies that incorporate new technologies are outlined. Those studies may address the contribution of entheseal inflammation to initiation and perpetuation of key pathophysiologic pathways in the psoriatic joint.

### Comparison of the heel enthesitis MRI scoring system (HEMRIS) with clinical enthesitis and local metabolic activity on PET-CT [^f9b7e7d9]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Recently, the HEMRIS was introduced as scoring system for use in clinical trials in spondyloarthritis and as a tool for assessment of enthesitis using MRI in clinical practice. As data on the new system are limited we compared HEMRIS outcomes with clinical, laboratory and PET/CT findings in patients prone to develop enthesitis. Subclinical MRI lesions (HEMRIS cut-off value: ≥ 1) were frequently observed and even a higher cut-off value of ≥ 2 still yielded a high prevalence of subclinical HEMRIS lesions. In case of clinical enthesitis, higher structural damage scores were observed at the Achilles tendon. There was a weak, but significant correlation between the structural and total HEMRIS scores at the Achilles tendon and metabolic activity on PET/CT. In patients with Pso, all without clinical evidence of involvement of the entheses, subclinical MRI lesions occurred in 65% of Achilles tendons and 35% of plantar fascias.

An interesting observation in our study is that we frequently detected subclinical inflammatory and structural MRI lesions at the plantar fascia and Achilles tendon. The literature on this is limited, but our finding is consistent with that of Poggenborg et al, who acquired whole-body MRIs in 18 PsA patients, 18 AS patients and 12 healthy controls and compared MRI-findings with clinical examination. The agreement of whole-body MRI and clinical assessment of enthesitis varied from 49 to 100% per anatomic location. Subclinical enthesitis was most frequently detected at the greater trochanter, Achilles tendons and ischial tuberosity. It was hypothesised that this could be due to high mechanical stress in these anatomical locations. The clinical significance of subclinical MRI findings at the enthesis in PsA and AS patients remains to be determined. Enthesopathy may be observed in asymptomatic persons without rheumatological conditions as a result of mechanical overload, degeneration, endocrine disease, trauma or as an adverse-effect to certain medications. Evaluation of a group of healthy volunteers with detailed information on BMI, endocrinological conditions, and exposure to mechanical stress (eg, sports) remains to be performed to define 'normal degeneration'. To evaluate whether HEMRIS can predict future development of synovitis or erosions, we aim to follow our study participants for a period of two years to better examine the clinical relevance of the results.

### Topography of entheseal lesions on ultrasound: a comparative study between axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and healthy controls [^fb740191]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study provides important preliminary information about the performance of the various sonographic entheseal sites in both axSpA and PsA. Employing different analytical models, we found that four entheseal sites (ie, lateral epicondyle, distal patellar ligament insertion, AT and PF) could effectively distinguish between SpA patients (both axSpA and PsA) and controls. These four sites have also been identified as being significant in other studies.

Erosions demonstrated a significant association with a diagnosis of SpA, but only when their presence was evaluated in the four significant sites (LE, TT, AT and PF), which was not the case when this was evaluated across all nine examined sites. This emphasises that both the presence of these elementary lesions and their specific anatomical locations play a crucial role in the evaluation of the US examination of the entheses. One of our key objectives was to evaluate the importance of both the OMERACT and GRAPPA definitions of PD enthesitis. While both are significantly associated with a diagnosis of SpA in our univariable analyses, only the 0–2 mm PD zone appears as an important predictor for a diagnosis of SpA in the LASSO model. However, both PD definitions showed no significance in the multivariable models. We found that 2–5 mm PD was significantly associated with CRP and BASFI in both univariable and multivariable regression, suggesting that it could potentially be associated with systemic inflammation and a more severe SpA disease profile. The consistent association of bursitis with functional indices suggests its contribution to physical impairment. These findings support the concept that evaluation of the enthesis should also extend beyond this 2 mm cut-off from the cortical bone, which is in accordance with the concept of the 'enthesis organ' or the 'synovio-entheseal complex'. Other studies demonstrated that active PsA patients showed not only PD at the enthesis junction (≤ 2 mm), but also in nearby bursae and the zone immediately beyond 2 mm from the cortex, similar to our findings. Additionally, MRI findings support this view, since SpA patients who present clinically with heel enthesitis frequently demonstrate local tendonitis and bursitis. Given these findings, we suggest that both concepts are useful in detecting enthesitis, and while the 2 mm cut-off is probably more specific for the diagnosis of SpA, the presence of PD beyond this cut-off suggests higher disease activity and functional impairment.

### MR imaging features of foot involvement in ankylosing spondylitis [^72df35f4]. European Journal of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine alterations of the soft tissue, tendon, cartilage, joint space, and bone of the foot using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients.

Materials and Method

Clinical and MR examination of the foot was performed in 23 AS patients (46 feet). Ten asymptomatic volunteers (20 feet) were studied on MR imaging, as a control group. MR imaging protocol included; T1-weighted spin-echo, T2-weighted fast-field echo (FFE) and fat-suppressed short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences in sagittal, sagittal oblique, and coronal planes using a head coil. Specifically, we examined: bone erosions, tendinitis (acute and chronic), para-articular enthesophyte, joint effusion, plantar fasciitis, joint space narrowing, soft tissue edema, bone marrow edema, enthesopathy in the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia attachment, subchondral signal intensity abnormalities (edema and sclerosis), tenosynovitis, retrocalcaneal bursitis, subchondral cysts, subchondral fissures, and bony ankylosis. Midfoot, hindfoot, and ankle were included in examined anatomic regions.

Results

Clinical signs and symptoms (pain and swelling) due to foot involvement were present in 3 (13%) of the patients while frequency of involvement was 21 (91%) with MR imaging assessment. The MR imaging findings were bone erosions (65%), Achilles tendinitis (acute and chronic) (61%), para-articular enthesophyte (48%), joint effusion (43%), plantar fasciitis (40%), joint space narrowing (40%), subchondral sclerosis (35%), soft tissue edema (30%), bone marrow edema (30%), enthesopathy of the Achilles attachment (30%), subchondral edema (26%), enthesopathy in the plantar fascia attachment (22%), retrocalcaneal bursitis (22%), subchondral cysts (17%), subchondral fissures (17%), tendinitis and enthesopathy of the plantar ligament (13%), and bony ankylosis (9%). The most common involved anatomical region was the hindfoot (83%) following by midfoot (69%) and ankle (22%).

Conclusion

In our experience, MR imaging may detect inflammatory and/or erosive bone, soft tissue, cartilage, tendon, and joint abnormalities in AS patients, even if AS patients did not have clinical signs and symptoms of foot involvement. If these data prove to be confirmed in further MR studies, MR imaging may be of importance especially in early diagnosis of inflammatory changes in the foot.

### Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis: what are the similarities and differences? [^6281fe3d]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The term spondyloarthritis (SpA) covers a partly heterogeneous group of rheumatic diseases with the prototypes ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and forms of psoriatic arthritis. Patients with SpA are genetically linked. They may present with characteristic clinical features such as inflammatory back pain (IBP), with peripheral symptoms such as enthesitis or arthritis, and with extra-articular manifestations such as anterior uveitis, psoriasis and chronic inflammatory bowel disease. The majority of patients diagnosed as axial SpA (axSpA) also show objective signs of inflammation on imaging such as sacroiliitis and spondylitisor on laboratory examinations such as C reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Furthermore, many patients, especially those who are positive for human leucocyte antigen (HLA) B27, have a positive family history of SpA or related diseases.

The concept of spondyloarthritis had already been recognised decades ago by Moll and Wright, and classification of patients as having AS has relied on the modified New York criteria, in which conventional radiographs of the sacroiliac joints showing more or less definite structural changes was most critical. Thereafter, another two sets of criteriahave been published which aimed to classify patients presenting with axial and peripheral symptoms, even without the presence of radiographic damage in the sacroiliac joints.

The era of MRI, which started 20 years ago, has contributed to a better assessment of patients with early disease stages of axSpA. The publication of new classification criteria for axSpA, which also include, in addition to conventional radiographs showing structural changes, positive findings obtained by MRI of the sacroiliac joints showing inflammation, and HLA-B27 as an entry criterion, has broadened the spectrum of SpA. This development has initiated clinical research comparing the two axSpA subgroups, non-radiographic (nr-axSpA) and radiographic (AS) axSpA. However, in daily practice, this distinction has not been considered useful with respect to the diagnosis of the patients.

The aim of this overview is to describe and discuss the similarities and differences between the two axSpA subgroups, mainly taking into account data published in three studies that have investigated cohorts from different origins: one local study, one national study (German SpA Inception Cohort (GESPIC)), where additional information on patients with radiographic axSpA with shorter (≤ 5 years) and longer (> 5 years) disease duration was also provided, and one international study that was mainly conducted to prove the efficacy of a new type of tumour necrosis factor α blocker.

### Comparison of the heel enthesitis MRI scoring system (HEMRIS) with clinical enthesitis and local metabolic activity on PET-CT [^7c9ea912]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the Heel Enthesitis MRI Scoring model (HEMRIS) with clinical and PET/CT outcomes in patients with cutaneous psoriasis (Pso), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

Methods

This prospective, observational study included 38 patients with Pso, PsA and AS. Patients were included regardless of presence or absence of clinical heel enthesitis. MRI-scans of both ankles and a whole-body 18 F-FDG PET/CT were acquired. MRIs were assessed for enthesitis by two independent and blinded observers according to the HEMRIS. A physician, blinded for imaging results, performed clinical evaluations of enthesitis at the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia.

Results

In total, 146 entheses were scored according to the HEMRIS and clinically assessed for enthesitis (6 entheses were clinically affected). In Achilles tendons with clinical enthesitis, the HEMRIS structural damage score was significantly higher, compared to Achilles tendons without clinical enthesitis (respective median scores 1.0 and 0.5; p = 0.04). In clinically unaffected entheses, HEMRIS abnormalities occurred in 44/70 (63%) of Achilles tendons and in 23/70 (33%) of plantar fascia. At the Achilles tendon, local metabolic activity measured on PET/CT was weakly associated with the structural (r s = 0.25, p = 0.03) and total HEMRIS (r s = 0.26, p = 0.03).

Conclusion

This study revealed a high prevalence of subclinical HEMRIS abnormalities and discrepancy between HEMRIS and clinical and PET/CT findings. This may suggest that the HEMRIS is a sensitive method for detection of inflammatory and structural disease of enthesitis at the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia, although the clinical significance of these MRI findings remains to be determined in longitudinal studies.

### Naproxen (naproxen sodium) [^23163152]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Studies

General Information

Naproxen has been studied in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, juvenile arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, tendonitis and bursitis, and acute gout. Improvement in patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis was demonstrated by a reduction in joint swelling, a reduction in duration of morning stiffness, a reduction in disease activity as assessed by both the investigator and patient, and by increased mobility as demonstrated by a reduction in walking time. Generally, response to naproxen has not been found to be dependent on age, sex, severity or duration of rheumatoid arthritis.

In patients with osteoarthritis, the therapeutic action of naproxen has been shown by a reduction in joint pain or tenderness, an increase in range of motion in knee joints, increased mobility as demonstrated by a reduction in walking time, and improvement in capacity to perform activities of daily living impaired by the disease.

In a clinical trial comparing standard formulations of naproxen 375 mg bid (750 mg a day) vs 750 mg bid (1500 mg/day), 9 patients in the 750 mg group terminated prematurely because of adverse events. Nineteen patients in the 1500 mg group terminated prematurely because of adverse events. Most of these adverse events were gastrointestinal events.

In clinical studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and juvenile arthritis, naproxen has been shown to be comparable to aspirin and indomethacin in controlling the

A 58-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of arthralgia and bilateral temporal region pain, and a 1-month history of fever. He had had refractory neck pain since his 20s. Reduced cervical and lumbar mobility was observed. Radiographs of cervical and thoracic vertebrae disclosed syndesmophytes. Pelvic radiographs showed sclerosis in the right sacroiliac joint and ankylosis in the left sacroiliac joint. MRI with contrast enhancement showed enthesitis in the upper extremities and enhancement in the bilateral temporal muscle, which indicated enthesitis of temporal muscle. He was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis based on the limitation in mobility of the lumbar spine and radiographic findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing enthesitis of the temporal muscle. This case highlights that ankylosing spondylitis can be accompanied with enthesitis at the temporal muscle and fever of unknown origin at the initial presentation.

### Same, same or different? Commonalities and differences between spondyloarthritis and its subsets of axial and peripheral spondyloarthritis with psoriatic arthritis and its diverse phenotypes [^91a7d152]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Medicine is constantly changing and evolving, and rheumatology in particular is a specialty in which diseases that were unknown a few decades ago can now be correctly identified and successfully treated with targeted therapies. Furthermore, exactly these advances regularly confront us with the challenging decision of whether similar diseases should be rather 'lumped' together under one umbrella term to group them, or if they should be 'split' into smaller, differentiated, most specific subclasses. This remains a topic of ongoing discussion and debate, with valid arguments for both positions. Regarding spondyloarthritis (SpA), this debate has currently gained momentum again.

Under the umbrella term of SpA different diseases with similar clinical presentations — that can be divided according to the leading clinical symptom into axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and peripheral spondyloarthritis (perSpA) — are subsumed. These entities can be further divided according to the radiographic evaluation of the sacroiliac joints into non-radiographic axSpA and radiographic axial SpA (r-axSpA, formerly known as ankylosing spondylitis (AS)) for axSpA. While the (sub-)group of perSpA can be further differentiated according to the clinical presentation and/or extramusculoskeletal manifestations of the SpA into psoriatic arthritis (PsA), reactive arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease-related SpA. It is utterly important to highlight, that between these phenotypes significant overlaps are commonly apparent.

Additionally, the fact that first the clinical diagnosis (of SpA) — that is strongly influenced by the education from peers and local standards of care — needs to be established and only after that classification criteria for specific diseases (to create a as homogenise group of patients as possible) should be applied, is still important to mention. These classification criteria are widely accepted and used in clinical trials for axSpA (Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria for axial SpA)and PsA (ClASsification criteria for Psoriatic ARthritis (CASPAR) criteria)with significant overlaps of both criteria with those for perSpA, meaning that a significant number of patients could fulfil both — or even all three — sets of those criteria at the same time.

### 2019 update of the American College of Rheumatology / Spondylitis Association of America / Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network recommendations for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis [^b605caf2]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology/Spondylitis Association of America/Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network 2019 update — scope and methods are as follows: Axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) comprises ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and nonradiographic axial SpA, and AS affects 0.1–0.5% of the population. The update was warranted by new medications to treat axial SpA and did not reexamine all 2015 recommendations, instead focusing on questions with consequential new evidence and adding recommendations on how newly available medications should fit in treatment strategies and on the use of imaging. Target populations are adults with AS or nonradiographic axial SpA, and target users include rheumatologists, primary care clinicians, physiatrists, physical therapists, and others providing care to patients with axial SpA. Methods followed American College of Rheumatology and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology with systematic literature reviews for prespecified population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO) questions, and an expert voting panel reviewed evidence and formulated and voted on recommendations.

### Sulindac [^2bd549aa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of sulindac tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use sulindac tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

After observing the response to initial therapy with sulindac tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.

Sulindac tablets should be administered orally twice a day with food. The maximum dosage is 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day are not recommended.

In osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, the recommended starting dosage is 150 mg twice a day. The dosage may be lowered or raised depending on the response.

A prompt response (within one week) can be expected in about one-half of patients with osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Others may require longer to respond.

In acute painful shoulder (acute subacromial bursitis/supraspinatus tendinitis) and acute gouty arthritis, the recommended dosage is 200 mg twice a day. After a satisfactory response has been achieved, the dosage may be reduced according to the response. In acute painful shoulder, therapy for 7–14 days is usually adequate. In acute gouty arthritis, therapy for 7 days is usually adequate.

Incidence between 3% and 9%. Those reactions occurring in 1% to 3% of patients are not marked with an asterisk.

Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

ACR/SAA/SPARTAN evidence and recommendation categories define evidence levels and decision terms as follows: High-quality evidence are "Studies that provide high confidence in the effect estimate, and new data from future studies are thought unlikely to change the effect", moderate-quality evidence are "Studies that provide confidence that the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate but could be substantially different", low-quality evidence are "Studies that provide limited confidence about the effect, and the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate", and very low-quality evidence are "Studies that provide very little certainty about the effect, and the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate". A strong recommendation means "Action should be favored in most patients, usually requiring high-quality evidence, high confidence that future research will not alter the conclusion, AND an assessment that the desirable effects of the intervention outweigh the undesirable effects", while a conditional recommendation means "Action should be followed only in selected cases, often limited by low-quality evidence, OR when the desirable and undesirable consequences of an intervention are more balanced, OR if patients' preferences for the intervention are thought to vary widely". Patient preferences are "Beliefs and expectations regarding potential benefits and harms of treatment and how these relate to an individual's goals for health and life", and shared decision-making is "The process by which a patient and clinician arrive at an individualized treatment decision based on an understanding of the potential benefits and risks of available treatment options and of a patient's values and preferences".

### Suspecting and diagnosing the patient with spondyloarthritis and what to expect from therapy [^36cb9b6a]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Spondyloarthritis is a common rheumatologic disease, present in up to 2% of the population, characterized by inflammatory arthritis, often with enthesitis, dactylitis, spondylitis, and skin disease. It has historically been characterized as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease, reactive arthritis, and undifferentiated spondyloarthritis. These subsets are now classified as axial-predominant and peripheral-predominant spondyloarthritis. This article provides an updated understanding of disease classification and practical advice about diagnosis to aid in the determination of which patients should be referred to rheumatology. It is important to provide patients the opportunity to have early and effective therapy.

### OMERACT magnetic resonance imaging initiative on structural and inflammatory lesions in ankylosing spondylitis – report of a special interest group at OMERACT 10 on sacroiliac joint and spine lesions [^00de1ca7]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

The ASAS/OMERACT MRI group recently described and defined magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in sacroiliac joints (SIJ) that are essential for the diagnosis of sacroiliitis in patients with axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (AS). At the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT) 2010 meeting, a special interest group (SIG) was formed to design a research agenda for the definition and description of structural lesions in the SIJ and the spine in patients with established AS. During the SIG, a summary of the previous work of the group was presented to all participants, containing: (1) a description of the current definitions of structural SIJ changes; (2) available scoring methods for SIJ changes; (3) data from a previous pilot MRI exercise on chronic SIJ changes performed by members of the group; and (4) a proposal for a research agenda for OMERACT 11. The group agreed on the project's scientific merits and the need to evaluate all available scoring methods and to have clear definitions for all possible abnormalities that can be seen on MRI, prior to the start of the exercise. It was also agreed that the exercise should include scoring of both structural and inflammatory lesions, due to lack of agreement about the best scoring method for assessing both types of lesions in AS. Participants agreed that longitudinal MRI over a certain period are needed to learn about the time sequence of pathologic changes and to understand the course of the disease. Finally, participants asked the group to add the development of a scoring method for structural changes in the spine in a subsequent exercise. Further to these objectives, all experts who agreed to contribute in the exercise will collaborate to achieve consensus on definitions and to organize training in the different scoring systems prior to the start of the project, with the aim to finalize the multiple reader exercise by the end of 2011, in time for OMERACT 11.

### Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis: what are the similarities and differences? [^e4d9a6b9]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Demographics

Except for the male:female ratio (see below), no major differences in patient demographics have been observed (table 1). The proportion of patients with symptom duration of ≥ 5 years was similar between two studies, with 68%and 61.2%. Almost no differences were found regarding the mean age of the patients at presentation between subgroups (table 1). Importantly, the prevalence of HLA-B27 was similar: 86.4% vs 89.1%,74.7% vs 82.2%and 74.8% vs 81.5%for nr-axSpA and AS, respectively.

Table 1
Clinical characteristics of the three main studies compared in this report, showing similarities and differences observed between the two axSpA subtypes

Prevalence of clinical features of axSpA

All studies showed that the frequency of typical clinical features and also of extra-spinal and extra-articular manifestations are similar between the two subgroups. Some variations between studies due to the geographic distribution of the examined populations were reported. For example, peripheral arthritis in general was found to be around 18% for nr-axSpA and AS in two studies, while the frequency was much higher in the third study with around 54%, again in both groups. Similar observations were also made for the prevalence of psoriasis, with 9.1% vs 10.7%and 5.3% vs 8.1%for nr-axSpA and AS, respectively, as well as for enthesitis and inflammatory bowel disease (table 1).

### Naproxen sodium [^47d60317]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Naproxen has been studied in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, tendonitis and bursitis, and acute gout. Improvement in patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis was demonstrated by a reduction in joint swelling, a reduction in duration of morning stiffness, a reduction in disease activity as assessed by both the investigator and patient, and by increased mobility as demonstrated by a reduction in walking time. Generally, response to naproxen has not been found to be dependent on age, sex, severity or duration of rheumatoid arthritis.

In patients with osteoarthritis, the therapeutic action of naproxen has been shown by a reduction in joint pain or tenderness, an increase in range of motion in knee joints, increased mobility as demonstrated by a reduction in walking time, and improvement in capacity to perform activities of daily living impaired by the disease.

In a clinical trial comparing standard formulations of naproxen 375 mg twice a day (750 mg a day) vs 750 mg twice a day (1500 mg/day), 9 patients in the 750 mg group terminated prematurely because of adverse events. Nineteen patients in the 1500 mg group terminated prematurely because of adverse events. Most of these adverse events were gastrointestinal events.

In clinical studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, naproxen has been shown to be comparable to aspirin and indomethacin in controlling the aforementioned measures of disease activity, but the frequency and severity of the milder gastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea, dyspepsia, heartburn) and nervous system adverse effects (tinnitus, dizziness, lightheadedness) were less in naproxen-treated patients than in those treated with aspirin or indomethacin.
