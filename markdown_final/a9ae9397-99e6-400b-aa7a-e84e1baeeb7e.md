## Question

education in leg pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about patient education for leg pain, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify leg pain phenotypes to anchor education content. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about education's role and when it helps versus when it does not. Next, I will examine condition-specific education strategies for low back pain with leg symptoms, patellofemoral pain, peripheral artery disease, and venous disease. After that, I need to check delivery methods, timing, and behavior-change techniques that improve adherence. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight evidence gaps, making sure I double-check any overstatements and correct them as needed.

> Let me first confirm the clinical taxonomy of leg pain because education must match mechanism and prognosis. Leg pain commonly arises from spine-related radicular or referred patterns, patellofemoral or hip joint sources, peripheral neuropathic conditions, vascular claudication, and venous insufficiency or ulceration; I should verify that contemporary guidelines and reviews align with this framing and that they distinguish acute from chronic timelines and nerve root involvement when relevant [^115Gp2sm] [^113XCbwm] [^112qk95q].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about education's effect size. I need to check whether education alone changes pain and function or whether it must be paired with active treatments. The 2021 JOSPT update concludes that standard education/advice as a stand-alone treatment offers limited benefit for chronic low back pain, but gains clinical relevance when combined with exercise and manual therapy; similarly, a meta-analysis of individual education for acute/subacute low back pain shows only small, non-clinically relevant improvements, reinforcing that education should be embedded in multimodal care rather than used in isolation [^114RkCD3] [^111JceWU].

> Wait, let me verify the role of pain neuroscience education (PNE) because I initially thought it consistently improves pain trajectories. A multicenter RCT of preoperative PNE for lumbar radiculopathy did not reduce pain or disability at 1 year versus usual care, though it improved preparedness and reduced healthcare utilization; a secondary analysis suggests greater benefit in those with higher kinesiophobia and leg pain intensity, so I should be cautious not to overstate PNE's analgesic impact while acknowledging potential value for beliefs and utilization [^111syssQ] [^116xQ8Ed].

> Next, I should review low back pain with leg pain. Education should emphasize staying active, avoiding bed rest, and the favorable natural history; for acute radicular symptoms, positions that centralize pain and nerve mobility work in pain-free ranges can be taught, while mechanical traction should be avoided given lack of benefit; I need to ensure I do not conflate acute and chronic contexts, as education plus exercise is consistently supported in chronic presentations but stand-alone education is weak in acute phases [^113uyaqx] [^115Wvf6P] [^1176RWEQ] [^111su7KE].

> I will now examine patellofemoral pain education. Guidelines recommend education on load management, adherence to quadriceps and gluteal strengthening, biomechanics that relatively overload the patellofemoral joint, and addressing kinesiophobia; importantly, there are no RCTs showing education alone improves outcomes, so education should be integrated with exercise and, when helpful, taping or manual therapy; a validated patient leaflet can standardize content and improve fidelity [^114jexKp] [^114CoXnm] [^116UGJER].

> Let me consider peripheral artery disease and intermittent claudication. Supervised exercise is first-line and education must explain the ischemic mechanism, the need for structured walking to claudication with rest intervals, and the importance of cardiovascular risk reduction; home-based programs with behavioral supports can be reasonable alternatives when supervised programs are unavailable; I should confirm that guidelines emphasize education at each prescription touchpoint and shared decision-making about revascularization only after a supervised exercise trial in appropriate candidates [^1115yZkp] [^113XCbwm] [^114m2xav].

> For venous leg ulceration, I need to check whether education improves adherence to compression, since that drives healing. Evidence is limited and mixed; nurse-led self-management programs and social support models have not consistently improved healing or recurrence, though one study suggested a small, possibly non-clinically important pain reduction; thus, education should focus on practical adherence strategies, skin care, and the rationale for compression, while recognizing that we lack high-certainty evidence for education-only adherence interventions [^116PccVQ] [^115HKVSs].

> Next, I should review delivery methods and behavior-change techniques. Verbal-only education suffers from poor retention; combining written or digital materials with brief teach-back improves uptake; for claudication, activity monitors and goal-setting enhance adherence; for patellofemoral pain, a concise, expert-developed leaflet supports translation of evidence; and for postoperative pain, individualized, family-centered education with a documented plan improves engagement and may reduce opioid consumption, though comparative effectiveness across formats remains uncertain [^116nMRvv] [^112T8fFj] [^116UGJER] [^1116FGCA].

> I need to ensure timing is aligned with clinical phase. Early education in acute low back pain should set expectations, discourage harmful beliefs, and promote activity, while chronic pain education is most impactful when layered onto exercise and manual therapy; preoperative education for spine surgery should include expectations about leg versus back pain improvement and the role of active rehabilitation; for PAD, education should precede and accompany exercise prescription to sustain behavior change [^113uyaqx] [^111su7KE] [^113kARqx] [^113XCbwm].

> But wait, what about special populations and equity. Older adults benefit from simplified, culturally adapted content with attention to comorbidities and health literacy; patients with higher kinesiophobia may derive relatively greater benefit from PNE; and implementation science reminds us that clinician-only strategies often fail without addressing patient and system barriers, so education must be feasible within workflow and meaningful to patients' goals [^116xQ8Ed] [^116EJMjR].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations while I double-check the strength of evidence. For spine-related leg pain, pair education with exercise emphasizing trunk activation and movement control, avoid traction, and use education to support shared decisions about surgery where benefits are moderate and decline over time; for patellofemoral pain, integrate load management and kinesiophobia counseling with quadriceps and gluteal strengthening; for PAD, prioritize supervised exercise and risk-factor education with structured walking; for venous ulcers, reinforce compression adherence with practical strategies while acknowledging limited evidence for education-only adherence gains; across conditions, avoid fear-inducing pathoanatomy and emphasize active self-management and realistic expectations [^112EtAFd] [^1176RWEQ] [^1169XMTe] [^114jexKp] [^1115yZkp] [^116PccVQ] [^113uyaqx].

> Finally, I should confirm key evidence gaps and correct any overstatements. Stand-alone education has small or uncertain effects on pain and function in many musculoskeletal contexts; PNE may improve beliefs and utilization without consistently changing pain trajectories; and implementation studies show that translating education recommendations into routine care is hard, especially without addressing patient and system barriers; therefore, future work should test dose, sequencing, and tailored delivery, and we should avoid implying that education alone is sufficient for clinically meaningful pain reduction [^111JceWU] [^111syssQ] [^116EJMjR].

Education for leg pain should be **individualized and condition-specific**, focusing on the underlying cause, prognosis, and self-management strategies. Key elements include explaining the diagnosis in plain language, setting realistic expectations about recovery, and teaching pain control techniques (e.g. activity modification, load management, exercise adherence, and weight control) [^114jexKp] [^114CoXnm]. For spine-related leg pain, emphasize the favorable natural history, avoid alarmist imaging, and promote active management; for PAD, prioritize supervised exercise, smoking cessation, and cardiovascular risk reduction [^1115yZkp] [^117MW8d2]; for venous ulcers, stress compression adherence and skin care [^116PccVQ]. Use written materials, videos, and teach-back to improve retention, and address psychosocial factors like fear-avoidance and catastrophizing to enhance adherence and outcomes [^116nMRvv] [^116YAgWh].

---

## General principles of patient education for leg pain

- **Clear diagnosis and explanation**: Explain the diagnosis in simple, non-alarmist terms, using visual aids or analogies to improve understanding and reduce anxiety [^112oY8UF].

- **Prognosis and expectations**: Set realistic expectations about recovery, emphasizing the favorable natural history of many leg pain conditions and the importance of active management [^113uyaqx].

- **Pain management strategies**: Teach self-management techniques, including activity modification, load management, adherence to exercise programs, weight control, and use of heat or cold therapy [^114jexKp].

- **Psychosocial factors**: Address fear-avoidance beliefs, catastrophizing, and anxiety, as these can significantly impact adherence and outcomes [^113uyaqx].

---

## Condition-specific educational strategies

### Spine-related leg pain (radiculopathy, sciatica)

- **Natural history**: Emphasize that most cases improve spontaneously within weeks to months, and that persistent symptoms do not necessarily indicate severe pathology [^notfound].

- **Imaging and red flags**: Educate patients about the limited role of routine imaging in the absence of red flags, and the potential harms of unnecessary imaging [^113L7mAU].

- **Active management**: Encourage physical activity, specific exercises, and avoidance of prolonged bed rest [^113uyaqx].

- **Neuropathic pain**: Provide information about neuropathic pain characteristics and management options, including medications and behavioral strategies [^116f6AJv].

---

### Peripheral artery disease (PAD) and intermittent claudication

- **Risk factor modification**: Educate patients on smoking cessation, diet, blood pressure control, cholesterol management, and diabetes control [^116nUwUp].

- **Exercise therapy**: Promote supervised exercise programs, emphasizing the benefits of regular walking and physical activity [^1115yZkp].

- **Symptom recognition**: Teach patients to recognize worsening symptoms and when to seek medical attention [^112N3QA6].

---

### Venous leg ulcers

- **Compression therapy**: Emphasize the importance of adherence to compression therapy, skin care, and elevation of the affected limb [^116PccVQ].

- **Wound care**: Provide practical training on wound dressing techniques, infection prevention, and monitoring for complications [^notfound].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Encourage weight management, regular exercise, and smoking cessation [^116PccVQ].

---

## Effective educational methods and tools

- **Written materials**: Provide clear, concise written materials tailored to the patient's literacy level and language preference [^116nMRvv].

- **Visual aids and multimedia**: Use videos, infographics, and interactive tools to enhance understanding and retention [^1116FGCA].

- **Teach-back method**: Confirm understanding by asking patients to explain the information back in their own words [^notfound].

- **Group education**: Consider group sessions for peer support and shared experiences, particularly for chronic conditions [^112oY8UF].

---

## Addressing psychological factors

Psychological factors significantly influence leg pain outcomes; **education should incorporate strategies to address fear-avoidance, catastrophizing, and anxiety**. Cognitive-behavioral approaches and pain neuroscience education can improve pain intensity, disability, and quality of life [^116YAgWh] [^112oY8UF].

---

## Barriers to effective education and strategies to overcome them

| **Barrier** | **Strategy** |
|-|-|
| Low health literacy | - Use simple language <br/> - Visual aids <br/> - Teach-back method [^1116FGCA] |
| Language barriers | - Provide materials in multiple languages <br/> - Use interpreters [^notfound] |
| Cultural differences | - Tailor content to cultural beliefs and practices [^112oY8UF] |
| Limited time | - Use efficient, structured educational sessions <br/> - Provide take-home materials [^116nMRvv] |
| Patient disengagement | - Use motivational interviewing <br/> - Goal-setting <br/> - Shared decision-making [^114m2xav] |

---

## Evaluation of educational effectiveness

Regularly assess patient understanding and satisfaction to guide adjustments. Use **validated questionnaires** to evaluate pain intensity, disability, and quality of life, and track adherence to recommended treatments and self-management strategies. Collect patient feedback to refine educational content and delivery methods [^111JjB5P].

---

Education for leg pain should be **individualized, condition-specific, and comprehensive**, addressing diagnosis, prognosis, self-management, and psychosocial factors. Using clear communication, visual aids, and teach-back, clinicians can improve understanding, adherence, and outcomes.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^116f6AJv]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Definite neuropathic pain is reached if all the above criteria are present, plus a diagnostic test confirming a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system explaining the pain.

It is recommended that the presence of probable or definite neuropathic pain prompt consideration of treatment according to the neuropathic pain treatment guidelines. Currently, in the context of spine-related leg pain, however, there is little evidence that neuropathic pain medications are effective. However, very few trials actually mandated the presence of neuropathic pain as an inclusion criterion, meaning we cannot preclude heterogeneity in case definitions, further confounding/complicating the interpretation of true efficacy. Other studies used underpowered (post hoc) subgroup analyses. Future research is required to determine whether neuropathic pain medications are effective in patients with spine-related leg pain with neuropathic characteristics and clarification of outcomes may in part be facilitated by the use of specific case definitions, as proposed in this paper. In the absence of clear evidence for efficacy in pharmacological treatment, targeted management strategies for people with neuropathic pain would still be distinct from those with nociceptive pain, for instance, related to explanations, education, and sense making. As such, the grading system classification has direct clinical implications for care recommendations including in spine-related leg pain.

### 'Managing my patellofemoral pain': the creation of an education leaflet for patients [^116nMRvv]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a prevalent multifactorial knee condition, accounting for 16.5% of all consultations in sports medicine clinics. We recently created a 'Best Practice Guide to Conservative Management of Patellofemoral Pain' based on current level 1 evidence (ie, high-quality systematic reviews) and international expert opinion. Multimodal interventions possess the strongest evidence in the longer term management of PFP, and commonly consisted of quadriceps and gluteal exercises, stretching, massage, patellar mobilisation and patellar taping. International expert opinion highlighted that tailoring this multimodal approach, along with appropriate patient education, is essential for effective PFP management. Importantly, this recommendation fits with previous evidence supporting the efficacy of patient education alongside multimodal intervention in conditions including hip and knee osteoarthritis.

The question is how to provide patient education in clinical practice? Previous research indicates poor knowledge retention when information is only provided verbally, highlighting the need for education resources to facilitate effective education of PFP patients, and the translation of the current evidence base into clinical practice. Currently, no published educational resources for PFP exist. Previously published studies have used educational interventions as comparisonsor in conjunction with other treatments. However, the material is rarely described in enough detail to allow use outside the study, and is based on the researcher's own experience without input from other experts.

The purpose of this study was to develop a brief yet comprehensive evidence-based education leaflet to be used as an adjunct in the management of PFP through consultation with both experts (clinical academics) and individuals with PFP. The hope is that this resource will improve the translation of the current evidence base related to PFP management into clinical practice.

### Interventions for the management of acute and chronic low back pain: revision 2021 [^1169ykHD]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Postoperative low back pain — education interventions: After laminectomy, an RCT (n = 86) found moderate to large benefits of a targeted cognitive behavioral therapy–based rehabilitation approach compared with a general postoperative education program for back and leg pain intensity, disability, and pain interference at 3 months after surgery, but not immediately posttreatment. In patients undergoing lumbar fusion, an RCT (n = 96) found no additional benefit of a preoperative cognitive behavioral intervention compared with standard preoperative education for pain or disability 1 year following surgery, although the reduction in disability was achieved much faster in the intervention group. Following first-time discectomy, an RCT (n = 129) found no additional benefit of a biopsychosocial evidence-based educational booklet compared with a biomedical-based booklet for pain intensity or disability outcomes 2 months after surgery.

### Non-invasive and minimally invasive management of low back disorders [^113GPmFj]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Non-invasive clinical treatment recommendations — activity levels, exercise, and directional preference exercises should be addressed; nonprescription analgesics may provide sufficient pain relief for most patients with acute and subacute low back pain (LBP), and if the treatment response is inadequate or limitations are more significant, prescribed pharmaceuticals and/or physical methods can be added. Initial care may include exercise, advice on activities, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, heat, cryotherapy, and manipulation; education about LBP should begin at the first visit, and fear avoidance belief training (FABT) is for those with fear avoidance beliefs. Comorbid conditions, invasiveness, adverse effects, cost, and provider and patient preferences help guide recommendations, and throughout treatment phases, any given treatment should be assessed for efficacy and ineffective treatments should be discontinued rather than accumulated. Chronically impaired LBP patients are believed to begin a course towards disability at, or before, their first clinical encounter; those who respond to appropriate treatment should have their treatment, compliance, and psychosocial factors assessed early, and courses beyond a provider's abilities should be referred. The literature largely lacks specification of clear inclusionary and exclusionary criteria for radicular symptoms; most trials do not report lower extremity symptoms or clarify "leg pain", and only a minority reported stratified analyses to detect if such patients responded differently.

### Psychological interventions for chronic, non-specific low back pain: systematic review with network meta-analysis [^116YAgWh]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

The NMA results showed that at post-intervention, behavioural therapy delivered with physiotherapy care (SMD 1.08, 95% confidence interval 0.22 to 1.94; low quality evidence; equivalent to 27.3 points mean difference in improvement on a scale of 0 to 100), cognitive behavioural therapy delivered with physiotherapy care (0.92, 0.43 to 1.42; moderate quality evidence), and pain education delivered with physiotherapy care (0.91, 0.37 to 1.45; moderate quality evidence) have a large and clinically important effect on reducing pain intensity, compared with physiotherapy care alone (supplementary I; fig 5). Sensitivity analysis, excluding three studies with high risk of bias, produced similar effect estimates (1.14, 0.04 to 2.24 for behavioural therapy with physiotherapy care; 0.91, 0.37 to 1.46 for cognitive behavioural therapy with physiotherapy care; and 0.91, 0.35 to 1.48 for pain education with physiotherapy care; supplementary N). Results from all other sensitivity analyses conducted for pain intensity at post-intervention were similar, except for cognitive behavioural therapy delivered with physiotherapy care, which was not significant in the sensitivity analysis excluding studies of patients with leg pain (0.56, −0.01 to 1.12; supplementary N).

### The 'best practice guide to conservative management of patellofemoral pain': incorporating level 1 evidence with expert clinical reasoning [^111cGk3h]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Importance

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is both chronic and prevalent; it has complex aetiology and many conservative treatment options.

Objective

Develop a comprehensive contemporary guide to conservative management of PFP outlining key considerations for clinicians to follow.

Design

Mixed methods.

Methods

We synthesised the findings from six high-quality systematic reviews to September 2013 with the opinions of 17 experts obtained via semistructured interviews. Experts had at least 5years clinical experience with PFP as a specialist focus, were actively involved in PFP research and contributed to specialist international meetings. The interviews covered clinical reasoning, perception of current evidence and research priorities.

Results

Multimodal intervention including exercise to strengthen the gluteal and quadriceps musculature, manual therapy and taping possessed the strongest evidence. Evidence also supports use of foot orthoses and acupuncture. Interview transcript analysis identified 23 themes and 58 subthemes. Four key over-arching principles to ensure effective management included-(1) PFP is a multifactorial condition requiring an individually tailored multimodal approach. (2) Immediate pain relief should be a priority to gain patient trust. (3) Patient empowerment by emphasising active over passive interventions is important. (4) Good patient education and activity modification is essential. Future research priorities include identifying risk factors, testing effective prevention, developing education strategies, evaluating the influence of psychosocial factors on treatment outcomes and how to address them, evaluating the efficacy of movement pattern retraining and improving clinicians' assessment skills to facilitate optimal individual prescription.

Conclusions and Relevance

Effective management of PFP requires consideration of a number of proven conservative interventions. An individually tailored multimodal intervention programme including gluteal and quadriceps strengthening, patellar taping and an emphasis on education and activity modification should be prescribed for patients with PFP. We provide a 'Best Practice Guide to Conservative Management of Patellofemoral Pain' outlining key considerations.

### Educational needs and preferences of adult patients with acute pain: a mixed-methods systematic review [^115fBc4n]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

3.3. Thematic synthesis

Several educational needs were identified when combining quantitative outcomes and qualitative findings from the retained studies (Table 4). The most frequently reported educational need was what to expect in terms of pain (subthemes: intensity, type, location, duration) (19/32; 59%): "It would have preferred more information on the different types of pain you go through. What this fracture and the operation do to the foot and where the pain comes from. And about the prognosis, how long it will take. ", followed by pain medication (subthemes: type, how and when to take it) (12/32; 38%): "The painkillers were quite strong. I was discharged and wasn't told how to use and dose these medications, so I had to look this up myself. " Other educational needs were identified less frequently and in a similar proportion of studies, including pain management (subthemes: various treatment options, self-management) (10/32; 31%): "I want to be able to at least learn some things that I can add to my knowledge and repertoire of managing my health. "; prevention of opioid use disorders (subthemes: information on risks and benefits, how to wean off) (9/32; 28%): "When I talk about addiction, it seems that the doctors didn't care too much". "But, in my case, my doctor, you know, he didn't tell me: okay, we're going to wean slowly and we're going to go with the recovery. "; and non-pharmacological approaches for pain management (types, how and when to use them) (9/32; 28%): "I've heard different things for your neck. You should or shouldn't turn and stretch from one way or another. One person will tell me one thing, and another will tell me a different thing. So, I'm hoping for the education of proper or right things to do. " The least frequently identified educational needs for which quotes were not always available were adverse effects of analgesics (subthemes: types, probability, prevention, treatments) (7/32; 22%); understanding the cause of pain (subthemes: causes, severity of the problem) (7/32; 22%); strategies to avoid aggravating pain (4/32; 13%); and healthcare professional to contact for pain management issues (4/32; 13%)

### Patellofemoral pain [^111tEe4z]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) — patient education: Clinicians may include specific patient education on load management, body-weight management when appropriate, adherence to active treatments like exercise therapy, biomechanics contributing to relative overload of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ), evidence for various treatment options, and kinesiophobia; patient education may improve compliance and adherence to active management and self-management strategies and is unlikely to have adverse effects.

### Investigation of the effects of combined exercises and self-management education, with and without functional exercises, on pain and functional outcomes in patients with avascular necrosis of the femoral head: a protocol for a single-blind, randomised controlled trial with a parallel design and a 4 month follow-up [^111JjB5P]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Mixed therapeutic exercises

Both groups will undergo a 12 week programme consisting of various mixed therapeutic exercises (Mix-Exe) (TR, 36 sessions over 3 months). The Mix-Exe will include low-intensity, non-weight-bearing resistance exercises, mobility and flexibility exercisesand pendulum leg swing exercises. Personalised exercise programmes will be delivered to patients every 2 weeks via the Telegram app as part of the telerehabilitation programme. Each exercise session will last between 45 and 60 min. Patients will receive instructional videos outlining their exercises and movements. They will be asked to perform the exercises three times a week and log their sessions on a calendar. Every 2 weeks, patients will be asked to share feedback on their experience with the exercises. If any exercise is too difficult, they can discuss adjustments with the therapist during weekly calls. The Mix-Exe programme will be the same for both groups. (For details on exercise progression, volume and intensity, please refer to online supplemental file 1.)

Functional resistance exercises

The functional resistance exercises programme will focus on the lower extremities and include weight-bearing, multijoint and multiplanar exercises. The exercises will consist of three movements using a closed kinematic chain:squats (or half squats), side lunges (or half-side lunges) and step-ups. Patients in the Exe+Functional group will perform these functional exercises once a week in addition to the Mix-Exe. The control group will not participate in these functional resistance exercises (see online supplemental file 1).

Self-Management Education (SME)

After the baseline assessment, patients will receive a personalised self-management education (SME) session tailored to their specific condition and based on previous studies. Additionally, patients will be provided with a booklet covering the following topics: (1) encouragement to follow the therapeutic exercise protocol, (2) weight control recommendations, (3) use of heat therapy around the affected joint, (4) recommendations for flat-soled or low-heeled shoes, (5) healthy eating and balanced diet suggestions, (6) sleep regulation advice, (7) importance of hydration and (8) non-pharmacological techniques for pain management. This SME session will ensure that patients understand how to follow the exercise protocol. The SME content will be identical for both groups.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological-based interventions, including education and prescribing strategies, to reduce subacute pain after total hip or knee arthroplasty: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^113sdB9N]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) are cornerstone and cost-effective procedures to improve pain, mobility, and quality of life for people with severe knee and hip osteoarthritis, respectively. TKA and THA are among the most common elective surgeries performed worldwide. Due to rising rates of obesity and population aging, the burden of osteoarthritis and the subsequent need for these surgeries are projected to increase by 673% for TKA and 174% for THA by 2030 in the United States (US), with similar increases projected elsewhere, such as in Australia and the United Kingdom.

Adequate pain management after TKA and THA facilitates faster rehabilitation and reduced postoperative complications, hospital readmission rates, and overall health care costs. A prospective study of 87 patients showed that moderate to severe subacute pain is experienced by more than 40% of patients and is associated with an increased risk of persistent pain 12 months after orthopedic surgery; thus, it would appear that better early management could confer better long-term results. Although there is some literature describing pain management strategies in the immediate postoperative period after arthroplasty, the most effective strategies for the management of pain during the subacute period (from discharge to 3 months after surgery) are unclear. Uncertainty about the optimal strategy might contribute toward unwarranted practice variation and low-value or harmful care, which can adversely impact patient outcomes.

The most effective pharmacological-based interventions for subacute pain after TKA or THA have not been established, which represents a gap in evidence for providing care in the subacute postoperative period. Therefore, the present systematic review will examine the available evidence for postdischarge pharmacological interventions, including educational and prescribing strategies, and their effect on reducing pain during the subacute period after TKA or THA.

### Evaluation and treatment of low back pain: an evidence-based approach to clinical care [^116sAwsZ]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

Low back pain is a common reason for patient visits to a health care provider. For most patients, low back symptoms are nonspecific, meaning that the pain is localized to the back or buttocks and is due to a presumed musculoligamentous process. For patients with radicular leg symptoms, a precise etiology is more commonly identified. The history and physical examination usually provide clues to the uncommon but potentially serious causes of low back pain, as well as to those patients at risk for prolonged recovery. Diagnostic testing should not be a routine part of the initial evaluation, but used selectively based upon the history, examination, and initial treatment response. For patients without significant neurological impairment, initial treatments should include activity modification, nonnarcotic analgesics, and education. For patients whose symptoms are not improving over 2 to 4 weeks, referral for physical treatments is appropriate. A variety of therapeutic options of limited or unproven benefit are available for patients with radicular leg symptoms or chronic low back pain. Patients with radicular pain and little or no neurological findings should receive conservative treatment, but elective surgery is appropriate for those with nerve root compression who are unresponsive to conservative therapy.

### Patient education, coaching, and self-management for cancer pain [^116Yt8as]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses have identified the effectiveness of patient education in improving cancer pain management. However, the mechanisms by which patient education improves pain outcomes are uncertain, as are the optimal delivery, content, timing, frequency, and duration. This review provides best-bet recommendations based on available evidence to guide service managers and clinicians in developing a patient education program.

Methods

We used patient-centered care, self-management, coaching, and a behavior change wheel as lenses through which to consider the evidence for elements of patient education most likely to be effective within the context of other strategies for overcoming barriers to cancer pain assessment and management.

Results

The evidence suggests that optimal strategies include those that are patient-centered and tailored to individual needs, are embedded within health professional-patient communication and therapeutic relationships, empower patients to self-manage and coordinate their care, and are routinely integrated into standard cancer care. An approach that integrates patient education with processes and systems to ensure implementation of key standards for pain assessment and management and education of health professionals has been shown to be most effective.

Conclusion

Patient education is effective in reducing cancer pain and should be standard practice in all settings. For optimal results, patient education should be integrated with other strategies for implementing evidence-based, person-centered care and overcoming barriers at the levels of patient, provider, and health system.

### Effectiveness of strategies for implementing guideline-concordant care in low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113L7mAU]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally, low back pain is highly prevalent and a leading cause of disability. Clinical practice guidelines serve as important resources to improve the quality of care for low back pain by synthesising and appraising existing evidence, and providing recommendations for evidence-informed management. However, a time lag exists in the translation of evidence into practiceand in many cases, the management of low back pain is inconsistent with guideline-concordant care.

International guidelines, such as ones from the World Health Organization, Europe, United States of America and Australia, present similar core recommendations for managing low back pain, including providing education/advice to patients, discouraging routine imaging use, and reducing analgesic use, such as opioids. Such recommendations are informed by evidence demonstrating that education/advice can provide small, short-term improvements in pain management, and routine imaging does not confer clinical benefits yet can prolong recovery in patients with non-specific low back pain. Further, guidelines are shifting from a focus on analgesic to non-analgesic treatments, due to the limited evidence of efficacy and risk of harm associated with many analgesics.,

Despite the consistency of recommendations for the management of low back pain across international guidelines, there is variation in the care provided in practice. Guideline implementation involves the use of strategies aimed to facilitate uptake, use or adoption of guideline-concordant care, change healthcare professionals' behaviours and improve patient outcomes. Previous research has shown that the use of implementation strategies by guideline developers may increase the uptake of clinical practice guidelines, compared to passive dissemination. However, for low back pain, current evidence to support the effectiveness of guideline implementation strategies is limited and findings from systematic reviews on this topic are inconsistent. Considering that implementation research is a rapidly evolving area, and a number of implementation studies in low back pain have been published, since the last systematic review on this topic in 2016, an up-to-date systematic review with meta-analysis is warranted.

This systematic review aimed to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of implementation strategies for improving the uptake of one or more of three guideline recommendations for the management of low back pain: providing education/advice, discouraging routine imaging use, and/or reducing analgesic use. This review hypothesised that implementing low back pain guideline recommendations would promote guideline-concordant care among healthcare professionals and organisations.

### Update on treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a review of current US guidelines with a focus on the most recently approved management options [^1146xRkw]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Unmet Needs in the Treatment of Painful DPN

Unmet needs with regard to the treatment of painful DPN can be categorized at three levels, which should form the basis for a personalized approach to the management of this frequently debilitating and progressive condition.
In the absence of any approved effective pharmacological disease-modifying therapy, preventative approaches that delay the development of nerve damage and slow disease progression would be highly beneficial. This should involve educating healthcare professionals and patients about diabetes and DPN, implementing effective targeted screening strategies as part of routine clinical practice, encouraging patients to undertake lifestyle modifications, and optimizing the use of medications. Early diagnosis and timely treatment of painful DPN is vital to prevent progression, avoid the development of advanced complications, and improve HR-QoL, economic and other outcomes.
A vital goal should be to develop pathogenetically oriented disease-modifying treatments designed to prevent/reverse the nerve damage associated with painful DPN.
Since approximately 30% of patients with DPN experience painful episodes, optimal approaches to minimize pain are an essential goal for a relevant proportion of patients.

Disease Prevention

To ensure that DPN is diagnosed and managed as early as possible, screening for DPN should be conducted regularly and routinely in all diabetic patients (Table 1). Healthcare professionals should be educated in patient assessment, which involves obtaining a careful clinical history and conducting a targeted physical exam. A patient-centered approach may require referral to specialists in other disciplines including but not limited to endocrinology, pain management, and podiatry. Patients should also be educated about the risk of DPN and its early signs and symptoms.

Management decisions pertaining to DPN prevention should be individualized to the patient's needs. These include appropriate foot care and a range of initiatives to reduce DPN risk factors. To prevent the onset of DPN in patients with T1D, intensive glucose control should be implemented when possible. In patients with T2D, controlling features of the metabolic syndrome, such as hyperglycemia, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, together with educational strategies to improve lifestyle measures, including weight loss, increased physical activity, and smoking cessation, are recommended to prevent DPN. Education about lifestyle interventions is also important to prevent DPN in individuals with prediabetes/metabolic syndrome.

### Individual patient education for managing acute and / or subacute low back pain: little additional benefit for pain and function compared to placebo. A systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111JceWU]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of individual patient education for managing acute and/or subacute low back pain (LBP), compared to no intervention/placebo education, noneducational interventions, or other type of education.

Design

Systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized trials.

Literature Search

PubMed, CINAHL, PEDro, Embase, Scopus, and CENTRAL (up to September 30, 2020); reference lists of previous systematic reviews.

Study Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating individual education for patients with acute and/or subacute LBP.

Data Synthesis

Random-effects meta-analysis for clinically homogeneous RCTs. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

Results

We included 13 RCTs. There was moderate certainty evidence that individual patient education was more effective than placebo education for pain at medium term (mean difference [MD], -0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.52, -0.07) and physical function at short term (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.25; 95% CI: -0.47, -0.02) and medium term (SMD, -0.26; 95% CI: -0.48, -0.04), but with no clinically relevant effects. There was low-to-moderate certainty evidence that individual patient education was superior to noneducational interventions on short-term quality of life (MD, -12.00; 95% CI: -20.05, -3.95) and medium-term sick leave (odds ratio = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.88). We found no clinically relevant between-group effects for any other comparison (low-to-high certainty of evidence) at any follow-up.

Conclusion

One or 2 hours of individual patient education probably makes little to no difference in pain and functional outcomes compared with placebo for patients with acute and/or subacute LBP. Considering its effects on other outcomes (eg, reassurance) and patients' desire for information about their condition, it is reasonable to retain patient education as part of a first-line approach when managing acute and subacute LBP.

### Influence of preoperative pain, cognitions, and quantitative sensory testing measures on the effects of perioperative pain neuroscience education for people receiving surgery for lumbar radiculopathy: secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial [^116xQ8Ed]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE: To explore whether preoperative pain intensity, pain cognitions, and quantitative sensory measures influence the established effectiveness of perioperative pain neuroscience education (PPNE) on health-related quality of life at 1 year after surgery for lumbar radiculopathy. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a triple-blinded randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Participants (n = 90) were Dutch-speaking adults (18–65 years) who were scheduled for surgery for lumbar radiculopathy in 3 Belgian hospitals. They were randomized (1:1) to receive PPNE (n = 41) or perioperative biomedical education (n = 49). Linear mixed models were built for health-related quality of life (ie, SF-6D utility values, Physical and Mental Component of the 36-item Short Form Health Survey) using the following independent variables: therapy, time, and preoperative scores for back and leg pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, hypervigilance, and quantitative sensory measures. RESULTS: The impact of PPNE on SF-6D utility values over time was influenced by kinesiophobia (F = 3.30, P = .02) and leg pain intensity (F = 3.48, P = .02). Regardless of the intervention, back pain intensity negatively influenced SF-6D values over time (F = 3.99, P = .009). The Physical Component scores were negatively impacted by back pain intensity (F = 9.08, P = .003) and were influenced over time by leg pain intensity (F = 2.87, P = .04). The Mental Component scores were negatively impacted by back pain intensity (F = 6.64, P = .01) and pain catastrophizing (F = 5.42, P = .02), as well as hypervigilance (F = 3.16, P = .03) and leg pain intensity (F = 3.12, P = .03) over time. CONCLUSION: PPNE may be more effective than perioperative biomedical education in improving postoperative health utility values in patients who reported higher kinesiophobia and leg pain intensity before surgery for lumbar radiculopathy.

### Efficacy of pain education in cancer patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112bgt2L]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patient education has been considered as one of the important strategies to improve cancer pain control. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported inconsistent findings on this issue. This study aims to evaluate the overall efficacy of pain education on improving pain management in cancer patients by using a meta-analysis of RCTs.

Methods

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library in February 2012. Two evaluators independently reviewed and selected trials based on the predetermined selection criteria. Out of 213 articles meeting initial criteria, 12 RCTs involving 2,169 participants (1,069 intervention group and 1,100 control group), were included in the final analysis.

Results

In the meta-analysis of all 12 RCTs, compared with the control group, the intervention group showed a small significant lower pain intensity (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.11; 95% confidence interval, -0.20 to -0.02). In the subgroup meta-analysis by various factors, a beneficial effect of pain education was observed for patients with an estimated prognosis of at least 3 months, a follow-up within 2 weeks after pain education, multiple sessions, measured worst pain, tailored education, general pain management, education by medical staff, and usual care for a control group. However, in the subgroup meta-analyses of trials using attention control as a control group and high-quality trials, there was no significant effect of pain education.

Conclusions

Further large, high-quality RCTs using a placebo control such as attention control are required to investigate whether pain education has a true efficacy on pain control or is a placebo effect.

Intermittent claudication (IC) supervised versus home-based exercise and adherence strategies: Structured, supervised programs demonstrate superior outcomes to unsupervised home programs and are the preferred strategy when possible. A 12-week home-based program with lecture and weekly instruction improved initial claudication time and maximal walking time at 6 months, with statistically significant gains versus baseline but less than supervised exercise; other home-based programs showed improvements but lower than supervised, and 47% of noncompleters dropped out. A home-based 12-week program incorporating a step monitor achieved the same level of adherence and increased claudication time and peak walking time to a similar degree as supervised exercise.

### Guidance on the management of pain in older people [^114TwJTp]. Age and Ageing (2013). Low credibility.

This guidance document reviews the epidemiology and management of pain in older people via a literature review of published research. The aim of this document is to inform health professionals in any care setting who work with older adults on best practice for the management of pain and to identify where there are gaps in the evidence that require further research. The assessment of pain in older people has not been covered within this guidance and can be found in a separate document (http://www.britishpainsociety.org/pub_professional.htm#assessmentpop). Substantial differences in the population, methods and definitions used in published research makes it difficult to compare across studies and impossible to determine the definitive prevalence of pain in older people. There are inconsistencies within the literature as to whether or not pain increases or decreases in this age group, and whether this is influenced by gender. There is, however, some evidence that the prevalence of pain is higher within residential care settings. The three most common sites of pain in older people are the back; leg/knee or hip and 'other' joints. In common with the working-age population, the attitudes and beliefs of older people influence all aspects of their pain experience. Stoicism is particularly evident within this cohort of people. Evidence from the literature search suggests that paracetamol should be considered as first-line treatment for the management of both acute and persistent pain, particularly that which is of musculoskeletal origin, due to its demonstrated efficacy and good safety profile. There are few absolute contraindications and relative cautions to prescribing paracetamol. It is, however, important that the maximum daily dose (4 g/24 h) is not exceeded. Non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be used with caution in older people after other safer treatments have not provided sufficient pain relief. The lowest dose should be provided, for the shortest duration. For older adults, an NSAID or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitor should be co-prescribed with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and the one with the lowest acquisition cost should be chosen. All older people taking NSAIDs should be routinely monitored for gastrointestinal, renal and cardiovascular side effects, and drug–drug and drug–disease interactions. Opioid therapy may be considered for patients with moderate or severe pain, particularly if the pain is causing functional impairment or is reducing their quality of life. However, this must be individualised and carefully monitored. Opioid side effects including nausea and vomiting should be anticipated and suitable prophylaxis considered. Appropriate laxative therapy, such as the combination of a stool softener and a stimulant laxative, should be prescribed throughout treatment for all older people who are prescribed opioid therapy. Tricyclic antidepressants and anti-epileptic drugs have demonstrated efficacy in several types of neuropathic pain. But, tolerability and adverse effects limit their use in an older population. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections in osteoarthritis of the knee are effective in relieving pain in the short term, with little risk of complications and/or joint damage. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid is effective and free of systemic adverse effects. It should be considered in patients who are intolerant to systemic therapy. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid appears to have a slower onset of action than intra-articular steroids, but the effects seem to last longer. The current evidence for the use of epidural steroid injections in the management of sciatica is conflicting and, until further larger studies become available, no firm recommendations can be made. There is, however, a limited body of evidence to support the use of epidural injections in spinal stenosis. The literature review suggests that assistive devices are widely used and that the ownership of devices increases with age. Such devices enable older people with chronic pain to live in the community. However, they do not necessarily reduce pain and can increase pain if used incorrectly. Increasing activity by way of exercise should be considered. This should involve strengthening, flexibility, endurance and balance, along with a programme of education. Patient preference should be given serious consideration. A number of complementary therapies have been found to have some efficacy among the older population, including acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and massage. Such approaches can affect pain and anxiety and are worth further investigation. Some psychological approaches have been found to be useful for the older population, including guided imagery, biofeedback training and relaxation. There is also some evidence supporting the use of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) among nursing home populations, but of course these approaches require training and time. There are many areas that require further research, including pharmacological management where approaches are often tested in younger populations and then translated across. Prevalence studies need consistency in terms of age, diagnosis and terminology, and further work needs to be done on evaluating non-pharmacological approaches.

### Interventions to support family caregivers in pain management: a systematic review [^114YZeMT]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Family caregivers encounter many challenges when managing pain for their loved ones. There is a lack of clear recommendations on how to prepare caregivers in pain management.

Objectives

To evaluate existing interventions that support family caregivers in providing pain management to patients with all disease types.

Methods

Four electronic databases were systematically searched (PubMed, Cumulative Index for Nursing Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, and Scopus) using index and keyword methods for articles published before December 2019. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess the quality.

Results

The search identified 6851 studies, and 25 studies met the inclusion criteria. Only two studies exclusively focused on noncancer populations (8%). Three types of interventions were identified in this review: educational interventions, cognitive-behavioral interventions, and technology-based interventions. Both educational and cognitive-behavioral interventions improved family caregiver and patient outcomes, but the content and intensity of these interventions in these studies varied widely, and there was a limited number of randomized clinical trials (68%). Hence, it is unclear what strategies are most effective to prepare family caregivers in pain management. Technology-based interventions were feasible to support family caregivers in providing pain management.

Conclusion

Providing adequate pain management training can improve patient and family caregiver outcomes. However, the most effective interventions for family caregivers are still unclear. More rigorous and replicable clinical trials are needed to examine the effects of educational interventions, cognitive-behavioral interventions, and technology-based interventions. Also, more studies are needed in patients with a noncancer diagnosis or multimorbidity.

### Effectiveness of communication strategies in the management of chronic postsurgical pain: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1113dkus]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Many risk factors for CPSP, such as demographic, clinical (eg, preoperative comorbidities or disability), and surgery-related factors, are not modifiable. Potentially modifiable factors such as psychological and behavioral factors (eg, depression, anxiety, kinesiophobia, or self-efficacy) may be mitigated by education and communication. Further, priming effects such as verbal suggestionmay be used to influence pain perception after surgery. Although guidelines recommend to screen for risk factors for CPSP before and after surgery and provide preoperative education including a pain management plan, to reduce the risk for CPSP, recommendations are less specific on how to effectively communicate with patients. In particular, ambiguous or frightful illness information and verbal suggestion have been found to activate pain memory and increase pain. Therefore, it has been suggested that clinicians should avoid negative verbal suggestions and ambiguous messages. At the same time, patients require adequate information and education about their condition, and insufficient communication may decrease the patient's satisfaction with pain management and result in distrust. Clinicians need to find a balance between providing accurate illness information (eg, during preoperative discussion of the procedure and potential complications) together with reassurance by reducing worries, showing empathy, and building a solid working relationship. Language is the main tool for communication between clinicians and patients. To date, the key determinants for communication that influences pain perception and reduce the risk for CPSP remain unclear.

The aim of this study is to systematically review the current evidence about the influence of communication strategies on the risk for CPSP. Further, we aim to identify promising or successful elements in patient-centered communication that may be recommended for clinical use.

### Management of postoperative pain: a clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Society, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, and the American society of anesthesiologists' committee on regional anesthesia, executive committee, and administrative council [^114Udqb4]. The Journal of Pain (2016). Medium credibility.

Postoperative pain assessment — Recommendation 5 specifies validated tools, prioritizes self-report, and cautions against sole reliance on "objective" signs: The panel recommends that clinicians use a validated pain assessment tool to track responses to postoperative pain treatments and adjust treatment plans accordingly (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Pain assessment and reassessment are required to provide optimal postoperative pain care, and because pain is inherently subjective, patient self-report is the primary basis of all pain assessments. For patients who cannot adequately report their pain because of cognitive deficits, sedation, developmental stage, or other factors, clinicians might need to use behavioral assessment tools and solicit input from caregivers to assess pain, and in all cases, clinicians should not rely solely on "objective" measures such as pain-related behaviors or vital signs in lieu of patient self-report because such measures are neither valid nor reliable. A number of pain assessment tools have been validated for accuracy and tested for interrater and intra-rater reliability, and they use methods including visual analogue scales, numeric or verbal rating scales, symbols, and others. The panel recommends that clinicians use a validated pain assessment tool, although there is inadequate evidence on the effects of different pain assessment tools on postoperative pain outcomes to guide recommendations on which specific tools to use, so selection should consider the patient's level of consciousness, educational level, and cultural and language differences. In children, the Pediatric Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials group suggests the use of the Face, Legs, Arms, Cry, Consolability and Parents Post-operative Pain Measure for assessing acute pain in preverbal and nonverbal children, and tools for intensive care units include the Behavioral Pain Scale and the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool.

### Dealing with chronic pain: tips to teach undergraduate health sciences students [^112oY8UF]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Educate the Patients and Involve Them in Pain Management

"Explain the pain" is important for changing the understanding of the biological processes that underpin pain. For this purpose, Pain Neuroscience Education (PNE) uses the current understanding of neuroscience to help reconceptualise the experience of pain. Translating this for the targeted culture is also important. In fact, PNE has become key to the successful management of chronic pain. When it is combined with other pain interventions, this approach has been associated with health-related cost reduction. Furthermore, PNE has demonstrated a positive effect on kinesiophobia, pain intensity, disability, or catastrophising, which are predictors of negative clinical evolution in chronic pain patients.

Therefore, it is essential to Training health science students in teach this patient-centred therapeutic approach is essential for improving care of future patients. The focus of such educational interventions is the understanding of the biological processes that are thought to underpin pain as a mechanism for reducing pain itself. A combination of different teaching resources to complement in-person pain education can be used, such as prepared pictures, presentation slides, drawings, infographics, metaphors, and books. Research demonstrates that education, as part of multidisciplinary programmes, is likely to improve self-management and self-efficacy in people with chronic pain.

When educating patients is a goal, research indicates that the most effective health promotional programmes for adults are social and educational group activities rather than individual health-focused interventions. Educational group actions can help improve aspects such as differences in coping strategies illness perceptions, self-efficacy, fear-avoidant beliefs, locus of control, and pain attitudes in different populations. However, when these actions are carried out, ethnic and cultural patient characteristics should be considered because these affect the pain beliefs, cognitions, and behaviours in those with chronic pain.

Clinical and research implications

We need to find ways to improve patient outcomes from surgery such as improving early post-operative rehabilitation to target early improvement, or prehabilitation to optimise preoperative patient health. Prehabilitation to address cardiovascular optimisation, endocrine diseases and baseline pain levels have shown positive impacts on post-operative outcomes and may be a consideration to support this group in waiting well for surgery. Recent evidence suggests a high certainty of prehabilitation programs leading to improvements in pain in patients undergoing lumbar surgery, and moderate-certainty evidence for improvements in health-related quality of life. In addition, we may also wish to consider who has surgery for LSS, as surgery may not provide as much benefit for those with predominant low back pain. Targeted education regarding post-operative expectations such as improvement in leg pain in contrast to back pain may help patients to better prepare for the surgery and recovery period. In addition, educating patients about the importance of national registries and data collection to facilitate better post-operative PROMS completion will improve the quality of BSR data and allow more meaningful interpretation of outcomes.

### Low-dose strength training in addition to neuromuscular exercise and education in patients with knee osteoarthritis in secondary care-a randomized controlled trial [^112Q7QhF]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the effects of lower limb strength training in addition to neuromuscular exercise and education (ST + NEMEX-EDU) compared to neuromuscular exercise and education alone (NEMEX-EDU) on self-reported physical function in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA).

Design

Patient-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT).

Methods

The trial included 90 patients in secondary care with radiographic and symptomatic KOA, ineligible for knee replacement. Both groups exercised twice weekly for 12 weeks. Additional strength training consisted of a single, fatiguing knee extension set (30–60RM) before four sets of leg-press (8–12RM). Primary outcome was the between-group difference on the subscale activities of daily living from the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS ADL) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included KOOS symptoms, pain, function in sport and recreation, and quality of life, 40 m walk, stair climb, leg extension power, EuroQol-5D-5L, pain medication usage, and adverse events.

Results

There was no statistically significant between-group difference in KOOS ADL at 12-weeks; adjusted mean difference -1.15 (-6.78 to 4.48). Except for the stair climb test, which demonstrated an adjusted mean difference of 1.15 (0.09–2.21) in favor of ST + NEMEX-EDU, all other outcomes showed no statistically significant between-group differences. Neither group improved leg extension power.

Conclusion

The addition of lower-limb strength training, using a low-dose approach, to neuromuscular exercise and education carried no additional benefits on self-reported physical function or on most secondary outcomes. Both groups displayed similar improvements at 12-week follow-up. Hence, the current low-dose strength training approach provided no additional clinical value in this group of KOA patients.

### Construction of pain management strategies after hepatectomy: evidence summary and Delphi study [^116j8ZHv]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Pain Education and Risk Control

Pain education should be integrated throughout the entire process from admission to discharge, which aims to help patients understand pain information, including pain mechanisms, pain assessment, and pain management, to promote effective pain control and improve their quality of life. Research has shown that pain education combined with psychological interventions can reduce pain intensity in patients with primary liver cancer. In addition, caregivers should be encouraged to participate in the pain management process, and medical staff should provide personalized postoperative pain management education centered on patients and families in various ways, such as face-to-face guidance, written materials, and videos. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine the comparative effectiveness of different educational interventions or recommend specific interventions.

Pain risk control is an important component of pain management and involves the identification, assessment, monitoring, and mitigation of potential risks to ensure patient safety, improve the effectiveness of pain treatment, and optimize the overall treatment experience for patients. Most of the analgesics are associated with serious side effects, such as NSAIDS can cause severe GI disturbance and opioids can cause addiction. For patients using drugs for postoperative analgesia, particularly in the first few hours after surgery, close monitoring should be conducted to determine the risk of severe GI disturbance, excessive sedation and respiratory depression. In addition, relevant contingency plans should be developed to ensure that risks are addressed quickly and effectively after they occur.

### Effectiveness of strategies for implementing guideline-concordant care in low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116EJMjR]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis included 27 studies investigating the effects of implementation strategies for low back pain guideline recommendations, targeting 7796 healthcare professionals overseeing 34,890 patients. Multifaceted strategies were most commonly evaluated, primarily targeting primary care professionals. Across studies, implementation strategies discouraged routine imaging use but did not improve the provision of patient education/advice or reduce analgesic use compared to no implementation strategy at the primary time point (low to moderate certainty evidence). Moreover, no evidence demonstrated that implementation strategies improved healthcare professionals' knowledge and beliefs, decreased patients' pain, or improved function at the primary time point.

This review found that implementation strategies were not consistently effective across recommendations and time points. This may reflect the range of barriers that healthcare professionals face when attempting to implement guideline recommendations for low back pain. Such barriers (e.g. lack of funding support to access to guideline-recommended treatment alternatives) are multiple and varied, arising from various sources, including patients and healthcare systems. Additionally, most included studies targeted strategies at healthcare professionals only, and did not address patients or health systems, likely affecting the success of the strategies. For example, previous literature has identified that patient's demands are a key barrier to reducing routine imagine use for low back pain. Although strategies did not target patients or their behaviours, it is possible that the implementation strategies supported healthcare professionals to educate patients about the potential harms of imaging, subsequently decreasing inappropriate imaging. But for other recommendations like reducing analgesic use, barriers may be more complicated, including a lack of alternative treatment options to manage patient's pain and workload pressures that prevent healthcare professionals from being able to engage in comprehensive conversations about deprescribing. As such, even if strategies intend to change healthcare professional's behaviour, without adequate support from healthcare systems, or buy-in from patients, guideline concordant care may not be able to be enacted. This may explain why the effectiveness of strategies was not observed in the medium-term.

### Preoperative pain neuroscience education for lumbar radiculopathy: a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 1-year follow-up [^111syssQ]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial on preoperative pain neuroscience education (NE) for lumbar radiculopathy.

Objective

To determine if the addition of NE to usual preoperative education would result in superior outcomes with regard to pain, function, surgical experience, and health care utilization postsurgery.

Summary Of Background Data

One in 4 patients after lumbar surgery (LS) for radiculopathy experience persistent pain and disability, which is nonresponsive to perioperative treatments. NE focusing on the neurophysiology of pain has been shown to decrease pain and disability in populations with chronic low back pain.

Methods

Eligible patients scheduled for LS for radiculopathy were randomized to receive either preoperative usual care (UC) or a combination of UC plus 1 session of NE delivered by a physical therapist (verbal one-on-one format) and a NE booklet. Sixty-seven patients completed the following outcomes prior to LS (baseline), and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after LS: low back pain (numeric rating scale), leg pain (numeric rating scale), function (Oswestry Disability Index), various beliefs and experiences related to LS (10-item survey with Likert scale responses), and postoperative utilization of health care (utilization of health care questionnaire).

Results

At 1-year follow-up, there were no statistical differences between the experimental and control groups with regard to primary outcome measure of low back pain (P = 0.183), leg pain (P = 0.075), and function (P = 0.365). In a majority of the categories regarding surgical experience, the NE group scored significantly better: better prepared for LS (P = 0.001); preoperative session preparing them for LS (P < 0.001) and LS meeting their expectations (P = 0.021). Health care utilization post-LS also favored the NE group (P = 0.007) resulting in 45% less health care expenditure compared with the control group in the 1-year follow-up period.

Conclusion

NE resulted in significant behavior change. Despite a similar pain and functional trajectory during the 1-year trial, patients with LS who received NE viewed their surgical experience more favorably and used less health care facility in the form of medical tests and treatments.

The Journal of Pain (2016). Medium credibility.

Preoperative education and perioperative pain management — The panel recommends that clinicians provide patient- and family-centered, individually tailored education to the patient (and/or responsible caregiver), including information on treatment options for management of postoperative pain, and document the plan and goals for postoperative pain management (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Individually tailored programs of education and support for patients with more intensive needs who undergo surgery are associated with beneficial effects including reduced postoperative opioid consumption, less preoperative anxiety, fewer requests for sedative medications, and reduced length of stay after surgery; although studies of patients without more intensive needs did not show beneficial clinical effects of preoperative educational interventions, the panel believes such interventions remain of value to inform patients and engage them in decision making. Educational interventions can range from single episodes of face-to-face instruction or provision of written materials, videos, audiotapes, or Web-based educational information to more intensive, multicomponent preoperative interventions including individualized and supervised exercise, education, and telephone calls, and there is insufficient evidence to determine the comparative effectiveness of different educational interventions or to recommend specific interventions.

### 2016 AHA / ACC guideline on the management of patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease: executive summary [^1115yZkp]. Vascular Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Structured exercise programs for peripheral artery disease (PAD) — definitions and recommendations are summarized as follows: A supervised exercise program takes place in a hospital or outpatient facility, uses intermittent walking exercise, is directly supervised by qualified healthcare provider(s), and training is performed for a minimum of 30–45 min/session; sessions are performed at least 3 times/wk for a minimum of 12 wk, with warm-up and cool-down periods preceding and following each walking session. A structured community- or home-based exercise program occurs in the personal setting of the patient, is self-directed with guidance of healthcare providers, prescribes a regimen similar to supervised programs, and may incorporate behavioral change techniques such as health coaching or activity monitors. Recommendations: In patients with claudication, a supervised exercise program is recommended to improve functional status and QoL and to reduce leg symptoms; a supervised exercise program should be discussed as a treatment option for claudication before possible revascularization; in patients with PAD, a structured community- or home-based exercise program with behavioral change techniques can be beneficial to improve walking ability and functional status; and in patients with claudication, alternative strategies of exercise therapy, including upper-body ergometry, cycling, and pain-free or low-intensity walking that avoids moderate-to-maximum claudication while walking, can be beneficial to improve walking ability and functional status.

### Interventions for the management of acute and chronic low back pain: revision 2021 [^114RkCD3]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Chronic low back pain — general education/advice as stand-alone versus combined interventions — shows limited benefit when used alone but may help when paired with exercise. Multiple trials found no additional benefit from "The Back Book" education alone, including RCTs with n = 126, n = 62, and n = 181, while an RCT in female health care workers (n = 219) reported a moderate benefit when neuromuscular exercise was combined with back care counseling for pain intensity (effect size = 0.7). In the updated search, 6 RCTs of stand-alone general education or advice largely found no additional benefit for pain and disability, whereas studies including exercise showed improvements when combined with education. Consistent with this, the 2021 recommendation states: Physical therapists may use standard education strategies for patients with chronic LBP, but not as a stand-alone treatment, and notes that standard strategies include advice related to exercise and advice about staying active.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^112jK66q]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Outcomes

Informed by the involvement of patients before the trial, the primary outcome was time to first resolution of sciatica symptoms, defined as "completely recovered" or "much better", measured on a 6-point ordinal scale and collected via text messages (or brief telephone calls). The scale's anchor was patients' baseline symptoms when they attended the SCOPiC research clinic. The text message read: "Compared to how you were at the SCOPiC clinic X weeks/months ago, how are your back and leg symptoms today?" Primary outcome data collection occurred weekly for the first 4 months for all participants, and then every 4 weeks between 4 and 12 months' follow-up, or until "stable resolution" of symptoms (defined as 2 consecutive months' responses of "completely recovered" or "much better").

Secondary clinical outcomes were collected at 4 and 12 months by use of self-completed postal questionnaires. These included: global perceived change (GPC; 6-point ordinal scale as per primary outcome data collection), physical function, overall impact of sciatica symptoms, back and leg pain intensity, sleep disturbance, fear of movement, anxiety and depression, risk of persistent back-pain related disability, health-related quality of life (EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L), general health, neuropathic pain symptoms, days lost from work and productivity loss due to sciatica, and satisfaction with care (appendix p 1). Furthermore, data were collected on health-care resource use and costs related to the delivery of the stratified care intervention and usual non-stratified care, over 12 months. Information was collected about serious adverse events and adverse events. Process outcomes included data on numbers of patients referred to physiotherapy and specialist spinal services, and were collected via patient questionnaires and hospital record reviews from participating NHS services. Where possible, we captured timing of referral and treatment.

We aimed to recruit 470 participants (see the statistical analysis plan in the appendix p 17 for further details) in order to detect a hazard ratio (HR) between 1·4 and 1·5 for time to resolution of symptoms (primary outcome) with 80–90% power, assuming an event (resolution) rate of 60% or greater over 12 months, 20% dropout, and intra-class correlation for clustering by physiotherapist at the level of 0·01 and allowing for a coefficient of variation in physiotherapist cluster size of 0·65.

### Self-management of chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis [^115ej1Bs]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis are two musculoskeletal problems that are highly prevalent in the general population, are frequently episodic and persistent, and are associated with high costs to society, both direct and indirect. This epidemiological picture provides the background that justifies the use of self-management strategies in managing these problems. For this Review, relevant systematic reviews were included that related to effectiveness; other study designs were included that addressed other aspects of the topic. The accepted definition of self-management includes liaison between health professionals and individuals with these problems, as well as independent health-promotion activities. Independent self-management strategies, such as exercise and self-medication, are practiced by individuals in the general population. Consistent evidence shows that self-management programs for osteoarthritis are effective in addressing pain and function, but effect sizes are small and might be clinically negligible. Educational programs for patients with back pain are effective in an occupational setting and if combined with an exercise program. Exercise is an effective strategy in the management of both chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis, although it is unclear what the optimum exercise is. Exercise, supported by advice and education, should be at the core of self-management strategies for chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^115CA11j]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Multimodal pain management — key points and patient counseling — emphasizes clear patient expectations, proactive assessment, scheduled nonopioid analgesics, and planned de-escalation. The page states to counsel patients that the goal of pain management is not eradication of all pain and to inform patients that pain is normal after trauma and surgery, medications are meant to alleviate but not remove pain entirely, and pain may increase as mobility increases. Key points include that patient education about expectations for management is a highly effective intervention for pain management, to promptly investigate the cause of increasing pain rather than responding by increasing the analgesic dose or adding new medications, to administer acetaminophen and ibuprofen "around-the-clock" to maintain a constant serum level, and to have a protocol for safe de-escalation of analgesics as quickly as possible. The page defines multimodal analgesia (MMA) as the use of multiple analgesics, regional analgesia, and nonpharmacologic interventions to affect peripheral and/or central nervous system loci in the pain pathway, and notes that the MMA concept may be applied across the care continuum with strategies suited to each phase of care.

### Impact of enhanced pain knowledge on core outcomes in fibromyalgia patients with high self-reported pain education needs: a target trial emulation using the DANFIB registry [^117T2ftQ]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Consistent with our findings, Mittinty et al reported that a self-reported positive influence of pain education on pain cognition and self-management strategies was associated with improved clinical outcomes in individuals with chronic pain. In this observational study, 40% of participants in the pain education programme reported that it did not change their understanding of pain or self-management strategies. The authors suggested that this concerning failure rate might partially reflect patients who already possessed a contemporary understanding of pain at the time of care, or more likely, variables influencing any educational intervention, such as content, context and the number of sessions. Additionally, this study found no association between other potentially confounding variables, including marital status, education level, and employment status, and clinical outcomes. The insight into the influence of the social and cultural context in which pain education occurs remains limited, with effectiveness evaluations traditionally focusing on changes in knowledge, attitudes and pain scores. Moreover, it is unclear whether dose–response relationships exist between the amount of information, reinforcement and support for learning, and patient outcomes, particularly in special populations, including minority groups, where language or cultural sensitivity might impact the adoption of self-management behaviours. The evidence supporting the effectiveness of booster sessions after self-management interventions as a means of maintaining self-management behaviours in the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain is likewise missing. Therefore, future research should focus on identifying which subgroups of fibromyalgia patients respond most favourably to specific types of pain educational programmes.

### Exercise for osteoarthritis of the knee [^112AjDBn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a major public health issue causing chronic pain, impaired physical function, and reduced quality of life. As there is no cure, self-management of symptoms via exercise is recommended by all current international clinical guidelines. This review updates one published in 2015.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the effects of land-based exercise for people with knee osteoarthritis (OA) by comparing: 1) exercise versus attention control or placebo; 2) exercise versus no treatment, usual care, or limited education; 3) exercise added to another co-intervention versus the co-intervention alone.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), together with reference lists, from the date of the last search (1st May 2013) until 4 January 2024, unrestricted by language.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated exercise for knee OA versus a comparator listed above. Our outcomes of interest were pain severity, physical function, quality of life, participant-reported treatment success, adverse events, and study withdrawals.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane for systematic reviews of interventions.

Main Results

We included 139 trials (12,468 participants): 30 (3065 participants) compared exercise to attention control or placebo; 60 (4834 participants) compared exercise with usual care, no intervention or limited education; and 49 (4569 participants) evaluated exercise added to another intervention (e.g. weight loss diet, physical therapy, detailed education) versus that intervention alone. Interventions varied substantially in duration, ranging from 2 to 104 weeks. Most of the trials were at unclear or high risk of bias, in particular, performance bias (94% of trials), detection bias (94%), selective reporting bias (68%), selection bias (57%), and attrition bias (48%). Exercise versus attention control/placebo Compared with attention control/placebo, low-certainty evidence indicates exercise may result in a slight improvement in pain immediately post-intervention (mean 8.70 points better (on a scale of 0 to 100), 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.70 to 11.70; 28 studies, 2873 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence indicates exercise likely results in an improvement in physical function (mean 11.27 points better (on a scale of 0 to 100), 95% CI 7.64 to 15.09; 24 studies, 2536 participants), but little to no improvement in quality of life (mean 6.06 points better (on a scale of 0 to 100), 95% CI -0.13 to 12.26; 6 studies, 454 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence that exercise likely increases participant-reported treatment success (risk ratio (RR) 1.46, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.92; 2 studies 364 participants), and likely does not increase study withdrawals (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.26; 29 studies, 2907 participants). There was low-certainty evidence that exercise may not increase adverse events (RR 2.02, 95% CI 0.62 to 6.58; 11 studies, 1684 participants). Exercise versus no treatment/usual care/limited education Compared with no treatment/usual care/limited education, low-certainty evidence indicates exercise may result in an improvement in pain immediately post-intervention (mean 13.14 points better (on a scale of 0 to 100), 95% CI 10.36 to 15.91; 56 studies, 4184 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence indicates exercise likely results in an improvement in physical function (mean 12.53 points better (on a scale of 0 to 100), 95% CI 9.74 to 15.31; 54 studies, 4352 participants) and a slight improvement in quality of life (mean 5.37 points better (on a scale of to 100), 95% CI 3.19 to 7.54; 28 studies, 2328 participants). There was low-certainty evidence that exercise may result in no difference in participant-reported treatment success (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.49; 3 studies, 405 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence that exercise likely results in no difference in study withdrawals (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.20; 53 studies, 4408 participants). There was low-certainty evidence that exercise may increase adverse events (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.17 to 8.57; 18 studies, 1557 participants). Exercise added to another co-intervention versus the co-intervention alone Moderate-certainty evidence indicates that exercise when added to a co-intervention likely results in improvements in pain immediately post-intervention compared to the co-intervention alone (mean 10.43 points better (on a scale of 0 to 100), 95% CI 8.06 to 12.79; 47 studies, 4441 participants). It also likely results in a slight improvement in physical function (mean 9.66 points better, 95% CI 7.48 to 11.97 (on a 0 to 100 scale); 44 studies, 4381 participants) and quality of life (mean 4.22 points better (on a 0 to 100 scale), 95% CI 1.36 to 7.07; 12 studies, 1660 participants) immediately post-intervention. There was moderate-certainty evidence that exercise likely increases participant-reported treatment success (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.24; 6 studies, 1139 participants), slightly reduces study withdrawals (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.97; 41 studies, 3502 participants), and slightly increases adverse events (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.76; 19 studies, 2187 participants). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression We did not find any differences in effects between different types of exercise, and we found no relationship between changes in pain or physical function and the total number of exercise sessions prescribed or the ratio (between exercise group and comparator) of real-time consultations with a healthcare provider. Clinical significance of the findings To determine whether the results found would make a clinically meaningful difference to someone with knee OA, we compared our results to established 'minimal important difference' (MID) scores for pain (12 points on a 0 to 100 scale), physical function (13 points), and quality of life (15 points). We found that the confidence intervals of mean differences either did not reach these thresholds or included both a clinically important and clinically unimportant improvement.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low- to moderate-certainty evidence that exercise probably results in an improvement in pain, physical function, and quality of life in the short-term. However, based on the thresholds for minimal important differences that we used, these benefits were of uncertain clinical importance. Participants in most trials were not blinded and were therefore aware of their treatment, and this may have contributed to reported improvements.

### Patient and lay carer education for preventing pressure ulceration in at-risk populations [^112mYFVk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pressure ulcers (PUs) are injuries to the skin and underlying tissues that occur most commonly over bony prominences, such as the hips and heels as a result of pressure and shear forces. PUs cause pain, discomfort, longer hospital stays, and decreased quality of life. They are also very costly to treat and consume substantial parts of healthcare budgets. PUs are largely preventable, and education targeted at patients and their carers is considered important.

Objectives

To assess the effects of patient and/or lay carer education on preventing pressure ulceration in at-risk people, in any care setting.

Search Methods

In June 2019 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase; Ovid PsycINFO and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited people of any age at risk of pressure ulceration, and RCTs that recruited people who informally care for someone at risk of pressure ulceration.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and GRADE assessment of the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 10 studies with 11 publications (2261 participants analysed). Seven targeted their intervention at people at risk of ulceration and measured outcomes on these at risk people; two targeted those at risk and their family carers and measured outcomes on the at risk people cared for by their families; and one targeted lay carers only and measured outcomes on the at risk people they cared for. There were two main types of interventions: the provision of information on prevention of pressure ulcers, and the use of different types of education programmes. Provision of information on the prevention of pressure ulcers Three studies (237 participants) reported data for this comparison: two provided information directly to those at risk and their carers, and the third provided information to lay carers. As data could not be pooled we present individual study data. The evidence for primary outcomes is of very low certainty (downgraded twice for study limitations and twice for imprecision). We are uncertain whether the combined use of a self-instruction manual and one-to-one patient training and counselling versus a self-instruction manual alone reduces the proportion of at risk people developing a new PU (risk ratio (RR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 1.18), or whether carer self-instruction and one-to-one counselling versus self-instruction alone reduces the proportion of at risk people developing a new PU (RR 2.05, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.70). We are uncertain whether the use of home-based training, compared with routine ward-based training, reduces the proportion of at risk people developing a new PU (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.02). One study explored the secondary outcome patient knowledge of pressure ulcer prevention; however, as usable data were not provided, we were unable to carry out further analysis, and no effect estimate could be calculated. Educational programmes on the prevention of pressure ulcers Seven studies (2024 participants analysed) provided data for this comparison. In all studies the intervention was aimed at people at risk of ulceration. Risk of pressure ulceration One secondary report of an included study reported the primary outcome as time to PU development or occurrence and three studies and one secondary report of an included study reported this as the proportion of at risk people developing a new PU. One study reported the secondary outcome grade of PU and five studies and one secondary report of an included study reported on patient knowledge. There is low certainty evidence of there being no clear difference in the proportion of participants developing a new PU between use of a pressure ulcer prevention care bundle (PUPCB) and standard care: HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.33 (downgraded twice for imprecision). One secondary report of an included study explored whether individualised PU education and monthly structured telephone follow-up reduces the mean time to PU occurrence. Not all participants in this study developed a pressure ulcer, therefore the mean time to pressure ulcer occurrence could not be calculated from the data. We are uncertain whether the following three interventions reduce the proportion of at risk people developing a new PU as we assessed the certainty of evidence as very low: individualised PU education and monthly structured telephone follow-up (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.30), education delivery (RR 3.57, 95% CI 0.78 to 16.38), (downgraded twice for risk of bias and twice for imprecision); and computerised feedback and one-to-one consultations (no clear data provided), (downgraded twice for risk of bias and once for indirectness). Grade of pressure ulcer There is low certainty evidence that use of a PU prevention care bundle may make no difference to the severity of new PU development when compared with standard care. Patient knowledge We are uncertain whether the following interventions improve patient knowledge: enhanced educational intervention and structured follow-up (mean difference (MD) 9.86, 95% CI 1.55 to 18.17); multi component motivational interviewing/self-management with a multi component education intervention (no clear data provided); Spinal Cord Injury Navigator programme (no clear data provided); individualised PU education and monthly structured telephone follow-up (no clear data provided); computerised feedback (no clear data provided), structured, patient-centric PU prevention education event (MD 30.15, 95% CI 23.56 to 36.74). We assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as low or very low (downgraded for risk of bias, imprecision, or indirectness).

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain whether educational interventions make any difference to the number of new PUs that develop, or to patient knowledge based on evidence from the 10 included studies, which we assessed as of low or very low certainty due to problems with risk of bias, serious imprecision and indirectness. The low certainty of evidence means that additional research is required to confirm these results.

### Complex interventions for preventing diabetic foot ulceration [^111YznEG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Ulceration of the feet, which can lead to the amputation of feet and legs, is a major problem for people with diabetes mellitus, and can cause substantial economic burden. Single preventive strategies have not been shown to reduce the incidence of foot ulceration to a significant extent. Therefore, in clinical practice, preventive interventions directed at patients, healthcare providers and/or the structure of health care are often combined (complex interventions).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of complex interventions in the prevention of foot ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus compared with single interventions, usual care or alternative complex interventions. A complex intervention is defined as an integrated care approach, combining two or more prevention strategies on at least two different levels of care: the patient, the healthcare provider and/or the structure of health care.

Search Methods

For the second update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 22 May 2015), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), The Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), The NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 22 May 2015), Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 21 May, 2015), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 21 May, 2015) and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 22 May, 2015).

Selection Criteria

Prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared the effectiveness of combinations of preventive strategies, not solely patient education, for the prevention of foot ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus, with single interventions, usual care or alternative complex interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors were assigned to independently select studies, to extract study data and to assess risk of bias of included studies, using predefined criteria.

Main Results

Only six RCTs met the criteria for inclusion. The study characteristics differed substantially in terms of healthcare settings, the nature of the interventions studied and outcome measures reported. In three studies that compared the effect of an education-centred complex intervention with usual care or written instructions, only little evidence of benefit was found. Three studies compared the effect of more intensive and comprehensive complex interventions with usual care. One study found a significant and cost-effective reduction, one of lower extremity amputations (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.71). One other study found a significant reduction of both amputation and foot ulcers. The last study reported improvement of patients' self care behaviour. All six included RCTs were at high risk of bias, with hardly any of the predefined quality assessment criteria met.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no high-quality research evidence evaluating complex interventions for preventing diabetic foot ulceration and insufficient evidence of benefit.

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guideline on the management of intermittent claudication: focused update [^112Snqnj]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guideline — revascularization on patients with asymptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) or in intermittent claudication (IC) based solely on hemodynamic measurements, imaging findings, or to modify disease progression — is paired with the alternative strategy of management without revascularization. The desirable effect of avoiding potential major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major adverse limb events (MALE) would be perceived as substantial, although evidence supporting this benefit when the indication is only based on hemodynamics is unclear, while the undesirable effects of unnecessary revascularization in asymptomatic patients or those with mild IC are important. Little data specifically demonstrates how much patients value avoiding unnecessary procedures or fear disease progression; patients value avoiding unnecessary procedures defined as ones which are not shown to improve duration or quality of life (QoL), and when properly educated on the natural history of asymptomatic PAD, as well as the risks of intervention, patients uniformly choose medical management and do not desire intervention. The potential risk of MACE and MALE with lower extremity PAD are well described, and the natural history of the limb as well as systemic cardiovascular risk in patients with asymptomatic PAD are also well-described. Savings would be anticipated with the nonoperative approach due to avoidance of initial revascularization procedures and follow-up care, including potential for reinterventions. The approach would mitigate health inequities as some data suggests minority populations more often undergo revascularization for IC, although the rates of revascularization for asymptomatic disease are not known as payment for these procedures would not be covered, and documentation for some patients with asymptomatic disease undergoing intervention may not be accurate. Physicians will likely oppose broad limitations on care that do not allow for physician and patient discretion but should support education for evidence-based care in order to avoid unnecessary procedures, and patient education is required to dispel misguided patient concerns which may contribute to the expectation of revascularization in the setting of asymptomatic or mild PAD.

### Non-surgical interventions for preventing contralateral tissue loss and amputation in dysvascular patients with a primary major lower limb amputation [^112kc7FQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Major lower limb amputation (LLA, above the ankle) is performed for people with intractable pain, life-threatening infections, or non-functional limbs. Of 7500 LLAs carried out in England between 2015 and 2018, the majority of these were performed in dysvascular patients. Dysvascularity is the absence of adequate blood supply to maintain a limb's usual function (ischaemia, usually caused by peripheral arterial disease or diabetes mellitus), ultimately leading to pain and tissue injury (ulcers, gangrene, sometimes referred to as tissue loss). Among those who undergo dysvascular LLA, 5.7% and 11.5% will likely undergo contralateral LLA at one and five years respectively, which is associated with greater disability and lower likelihood of returning to work, increasing the psychological burden to the patient and socioeconomic cost to the patient and health service. While extensive research has been carried out in the management of peripheral arterial disease and the care of diabetic feet, there are no guidelines for practice on prevention of contralateral amputation.

Objectives

To assess the effects of non-surgical interventions versus placebo, no intervention, or other non-surgical interventions on contralateral limb (CLL) tissue loss and amputation in dysvascular patients with a primary major LLA.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PEDro databases and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers until 20 March 2023. We also checked the references of identified studies and contacted study authors and manufacturers of relevant products.

Eligibility Criteria

We aimed to include all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (e.g. randomised by birthdate) comparing the effectiveness of a non-surgical intervention with placebo, no intervention, or other non-surgical intervention, in adults with a primary major LLA due to dysvascularity. Interventions could be physical, pharmacological, educational, behavioural, or organisational, and delivered by a healthcare professional or carer.

Outcomes

Our critical and important outcomes of interest were as follows. Critical outcomes
- Incidence of new localised tissue injury or ulceration (tissue loss) of the CLL, regardless of stage or classification at given time points.
- Time to the development of any localised tissue injury or ulceration (tissue loss) of the CLL, regardless of stage or classification.
- Incidence of new minor amputation (through the ankle, foot, or toe(s)) of the CLL at given time points.
- Time to new minor amputation (through the ankle, foot, or toe(s)) of the CLL.
- Incidence of new major amputation (whole limb or partial limb, above the ankle) of the CLL at given time points.
- Time to new major amputation (whole limb or partial limb, above the ankle) of the CLL. Important outcomes
- Survival (time to death from all causes) at 12 months.
- Patient-reported outcome measures of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using validated scales such as the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) and EQ-5D.
- Adverse events (e.g. infections in the CLL).
- Hospital readmission.

Risk Of Bias

We used Cochrane's RoB 1 tool to assess risk of bias in the included study.

Synthesis Methods

We were only able to perform a narrative review due to lack of data. We reported risk ratios (RR) with 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Included Studies

We found one eligible study, which compared electrostimulation of the gastrocnemius muscle and standard rehabilitation against standard rehabilitation in 50 dysvascular amputees.

Synthesis Of Results

There was no new incidence of tissue loss reported. The following outcomes were not reported: time to new tissue loss; time to and incidence of minor amputation; HRQoL outcomes; adverse events; and hospital readmissions. Electrostimulation was associated with a three-fold reduction in the incidence of new major amputation of the CLL (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.99), although time to new major amputation was not reported. There was no difference between groups in 12-month survival (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.18). We judged the overall certainty of the evidence (GRADE) as very low across all outcomes, with unclear risk of selection and detection bias and high risk of performance bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite the care of the CLL being identified as a key research priority by two separate consensus papers, there is insufficient high-quality evidence to address this priority to date. We found only a single RCT suitable for inclusion, and this study was subject to risk of bias. Contralateral limb outcomes should be recorded in future research on dysvascular amputees. Until better evidence and clearer recommendations are available, this topic is likely to remain a research priority.

### Pain in hemodialysis patients: prevalence, cause, severity, and management [^117TY8Ka]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Background

There is growing evidence that dialysis patients have a high burden of symptoms, including pain. However, the prevalence, cause, severity, and management of pain in dialysis patients have not been described.

Methods

This prospective cohort study of 205 Canadian hemodialysis (HD) patients describes the prevalence, cause, severity, and management of pain in this population. A chart review for demographic and clinical data was conducted, and patients completed a questionnaire that incorporated the Brief Pain Inventory, followed by the McGill Pain Questionnaire.

Results

One hundred three patients (50%) reported a problem with pain. Patients with pain had been on HD therapy longer (52.2 months) than those without pain (37.7 months). Causes of pain were diverse, and 18.4% of patients had more than a single cause of their pain. Musculoskeletal pain was most common (50.5%) and equal in severity to pain associated with peripheral neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease. Fifty-five percent of patients with pain rated their worst episode in the previous 24 hours as severe. Thirty-two percent of patients with pain were administered no analgesics, 29.1% were administered nonopioid analgesics, 26.2% were administered weak opioids, and 9.7% were administered strong opioids. The Pain Management Index describes the effectiveness of pain management and was negative in 74.8% of patients, indicating ineffective management.

Conclusion

Pain is a significant problem in more than 50% of HD patients and is not being effectively managed. The development of effective pain management strategies, underpinned by appropriate training and education, is necessary to improve the quality of life for dialysis patients.

### Infographic. exercise for intermittent claudication [^116nUwUp]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Intermittent claudication (IC) is pain or discomfort in the muscles of the calf, thigh or buttock that occurs during walking and is relieved by rest. It affects 4% of people over 60 years of age and is the most common symptom of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). For people with IC, the goals of treatment are twofold: (1) secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease through management of risk factors (eg, tobacco use, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, hypertension and physical inactivity); (2) improving functional status, with treatment options including exercise training, revascularisation and vasodilator therapy.

In 2012, the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence published a clinical guideline on the diagnosis and management of PAD. This guideline recommended that a 3-month supervised exercise programme (SEP) should be offered as a first-line therapy for IC, and that revascularisation and vasodilator therapy should only be considered if exercise provides insufficient symptom relief. Although research studies have shown unsupervised exercise to be generally less effective at improving functional status than an SEP, it can still be effective, and should be recommended if an SEP is not available.

The evidence supporting the efficacy of exercise for people with IC dates back to 1966 when a study reported that 6 months of interval walking exercise improved patients' pain-free and maximum walking distances. Over the following 50+ years, numerous randomised trials and meta-analyses have been published supporting the efficacy of exercise in improving functional status in this population. Despite this evidence and the clinical guideline recommendations, the provision of SEPs is variable, with one study reporting that only 38.5% of vascular units in the UK had access to an SEP. Potential barriers include a lack of funding, facilities and patient motivation.

The benefits of exercise for people with IC are too great to be ignored. Therefore, to support the provision and uptake of exercise, we have developed two new resources. First, a statement for healthcare professionals that summarises the evidence and provides exercise prescription guidelines. Second, an infographic of key messages aimed primarily at patients. This infographic, which may be shared digitally or used as a poster or handout in clinics, aims to encourage patients to make exercising a regular habit by highlighting potential benefits and providing clear guidelines and safety messages. We hope that readers will share this infographic widely to enhance awareness of this debilitating condition and the important role that exercise can play in its management.

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guideline on the management of intermittent claudication: focused update [^114m2xav]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Revascularization for claudication — shared decision-making should include a comprehensive assessment of the patient's treatment goals, risk factors, presumed benefits, and undesirable outcomes, and lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation and healthy diet, optimal medical therapy (OMT), and a trial of exercise therapy should be initial steps in all patients, in addition to education. Presumed benefits include Improved Walking Distance, Improved Quality of Life, and Improved CV Health & Lifespan. Undesired outcomes include both short-term complications and, more commonly, recurrence of symptoms or need for reintervention; short-term events include peri-procedural morbidity, including Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) or Major Adverse Limb Events (MALE), whereas long-term adverse events attributable to revascularization are primarily limb-related. The balance between presumed benefits and undesirable outcomes is influenced by patient-specific risk factors (eg, comorbidities, anatomic complexity) and trade-offs inherent in the mode of revascularization under consideration, taken within the context of the patient's values and preferences.

### Spinal pain: current understanding, trends, and the future of care [^113xm6dv]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Goals and process of spinal pain management

MoC (Model of Care) can help to address the burden of service gaps in musculoskeletal health. An MoC is an evidence-based strategy, framework, or pathway that outlines the optimal manner in which care for specific types or groups of conditions should be made available and delivered to consumers. An MoC aims to

… include contemporary evidence with a framework to meet the current and projected community needs, within the context of local operational requirements.

Importantly, an MoC is not an clinical practice guideline. Attention needs to be given to not only effective evidence-based management but also to other factors, such as poor lifestyle, lack of exercise, and patient education. In addition, management of persistent and/or complex spinal pain requires timely follow-up and ongoing consumer participation in their care, which usually needs ongoing supervision, ie, coaching. Management of a person with pain is, therefore, a series of ongoing activities that requires continuing input and participation by both the consumer and the multidisciplinary health care team, respectively. Guidelines on these activities would be included in an MoC document, thereby offering an outline of consumer's care journey.

The goals, then, of an evidence-based MoC would be to:
Broaden care services to span from hospital-based to community-based services with a view to improve and facilitate earlier access to care, embrace a wider relevant workforce, and contain costs by attempting to avoid hospitalization, unnecessary investigations, and possibly long waiting times for appointments;
Expand care services across hospital-based and community-based services with a view to improve and facilitate earlier access to care, embrace a wider relevant workforce, and contain costs by attempting to avoid hospitalization, unnecessary investigations, and long waiting times for specialist appointments;
Orchestrate a multidisciplinary approach to care, thereby offering care tailored to the individual needs of the person with pain, which is likely to produce the best possible clinical outcomes. Depending on the complexity of the case, this may include referral to a secondary or tertiary hospital for procedures and/or relevant investigations;
Facilitate quicker and early access of persons with spinal pain to assessment and appropriate care, guided by triage and diagnosis, so to reduce the duration of morbidity and attempt to avoid chronicity of pain. Avoiding, or at least managing, persistent pain would likely have significant cost savings; and
Disseminate information and educate a) the public, b) consumers, and c) health care professionals regarding the best practice management of spinal pain.

### Do we really apply evidence-based-recommendations to spine surgery? Results of an international survey [^117Lcm3T]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

One concern supported by this survey is how EBM is perceived across geographical regions. As noted in the Results, spinal surgeons from Asia and Africa answered less accurately on EBM's correct definition and use than those of North America and Europe. Since EBM can be successfully applied in spine surgery, future training and education must incorporate the teaching of proper EBM understanding and implementation. The incorporation of EBM in education and training is supported by current literature. Furthermore, it may be worth it for spinal surgeons to use social media, conferences, or training online to integrate EBM education opportunities to more easily reach underdeveloped regions of the world and provide opportunities for those who were unable to acquire this education during their medical schooling.

Low back pain is one of the most common reasons for applying to a spinal surgeon. However, the order of obtaining further diagnostic imaging modalities in the absence of red flags remains a debate. Most of the participants opted to obtain an MRI. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against obtaining imaging in the absence of red flags and the type of imaging. A striking difference was observed in the imaging modality amongst geographical locations. While most participants from North America and Europe opted for an MRI, most respondents from Asia and Africa stated they'd prefer an X-ray/CT before an MRI. This may be due to a higher availability of X-ray/CT compared to MRI in regions from responders who were less likely to order an MRI; alternatively, the recommendation for X-ray/CT instead of MRI could be if a patient does not present with any red flags with lower back pain that warrants an MRI. Thus, X-ray/CT is chosen first. Another clinical scenario evaluated was an extruded disc with no leg pain. These patients sometimes undergo unnecessary surgery due to radiological findings; however, most of the respondents opted for physical and medical therapy. The notion of "treat the patient, not the image" has been well settled in the spine surgery society. However, the debate of "what to treat with physical and medical therapy if no leg pain is present" arises at this point.

### Development of an assessment schedule for patients with low back-associated leg pain in primary care: a Delphi consensus study [^115fQThE]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

The development of the clinical assessment for patients with LBP and leg pain by consensus is important to improve management of patients with LBP-associated leg pain. First, such assessment criteria will enable more accurate and appropriate inclusion into research studies, ensuring that a full spectrum of symptoms is captured. Second, this will enable the development of classification criteria for the presence or absence of nerve root involvement in unselected primary care populations with back and leg pain. Ultimately, the goal is to provide a more valid assessment, feasible and appropriate for primary care that distinguishes between non-specific LBP and leg pain and LBP with nerve root pain. This should enable practitioners to offer more appropriate treatment for each group and to test whether management options should differ between the groups.

As part of an ongoing spinal research programme, we plan a clinical epidemiology cohort study investigating prognostic indicators of outcome in adults presenting in primary care with low back and leg pain. In this article, we describe the process of developing a standardised clinical assessment to be used in the cohort study and the derivation of the items of the clinical assessment which contribute most to a diagnosis of nerve root involvement.

The objectives of this study were to develop consensus on the content of the clinical assessment of adults presenting to primary care with low back and leg pain and to identify the items from history and clinical examination that contribute most to the diagnosis of low back and leg pain that is due to spinal nerve root involvement.

### Leg-length discrepancy after total hip arthroplasty [^111Xbjux]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Leg-length discrepancy after total hip arthroplasty can pose a substantial problem for the orthopaedic surgeon. Such discrepancy has been associated with complications including nerve palsy, low back pain, and abnormal gait. Careful preoperative measurement and assessment, as well as preoperative and postoperative patient education, are important factors in achieving an acceptable result. However, after total hip arthroplasty, equal leg length should not be guaranteed. Rather, the patient should be given a realistic assessment of what can reasonably be expected.

### Interventions for helping people adhere to compression treatments for venous leg ulceration [^116PccVQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic venous ulcer healing is a complex clinical problem that requires intervention from skilled, costly, multidisciplinary wound-care teams. Compression therapy has been shown to help heal venous ulcers and to reduce recurrence. It is not known which interventions help people adhere to compression treatments. This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of interventions designed to help people adhere to venous leg ulcer compression therapy, to improve healing and prevent recurrence after healing.

Search Methods

In June 2015, for this first update, we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. We also searched trial registries, and reference lists of relevant publications for published and ongoing trials. There were no language or publication date restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions that aim to help people with venous leg ulcers adhere to compression treatments compared with usual care, or no intervention, or another active intervention. Our main outcomes were ulcer healing, ulcer recurrence, quality of life, pain, adherence to compression therapy and number of people with adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of each included trial, and assessed overall quality of evidence for the main outcomes in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

One randomised controlled trial was added to this update making a total of three. One ongoing study was also identified. One trial (67 participants) compared a community-based Leg Club® that provided mechanisms for peer-support, assistance with goal setting and social interaction with home-based care. There was no clear difference in healing rates at three months (12/28 people healed in Leg Club group versus 7/28 in home-based care group; risk ratio (RR) 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 3.71); or six months (15/33 healed in Leg Club group versus 10/34 in home-based care group; RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.93); or in quality of life outcomes at six months (MD 0.85 points, 95% CI -0.13 to 1.83; 0 to 10 point scale). The Leg Club may lead to a small reduction in pain at six months, that may not be clinically significant (MD -12.75 points, 95% CI -24.79, -0.71; 0 to 100 point scale, 15 point reduction is usually considered the minimal clinically important difference) (low quality evidence downgraded for risk of selection bias and imprecision). Another trial (184 participants) compared a community-based, nurse-led self-management programme of six months' duration promoting physical activity (walking and leg exercises) and adherence to compression therapy via counselling and behaviour modification (Lively Legs®) with usual care in a wound clinic. At 18 months follow-up, there were no clear differences in healing rates (51/92 healed in Lively Legs group versus 41/92 in usual care group; RR 1.24 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.67)); rates of recurrence of venous leg ulcers (32/69 with recurrence in Lively Legs group versus 38/67 in usual care group; RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.14)); or adherence to compression therapy (42/92 people fully adherent in Lively Legs group versus 41/92 in usual care group; RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.41)). The evidence from this trial was also downgraded to low quality due to risk of selection bias and imprecision. A single study compared patient education delivered via video with education delivered by text (pamphlet). However, no outcomes relevant to this review were reported. We found no studies that investigated other interventions to promote adherence to compression therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

It is unclear whether interventions designed to help people adhere to compression therapy improve venous ulcer healing and reduce recurrence. There is a lack of trials of interventions that promote adherence to compression therapy for venous ulcers.

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guideline on the management of intermittent claudication: focused update [^112T8fFj]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Intermittent claudication home-based exercise therapy — program design and certainty: Overall, the certainty of available evidence was very low due to precision and study design limitations. To support successful implementation of a HET program, tracking exercise with an activity monitor and use of behavioral change strategies (such as goal-setting, periodic check-ins, and coaching) are recommended. Effective exercise programs should be followed for at least 12 weeks and should consist of five sessions per week, up to 50 minutes per session, where patients walk at a pace that induces ischemic symptoms. They should use some sort of activity monitor and set goals for tracking progress, and patients should receive some type of check-in; the optimal frequency and details remain unclear, but some in-person visits are advised.

### Interventions for helping people adhere to compression treatments for venous leg ulceration [^115HKVSs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic venous ulcer healing is a complex clinical problem that requires intervention from skilled, costly, multidisciplinary wound-care teams. Compression therapy has been shown to help heal venous ulcers and to reduce the risk of recurrence. It is not known which interventions help people adhere to compression treatments.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of interventions designed to help people adhere to venous leg ulcer compression therapy, and thus improve healing of venous leg ulcers and prevent their recurrence after healing.

Search Methods

In May 2013 we searched The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; EBSCO CINAHL; trial registries, and reference lists of relevant publications for published and ongoing trials. There were no language or publication date restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions that help people with venous leg ulcers adhere to compression treatments compared with usual care, or no intervention, or another active intervention. Our main outcomes were number of people with ulcers healed, recurrence, time to complete healing, quality of life, pain, adherence to compression therapy and number of people with adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of each included trial, and assessed overall quality of evidence for the main outcomes in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

Low quality evidence from one trial (67 participants) indicates that, compared with home-based care, a community-based Leg Club® clinic that provided mechanisms for peer-support, assistance with goal setting and social interaction did not result in superior healing rates at three months (12/28 people healed in Leg Club clinic group versus 7/28 in home-based care group; risk ratio (RR) 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 3.71); or six months (15/33 healed in Leg Club group versus 10/34 in home-based care group; RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.93); or in improved quality of life outcomes at six months (MD 0.85 points, 95% CI -0.13 to 1.83; 0 to 10 point scale). However, the Leg Club resulted in a statistically significant reduction in pain at six months (MD -12.75 points, 95% CI -24.79, -0.71; 0 to 100 point scale), although this was not considered a clinically important difference. Time to complete healing, recurrence of ulcers, adherence and adverse events were not reported. Low quality evidence from another trial (184 participants) indicates that, compared with usual care in a wound clinic, a community-based and nurse-led self-management programme of six months' duration promoting physical activity (walking and leg exercises) and adherence to compression therapy via counselling and behaviour modification (Lively Legs®) may not result in superior healing rates at 18 months (51/92 healed in Lively Legs group versus 41/92 in usual care group; RR 1.24 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.67)); may not result in reduced rates of recurrence of venous leg ulcers at 18 months (32/69 with recurrence in Lively Legs group versus 38/67 in usual care group; RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.14)); and may not result in superior adherence to compression therapy at 18 months (42/92 people fully adherent in Lively Legs group versus 41/92 in usual care group; RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.41)). Time to complete healing, quality of life, pain and adverse events were not reported. We found no studies that investigated other interventions to promote adherence to compression therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a paucity of trials of interventions that promote adherence to compression therapy for venous ulcers. Low quality evidence from two trials was identified: one promoting adherence via socialisation and support (Leg Club®), and the other promoting adherence to compression, leg exercises and walking via counselling and behaviour modification (Lively Legs®). These trials did not reveal a benefit of community-based clinics over usual care in terms of healing rates, prevention of recurrence of venous leg ulcers, or quality of life. One trial indicated a small, but possibly clinically unimportant, reduction in pain, while adverse events were not reported. The small number of participants may have a hidden real benefit, or an increase in harm. Due to the lack of reliable evidence, at present it is not possible either to recommend or discourage nurse clinic care interventions over standard care.

### Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication [^112N3QA6]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery — recommendations for management of asymptomatic disease: 3.1 We recommend multidisciplinary comprehensive smoking cessation interventions for patients with asymptomatic PAD who use tobacco (repeatedly until tobacco use has stopped) (Grade 1, Level of evidence A); 3.2 We recommend providing education about the signs and symptoms of PAD progression to asymptomatic patients with PAD (Grade 1, Level of evidence Ungraded); 3.3 We recommend against invasive treatments for PAD in the absence of symptoms, regardless of hemodynamic measures or imaging findings demonstrating PAD (Grade 1, Level of evidence B). Supporting evidence summaries state that smoking cessation reduces overall mortality and morbidity in smokers in general (quality of evidence A) and that there are no data on benefits and harms of surveillance for serial ABI testing in asymptomatic PAD (quality of evidence C).
