## Question

What antibiotics for aspirational pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about empiric antibiotic selection for aspiration pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing aspiration pneumonitis from aspiration pneumonia. Then, I should verify the modern microbiology and guideline stance on anaerobic coverage. Next, I will stratify by setting and severity, including CAP, HAP/VAP, and ICU-specific issues. After that, I should outline empiric regimens and durations, followed by de-escalation and stewardship. Finally, I will consider special populations and close with a concise synthesis and safety checks, making sure I anchor each step to high-quality guidelines and contemporary evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundational distinction, because if I get this wrong, everything downstream will be off. Aspiration pneumonitis is a chemical injury from gastric contents and is typically self-limited; antibiotics are not indicated initially, whereas aspiration pneumonia is a bacterial infection requiring antibiotics, and the two are frequently conflated in practice, which drives overtreatment [^1168zSU9] [^1167XRej].

> Wait, let me verify the modern microbiology before jumping to regimens. Historically, anaerobes were thought to predominate, but recent prospective and molecular studies show anaerobes are uncommon isolates in aspiration pneumonia, with aerobes like Streptococcus pneumoniae, gram-negative bacilli, and Staphylococcus aureus more prominent, especially in severe disease and healthcare-associated settings; anaerobes are more relevant when there is necrosis, abscess, or empyema [^1125UkiM] [^1168zSU9] [^111Vs8ak].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about adding anaerobic coverage. I should confirm guideline direction. The 2019 ATS/IDSA CAP guideline recommends not routinely adding anaerobic coverage for suspected aspiration pneumonia unless lung abscess or empyema is suspected, and the 2023 BTS clinical statement aligns with this approach, emphasizing standard CAP therapy rather than anti-anaerobic expansion; contemporary European guidance for severe CAP similarly supports standard CAP regimens without specific anti-anaerobic targeting [^1168zSU9] [^115Lwwfx].

> I need to check the comparative effectiveness data to ensure this is not just dogma. Large retrospective cohorts using a target-trial framework show no mortality benefit for extended anaerobic coverage versus limited anaerobic coverage in community-acquired aspiration pneumonia, but they do show a higher risk of Clostridioides difficile with extended anaerobic therapy; this strengthens the case against routine anaerobic coverage in typical cases [^115TU8kf] [^113bfzA8] [^113TjUoK].

> Next, I should review setting and severity, because empiric choices hinge on these axes. For community-acquired aspiration pneumonia without severe illness or MRSA/Pseudomonas risk factors, standard CAP regimens suffice. For severe CAP or healthcare-associated pneumonia, broader coverage for resistant gram-negatives and MRSA may be warranted. In the ICU, I must also consider dynamic microbiota shifts with mechanical ventilation that reduce anaerobes and increase gram-negatives, arguing against routine anaerobic coverage and for early lower respiratory sampling when feasible [^1168zSU9] [^111oX58p] [^1128hi7B].

> Let me think about concrete empiric regimens for community-acquired aspiration pneumonia. Reasonable first-line options with limited anaerobic activity include ceftriaxone or levofloxacin. Amoxicillin-clavulanate provides broader anaerobic coverage but should be reserved for specific contexts such as abscess or empyema suspicion, not used routinely. Macrolides can be added for atypical coverage when clinically indicated, and duration is typically 5 days if the patient improves, extending only if there is slow response or complications [^1168zSU9] [^113bfzA8] [^116N89Kk].

> For hospital-acquired or severe cases, I should confirm when to broaden. If there are risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas, or if the patient is in septic shock or requires ICU care, regimens may need anti-MRSA and antipseudomonal coverage. However, I need to ensure I do not reflexively add anaerobic coverage unless there is radiographic or clinical evidence of abscess or empyema, consistent with IDSA/ATS guidance for HAP/VAP and severe CAP pathways [^1168zSU9].

> I will now examine ICU-specific considerations, because practice often diverges from evidence here. Many ICU patients with suspected aspiration receive unnecessary antibiotics for pneumonitis; early bronchoscopy can help distinguish pneumonitis from pneumonia and enable targeted therapy or cessation when cultures are negative; additionally, anaerobes diminish rapidly after intubation, so routine anti-anaerobic therapy is often misdirected in ventilated patients, reinforcing a stewardship-minded approach [^116dkVcF] [^1128hi7B] [^1167XRej].

> Next, I should review de-escalation and stewardship, since empiric therapy is often broader than necessary. Obtaining sputum or lower respiratory samples before antibiotics when feasible, reassessing at 48–72 hours, and narrowing or stopping therapy based on cultures and clinical response reduces adverse events and resistance; BTS also supports a 5-day course for most improving patients with aspiration pneumonia, with longer durations reserved for slow response or complications [^111oX58p] [^111Ewmrk] [^116N89Kk].

> But wait, what about special populations where practice differs from adults with CAP. In stroke-associated pneumonia, consensus favors treating like CAP early after stroke and avoiding routine anaerobic coverage. In children with neurologic impairment, observational data suggest worse outcomes with gram-negative–only regimens and support including anaerobic coverage, though high-quality pediatric guidelines are limited. In drowning, empiric antibiotics are not recommended initially because radiographic infiltrates are often chemical pneumonitis rather than infection [^113gptdE] [^112QZLkz] [^113nCNyU].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize to ensure internal consistency. For most adults with community-acquired aspiration pneumonia, use standard CAP therapy without routine anaerobic coverage, reserving amoxicillin-clavulanate, clindamycin, or metronidazole add-ons for suspected abscess or empyema. In severe or healthcare-associated cases, broaden for resistant gram-negatives and MRSA as indicated, but still avoid reflex anaerobic therapy. In the ICU, prioritize early diagnostic clarification and de-escalation, recognizing the rapid decline of anaerobes after intubation. Across settings, aim for 5 days if improving and apply rigorous stewardship principles [^1168zSU9] [^116N89Kk] [^1128hi7B].

> Finally, I should double-check safety and follow-up. Extended anaerobic coverage increases C. difficile risk without mortality benefit in large cohorts, so I need to ensure that any decision to add anaerobic therapy is indication-driven. Supportive care, hydration, and oxygenation remain foundational. And if the patient fails to improve as expected, I should reassess for alternative diagnoses, complications like empyema, or resistant pathogens rather than automatically escalating anaerobic coverage [^113bfzA8] [^112ykbDU] [^111Ewmrk].

Empiric therapy for aspiration pneumonia should be tailored to setting, severity, and risk factors [^1169m5ie]. For **community-acquired cases**, use standard CAP regimens (ceftriaxone or levofloxacin) [^113bfzA8] without routine anaerobic coverage unless abscess or empyema is suspected [^1168zSU9]. For **healthcare-associated or severe cases**, add MRSA and Pseudomonas coverage (e.g. vancomycin or linezolid plus piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime) [^1169m5ie]. Treat for **5–7 days** [^notfound] if the patient improves, extending if there is a slow response or complications [^1121NzV4]. Avoid **routine anaerobic coverage** [^1168zSU9] due to a lack of benefit and increased C. difficile risk [^113bfzA8].

## Microbiology of aspiration pneumonia

Aspiration pneumonia is **typically polymicrobial**, involving aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from the oropharynx and gastrointestinal tract [^117QrQ9u]. Common pathogens include:

- **Aerobic bacteria**: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Enterobacteriaceae (e.g. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^notfound].

- **Anaerobic bacteria**: Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus [^notfound].

Recent data indicate that **anaerobes are less frequently isolated** than historically assumed, particularly in community-acquired aspiration pneumonia [^1125UkiM] [^1168zSU9].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotic therapy is indicated when **bacterial infection is suspected or confirmed** [^1173MLCC]. Aspiration pneumonitis (chemical injury without infection) **does not require antibiotics** [^1168zSU9]. Clinical features suggesting infection include fever, leukocytosis, purulent sputum, and new or progressive infiltrates on chest imaging [^111abrfR].

---

## Empiric antibiotic recommendations

Empiric antibiotic selection should be guided by the **clinical setting, severity, and patient-specific risk factors** [^11346AWb]:

| **Clinical setting** | **Recommended empiric antibiotic regimen** |
|-|-|
| Community-acquired aspiration pneumonia (mild to moderate severity) | - Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime <br/> - Or levofloxacin or moxifloxacin [^111PC2Cb] <br/> - Anaerobic coverage not routinely recommended unless lung abscess or empyema is suspected [^1168zSU9] |
| Healthcare-associated or severe aspiration pneumonia (including ICU patients) | - Vancomycin or linezolid (for MRSA coverage) <br/> - Plus piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime (for Pseudomonas coverage) [^notfound] <br/> - Anaerobic coverage (e.g. metronidazole) if lung abscess or empyema is suspected [^111Vs8ak] |
| Penicillin allergy | - Levofloxacin or moxifloxacin <br/> - Plus metronidazole if anaerobic coverage is indicated [^1168zSU9] |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The **recommended duration** of antibiotic therapy for aspiration pneumonia is generally 5–7 days [^116N89Kk], provided the patient is clinically stable and improving. Longer courses (10–14 days) may be necessary for patients with slow clinical response, complications such as lung abscess or empyema, or severe immunosuppression [^notfound].

---

## Role of anaerobic coverage

Routine anaerobic coverage is **not recommended** for uncomplicated community-acquired aspiration pneumonia [^1168zSU9]. Anaerobic coverage should be considered when:

- Lung abscess or empyema is suspected [^111Vs8ak].

- There is necrotizing pneumonia or putrid sputum.

- The patient is severely immunocompromised.

Recent studies have shown that **extended anaerobic coverage does not improve outcomes** and increases the risk of Clostridioides difficile infection [^113bfzA8] [^115TU8kf].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Aspiration pneumonia is associated with **significant morbidity and mortality**, particularly in elderly patients, those with chronic comorbidities, and immunocompromised individuals [^113TjUoK]. Complications include:

- Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation [^112J6T2h].

- Lung abscess and empyema [^111Vs8ak].

- Sepsis and multi-organ failure [^notfound].

- Increased risk of recurrent pneumonia and prolonged hospital stay [^114F8n75].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventing aspiration pneumonia involves **multidisciplinary strategies**, including:

- Head-of-bed elevation during feeding [^111GEvEu].

- Swallowing assessment and rehabilitation [^notfound].

- Oral hygiene protocols [^111GEvEu].

- Aspiration precautions during feeding (e.g. postpyloric feeding tubes) [^1134Jycq].

---

Empiric antibiotic therapy for aspiration pneumonia should be individualized based on the clinical setting, severity, and patient-specific risk factors. Routine anaerobic coverage is **not recommended** for uncomplicated cases, and therapy should be adjusted based on clinical response and microbiological data [^1168zSU9].

### Dynamics of microbiota during mechanical ventilation in aspiration pneumonia [^1128hi7B]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens is an urgent health-related problem, and the appropriate use of antibiotics is imperative. It is often difficult to identify the causative bacteria in patients with aspiration pneumonia because tracheal aspirate contains contaminants of oral bacteria. We investigated the dynamics of microbiota in mechanically ventilated patients with aspiration pneumonia to develop a treatment strategy.

Methods

Twenty-two intubated patients with aspiration pneumonia were recruited. Saliva and tracheal aspirate of the subjects were collected at three time points: (A) within 2 h after intubation, (B) just before administration of antibiotics, and (C) 48–72 h after administration of antibiotics. The microbiota in each specimen was analyzed by using the 16S rRNA gene clone library sequencing method. Bacterial floras of the samples were analyzed by principal component analysis.

Results

Principal component analysis based on the composition of genus revealed that although the changes of microbiota in the saliva from (A) to (B) were not clear, the composition of anaerobes in the tracheal aspirate (B) was lower than (A). In fact, the reduction of anaerobes, not in the saliva but in the tracheal aspirate from (A) to (B), was confirmed by incident rate ratios estimated by a multilevel Poisson regression model (p < 0.001). The extent of decrease in anaerobes was fully dependent on the time difference between the sampling of tracheal aspirate (A) and (B) — in particular, over 3 h of mechanical ventilation. This indicates that the alterations of microbiota (involving the reduction of anaerobes in the lower respiratory tract) occurred during mechanical ventilation prior to the administration of antibiotics. After the administration of antibiotics, Enterobacter spp. Corynebacterium spp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Granulicatera adiacens were predominantly detected in the tracheal aspirate (C).

Conclusion

The microbiota of the lower respiratory tract changes dynamically during mechanical ventilation and during the administration of antibiotics in intubated patients with aspiration pneumonia. Antibiotics should be selected on the premise that dynamic changes in microbiota (involved in the reduction of anaerobes) may occur during the mechanical ventilation in these patients.

Future directions

The BTS Standards of Care Committee will, at a later date, decide on the timing and scope of a future update of the BTS CAP Guideline building on the excellence of the NICE Pneumonia Guideline. Topics to be considered for inclusion in future BTS CAP Guideline include the management of pneumonia associated with viral pathogens, specifically influenza, and aspiration pneumonia.

The relative lack of major differences between the NICE and BTS guidelines might be viewed positively as demonstrating coherence and consistency in guidelines. However, it also highlights the relative lack of substantial innovation and advancement over recent years in the evidence base related to the clinical management of CAP. More attention to translational and clinical research is merited if further improvements in the care of patients with CAP are to be gained.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^1142gMa4]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study has several strengths. First, the large sample size of 3,999 patients allowed for more precise estimates. Second, the study included 18 hospitals that included both academic and community hospitals, thereby increasing the generalizability of the study findings. Third, the GEMINI database was comprehensive and included detailed medication and patient data. Data on medication orders allowed accurate capture of antibiotic exposure during the entire hospital stay. Patient data allowed for adjustment of many prognostic factors in the propensity score overlap weighting analysis. All study patients underwent complete follow-up in hospital.

The study had important limitations that merit mentioning. First, ICD-10-CA codes for aspiration pneumonia have not been validated previously to capture aspiration pneumonia and may have included aspiration pneumonitis that does not require antibiotic therapy. However, we coupled the ICD-10-CA diagnosis codes with the physician's decision to treat with first-line CAP antibiotics, which reflected clinical diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia necessitating antibiotic therapy. Most aspiration pneumonitis cases resolve within 48 h. Based on the cumulative incidence curves (Fig 2), mortality continued to increase steadily after day 2, which followed the typical course for aspiration pneumonia, rather than aspiration pneumonitis. A prior study used the same method based on International Classification of Diseases codes to capture and differentiate aspiration pneumonia from other pneumonias.

Second, the primary outcome was in-hospital mortality because complete follow-up ended on discharge from hospital. We were unable to report out-of-hospital deaths or readmission to hospitals not participating in the GEMINI network. However, in-hospital mortality likely captured most of the attributable deaths resulting from aspiration pneumonia. Our in-hospital mortality rate of 30% was very close to the reported 29% 30-day all-cause mortality for aspiration pneumonia in a large nationwide cohort study of > 1 million patients, suggesting that our study did not miss a significant number of deaths. Patients who were discharged, deteriorated, and then readmitted to a GEMINI hospital site still were captured in our study using the exploratory outcome of 30-day attributable mortality, which was similar between the two groups. This should capture the vast majority of readmissions, because a prior study showed that > 80% of readmissions occur at the same hospitaland our database accounted for readmission to any hospital within the GEMINI network that make up roughly one-half of all acute-care hospital beds in Ontario.

### Pulmonary aspiration syndromes [^114xhfU3]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pulmonary aspiration syndromes are a common cause of morbidity and mortality. These syndromes are often misdiagnosed and their management is frequently suboptimal. This paper reviews the clinical features and management of the most common aspiration syndromes.

Recent Findings

Pulmonary aspiration syndromes refer to a group of pulmonary diseases resulting from aspiration of foreign material into the lung. The type of syndrome depends on the quantity and nature of the aspirated material as well as its chronicity. The most common syndromes include aspiration pneumonia, diffuse aspiration bronchiolitis, and aspiration pneumonitis. Aspiration pneumonia and diffuse aspiration bronchiolitis generally occur in elderly, debilitated patients with dysphagia and usually present as 'community acquired pneumonia', which tends to be recurrent in patients with diffuse aspiration bronchiolitis. Treatment consists of broad-spectrum antibiotics and management of the underlying dysphagia. Aspiration pneumonitis follows the aspiration of gastric contents, usually in patients with a marked decreased level of consciousness. Treatment of aspiration pneumonitis is essentially supportive; however, corticosteroids and other immunomodulating agents may have a role in these patients.

Summary

Aspiration syndromes are common with their management dictated by the type of aspiration syndrome.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia: breaking the vicious circle of antibiotic overuse [^114w2SeK]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the rate of appropriateness of empirical antimicrobial therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia, to evaluate de-escalation in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia treated according to local pathway, and to identify the bacteria responsible for recurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Design

Prospective observational study during a 36-month period.

Setting

Medical-surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Patients

One hundred and fifteen patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit developing ventilator-associated pneumonia with positive cultures. The patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia were treated with limited-spectrum antibiotics (i.e., without activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa) if they had no prior hospitalization (within 21 days) or prior administration of antibiotics (within 10 days). Quantitative cultures obtained by bronchoscopy or tracheal aspiration were used to reassess empirical therapy.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

A limited-spectrum therapy was used in 79 patients (69%). Empirical antimicrobial therapy was appropriate in 100 patients (85%). The mortality rate was significantly higher in the patients in whom empirical therapy was inappropriate than in those in whom treatment was appropriate (47 vs. 20%, p = .04). De-escalation was done in respectively 26% and 72% of patients with early- and late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia, whereas treatment was escalated in 27 patients (23%). Ventilator-associated pneumonia episodes were recurrent in 22 cases, including eight episodes due to high-risk bacteria.

Conclusions

A rational empirical antimicrobial therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia using limited-spectrum antibiotics is possible if local ecology and patient medical history and clinical status are considered. In addition, de-escalation is feasible in 42% of patients. This integrative approach may reduce the emergence of resistant bacteria, which in turns reduces the need for broad-spectrum antibiotics, breaking the vicious circle of antibiotic overuse.

### Aspiration-induced lung injury [^111pkQTQ]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric contents into the lower respiratory tract is a common event in critically ill patients and can lead to pneumonia or pneumonitis. Aspiration pneumonia is the leading cause of pneumonia in the intensive care unit and is one of the leading risk factors for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndromes. Despite its frequency, it remains largely a disease of exclusion characterized by ill-defined infiltrates on the chest radiograph and hypoxia. An accurate ability to diagnose aspiration is paramount because different modalities of therapy, if applied early and selectively, could change the course of the disease. This article reviews definitions, diagnosis, epidemiology, pathophysiology, including animal models of aspiration-induced lung injury, and evidence-based clinical management. Additionally, a review of current and potential biomarkers that have been tested clinically in humans is provided.

Data Sources

Data were obtained from a PubMed search of the medical literature. PubMed "related articles" search strategies were used.

Summary and Conclusions

Aspiration in the intensive care unit is a clinically relevant problem requiring expertise and awareness. A definitive diagnosis of aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia is challenging to make. Advances in specific biomarker profiles and prediction models may enhance the diagnosis and prognosis of clinical aspiration syndromes. Evidence-based management is supportive, including mechanical ventilation, bronchoscopy for particulate aspiration, consideration of empiric antibiotics for pneumonia treatment, and lower respiratory tract sampling to define pathogenic bacteria that are causative.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^113TjUoK]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Take-home Points

Study Question: In patients admitted to hospital for community-acquired aspiration pneumonia, does a difference exist between antibiotic therapy with limited anaerobic coverage and extended anaerobic coverage in terms of in-hospital mortality and risk of Clostridioides difficile colitis?

Results: In this retrospective cohort study of 3,999 patients, the extended anaerobic coverage group showed similar in-hospital mortality and a higher risk of C difficile colitis when compared with the limited anaerobic coverage group.

Interpretation: We found that extended anaerobic coverage likely is unnecessary in aspiration pneumonia because it was associated with no mortality benefit and an increased risk of harm.

Aspiration pneumonia is a bacterial lung infection that results from a large-volume aspiration of oropharyngeal and gastric contents. It accounts for 5% to 15% of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)cases and is associated with high mortality. In a cohort study of 4,263 hospitals, the 30-day mortality rate was 29.4% in 192,814 patients with aspiration pneumonia and 11.6% in 909,078 patients with other pneumonia. In a systematic review of 19 studies, aspiration pneumonia was associated with a relative risk of 3.62 (95% CI, 2.65–4.96) for in-hospital mortality when compared with pneumonia without aspiration risk factors.

### Aspiration risk factors, microbiology, and empiric antibiotics for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia [^1125UkiM]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Aspiration community-acquired pneumonia (ACAP) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in patients with aspiration risk factors (AspRFs) are infections associated with anaerobes, but limited evidence suggests their pathogenic role.

Research Question

What are the aspiration risk factors, microbiology patterns, and empiric anti-anaerobic use in patients hospitalized with CAP?

Study Design and Methods

This is a secondary analysis of GLIMP, an international, multicenter, point-prevalence study of adults hospitalized with CAP. Patients were stratified into three groups: (1) ACAP, (2) CAP/AspRF+ (CAP with AspRF), and (3) CAP/AspRF- (CAP without AspRF). Data on demographics, comorbidities, microbiological results, and anti-anaerobic antibiotics were analyzed in all groups. Patients were further stratified in severe and nonsevere CAP groups.

Results

We enrolled 2,606 patients with CAP, of which 193 (7.4%) had ACAP. Risk factors independently associated with ACAP were male, bedridden, underweight, a nursing home resident, and having a history of stroke, dementia, mental illness, and enteral tube feeding. Among non-ACAP patients, 1,709 (70.8%) had CAP/AspRF+ and 704 (29.2%) had CAP/AspRF-. Microbiology patterns including anaerobes were similar between CAP/AspRF-, CAP/AspRF+ and ACAP (0.0% vs 1.03% vs 1.64%). Patients with severe ACAP had higher rates of total gram-negative bacteria (64.3% vs 44.3% vs 33.3%, P = 0.021) and lower rates of total gram-positive bacteria (7.1% vs 38.1% vs 50.0%, P < .001) when compared with patients with severe CAP/AspRF+ and severe CAP/AspRF-, respectively. Most patients (> 50% in all groups) independent of AspRFs or ACAP received specific or broad-spectrum anti-anaerobic coverage antibiotics.

Interpretation

Hospitalized patients with ACAP or CAP/AspRF+ had similar anaerobic flora compared with patients without aspiration risk factors. Gram-negative bacteria were more prevalent in patients with severe ACAP. Despite having similar microbiological flora between groups, a large proportion of CAP patients received anti-anaerobic antibiotic coverage.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^117XDemK]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy is an essential part of management for patients with aspiration pneumonia. Empiric antibiotic coverage for aspiration pneumonia has been debated and changed over time. Historically, anaerobic bacteria were thought to be the predominant pathogen in aspiration pneumonia. However, in more recent prospective studies, anaerobes were isolated in only 0.5% cases of aspiration pneumoniaand 16% of isolated bacteria.

Thus, the 2019 American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on CAP recommend to not routinely add anaerobic coverage in patients with aspiration pneumonia, and to treat with first-line antibiotics for CAP such as ceftriaxone or levofloxacin. This recommendation also considered the potential harmful consequences of broader empiric antibiotic coverage that increase risk of Clostridioides difficile colitis and select for antimicrobial resistance.

Very little evidence is available on the comparative effectiveness of empiric antibiotic therapy with limited or extended anaerobic coverage for aspiration pneumonia. A recent systematic review found three relevant studies (two observational studies and one randomized controlled trial). All three studies did not show a significant difference in mortality or clinical cure rate with extended anaerobic coverage. However, the small sample sizes that ranged from 117 to 637 patients led to imprecise estimates with large CIs that cannot exclude clinically important differences.

A large multicenter study of aspiration pneumonia that compares first-line CAP antibiotic therapy with limited vs extended anaerobic coverage is needed to conclude if any clinically important differences exist in effectiveness and adverse effects. To this end, we conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with community-acquired aspiration pneumonia to compare first-line CAP antibiotic therapy with limited vs extended anaerobic coverage in terms of in-hospital mortality and risk of C difficile colitis.

### Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy for acute aspiration pneumonitis [^114UiLH5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy is frequently prescribed for acute aspiration pneumonitis, with the intent of preventing the development of aspiration pneumonia. However, few clinical studies have examined the benefits and harms of this practice.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study design was used to compare outcomes of patients with aspiration pneumonitis who received prophylactic antimicrobial therapy with those managed with supportive care only during the initial 2 days following macroaspiration. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality within 30 days. Secondary outcomes included transfer to critical care and antimicrobial therapy received between days 3 and 14 following macroaspiration including escalation of therapy and antibiotic-free days.

Results

Among 1483 patients reviewed, 200 met the case definition for acute aspiration pneumonitis, including 76 (38%) who received prophylactic antimicrobial therapy and 124 (62%) who received supportive management only. After adjusting for patient-level predictors, antimicrobial prophylaxis was not associated with any improvement in mortality (odds ratio, 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4–1.7; p = 0.7). Patients receiving prophylactic antimicrobial therapy were no less likely to require transfer to critical care (5% vs 6%; p = 0.7) and subsequently received more frequent escalation of antibiotic therapy (8% vs 1%; p = 0.002) and fewer antibiotic-free days (7.5 vs 10.9; P < .0001).

Conclusions

Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy for patients with acute aspiration pneumonitis does not offer clinical benefit and may generate antibiotic selective pressures that results in the need for escalation of antibiotic therapy among those who develop aspiration pneumonia.

### Effectiveness of ceftriaxone plus doxycycline in the treatment of patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia [^1138oByX]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Limited data exist on the effectiveness of ceftriaxone plus doxycycline in the treatment of patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of all adults hospitalized for pneumonia between January 1999 and July 2001 at an academic medical center. Outcomes were compared for patients with CAP treated with ceftriaxone plus doxycycline versus other appropriate initial empiric antibiotic therapies. Outcomes were adjusted with the use of a propensity score to account for differences in patient characteristics and illness severity between groups.

Results

A total of 216 patients were treated with ceftriaxone plus doxycycline and 125 received other appropriate initial empiric antibiotic therapies. After adjustment, use of ceftriaxone plus doxycycline was associated with reduced inpatient mortality (OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.08–0.81) and 30-day mortality (OR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.17–0.81), but not with length of stay or readmission rates. Analysis of a subset of the sample that excluded patients admitted from nursing homes, patients admitted to the ICU, and patients diagnosed with aspiration also showed reduced inpatient mortality with the use of ceftriaxone plus doxycycline.

Conclusions

The use of ceftriaxone plus doxycycline as an initial empiric therapy for patients hospitalized with CAP appears safe and effective, and its potential superiority should be evaluated prospectively.

Discussion

In this retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with community-acquired aspiration pneumonia across 18 hospital sites, in-hospital mortality was not significantly different between EAC and LAC groups (adjusted risk difference, 1.6%; 95% CI, –1.7% to 4.9%). The lower CI limit of –1.7% excluded a clinically important difference of 3% mortality reduction. Thus, extended anaerobic coverage seemed unlikely to lead to a clinically important improvement in mortality. However, extended anaerobic coverage was associated with a significantly increased risk of C difficile colitis (adjusted risk difference, 1.0%; 95% CI 0.3%-1.7%). These findings suggest that extended anaerobic antibiotic coverage did not offer any additional benefit for aspiration pneumonia and could have increased the risk of harm.

Our study findings are consistent with those from a small randomized controlled trialand three prior observational studies. Similar to these four studies, our study did not show a significant difference between LAC and EAC groups in terms of mortality. Unlike the prior three studies, our study included only patients receiving first-line antibiotic agents for CAP. In addition, our study showed a much larger sample size that was more than four times the sample size of all four studies combined. This allowed for a more precise estimate with a narrow 95% CI to exclude a clinically important difference.

Our study findings have important implications. This study adds strong real-world clinical evidence to the ATS and IDSA 2019 CAP guidelines recommendation of not routinely adding anaerobic coverage for aspiration pneumonia. Patients with community-acquired aspiration pneumonia can be treated with ceftriaxone or levofloxacin without adding another antibiotic for anaerobic coverage. The avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic administration can decrease the risk of antibiotic adverse effects, especially C difficile colitis. On a larger scale, limiting unnecessary antibiotic use may lower antibiotic selective pressure and may result in less antibiotic resistance. In hospitals, antimicrobial stewardship programs can implement targeted interventions to de-escalate antibiotic therapy for aspiration pneumonia.

In reply Dr Joseph raises a very important question, one that we discussed extensively when designing our study. Research in children and adults with pulmonary disease secondary to aspiration of oral contents has repeatedly documented the presence of oral anaerobic bacteria in the pulmonary trees of affected patients. 1–3 These organisms do not exist in the lungs of healthy persons. As a result, systemic antibiotic therapy has become the standard of care for this disease, although, to our knowledge, no placebo-controlled trials have ever been conducted.

### The enduring challenge of determining pneumonia etiology in children: considerations for future research priorities [^114rzpQD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The development and evaluation of horse serum therapy for pneumococcal pneumonia during the 1920s lent urgency to determining etiology and, if pneumococcal, to identifying the serotype. In general, isolates were obtained from sputum cultures, but it was recognized that lung material, aspirated by percutaneous needles, provided more accurate information and, importantly, may be the only specimen available in young children who swallow rather than expectorate their sputum. In New York, between 1928 and 1936, Bullowa pioneered both lung aspiration and serum therapy, reporting 405 such procedures in children and nearly 1500 in adults.

The Advent of Antibiotics

When sulphonamides and penicillin replaced serum therapy as standard treatment for pneumonia in the 1940s, the incentive to define the infecting organism in individual cases receded, as did the effort to develop pneumococcal vaccines. There are few published studies of pneumonia etiology in the subsequent 30 years. In 1967 the first case of pneumonia caused by a pneumococcus resistant to penicillin was reported in Australia, but the clinical and epidemiological significance of this report was not appreciated for many years. In fact, the stimulus to re-examine etiology across the world was the desire to make appropriate life-saving antibiotics more widely available to children to reduce the mortality rate in low-income settings. In the 1980s, the first etiology studies in developing countries were conducted using blood and lung aspirate cultures that focused on bacterial etiologies. In The Gambia, bacteria were cultured in 33 (65%) of 51 children investigated. In Papua New Guinea, 51 (61%) of 83 children had positive cultures; 32 had Haemophilus influenzae, and 28 had S. pneumoniae, including 10 who had both. The salient feature of these studies was their focus on radiologically evident pneumonia in children with no prior exposure to antibiotics. Indeed, some studies at the time showed that antibiotic treatment of pneumonia in developing countries, using a nonspecific clinical case definition, could reduce mortality, affirming the important role of bacteria in causing severe pneumonia.

### Antibiotic treatment for pneumonia complicating stroke: recommendations from the pneumonia in stroke consensus (PISCES) group [^113gptdE]. European Stroke Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The microbiological aetiology of pneumonia complicating stroke is poorly characterised. In this second Pneumonia in Stroke ConsEnsuS statement, we propose a standardised approach to empirical antibiotic therapy in pneumonia complicating stroke, based on likely microbiological aetiology, to improve antibiotic stewardship.

Methods

Systematic literature searches of multiple databases were undertaken. An evidence review and a round of consensus consultation were completed prior to a final multi-disciplinary consensus meeting in September 2017, held in Barcelona, Spain. Consensus was approached using a modified Delphi technique and defined a priori as 75% agreement between the consensus group members. Findings: No randomised trials to guide antibiotic treatment of pneumonia complicating stroke were identified. Consensus was reached for the following: (1) Stroke-associated pneumonia may be caused by organisms associated with either community-acquired or hospital-acquired pneumonia; (2) Treatment for early stroke-associated pneumonia (< 72 h of stroke onset) should cover community-acquired pneumonia organisms; (3) Treatment for late stroke-associated pneumonia (≥ 72 h and within seven days of stroke onset) should cover community-acquired pneumonia organisms plus coliforms ± Pseudomonas spp. if risk factors; (4) No additional antimicrobial cover is required for patients with dysphagia or aspiration; (5) Pneumonia occurring after seven days from stroke onset should be treated as for hospital-acquired pneumonia; (6) Treatment should continue for at least seven days for each of these scenarios.

Discussion

Consensus recommendations for antibiotic treatment of the spectrum of pneumonia complicating stroke are proposed. However, there was limited evidence available to formulate consensus on choice of specific antibiotic class for pneumonia complicating stroke.

Conclusion

Further studies are required to inform evidence-based treatment of stroke-associated pneumonia including randomised trials of antibiotics and validation of candidate biomarkers.

### Antibiotics versus non-antibiotic in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia: analysis of the MIMIC-IV database [^117Q6U4Y]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Subgroup analysis

The number of patients in each subgroup is shown in Fig. 4. Except for the groups with SOFA ≥ 5, APSIII ≥ 69, and those not using mechanical ventilation, the use of antibiotics significantly reduced in-hospital mortality in patients with AP in all other subgroups. Compared to patients aged ≥ 65 years (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29–0.94, P = 0.033), patients aged < 65 years (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11–0.74, P = 0.012) had a lower OR value.

Antibiotic usage in patients with AP

Figure 5 illustrates the statistical overview of antibiotic usage in patients with AP. The most frequently used antibiotic is vancomycin, followed by fourth-generation cephalosporins (ForGC). Antibiotics used by fewer than 80 patients are categorized as'Other' due to their relatively small number in comparison to the total.

Figure 6 depicts the combined use of antibiotics and the corresponding patient num- bers. Among them, the largest number of patients received a combination of two antibiotics (N = 1154), followed by patients treated with a combination of three antibi- otics (N = 1023), while the least number of patients were treated with a combination of eight antibiotics (N = 1).

Results

Patients

Patient recruitment ended June 30, 2008 as planned. The last patient was followed up until July 8, 2008. A total of 696 patients were hospitalized for pneumonia during the study period. Among these, 433 patients were excluded: 416 because of aspiration risks, 13 because of a protocol violation by a physician, and four because of receipt of immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, 263 patients were finally included in this study (Fig. 1), among whom, 124 were allocated to the CTRX group, and 139 to the ABPC/SBT group. In two cases from the CTRX group and three cases from the ABPC/SBT group, no macrolides were administered. Fifty-one patients were excluded from the VPP population: 30 because of misdiagnosis with non-aspiration pneumonia, 10 because of inappropriate antibiotic change, seven because of a lack of information, and four because of insufficient treatment period. No significant differences in the numbers of cases excluded from the VPP were observed between the two groups. Baseline clinical characteristics of the MITT and VPP populations are summarized in Tables 1 and 2; these characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups except for CRP, which was higher in the ABPC/SBT group than in the CTRX group in the MITT population, but did not differ significantly between the two groups in the VPP population. This study included patients with low PSI, due to the universal health-care coverage in Japan. Patients with low PSI are thus more likely to be hospitalized in Japan than in other countries.

### Adherence to ATS guidelines for hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^111Lhch8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare outcomes of care and antibiotic utilization for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) throughout a group of not-for-profit hospitals.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of patients from community hospitals with a diagnosis of pneumonia at discharge admitted from December 1997 to May 1998. Data were collected based on American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria.

Results

Medical records of 330 patients were reviewed; mortality was 7%. Using ATS guidelines, 51 (15.5%) patients were not treated with recommended antimicrobial therapy. Of these patients, 14 had nonsevere cases of CAP and 37 cases were severe. Factors found to be associated with in-hospital mortality included nonadherence to ATS guidelines (OR 4.46; 95% CI 1.38 to 14.43), decreased urine output (OR 7.72; 95% CI 1.70 to 35.04), and increasing age (OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.12). Significant predictors of length of stay (LOS) included age, nonadherence to ATS criteria, suspected aspiration, discharge status, low pulse oximetry on admission, decreased urine output, use of vasopressor medications, and interstitial lung disease; More than 80% of patients had at least one culture performed, but only 27.5% of these cultures were positive. The most cpmmonly prescribed antibiotic was cefuroxime injection, representing 25% of the antibiotic orders.

Conclusions

Patients with CAP treated inconsistently with ATS guidelines had a 4.46-d higher risk of inpatient mortality and had significantly longer LOS.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^116PUCd6]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Of 3,999 patients included in the study, 2,683 patients (67.1%) and 1,316 patients (32.9%) were in the LAC and EAC groups, respectively (Fig 1). The antibiotics used in each group are described in e-Table 1. The median duration of receiving antibiotics was 5 days (IQR, 3–7 days) and 7 days (IQR, 4–8 days) in the LAC and EAC groups, respectively. The excluded patients treated with only oral antibiotics are described in e-Table 2. These patients were younger and showed less severe illness based on ICU admission as well as mLAPS, leading to a much lower in-hospital mortality.

Figure 1
Flow diagram showing patient disposition. Numbers for each exclusion criteria given as a range because of suppression of cells with five or fewer patients. mLAPS = modified Laboratory-Based Acute Physiology Score.

Baseline Characteristics

Baseline characteristics are described in Table 1. Of note, the proportion of patients in each group differed significantly across hospital sites and admission year. The proportion of patients with LAC steadily increased from 2015 to 2021, which likely reflected the increasing adoption of the ATS and IDSA guidelines. Other patient baseline characteristics were well balanced even before propensity score adjustment. The organisms causing aspiration pneumonia based on ICD-10-CA codes were specified in only 17 patients (0.4%). Organisms included Klebsiella species, Escherichia coli, other gram-negative bacilli, and Staphylococcus aureus, which were all identified in fewer than five patients.

To investigate the reasons for medical staff using antibiotics, we compared the differences between vancomycin + piperacillin-tazobactam (Table 2) or levofloxacin + metronidazole (Table 3) and no antibiotics. This revealed that only one inflammation indicators of patients who used levofloxacin + metronidazole differed from those in the no antibiotics group, and that all inflammatory indicators of patients who used vancomycin + piperacillin-tazobactam differed from those in the no-antibiotics group.

VAP/VAE prevention — additional approaches in adult patients include using selective oral or digestive decontamination in countries and ICUs with low prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms, utilizing endotracheal tubes with subglottic secretion drainage ports, considering early tracheostomy, and considering postpyloric rather than gastric feeding for patients with gastric intolerance or at high risk for aspiration.

### A randomized trial of diagnostic techniques for ventilator-associated pneumonia [^115JnosA]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

Critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation are at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia. Current data are conflicting as to the optimal diagnostic approach in patients who have suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Methods

In a multicenter trial, we randomly assigned immunocompetent adults who were receiving mechanical ventilation and who had suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia after 4 days in the intensive care unit (ICU) to undergo either bronchoalveolar lavage with quantitative culture of the bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid or endotracheal aspiration with nonquantitative culture of the aspirate. Patients known to be colonized or infected with pseudomonas species or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were excluded. Empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated in all patients until culture results were available, at which point a protocol of targeted therapy was used for discontinuing or reducing the dose or number of antibiotics, or for resuming antibiotic therapy to treat a preenrollment condition if the culture was negative.

Results

We enrolled 740 patients in 28 ICUs in Canada and the United States. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome (28-day mortality rate) between the bronchoalveolar-lavage group and the endotracheal-aspiration group (18.9% and 18.4%, respectively; P = 0.94). The bronchoalveolar-lavage group and the endotracheal-aspiration group also had similar rates of targeted therapy (74.2% and 74.6%, respectively; P = 0.90), days alive without antibiotics (10.4 ± 7.5 and 10.6 ± 7.9, P = 0.86), and maximum organ-dysfunction scores (mean [± SD], 8.3 ± 3.6 and 8.6 ± 4.0; P = 0.26). The two groups did not differ significantly in the length of stay in the ICU or hospital.

Conclusions

Two diagnostic strategies for ventilator-associated pneumonia — bronchoalveolar lavage with quantitative culture of the bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid and endotracheal aspiration with nonquantitative culture of the aspirate — are associated with similar clinical outcomes and similar overall use of antibiotics.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) diagnostic sampling — We suggest noninvasive sampling with semiquantitative cultures to diagnose VAP, rather than invasive sampling with quantitative cultures and rather than noninvasive sampling with quantitative cultures (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Invasive respiratory sampling includes bronchoscopic techniques (ie, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), protected specimen brush (PSB)) and blind bronchial sampling (ie, mini-BAL), whereas noninvasive sampling refers to endotracheal aspiration. Evidence included 5 randomized trials, with 3 comparing invasive quantitative sampling to noninvasive semiquantitative sampling and 2 comparing invasive quantitative to noninvasive quantitative sampling. One trial showed that invasive sampling led to more antibiotic changes than noninvasive sampling (42% vs 15%; relative risk [RR], 2.81, 95% CI, 1.01–7.81), and another found more antibiotic-free days with invasive sampling (5.0 days vs 2.2 days; P < .001), whereas other trials found no difference; when the 5 trials were pooled via meta-analysis, sampling technique did not affect any clinical outcome, including mean duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, or mortality.

### Clinical aspiration-related practice patterns in the intensive care unit: a physician survey [^1178mv6f]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize physician practice patterns regarding the clinical, microbiological, and antimicrobial-related events of suspected or documented aspiration and aspiration pneumonia within the intensive care unit.

Design

National mail survey.

Setting

University medical center.

Study Population

Critical care physician members of the Society of Critical Care Medicine.

Interventions

Survey questionnaire.

Measurements and Main Results

The response rate was 645 (32%) of 2,000 mailed surveys; analysis of data represents completed questionnaires from 605 respondents. Intensivists (42.3%), pulmonologists (22.6%), and surgeons (21.6%) represent the majority of respondents. Altered level of consciousness (67.9%) in the intensive care unit was identified as the predominant predisposing factor for aspiration pneumonia. Sixty-four percent of physicians used sputum specimens, rather than protected specimen brushes or bronchoalveolar lavage, as the diagnostic source of bacterial cultures in cases of suspected aspiration pneumonia. Microbiological assessment of aspiration pneumonia revealed the absence of any predominant pathogen, although Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were cited in 40.1% of combined responses, whereas anaerobes represented the fifth most prevalent cultured bacteria. In cases of suspected and confirmed aspiration, 51.9% and 77.7% of respondents, respectively, would prescribe an antimicrobial agent in the absence of a definitive infectious process, with administration of dual antimicrobial therapy increasing from 28.9% to 46.0% in suspected vs. confirmed cases of aspiration. In the treatment of aspiration pneumonia, 27.6% of physicians preferred pathogen-specific therapy, whereas the remainder (72.4%) selected an empirical antibiotic regimen based on prior clinical experience. Overall, a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor, followed by a cephalosporin, aminoglycoside in combination, or clindamycin, was most often selected for empirical therapy of all defined aspiration-related clinical diagnoses.

Conclusions

Our study revealed a divergent approach to antimicrobial treatment of cases of aspiration in the intensive care unit. Further investigation is warranted to determine why empirical antimicrobials are initiated frequently for noninfectious stages of aspiration.

### Comparison of ceftriaxone plus macrolide and ampicillin / sulbactam plus macrolide in treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for aspiration: an open-label, quasi-randomized, controlled trial [^1165pHEr]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The present study had several limitations. First, there was uncertainty about the effect size. The difference between groups could potentially be smaller or non-existent. Second, this was a single-center trial. Because the background characteristics of patients would differ between hospitals, the severity of pneumonia would be different. Therefore, whether the clinical differences observed between the two antibiotics in the present study can be generalized needs to be investigated in a follow-up study. Third, to judge whether the patient had aspiration pneumonia, risk factors for aspiration were evaluated, but not swallowing function or silent aspiration at night. Some cases of pneumonia in the present study might thus have been caused by silent aspiration of oral bacteria. Distinguishing pneumonia caused by oral anaerobic bacteria from that caused by other bacteria by evaluating only the risk factors for aspiration was difficult. However, because it is not routine in clinical practice to evaluate swallowing function to judge whether a patient has aspiration pneumonia, the results of the present study can be considered at least somewhat reflective of actual clinical practice.

### The role of surveillance cultures in guiding ventilator-associated pneumonia therapy [^113GzVin]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent cause of death among the nosocomial infections acquired in the ICU. Routine surveillance endotracheal aspirate (ETA) cultures in patients on mechanical ventilation have been proposed to predict the cause of VAP. Our aim is to review the available experience regarding the role of surveillance ETA cultures in guiding VAP antimicrobial therapy.

Recent Findings

Microorganisms arrive in the lower respiratory tract by aspiration from the oropharynx or gastric reflux, extension from a contiguous infection, air contamination or by hematogenous seeding. Bacterial colonization of the airway leads to the development of VAP and may result from the aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric secretions. Recent studies have suggested that surveillance cultures could provide a rationale for prescribing appropriate antibiotics, while waiting for culture results, in up to 95% of patients in whom VAP is ultimately diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid culture. However, some authors observed that guiding therapy with those routine surveillance cultures leads to unacceptably low coverage of the pathogens producing VAP.

Summary

This article describes the evidence supporting the use of routine ETA cultures to prescribe appropriate initial empirical therapy compared with the current practice dictated by guidelines.

### Comparison of ceftriaxone plus macrolide and ampicillin / sulbactam plus macrolide in treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for aspiration: an open-label, quasi-randomized, controlled trial [^113zaTNU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is caused by a wide variety of pathogens, and is one of the most common infections around the world. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis or viruses such as influenza virus. Susceptibility to antibiotics varies depending on the pathogen. For example, the susceptibilities of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors were reported as 99.5%, 59.3–78.0% and 7.7–20.2%, and the susceptibilities of these species to third-generation cephalosporins were reported as 96.8, 100 and 1.0%. Antibiotics were therefore selected on the basis of presumptive bacteria in consideration of the patient's age, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory findings, severity, and so on.

Ceftriaxone (CTRX) and ampicillin/sulbactam (ABPC/SBT) are recommended by various guidelines for pneumonia in a number of countries as the first-line antibiotics for CAP. Both of these antibiotics are active against a similar range of microorganisms, except for anaerobic bacteria, which are the predominant pathogens in aspiration pneumonia. Because the susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to CTRX is relatively low, some guidelines recommend ABPC/SBT for the treatment of aspiration pneumonia. In previous reports that did not consider aspiration risks, no significant differences were found between CTRX and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as ABPC/SBT for the treatment of pneumonia. Only one paper has compared ABPC/SBT with CTRX in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia patients. However, that study was a retrospective propensity score-matching analysis and whether this result is applicable to aspiration pneumonia in clinical practice remains unclear.

Some reports have described CAP excluding aspiration pneumonia, but most previous studies of antibiotic treatments for CAP have included patients with aspiration pneumonia. To our knowledge, no reports have compared CTRX and ABPC/SBT for the treatment of CAP in patients without risk factors for aspiration. We therefore carried out the present study with the aim of investigating whether CTRX might be more effective than ABPC/SBT for the treatment of CAP, after excluding cases of aspiration pneumonia.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^1158a3Gy]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Interpretation

In conclusion, our study adds to the existing evidence that extended anaerobic coverage likely is unnecessary in community-acquired aspiration pneumonia and is associated with a greater risk of C difficile colitis. It is reasonable to treat these patients with a first-line antibiotic therapy for CAP such as ceftriaxone without adding clindamycin or metronidazole.

### Ampicillin + sulbactam vs clindamycin ± cephalosporin for the treatment of aspiration pneumonia and primary lung abscess [^114UpYUo]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Aspiration pneumonia, necrotising pneumonia and primary lung abscess are complications arising from the aspiration of infectious material from the oral cavity or stomach. There is limited information on optimal antibacterial therapeutic regimens. Patients with pulmonary infection following aspiration (n = 95) were included in a prospective, open, randomised, comparative multicentre trial to compare the safety, clinical and bacteriological efficacy of ampicillin + sulbactam vs. clindamycin ± cephalosporin. Treated patients (n = 70) received sequential antibiotic therapy with either ampicillin + sulbactam (n = 37) or clindamycin (n = 33), with or without a second- or third-generation cephalosporin, administered until the complete resolution of clinical and radiological abnormalities. Definite or presumptive pathogens were isolated from 58 patients. Mean duration of therapy was 22.7 days for ampicillin + sulbactam and 24.1 days for clindamycin. In patients treated with ampicillin + sulbactam, the clinical response was 73.0% at the end of therapy and 67.5% 7–14 days after therapy. For clindamycin, the rates were 66.7% and 63.5%, respectively. Bacteriological response was similar in both treatment arms. Nine patients died (12.9%), with a Simplified Acute Physiology Score of > 30 points being the only significant predictive factor for therapeutic failure. Ampicillin + sulbactam and clindamycin ± cephalosporin were both well-tolerated and proved equally effective in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia and lung abscess.

### How important are anaerobic bacteria in aspiration pneumonia: when should they be treated and what is optimal therapy [^112qM9Uc]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Anaerobic bacteria are infrequent pulmonary pathogens, and, even then they are, they are almost never recovered due to the need for specimens uncontaminated by the upper airway flora and failure to do adequate anaerobic bacteriology. These bacteria are relatively common in selected types of lung infections including aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, necrotizing pneumonia and emphyema. Preferred antibiotics for these infections based on clinical experience are clindamycin and any betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor.

### Differences in the features of aspiration pneumonia according to site of acquisition: community or continuing care facility [^112J6T2h]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the prevalence of aspiration pneumonia and to compare the features and risk factors for this entity in patients from continuing care facilities (CCFs) and the community who were admitted to the hospital with pneumonia.

Design

Prospective population-based study.

Setting

Six hospitals in Capital Health Region (Edmonton), Alberta, Canada.

Participants

One thousand nine hundred forty-six adults admitted with pneumonia. Patients were stratified by their residence as community or CCF.

Measurements

Aspiration pneumonia prevalence; risk factors; and outcomes such as mortality, length of stay, and intensive care unit admission rates.

Results

Ten percent of those with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) had aspirated, compared with 30% of those with CCF-acquired pneumonia. Those with community-acquired aspiration pneumonia (CAAP) and those with CCF-acquired aspiration pneumonia (CCF-AP) were younger, more likely to go to ICU, and more likely to require mechanical ventilation and had a longer length of stay and a higher mortality rate than nonaspirators. The risk factors for aspiration differed; for those with CAAP, impaired consciousness due to alcohol, drugs, or hepatic failure predominated, whereas 72% of those with CCF-AP had neurological disease that resulted in dysphagia. Eighty percent were treated with antibiotics effective against anaerobic bacteria.

Conclusion

Aspiration pneumonia is common in patients with both CAP and CCF-acquired pneumonia. The risk factors differ, and there is a high mortality rate. Neurological disease dominates as the predisposing factor toward aspiration pneumonia in people in CCFs.

### Characterizing pediatric aspiration pneumonia: diagnostic gaps and stewardship opportunities [^111hhGA7]. Hospital Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause for hospitalization, especially in children with medical complexity, yet there are no standard definition or clinical practice guidelines for the condition. Our objectives were to assess the validity of the aspiration pneumonia billing code and to describe the demographics, presenting symptoms, diagnostic results, and outcomes of children hospitalized with this condition.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 200 patients hospitalized with an International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia from 2016 to 2021. We conducted a standardized medical record review to identify children with a clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia and collected data on patient and hospitalization characteristics across 4 subgroups defined by a combination of clinical and radiographic features.

Results

Among 200 patients identified by ICD-10 code, 138 (69%) also had a clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia. For these 138 patients, the mean age was 8.4 years (SD, 7), and most had an underlying medical complexity. Diagnostic testing, antibiotic selection, and hospitalization outcomes were similar across definition subgroups. Only 18 patients (13%) had aspiration risk factors, fever, and a probable focal opacity on chest imaging at diagnosis.

Conclusions

We observed significant variability in presenting symptoms and diagnostic testing results among patients assigned a clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia. Our study underscores the need for a standardized clinical definition, improved diagnostic criteria, and evidence-based treatment guidelines to optimize clinical care for this patient population.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^115oRAF2]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Complete case analysis was performed. For descriptive analysis of continuous variables, mean ± SD or median (interquartile range [IQR]) were used when appropriate. Counts and percentages were used to describe categorical variables. Absolute standardized difference of the mean was used to describe the balance of baseline characteristics. A meaningful difference was defined as a standardized difference of > 0.1.

In keeping with a target trial approach, a modified intention-to-treat analysis was performed. To be included in this analysis, patients must have been receiving the same antibiotic for > 1 day or until death or discharge. Because most antibiotics were dosed daily, this ensured that patients received more than a single antibiotic dose. If patients were switched to another antibiotic regimen after 2 days, then they were analyzed based on the initial antibiotic group. A per-protocol analysis also was performed that included only patients who completed the antibiotic regimen they were prescribed initially without switching to or adding on another antibiotic during hospital stay.

For outcomes other than time to discharge, a risk difference with CIwas calculated as the risk for EAC group minus risk for LAC group. For time to discharge, a competing risk model was used. Possible end points in this model included being discharged alive or dying in hospital. The Fine and Graymodel was used to estimate the subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) for being discharged alive.

Measured covariates before the index time were balanced between the two groups using a propensity score-based method. Propensity scores were estimated using a logistic regression of the covariates and then were balanced using overlap weighting. Overlap weighting calculates the average treatment effect for the overlap population, which is the population with similar covariates distribution for which clinical equipoise exists and patients would be eligible for the analogous trial. Overlap weighting for two groups will always lead to an exact balance in the means of any included covariates, leading to an absolute standardized difference of 0. The weighted difference in means for outcomes would be the average risk difference. The overlap weights were entered into the competing risk model to estimate an adjusted sHR for being discharged alive.

A sensitivity analysis was carried out that accounted for hospital sites as clusters using a generalized linear mixed-effect model. Reported CIs were all two-sided 95% CIs. R version 4.1.3 software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) was the statistical software used, and the PSweight package was used for overlap weighting of propensity scores.

Data Reporting

To protect patient confidentiality, all cells containing or revealing five individuals or fewer were suppressed according to GEMINI data policy.

### Multicenter treatment and outcome evaluation of aspiration syndromes in critically ill patients [^115groMo]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Aspiration syndromes (pneumonia and pneumonitis) have significantly different processes. An evaluation of treatment and outcomes for these different syndromes has not been reported previously.

Objective

To characterize and assess antimicrobial prescribing patterns for aspiration syndromes in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and describe outcomes of those patients.

Methods

A retrospective, observational evaluation was conducted using a convenience sample of patients at 27 hospitals in North America; these patients were admitted to an adult ICU with a diagnosis of suspected/confirmed aspiration or had a suspected/confirmed aspiration while in the ICU. Hospital demographic, diagnosis, treatment, and clinical outcome data were collected.

Results

Over a 12 month period, 187 patients were observed. Aspiration syndromes included suspected aspiration (31%; n = 58), aspiration pneumonitis (12%; n = 23), aspiration pneumonia (55%; n = 103), and diagnosis not available (1.6%; n = 3). Antimicrobial management for the aspiration syndromes was as follows: suspected aspiration: 59% single agent, 38% multiple agents, and 3% no therapy; aspiration pneumonitis: 48% single agent, 39% multiple agents, and 13% no therapy; aspiration pneumonia: 48% single agent, 52% multiple agents, and 0% no therapy. Antimicrobial therapy was prescribed in patients with suspected (97%) and confirmed (100%) aspiration. Antibiotic therapy duration was significantly longer for aspiration pneumonia (9.1 ± 7.5 days) than for aspiration pneumonitis (5.2 ± 3.6 days; p = 0.013). Length of ICU stay was similar across patient groups.

Conclusions

Antimicrobial agents are frequently prescribed to treat aspiration syndromes despite the lack of demonstrated efficacy for aspiration pneumonitis. Outcomes between aspiration syndromes were similar with the exception of duration of antibiotic treatment.

### What is healthcare-associated pneumonia and how is it managed? [^111eKsBU]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pneumonia developing before hospital admission in patients in close contact with the health system was recently termed 'healthcare-associated pneumonia' and proposed as a new category of respiratory infection. We focus on the recent literature concerning the epidemiology, causative organisms, antibiotic susceptibilities, and outcomes of and empirical antibiotic therapy for this condition.

Recent Findings

The reported incidence of healthcare-associated pneumonia among patients requiring hospitalization for pneumonia ranges from 17% to 67%. Hospitalization within 90 days before pneumonia, attending a dialysis clinic and residing in a nursing home were the most common criteria for healthcare-associated pneumonia. Compared with patients with community-acquired pneumonia, those with healthcare-associated pneumonia are older, have greater co-morbidity, and are more likely to have aspiration pneumonia and pneumonia caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia also more frequently initially receive an inappropriate antibiotic therapy, have higher case fatality rates and have longer hospital stay.

Summary

Many patients hospitalized with pneumonia via the emergency department have healthcare-associated pneumonia. There are significant differences in the spectrum of causative organisms and antibiotic susceptibilities between healthcare-associated and community-acquired pneumonia. Physicians should differentiate patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia from those with community-acquired pneumonia to promote a targeted approach when selecting initial antibiotic therapy.

### Aspiration pneumonias: under-diagnosed and under-treated [^117W89ei]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To examine recent advancements of the epidemiology, risk factors, bacteriology, diagnostic measures, and treatment for aspiration pneumonia.

Recent Findings

In a large prospective study, 10.3% of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization was associated with aspiration pneumonia, as opposed to 30% when patients were admitted from long-term facilities. A murine stroke model showed increased apoptosis of cell-mediated immune cells due to overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. Subsequent nasal inoculum of low-dose Streptococcus pneumoniae caused severe pneumonia. Another murine study showed intratracheal administration of hydrochloric acid-primed lungs more susceptible to infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae. Tracheal pH monitoring demonstrated acidification of trachea in 28% of patients with acute stroke deemed to be safe for oral feeding. Various antimicrobial agents used to treat aspiration pneumonia have comparable success rates. However, clindamycin was the only agent that did not propagate emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Summary

Aspiration pneumonia is prevalent in community-acquired pneumonia. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effects of sympathetic nervous system and aspiration pneumonitis as primers for lung infection. Predicting aspiration risk is difficult and newer diagnostic tools are necessary. Antimicrobials used in aspiration pneumonia have similar success rates although the development of resistant organisms must be monitored.

### Pneumonia in older residents of long-term care facilities [^111SrV7R]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Compared with community-dwelling persons, residents in long-term care facilities have more functional disabilities and underlying medical illnesses and are at increased risk of acquiring infectious diseases. Pneumonia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this group. Risk factors include unwitnessed aspiration, sedative medication, and comorbidity. Recognition may be delayed because, in this population, pneumonia often presents without fever, cough, or dyspnea. Accurate identification of the etiologic agent is hampered because most patients cannot produce a suitable sputum specimen. It is difficult to distinguish colonization from infection. Colonization by Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative organisms can result from aspiration of oral or gastric contents, which could lead to pneumonia. Aspiration of gastric contents also can produce aspiration pneumonitis. This condition is not infectious initially and may resolve without antibiotics. Antibiotics for the treatment of pneumonia should cover Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, gram-negative rods, and S. aureus. Acceptable choices include quinolones or an extended-spectrum beta-lactam plus a macrolide. Treatment should last 10 to 14 days. Pneumonia is associated with significant mortality for up to two years. Dementia is related independently to the death rate within the first week after pneumonia, regardless of treatment. Prevention strategies include vaccination against S. pneumoniae and influenza on admission to the care facility. This article focuses on recent recommendations for the recognition of respiratory symptoms and criteria for the designation of probable pneumonia, and provides a guide to hospitalization, antibiotic use, and prevention.

### Clinically defined aspiration pneumonia is an independent risk factor associated with long-term hospital stay: a prospective cohort study [^114F8n75]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We identified clinically defined aspiration pneumonia itself as an independent risk factor associated with long-term hospital stay. We also identified that male sex, and multi-lobar chest X ray involvement were associated with long-term hospital stay among patients with aspiration pneumonia in an exploratory sub-analysis.

The reason why aspiration pneumonia itself is associated with long-term hospital stay may be that dysphagia in pneumonia patients is an inhibitory factor of discharge from hospital. Previous studies also revealed that aspiration pneumonia was associated with an increase in recurrent pneumonia. This condition may result from repeated aspiration, either silent or in evidence, which may result in long-term hospital stay even when the pneumonia itself is adequately treated. Therefore, both pre-, in-, and post-hospital interventions are important.

The most important pre-hospital intervention may be disease prevention. Implementation of preventive measures, including drug therapy, vaccination and/or rehabilitation, is a critical intervention, notably in patients with risk factors for aspiration. As an in-hospital intervention, in addition to adequate antibiotic therapy, early rehabilitation and physical therapy have been shown to shorten the length of hospital stay in patients with dysphagia. Follow-up management strategies such as newer rehabilitation approaches of stimulation techniques for patients with aspiration pneumonia due to dysphagia have already been recommended. In recent studies, the thickness of the erector spine muscles has been showed to be associated with prognosis of many diseases, including aspiration pneumonia. Strengthening the erector spine muscles may also be a specific rehabilitation strategy to prevent aspiration pneumonia or shorten the length of hospital stay.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1168zSU9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Aspiration pneumonia anaerobic coverage — hospitalized adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): we suggest not routinely adding anaerobic coverage for suspected aspiration pneumonia unless lung abscess or empyema is suspected (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence); some have estimated that 5% to 15% of pneumonia hospitalizations are associated with aspiration, and patients who aspirate gastric contents are considered to have aspiration pneumonitis, with many having resolution of symptoms within 24 to 48 hours and requiring only supportive treatment, without antibiotics; rates are higher in populations admitted from nursing homes or extended care facilities, and several studies of acute aspiration events in hospitalized patients have suggested that anaerobic bacteria do not play a major role in etiology.

### Pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonitis in nursing home residents: diagnosis and management [^111gk6EU]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the frequency of aspiration pneumonitis in nursing home residents with an initial diagnosis of pneumonia and to compare the clinical characteristics, management, and outcome of aspiration pneumonitis with those of pneumonia.

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Hospital geriatric unit for nursing home residents.

Participants

Nursing home residents admitted to the inpatient geriatric unit with suspected pneumonia between May 1999 and April 2001 (n = 195 episodes).

Measurements

Aspiration events were defined as definite (witnessed or unwitnessed) or suspected. Aspiration pneumonitis was defined as symptoms/signs of lower respiratory tract infection plus a history of an aspiration event plus a lower lobe infiltrate on chest radiograph. Pneumonia was defined as symptoms/signs of lower respiratory tract infection plus an infiltrate on chest radiograph plus no history of an aspiration event.

Results

The 195 episodes were stratified into three clinical groups: aspiration pneumonitis (n = 86; aspiration history/infiltrate), pneumonia (n = 43; no aspiration history/infiltrate), and an aspiration event (n = 66; aspiration history/no infiltrate). In general, symptoms, signs, and laboratory tests were not useful in distinguishing between the three groups. Survivors with aspiration pneumonitis (13/75 (17%)) or with an aspiration event (20/60 (33%)) were significantly more likely not to be treated with an antibiotic or to be treated for 1 day or less than those with pneumonia (0/41; P < .001). Excluding those not treated, significantly more patients with pneumonia (33/40 (83%)) were discharged on antibiotic treatment than those with aspiration pneumonitis (35/70 (50%)) or an aspiration event (21/51 (41%); P < .001). There was no significant difference in hospital mortality between the three clinical groups.

Conclusions

The findings of this study have implications for the diagnosis and management of suspected pneumonia in nursing home residents but require prospective validation.

### Antibiotic therapy in comatose mechanically ventilated patients following aspiration: differentiating pneumonia from pneumonitis [^116dkVcF]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the proportion of patients with documented bacterial aspiration pneumonia among comatose ICU patients with symptoms suggesting either bacterial aspiration pneumonia or non-bacterial aspiration pneumonitis.

Design

Prospective observational study.

Setting

University-affiliated 30-bed ICU.

Patients

Prospective cohort of 250 patients admitted to the ICU with coma (Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 8) and treated with invasive mechanical ventilation.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with microbiologically documented bacterial aspiration pneumonia. Patients meeting predefined criteria for aspiration syndrome routinely underwent telescopic plugged catheter sampling during bronchoscopy before starting probabilistic antibiotic treatment. When cultures were negative, the antibiotic treatment was stopped. Of 250 included patients, 98 (39.2%) had aspiration syndrome, including 92 before mechanical ventilation discontinuation. Telescopic plugged catheter in these 92 patients showed bacterial aspiration pneumonia in 43 patients (46.7%). Among the remaining 49 patients, 16 continued to receive antibiotics, usually for infections other than pneumonia; of the 33 patients whose antibiotics were discontinued, only two subsequently showed signs of lung infection. In the six patients with aspiration syndrome after mechanical ventilation, and therefore without telescopic plugged catheter, antibiotic treatment was continued for 7 days. Mechanical ventilation duration, ICU length of stay, and mortality did not differ between the 43 patients with bacterial aspiration pneumonia and the 49 patients with non-bacterial aspiration pneumonitis. The 152 patients without aspiration syndrome did not receive antibiotics.

Conclusions

Among comatose patients receiving mechanical ventilation, those without clinical, laboratory, or radiologic evidence of bacterial aspiration pneumonia did not require antibiotics. In those with suspected bacterial aspiration pneumonia, stopping empirical antibiotic therapy when routine telescopic plugged catheter sampling recovered no microorganisms was nearly always effective. This strategy may be a valid alternative to routine full-course antibiotic therapy. Only half the patients with suspected bacterial aspiration pneumonia had this diagnosis confirmed by telescopic plugged catheter sampling.

### Nosocomial lung infections in adult intensive care units [^114TPwZe]. Microbes and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Nosocomial respiratory tract infections are the leading type of nosocomial infections. Despite the development of new antibiotic therapies, they are associated with an increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with comorbidities are especially predisposed to acquire these infections, as are patients exposed to respiratory therapy. Aspiration of colonized secretions from the oropharynx is the main mechanism of infection development. Barrier techniques to reduce aspiration and antimicrobial agents to alter bacterial flora are important in preventing pneumonia episodes. The initial institution of an adequate antibiotic regimen is a determinant of outcome. Nosocomial pneumonias are often difficult to treat due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Antibiotic policies are crucial in avoiding a progression in antibiotic resistance.

### Is a strategy based on routine endotracheal cultures the best way to prescribe antibiotics in ventilator-associated pneumonia? [^115JFZYy]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to evaluate if a strategy based on routine endotracheal aspirate (ETA) cultures is better than using the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) guidelines to prescribe antimicrobials in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Methods

This was a prospective, observational, cohort study conducted in a 15-bed ICU and comprising 283 patients who were mechanically ventilated for ≥ 48 h. Interventions included twice-weekly ETA; BAL culture was done if VAP was suspected. BAL (collected at the time of VAP) plus ETA cultures (collected ≤ 7 days before VAP) (n = 146 different pairs) were defined. We compared two models of 10 days of empirical antimicrobials (ETA-based vs ATS/IDSA guidelines-based strategies), analyzing their impact on appropriateness of therapy and total antimicrobial-days, using the BAL result as the standard for comparison.

Results

Complete ETA and BAL culture concordance (identical pathogens or negative result) occurred in 52 pairs; discordance (false positive or false negative) in 67, and partial concordance in two. ETA predicted the etiology in 62.4% of all pairs, in 74.0% of pairs if ETA was performed ≤ 2 days before BAL, and in 46.2% of pairs if ETA was performed 3 to 7 days before BAL (P = 0.016). Strategies based on the ATS/IDSA guidelines and on ETA results led to appropriate therapy in 97.9% and 77.4% of pairs, respectively (P < .001). The numbers of antimicrobial-days were 1,942 and 1,557 for therapies based on ATS/IDSA guidelines and ETA results, respectively (P < .001).

Conclusions

The ATS/IDSA guidelines-based approach was more accurate than the ETA-based strategy for prescribing appropriate, initial, empirical antibiotics in VAP, unless a sample was available ≤ 2 days of the onset of VAP. The ETA-based strategy led to fewer days on prescribed antimicrobials.

### Methods for decreasing risk of aspiration pneumonia in critically ill patients [^111GEvEu]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is a significant clinical concern in critically ill hospitalized patients, leading to increase in the use of antibiotics, length of hospital stay, and the risk of mortality. Pneumonia caused by aspiration of gastric contents is of particular concern in patients who need mechanical ventilation and feeding through a nasogastric tube. Therefore, methods for decreasing the risk of aspiration are very important.

Methods

This review article summarizes factors that might influence the development of aspiration pneumonia, such as the position of the patient's body or type of hospital bed, methods of feeding, medications administered, suctioning of subglottic secretions, and bacterial decontamination.

Results

Elevating the head of the bed (45 degrees), continuous subglottic suctioning, and oral decontamination seem to be effective in the prevention of aspiration pneumonia.

### Clinical and microbiological end points in the treatment of pneumonia [^117ECfeH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration is reviewing its criteria for evaluating new antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia.

This brief contribution outlines areas for further consideration as new drugs are evaluated.

### Dynamics of microbiota during mechanical ventilation in aspiration pneumonia [^113Wmd9w]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

From the present findings, it can be deduced that antibiotics should be selected on the premise that dynamic changes in microbiota (involved in the reduction of anaerobes in the lower respiratory tract) may occur during mechanical ventilation in intubated patients with aspiration pneumonia. It was suggested that antibiotic treatment for anaerobes in these cases may not be appropriate. Additional pathogenic investigation should be conducted after over 3 h from initiating mechanical ventilation. However, because this is a single location observational study, and because the sample size was small, evaluation by larger scale interventional analysis is required for finding the most appropriate antibiotic regimen. The use of wide spectrum antibiotics (unnecessarily) leads to the emergence of drug resistant bacteria — which is now an urgent health-related problem. Needless to say, accurate identification of pathogenic bacteria and the justified usage of antibiotics are both imperative.

### Comparison of ceftriaxone plus macrolide and ampicillin / sulbactam plus macrolide in treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for aspiration: an open-label, quasi-randomized, controlled trial [^116wsaXe]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ceftriaxone (CTRX) and ampicillin/sulbactam (ABPC/SBT) are recommended by various guidelines as the first-line antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, which of these antibiotics is more effective for treating non-aspiration CAP remains unclear.

Methods

This study was a prospective, single-center, open-label, quasi-randomized controlled trial. Patients with adult CAP without risk for aspiration were allocated to either a CTRX or ABPC/SBT group based on the date of hospital admission. Macrolide was added to patients in each group. The primary outcome was the clinical response in the validated per-protocol (VPP) population at end of treatment (EOT). The secondary outcomes were clinical response during treatment and at end of study (EOS) in the VPP population, and mortality rate at day 30 in the modified intention-to-treat (MITT) population.

Results

Of 696 screened patients, 433 patients were excluded and 263 patients were allocated to receive either of the treatments. Males comprised 54% of patients and mean age and PSI were 62.1 ± 19.8years and 69.3 ± 30.0, respectively, with 124 patients allocated to the CTRX group and 138 patients allocated to the ABPC/SBT group. The clinical effectiveness rate for the VPP population at EOT was 90% in the CTRX and 96% in the ABPC/SBT group (p = 0.072, 95% confidence interval [CI] of risk difference [RD]: -12.6–0.8%). No significant difference in effectiveness at day 4 was observed between the CTRX and ABPC/SBT groups (p = 0.079, 95%CI of RD: -12.1–0.4%), but at day 7, ABPC/SBT was significantly more effective than CTRX in the VPP population (p = 0.047, 95%CI of RD: -13.3–0.4%). No significant difference in late response at EOS was seen between CTRX and ABPC/SBT groups: cure (89 [86%] and 102 [94%]), relapse (5 [5%] and 1 [1%]) and failure (10 [10%] and 5 [5%]; p = 0.053). Deaths within 30days in MITT population was higher in CTRX group (4 [3%]) than in ABPC/SBT group (0 [0%]) (p = 0.048, 95%CI of RD: 0.1–6.3%).

Conclusion

No significant difference in effectiveness was found between ABPC/SBT and CTRX at EOT. However, ABPC/SBT might be more effective in the early phase of treatment.

### Guidelines for enhanced recovery after trauma and intensive care (ERATIC): enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) and international association for trauma surgery and intensive care (IATSIC) society recommendations: paper 2: postoperative and intensive care recommendations [^113PmF8B]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

NMBAs could be used in the appropriate setting for trauma patients, but should be limited to bolus dosing for a maximum of 48 h duration. All patients should have BIS monitoring, if available, when paralyzed to ensure adequate depth of sedation.

Aspiration Pneumonia

Aspiration of gastric contents, due to regurgitation and vomiting, the presence of nasoenteric tubes or loss of airway reflexes (resulting from low level of consciousness) is a distinct risk during the initial assessment phase, operative induction phase, and during ICU care. Brain trauma is a particular risk factor over and above the other risk factors in trauma ICU patients. Furthermore, patients with acute abdomen, major truncal trauma, and those who require emergency surgical intervention have a higher risk. Aspiration is common with an incidence between 30% and 40%, much of which is subclinical. Early antibiotic therapy for simple gastric aspiration is unnecessary, with no benefit shown and the potential for generating resistant organisms. Early bronchoscopy will allow for correct classification between fluid and particulate aspiration, allowing removal of particulate matter and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures can guide therapy, both for aspiration and unexpected early (non‐VAP) pneumonia. Early antibiotic therapy for "sterile" gastric aspiration is not advocated, and selective antibiotics should be deescalated within 72 h if cultures are negative. It remains challenging to distinguish pneumonitis from pneumonia. When managed acutely, the morbidity and mortality are lower than other pneumonias in ICU. Where antimicrobials are used, there does not seem to be an outcome difference between baseline first choice and escalated level of antibiotic therapy in this pathology. Short courses of antibiotics, covering community acquired organisms but not anaerobes, may be indicated in cases with aspiration of stasis‐type enteric contents from beyond the stomach or where the aspiration occurs in the fed ICU patient.

### Evaluation of the effect of diagnostic methodology on the reported incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia [^112oupGT]. Thorax (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal method for diagnosing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is controversial and its effect on reported incidence uncertain. This study aimed to model the impact of using either endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage on the reported incidence of pneumonia and then to test effects suggested from theoretical modelling in clinical practice.

Methods

A three-part single-centre study was undertaken. First, diagnostic performance of aspirate and lavage were compared using paired samples from 53 patients with suspected VAP. Secondly, infection surveillance data were used to model the potential effect on pneumonia incidence and antibiotic use of using exclusively aspirate or lavage to investigate suspected pneumonia (643 patients; 110 clinically suspected pneumonia episodes). Thirdly, a practice change initiative was undertaken to increase lavage use; pneumonia incidence and antibiotic use were compared for the 12 months before and after the change.

Results

Aspirate overdiagnosed VAP compared with lavage (89% vs 21% of clinically suspected cases, p < 0.0001). Modelling suggested that changing from exclusive aspirate to lavage diagnosis would decrease reported pneumonia incidence by 76% (95% CI 67% to 87%) and antibiotic use by 30% (95% CI 20% to 42%). After the practice change initiative, lavage use increased from 37% to 58%. Although clinically suspected pneumonia incidence was unchanged, microbiologically confirmed VAP decreased from 18 to 9 cases per 1000 ventilator days (p = 0.001; relative risk reduction 0.61 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.82)), and mean antibiotic use fell from 9.1 to 7.2 antibiotic days (21% decrease, p = 0.08).

Conclusions

Diagnostic technique impacts significantly on reported VAP incidence and potentially on antibiotic use.

### Reappraisal of clindamycin IV monotherapy for treatment of mild-to-moderate aspiration pneumonia in elderly patients [^116vx3u1]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Background

As the number of elderly people has increased in Japan, the occurrence of aspiration pneumonia has also increased. Guidelines for the treatment of pneumonia have been proposed, in which the use of antibiotics, such as beta-lactam plus beta-lactamase inhibitor, clindamycin, and carbapenem, has been recommended as effective against anaerobic bacteria in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia. However, to our knowledge, a prospective comparison of these antibiotics regarding their clinical efficacy in aspiration pneumonia has not been performed.

Study Objectives

We compared the effects of IV administration of a half dose of ampicillin/sulbactam (SBT/ABPC), normal dose of SBT/ABPC, IV clindamycin, and IV panipenem/betamiprom (PAPM/BP) for treatment of mild-to-moderate aspiration pneumonia in elderly patients.

Design

Randomized prospective study.

Patients

One hundred adult patients with compatible signs and symptoms of aspiration pneumonia.

Assessments

Patients were assessed before, during, and after treatment regarding symptoms, as well as results of laboratory values, chest radiograph examinations, and sputum bacterial cultures.

Results

We found few differences between the groups regarding cure rate, duration of IV medication, and occurrence of adverse effects with the tested therapies. However, clindamycin therapy was less expensive and was associated with a lower rate of posttreatment occurrence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Conclusions

Clindamycin therapy for mild-to-moderate aspiration pneumonia is clinically effective, and provides economic advantages as compared to SBT/ABPC or PAPM/BP therapy.

### Comparison of ceftriaxone plus macrolide and ampicillin / sulbactam plus macrolide in treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for aspiration: an open-label, quasi-randomized, controlled trial [^114UfuF4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, the clinical effectiveness rates of CTRX and ABPC/SBT were compared in patients with CAP without risk factors for aspiration pneumonia. To our knowledge, this comparison has not been investigated in previous studies. Both antibiotics showed a high clinical effectiveness rate, and no significant differences were found between CTRX and ABPC/SBT at EOT (p = 0.072) in the VPP population. However, at day 7, the clinical effectiveness rate was higher for ABPC/SBT than for CTRX (p = 0.047). A similar result was obtained on days 4 and 7 in the MITT population (p = 0.018, 0.007).

It has been reported that there is no significant difference between β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations and third-generation cephalosporins in the treatment of CAP. However, most of those previous reports were retrospective studies, except for one that, unfortunately, did not undertake a direct comparison between β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations and third-generation cephalosporins. Those studies included cases of aspiration pneumonia. For aspiration pneumonia, Hasegawa reported in a retrospective propensity score-matching analysis that mortality was not significantly different between ABPC/SBT and CTRX groups. However, whether the two drugs show equivalent effectiveness in the treatment of pneumonia without aspiration risk remains unclear. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to compare the efficacy of CTRX and ABPC/SBT in the treatment of patients with CAP without risk factors for aspiration pneumonia.

The differences in efficacy between CTRX and ABPC/SBT in CAP treatment would be due to anaerobic bacteria, which are common causes of aspiration pneumonia. However, anaerobic bacteria can also cause pneumonia in patients without apparent risk factors for aspiration pneumonia. In a previous study that carried out a bacterial floral analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences in patients with CAP, 17.9% of detected bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were anaerobic, even in patients without risk factors for aspiration. Although the authors stated that it was unclear whether anaerobic bacteria were the primary cause, their results suggest that anaerobic bacteria may cause pneumonia in some patients without risk factors for aspiration. These reasons might explain the difference in effectiveness rate in the early phase between CTRX and ABPC/SBT in the present study, because the susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to third-generation cephalosporins is lower than that to β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

### Microbiology and prognostic factors of hospital-and community-acquired aspiration pneumonia in respiratory intensive care unit [^116qJWKT]. American Journal of Infection Control (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Incidence of aspiration pneumonia in hospital-acquired pneumonia and community-acquired pneumonia is high; however, many features of this disease remain imprecise. Our objective was to characterize the microbial etiology and their antibiotic resistance and to determine the prognostic factors in aspiration pneumonia among patients admitted to a respiratory intensive care unit (RICU).

Methods

A prospective survey was conducted in 112 patients exhibiting hospital-or community-acquired aspiration pneumonia in the RICU of a provincial general hospital from 2010–2012. Bronchoalveolar lavage sampling was collected, and then followed by standard culture and drug-sensitive test. Risk factors were analyzed by multivariate logistic analysis.

Results

One hundred twenty-eight strains were isolated in 94 patients, gram-negative bacilli (57.8%) was the predominant cultured microorganism, followed by fungus (28.9%) and gram-positive cocci (13.3%). The 5 main isolated bacteria demonstrated high and multiantibiotic resistance. The crude overall mortality was 43.8%, 50%, and 40%, respectively, in hospital- and community-acquired aspiration pneumonia group. Multivariate logistic analysis identified age older than 65 years, use of inotropic support, and ineffective initial therapy as independent risk factors of poor outcome.

Conclusions

The predominant pathogenic bacteria of aspiration pneumonia in patients admitted to an RICU were antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and effective initial supportive management secured better prognosis.

### Dynamics of microbiota during mechanical ventilation in aspiration pneumonia [^112pV3Am]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Aspiration pneumonia is an infectious process caused by the inhalation of oropharyngeal secretions in which pathogenic bacteria are colonized. Several studies show that aspiration is implicated in 5 to 20% of community acquired pneumonia and 15 to 75% of healthcare-associated pneumonia. As for causative agents, anaerobic bacteria and facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli were detected from patients with aspiration pneumonia. Culture methods are typically used to identify the causative agents. However, it is often difficult to identify the causative bacteria in patients' tracheal aspirate via the culture method because anaerobic bacteria are usually difficult to culture, and because tracheal aspirate contains contaminants of indigenous oral bacteria. Although over 700 bacterial species/phylotypes have been detected in the oral cavity by genetic analysis, a large number of anaerobic species have yet to be detected by culture using conventional methodologies. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate pathogens of aspiration pneumonia via culture-dependent methods. Difficulty in identification of causative bacteria may lead to inappropriate administration of antibiotics and the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. The proportion of nosocomial infections caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens is increasing, resulting in an increased length of hospital stay, mortality, and cost. The emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens is an urgent health-related problem, and proper use of antibiotics is necessary.

Advances in DNA sequencing technologies have allowed analysis of diverse microbiota and the evaluation of pathogenic bacteria by using culture-independent methods. In cases of aspiration pneumonia, 16S rRNA gene sequencing is used for the identification of causative bacteria. However, how microbiota of the oral cavity and lower respiratory tract changes as a result of antibiotic administration or mechanical ventilation has not been sufficiently evaluated. In particular, high concentrations of oxygen may be administered during mechanical ventilation, and we have found no reports regarding the dynamics of anaerobes in the lower respiratory tract during mechanical ventilation. We therefore hypothesized that microbiota in patients with aspiration pneumonia — especially with anaerobes in the lower respiratory tract — change dynamically during mechanical ventilation and the administration of antibiotics. Recognition of the actual causative agents using 16S rRNA gene sequencing for microbiota analysis may lead to new treatment procedures for pneumonia. To confirm our hypothesis, we evaluated the changes in the microbiota of oral cavities and lower respiratory tracts in cases of mechanically ventilated patients with aspiration pneumonia using the clone library analysis (based on highly accurate 16S rRNA gene sequencing).

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^115TU8kf]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics with extended anaerobic coverage are used commonly to treat aspiration pneumonia, which is not recommended by current guidelines.

Research Question

In patients admitted to hospital for community-acquired aspiration pneumonia, does a difference exist between antibiotic therapy with limited anaerobic coverage (LAC) vs antibiotic therapy with extended anaerobic coverage (EAC) in terms of in-hospital mortality and risk of Clostridioides difficile colitis?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study across 18 hospitals in Ontario, Canada, from January 1, 2015, to January 1, 2022. Patients were included if the physician diagnosed aspiration pneumonia and prescribed guideline-concordant first-line community-acquired pneumonia parenteral antibiotic therapy to the patient within 48 h of admission. Patients then were categorized into the LAC group if they received ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin. Patients were categorized into the EAC group if they received amoxicillin-clavulanate, moxifloxacin, or any of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin in combination with clindamycin or metronidazole. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included incident C difficile colitis occurring after admission. Overlap weighting of propensity scores was used to balance baseline prognostic factors.

Results

The LAC and EAC groups included 2,683 and 1,316 patients, respectively. In hospital, 814 patients (30.3%) and 422 patients (32.1%) in the LAC and EAC groups died, respectively. C difficile colitis occurred in five or fewer patients (≤ 0.2%) and 11 to 15 patients (0.8%-1.1%) in the LAC and EAC groups, respectively. After overlap weighting of propensity scores, the adjusted risk difference of EAC minus LAC was 1.6% (95% CI, -1.7% to 4.9%) for in-hospital mortality and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.7%) for C difficile colitis.

Interpretation

We found that extended anaerobic coverage likely is unnecessary in aspiration pneumonia because it was associated with no additional mortality benefit, only an increased risk of C difficile colitis.

### Dynamics of microbiota during mechanical ventilation in aspiration pneumonia [^111dwN8J]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The microbiota of the lower respiratory tract changes dynamically during mechanical ventilation before administration of antibiotics in intubated patients with aspiration pneumonia. The potential of microbiota alteration should be considered for the proper antibiotic treatment in these patients.

### Fever and infections in surgical intensive care: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^111abrfR]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Pulmonary infections are one of the most common causes of fever in critically ill patients, affecting an estimated 25%–33% of ICU patients, this is more common in trauma and the risk is increased in certain injury patterns and with increased injury severity. Neither fever nor leukocytosis, nor the combination are associated with positive respiratory cultures, but they are frequently obtained even in the absence of X-ray findings or clinical evidence of pneumonia. Respiratory cultures may help support the diagnosis, but the presence of bacteria on culture is not diagnostic of a pneumonia because a majority of intubated patients will have colonization of the endotracheal tube — this is especially true if tracheal aspirates are used, although the use of bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) does not eliminate false positives or false negatives. Unfortunately, a positive culture is often routinely managed with antibiotics regardless of the diagnostic impression.

The clinical determination or strong suspicion of the syndrome of pneumonia should guide whether or not cultures are initiated. Information for this determination includes imaging findings (chest X-ray, ultrasound or CT), new or acutely worsened oxygenation deficit, the onset of purulent secretions, with concomitant new fever or white count that is not otherwise explained. We find that the clustering of factors in the correct clinical setting is more useful than a single score or numerical cut-off.

There is no strong data to support BAL, mini-BAL, or protected specimen brushing over non-invasive methods of tracheal aspiration or for semi-quantitative over qualitative cultures. An argument can be made for or against either. The joint guideline from the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) weakly recommends non-invasive sampling based on low-quality evidence, while in trauma patients the utility of mini-BAL has been demonstrated specifically in its ability to parse the diagnosis of pneumonia from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We recommend institutional multidisciplinary review of accepted practices and verification of correct interpretation based on techniques used.

Question

When is it appropriate to hold antibiotics in cases of fever in the ICU?

Recommendation

Due to significant harm associated with inappropriate antibiotic therapy, it is important to evaluate the likelihood of infection when deciding for or against empiric antibiotic initiation. Once started, de-escalation or stoppage should occur in a timely manner with decision-support by multidisciplinary evaluation and local protocols. Procalcitonin can be used in the context of a multidisciplinary institutional protocol, however, the utility is limited in critically injured patients and certain surgical populations.

### Nosocomial pneumonia [^111uDNo6]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review describes the most recent advances in the management and prevention of nosocomial pneumonia. The new ATS guidelines in particular are most likely to affect clinical practice outside the USA.

Recent Findings

The problem of multidrug-resistant bacteria causing nosocomial pneumonia seems to be increasing. This is particularly true for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. While the diagnosis of ventilator associated pneumonia remains a conflictive issue, serial tracheobronchial aspirates may improve the selection of adequate antimicrobial treatment. Combined beta-lactam and aminoglycoside therapy is inferior to beta-lactam monotherapy, both in terms of clinical outcome and in the prevention of resistance during treatment; in addition, it carries an increased risk of nephrotoxicity.

Summary

The updated ATS guidelines will considerably impact clinical approaches to nosocomial and healthcare-related pneumonia. Serial tracheobronchial aspirates can be used to guide selection of antimicrobial treatment in ventilator associated pneumonia. The combination of beta-lactams and aminoglycosides is likely to be abandoned in the future. New potent treatment options for pneumonia due to nonfermenters are urgently needed.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (non-VAP) — microbiologic guidance for therapy: We suggest that patients with suspected HAP (non-VAP) be treated according to the results of microbiologic studies performed on respiratory samples obtained noninvasively, rather than being treated empirically (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Noninvasive methods to obtain respiratory samples include spontaneous expectoration, sputum induction, nasotracheal suctioning in a patient who is unable to cooperate to produce a sputum sample, and endotracheal aspiration in a patient with a tracheostomy.

### Strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated events, and nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^1134Jycq]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The following interventions may lower VAP rates, but current data are insufficient to determine their impact on duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and mortality.

Consider using endotracheal tubes with subglottic secretion drainage ports to minimize pooling of secretions above the endotracheal cuff in patients likely to require > 48–72 hours of intubation (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE). Intermittent and continuous drainage of subglottic secretions has been studied in at least 20 randomized controlled trials. On meta-analysis, the use of endotracheal tubes with subglottic drainage reduced VAP rates by 44%. There was no association, however, between subglottic secretion drainage and duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, or hospital length of stay. One meta-analysis reported a significant impact on mortality but abstracted one large study twice. The effect on mortality was no longer significant after removing the duplicate study (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.83–1.02). One large trial included VAE as an outcome and found no association between subglottic secretion drainage and VAE rates. Some studies have reported that subglottic secretion drainage is associated with less antibiotic utilization, but others have not. – Reductions in duration of mechanical ventilation with subglottic secretion drainage appear to be limited to patients expected to require > 48–72 hours of mechanical ventilation. Endotracheal tubes with subglottic secretion drainage ports should therefore be reserved for patients likely to require > 48–72 hours of intubation. Patients requiring emergency intubation in the hospital and preoperative patients at risk for prolonged mechanical ventilation are reasonable candidates. Extubation followed by immediate reintubation to exchange a conventional endotracheal tube for a subglottic secretion drainage endotracheal tube is not recommended.
Consider early tracheostomy (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE). Meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials suggests that early tracheostomy (within 7 days of intubation) may be associated with a 40% decrease in VAP rates, less time on mechanical ventilation, and fewer ICU days but no difference in mortality. Decision makers should integrate these potential benefits with each patient's values and preferences when determining whether and when to proceed with tracheostomy.
Consider postpyloric feeding tube placement in patients with gastric feeding intolerance at high risk for aspiration (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE). Postpyloric feeding is associated with less aspiration and less pneumonia compared to gastric-tube feeding. Meta-analyses vary in their assessment of whether postpyloric feeding is associated with decreases in ventilator, ICU, and/or hospital length of stay. Postpyloric tube placement requires special expertise that is not available in all centers and may incur delay in placement. Postpyloric feeding is considered less physiologic than gastric feeding. Postpyloric feeding should therefore be reserved for patients with gastric feeding intolerance and for patients at high risk for aspiration as detailed in nutrition society guidelines.

### Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic review of the literature [^115dm7b3]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The major limitation of the clinical approach to diagnosis is that it consistently leads to more antibiotic therapy than when therapy decisions are based on the findings of invasive lower respiratory tract samples. The clinical approach is overly sensitive, and patients can be treated for pneumonia when another non-infectious process is responsible for the clinical findings.

As none of the available diagnostic tests, performed alone, can provide an accurate diagnosis of VAP, a diagnostic strategy incorporating several criteria seems to be a good compromise. On the basis of clinical data, patients with clinical suspicion of VAP should be further evaluated by imaging procedures, bacteriological cultures, and biomarkers (Figure 1). The results of complementary diagnostic procedures should be used to refine the probability of diagnosing VAP and guide therapeutic decisions. Quantitative cultures should be performed on endotracheal aspirates or samples collected bronchoscopically, each technique having its own methodological limitations. Delays in the initiation of adequate antibiotic therapy increase mortality of VAP and thus therapy should not be postponed for the purpose of performing diagnostic studies in patients who are clinically unstable. The presence of organ dysfunction may necessitate the prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy. Garrard and A'Court recommended regular, repeated surveillance with a simple, inexpensive, and well tolerated lavage technique in addition to daily clinical scoring to identify patients who may have VAP. A recent meta-analysis of four randomized studies with a total of 628 patients showed that invasive strategies for the diagnosis of VAP did not alter mortality. In a recent multicenter trial, Heyland et al. randomized 740 patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation and who had suspected VAP after 4 days in the ICU to undergo either BAL with quantitative culture of the BAL fluid or endotracheal aspiration with non-quantitative culture of the aspirate. Empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated in all patients until culture results were available, at which point a protocol of targeted therapy was used for discontinuing or reducing the dose or number of antibiotics, or for resuming antibiotic therapy to treat a pre-enrollment condition if the culture was negative. There was no significant difference in outcomes or the use of antibiotics. The most likely explanation for this lack of effect on outcome is that prompt adequate initial antimicrobial coverage is the crucial issue affecting survival. Inappropriate or inadequate treatment refers to the use of antibiotics with either limited or no in vitro activity against the microorganism causing the infection. Since invasive sampling for suspected VAP does not directly affect the initial antibiotic prescription, it is not surprising that it does not alter mortality. Because of the nature of the technology, the culture results from bronchoscopy become available only after the crucial period when the clinician can intervene to maximal effect.

### Antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia in neurologically impaired children [^112QZLkz]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare hospital outcomes associated with commonly used antibiotic therapies for aspiration pneumonia in children with neurologic impairment (NI).

Design/Methods

A retrospective study of children with NI hospitalized with aspiration pneumonia at 39 children's hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System database. Exposure was empiric antibiotic therapy classified by antimicrobial activity. Outcomes included acute respiratory failure, intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, and hospital length of stay (LOS). Multivariable regression evaluated associations between exposure and outcomes and adjusted for confounders, including medical complexity and acute illness severity.

Results

In the adjusted analysis, children receiving Gram-negative coverage alone had two-fold greater odds of respiratory failure (odds ratio [OR] 2.15; 95% CI: 1.41–3.27), greater odds of ICU transfer (OR 1.80; 95% CI: 1.03–3.14), and longer LOS [adjusted rate ratio (RR) 1.28; 95% CI: 1.16–1.41] than those receiving anaerobic coverage alone. Children receiving anaerobic and Gram-negative coverage had higher odds of respiratory failure (OR 1.65; 95% CI: 1.19–2.28) than those receiving anaerobic coverage alone, but ICU transfer (OR 1.15; 95% CI: 0.73–1.80) and length of stay (RR 1.07; 95% CI: 0.98–1.16) did not statistically differ. For children receiving anaerobic, Gram-negative, and P. aeruginosa coverage, LOS was shorter (RR 0.83; 95% CI: 0.76–0.90) than those receiving anaerobic coverage alone; odds of respiratory failure and ICU transfer rates did not significantly differ.

Conclusions

Anaerobic therapy appears to be important in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia in children with NI. While Gram-negative coverage alone was associated with worse outcomes, its addition to anaerobic therapy may not yield improved outcomes.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^115dAYy6]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Third, we were able to capture new C difficile colitis diagnosed only in hospital, so diagnoses made after discharge were not captured. The risk of C difficile colitis is estimated to be highest within 3 to 14 days from the first antibiotic dose, and then decreases over time. Thus, our study would have captured the highest risk period during a patient's hospital stay.

Fourth, as is the case for any observational study, residual confounding may still be present. It is plausible that clinicians' empiric antibiotic choice depended on illness severity, where sicker patients were more likely to receive additional anaerobic coverage. This did not seem to be the case in this study based on baseline characteristics between the two groups with similar proportion of ICU admissions and mLAPS (Table 1). We had also balanced many prognostic factors using propensity score overlap weighting.

Fifth, a bacterial pathogen was not identified in the vast majority of study patients. ICD-10-CA codes likely are highly insensitive for specific bacterial pathogens. As well, the microbiological yield in aspiration pneumonia is low, because it is reasonable to treat moderately severe aspiration pneumonia without microbiological workup based on the current guidelines. Furthermore, even with a full microbiological workup, anaerobes are difficult to grow in cultures. Our study reflects the real-world clinical practice in which almost all cases of aspiration pneumonia are treated with antibiotics empirically without available microbiological data to tailor antibiotic therapy.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2024 update [^113nCNyU]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society drowning guidelines — antibiotics: Although microorganisms present in aspirated water may eventually cause pneumonia, no study to date has shown benefit from empiric administration of antibiotics in drowning patients, and microorganisms found in drowning-associated pneumonia are atypical bacteria or fungi and often are resistant to standard empiric treatments. Aspiration of even small volumes of water can produce radiographic abnormalities that can mimic pneumonia, and trauma, hypoxemia, and airway irritation can cause leukocytosis and fever, complicating differentiation from infection. We do not recommend empiric antibiotic therapy in the initial treatment of drowning patients; after initial resuscitation, if pneumonia is present, treatment should be guided by bacterial culture or antigen testing, and in the absence of these tests the decision to start should be based on clinical examination for physical evidence of infection. Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence.

Composition of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance rates in patients with AP

Table 4 lists the distribution of pathogens in respiratory specimens of patients with AP treated with vancomycin + piperacillin-tazobactam. In the 396 AP patients treated with vancomycin + piperacillin-tazobactam, 2051 strains of pathogens were detected. These included 156 strains (7.60% of the total) of fungi, 660 strains (32.18% of the total) of Gram-positive bacteria, and 1235 strains (60.22% of the total) of Gram- negative bacteria.

An additional table file shows the drug resistance characteristics of Gram-negative bacteria in respiratory specimens of patients with AP treated with vancomycin + piperacillin-tazobactam (see Additional file 3: Table S2). The results indicate that out of 1235 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, 169 strains were resistant (13.68% of the total), including 20 strains resistant to piperacillin-tazobactamorvancomycin, though the resistance rate was relatively low (< 1.62%).

An additional table file lists the distribution of pathogens in respiratory specimens of patients with AP treated with levofloxacin + metronidazole (see Additional file 4: Table S3). In the 41 patients with AP treated with levofloxacin + metronidazole, 41 strains of pathogens were detected. These included 4 strains (9.76% of the total) of fungi, 35 strains (85.36% of the total) of Gram-positive bacteria, and 2 strains (4.88% of the total) of Gram-negative bacteria. An additional table file outlines the drug resistance characteristics of these pathogens. In the respiratory specimens of patients with AP treated with levofloxacin + metronidazole, 2 strains were resistant to levofloxacin, and 2 strains were MRSA positive (see Additional file 5: Table S4).

### Decreasing aspiration risk with enteral feeding [^11592Qaz]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Aspiration is a clinical concern in patients receiving enteral tube feeding. Aspiration can result in pneumonia leading to increases in the use of antibiotics, length of hospital stay, and the risk of mortality. Pneumonia caused by aspiration of gastric contents is of particular concern in patients who require mechanical ventilation and feeding by nasogastric tube. This article summarizes factors that might influence the development of aspiration pneumonia and minimize risk, such as the position of the patient's body, method of feeding, and size of the feeding tube.

### Risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia: from epidemiology to patient management [^116V1mtx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Risk factors for the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as identified in epidemiological studies, have provided a basis for testable interventions in randomized trials. We describe how these results have influenced patient treatment. Single interventions in patients undergoing intubation have focused on either reducing aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, modulation of colonization (in either the oropharynx, the stomach, or the whole digestive tract), use of systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis, or ventilator circuit changes. More recently, multiple simultaneously implemented interventions have been used. In general, routine measures to decrease oropharyngeal aspiration and antibiotic-containing prevention strategies appear to be the most effective, and the latter were associated with improved rates of patient survival in recent trials. These benefits must be balanced against the widespread fear of emergence of antibiotic resistance. In hospital settings with low baseline levels of antibiotic resistance, however, the benefits to patient outcome may outweigh this fear of resistance. In settings with high levels of antibiotic resistance, combined approaches of non-antibiotic using strategies and education programs might be most beneficial.

### Treatment of aspiration in intensive care unit patients [^1167XRej]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Aspiration is a common event, but the clinical consequences are variable. The primary determinants are the nature of the aspirated material and the host response to it. The purpose of this paper is to present treatment algorithms that should be employed in critically ill patients who experience aspiration.

Methods

Expert review of the available literature was done to provide background information to support the logic of 3 treatment algorithms: (1) treatment of acute aspiration pneumonitis; (2) pulmonary care for acute aspiration; and (3) treatment of aspiration pneumonia.

Results

The discussion of aspirations is separated into 2 clinical scenarios: (1) aspiration pneumonitis (sterile inflammation) versus (2) aspiration pneumonia (an infectious process). Aspiration pneumonitis should be treated by aggressive pulmonary care to enhance lung volume and clear secretions. Intubation should be used selectively. Early corticosteroids and prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated. Treatment of aspiration pneumonia requires diligent surveillance for the clinical signs of pneumonia. Treatment decisions are based on 3 factors: (1) clinical diagnostic certainly (definite versus probable), (2) time of onset [early (< 5 days) versus late (≥ 5 days)], and (3) host factors (high risk versus low risk). There is no ideal antibiotic regimen. Unit-specific resistance patterns and known frequency pathogens should direct broad spectrum empiric therapy. Invasive diagnostic techniques (such as bronchoalveolar lavage) should be used when the diagnosis is not certain. Antibiotic coverage should be narrowed once sputum culture results become available.

Conclusions

Aspiration is common in critically ill patients and should be aggressively treated by these treatment algorithms.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^111oX58p]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) non-VAP — We suggest that patients with suspected HAP (non-VAP) be treated according to the results of microbiologic studies performed on respiratory samples obtained noninvasively, rather than being treated empirically (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Noninvasive methods to obtain respiratory samples include spontaneous expectoration, sputum induction, nasotracheal suctioning in a patient unable to cooperate to produce a sputum sample, and endotracheal aspiration in a patient with HAP who subsequently requires mechanical ventilation. Evidence cited includes one randomized trial in which Sixty-eight patients with HAP were randomly assigned to undergo bronchoscopy with protected specimen brushing vs noninvasive management, where expectorated sputum samples were not obtained so noninvasive management resulted in empiric therapy; there was no difference in clinical cure at 28 days or hospital length of stay, and lower 28-day mortality in the empirically treated group was not statistically significant (10% vs 21.9%; RR, 0.46; 95% CI, .13–1.61), with fewer patients in the invasive group receiving antibiotics than in the noninvasive group (76% vs 100%). Despite limited evidence, the panel agreed that an attempt should be made to obtain respiratory samples for culture and that respiratory specimens should be obtained noninvasively rather than invasively, noting opportunities to de-escalate antibiotic coverage and that routine invasive sampling via bronchoscopy would be associated with increased cost and increased risks to the patient, including rarely life-threatening complications and temporary worsening of gas exchange that could result in the need for respiratory support.

### AMS in the ICU: empiric therapy and adherence to guidelines for pneumonia [^1154Bvva]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) aims to preserve the efficacy of antimicrobials by selecting the right drug, dose and duration for the appropriate indication, resulting in maximum benefit and minimising adverse events and development of antimicrobial resistance. While AMS interventions may appear to be at odds with practice in the intensive care unit (ICU), they can improve quality of care without compromising patient outcomes. This study assessed if empiric antimicrobial therapy aligned with guideline recommendations for critically ill patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration pneumonia.

### Aspiration pneumonia in older adults [^1169m5ie]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Aspiration pneumonia refers to an infection of the lung parenchyma in an individual that has inhaled a bolus of endogenous flora that overwhelms the natural defenses of the respiratory system. While there are not universally agreed upon criteria, the diagnosis can be made in patients with the appropriate risk factors and clinical scenario, in addition to a radiographic or an ultrasonographic image of pneumonia in the typical dependent lung segment. Treatment options for aspiration pneumonia vary based on the site of acquisition (community-acquired aspiration pneumonia [CAAP] versus healthcare-associated aspiration pneumonia [HCAAP]), the risk for multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, and severity of illness. Hospitalized CAAP patients without severe illness and with no risk for MDR organisms or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) can be treated with standard inpatient community-acquired pneumonia therapy covering anaerobes. Patients with CAAP and either of the following-risk factors for MDR pathogens, septic shock, need for an intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or mechanical ventilation-can be considered for broader coverage against anaerobes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and PA. Severe aspiration pneumonia that originates in a long-term care facility or HCAAP with one or more risk factors for MDR organisms should be considered for similar treatment. HCAAP with one or more risk factors for MDR organisms or PA, plus septic shock, need for ICU admission or mechanical ventilation should receive double coverage for PA in addition to coverage for MRSA and anaerobes. Multiple gaps in current understanding and management of aspiration pneumonia require future research, with a particular focus on antibiotic stewardship.

### Patient information: community-acquired pneumonia… [^1173MLCC]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Risk factors for CAP include older age, cigarette smoking, chronic lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other chronic conditions, such as HIV, cancer, diabetes, and heavy alcohol use. CAP can be caused by a variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, although the pathogen is often not identified. Among hospitalized patients with CAP, the most common causes are viruses and the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. Symptoms of CAP may include fever, chills, cough with or without sputum, shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion, and fatigue. Patients are diagnosed with CAP if they have signs and symptoms of CAP and chest imaging findings consistent with pneumonia. All patients with suspected CAP should have chest imaging.

Chest x-ray is often the initial type of imaging, and if it does not reveal CAP, chest computed tomography should be considered. All patients with CAP should be tested for influenza and COVID-19 if these viruses are circulating in the community. Additional testing of sputum and blood cultures should be performed only in patients with severe CAP or those with risk factors for resistant bacteria. For outpatients, suspected bacterial CAP is typically treated with a 3-day course of oral antibiotics or combination oral antibiotics for those with multiple medical conditions. Hospitalized patients with suspected bacterial CAP should receive intravenous antibiotics for at least 3 days. Hospitalized patients with severe CAP should also receive steroids. Patients with severe CAP should be closely monitored and treated in an intensive care unit. Those who develop respiratory failure may need mechanical ventilation.

Medications to increase blood pressure should be used for patients with CAP who develop shock. People with a prior episode of CAP are at increased risk of CAP and should be advised about smoking and alcohol cessation and relevant vaccinations. Vaccination for pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus can help prevent or decrease the severity of CAP, especially in older adults or those with chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, asthma, COPD, HIV, or cancer.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^111PC2Cb]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

A physician's intention to treat aspiration pneumonia with antibiotic therapy was based on initiation of a first-line antibiotic parenterally within 2 days of admission according to the 2019 ATS and IDSA guidelines. The first-line antibiotic for CAP could be ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, amoxicillin-clavulanate (equivalent to ampicillin-sulbactam, which was not available in Canada), levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin.

Patients were excluded if they fulfilled any of following criteria:
1 The patient died before receiving antibiotic treatment because they would not have been included in the analogous trial.
2 The patient had a diagnosis of lung abscess or empyema based on ICD-10-CA diagnosis codes J85.x and J86.x, which would require extended anaerobic coverage.
3 The patient received only oral antibiotics, because this would introduce confounding by indication. Patients given only oral antibiotics would be more likely to receive extended anaerobic coverage, because all first-line CAP antibiotics with extended anaerobic coverage (amoxicillin-clavulanate and moxifloxacin) can be given orally, whereas some antibiotics with limited anaerobic coverage (ceftriaxone and cefotaxime) can be given only parenterally. Oral route of administration also was associated with outcome because less severely ill patients would be more likely to be treated with oral antibiotics initially. In clinical practice, patients with aspiration pneumonia usually are initiated on parenteral antibiotics because they typically have swallowing difficulties or are kept nil per os during the acute event.

This study included only community-acquired aspiration pneumonia based on diagnosis and treatment within the first 2 days of admission. Hospital-acquired aspiration pneumonia was not included in this study because it is a different clinical entity in terms of microbiology, empiric antibiotic therapy, and prognosis.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^111Ewmrk]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is a frequent cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and is the most common infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions. It takes 48–72h for most patients to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Non-response is typically defined as the persistence/worsening of clinical signs — such as fever, respiratory distress, impaired oxygenation and/or radiographic abnormalities — with rates ranging 20–30%. Several factors can contribute to non-response. Host factors, including immunosuppression, chronic lung disease, or ongoing aspiration, may impair resolution. Additionally, incorrect antibiotic dosing, atypical or resistant pathogens (such as multidrug-resistant bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or fungal infections) may be responsible, requiring alternative antimicrobial strategies. A septic complication related to pneumonia (e.g. empyema) or not (e.g. acalculous cholecystitis) may need to be excluded. Finally, non-infectious conditions (e.g. pulmonary embolism, malignancy, secondary ARDS or vasculitis) that can mimic or potentiate pneumonia must be considered. Although non-responding pneumonia is frequent, its management lacks strong evidence, and its approach is based mostly on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. Clinicians should continuously reassess the medical history and physical exam, review microbiological data, and consider imaging such as chest CT. Bronchoscopy or repeat sputum sampling may aid in identifying alternative pathogens or non-infectious causes. The management of a non-responding pneumonia depends on the findings of a structured reassessment. Herein, we provide guidance on how to identify and manage non-responding pneumonia. Ultimately, addressing pneumonia that does not respond to antibiotics is crucial for preventing complications, optimizing antimicrobial stewardship, and improving patient outcomes.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^117QEo5G]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment Strategies

Patients were classified into a limited anaerobic coverage (LAC) group and extended anaerobic coverage (EAC) group based on the initial antibiotic they received within 2 days of admission. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and levofloxacin were defined as having LAC because they cover some oral anaerobes such as Peptostreptococcus species. Amoxicillin-clavulanate, moxifloxacin, metronidazole, and clindamycin were defined as having EAC because they cover most oral and gut anaerobes including the Bacteroides fragilis group. Thus, patients in the LAC group received ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin monotherapy. Patients in the EAC group received amoxicillin-clavulanate, moxifloxacin, or any of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin in combination with an EAC antibiotic such as clindamycin or metronidazole. Using a target trial approach, the index time was the time when the patient received the first dose of antibiotic regimen, which would be analogous to randomization in a trial.

Outcomes

Patients were followed up until hospital discharge. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality that occurred after the index time. A mortality difference of 3% was considered the minimally important difference based on the noninferiority margin of 3% for mortality in published CAP antibiotic trials. Secondary outcomes included incident diagnoses of C difficile colitis after admission, time to being discharged alive, and readmission to the medical or intensive care services of participating hospitals within 30 days of discharge. Exploratory outcome included 30-day attributable mortality, which was defined as death within 30 days after initially being admitted for aspiration, pneumonia, or both. This also would include patients who were discharged and then readmitted to a GEMINI hospital site with aspiration, pneumonia, or both and subsequently died. This would not have captured deaths outside the hospital.

Assignment Procedures

Covariates were prognostic factors before index time, which included the following: demographics, including age, sex, and residence in a long-term care home; hospital admission, including hospital site, admission year, and admission meteorological season; comorbidities, including updated Charlson Comorbidity Index; and illness severity, including ICU admission within 48 h of admission, modified Laboratory-Based Acute Physiology Score (mLAPS) within 24 h of admission based on laboratory parameters (sodium, BUN, creatinine, albumin, hematocrit, WBC count, arterial pH, arterial Pa 2, arterial Pa 2, glucose, and bilirubin). Higher mLAPS signified higher illness severity. In a prior study, mLAPS performed as well as CURB-65 score in predicting mortality for CAP.

### Aetiological agents of adult community-acquired pneumonia in Japan: systematic review and meta-analysis of published data [^115TY1vx]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia, including aspiration pneumonia, remains a significant cause of death despite advances in medical care and antimicrobial agents. Inadequate empiric therapy increases the risk of deathor treatment failureand is one factor that defines the prognosis of pneumonia. In addition, unnecessary administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents in the treatment of pneumonia should be avoided due to cost, adverse effects and antimicrobial selection pressure. Therefore, it is essential to surmise the causative micro-organisms and select an appropriate initial antimicrobial agent based on the background of pneumonia, such as the community, medical care or hospital setting, while conducting a microbiological search by sputum, blood culture and serological tests as necessary.

In addition, with medical advances and more patients receiving intensive medical care or antimicrobial agents, pneumonia should be treated with an awareness of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Drug resistance, such as with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), cannot be ignored, not only in the hospital setting but also in the community. Even though broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents are widely used and the proportion of cases due to AMR is small, measures are still needed to recommend the prescribing of antimicrobial agents according to the AMR rate in the community, in order to further improve antimicrobial stewardship alongside global efforts against AMR. To this end, appropriate epidemiological data are required for each country or region, and more reliable and large-scale data are needed.

We conducted this systematic review of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Japan to clarify the epidemiology of pathogenic micro-organisms and the frequency of drug resistance in CAP in Japan. In addition, because it is presumed that the epidemiology of CAP in a given area differs depending on the background and testing methods, we organised the data and performed a meta-analysis to clarify the epidemiology of pathogenic micro-organisms.

### Aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis: a spectrum of infectious / noninfectious diseases affecting the lung [^117QrQ9u]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Our purpose is to describe aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis as a spectrum of infectious/noninfectious diseases affecting the lung. We summarize diagnosis, risk factors, treatment, and strategies for prevention of aspiration.

Recent Findings

Aspiration is present in normal individuals, and disease manifestation depends on the chemical characteristics, frequency, and volume of inoculum. Anaerobes, though present, are no longer the predominant microbes isolated in aspiration pneumonia. Targets for preventing aspiration including improved oral hygiene and positional feeding have had mixed results. Patients diagnosed by clinicians with aspiration pneumonia experience greater morbidity and mortality than patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

Summary

Aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis are part of the pneumonia continuum and share similarities in pathophysiology, microbiology, and treatment. Modern microbiology demonstrates that the lung is not sterile, and isolates in aspiration pneumonia frequently include aerobes or mixed cultures. Treatment for aspiration pneumonia should include antibiotic coverage for oral anaerobes, aerobes associated with community-acquired pneumonia, and resistant organisms depending on appropriate clinical context. Additional studies targeting prevention of aspiration and investigating the increased morbidity and mortality associated with aspiration pneumonia are warranted.

### Comparison of ceftriaxone plus macrolide and ampicillin / sulbactam plus macrolide in treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for aspiration: an open-label, quasi-randomized, controlled trial [^115ZgjwB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Criteria for evaluation

The primary outcome was the clinical response at EOT in the validated per-protocol (VPP) population. The secondary outcomes were clinical response during treatment (at days 4 and 7) and at EOS in the VPP population, and the mortality rate at 30 days of admission in the modified intention-to-treat (MITT) population. The VPP population was defined as patients who received treatment with the study drug for ≥ 4 days in cases of clinical cure, or ≥ 3 days in cases of clinical failure without a protocol violation or missing data. The following patients were excluded: those lacking information or clinical data; those treated with other antibiotics in addition to the study drug; and those treated with systemic corticosteroids affecting the judgment of the effectiveness of treatment in the VPP population. All patients treated with one or more doses of the study drug were included in the MITT population.

The effectiveness of treatment was assessed by blinded investigators. The assessment was based on clinical signs and symptoms, WBC count, serum CRP, and chest radiography. Serum CRP and chest radiography were not used for the assessment on day 4, because the findings might appear to be worse than those on day 1 despite an improvement in patient condition. The clinical response was classified into three categories: improving, indeterminate, or worsening. The test drugs were discontinued and changed to other antibiotics when the clinical response was judged to fall in the latter two categories. "Effective" on days 4, 7 and EOT was defined as a case in which the clinical response was judged as improving at the respective time point. Late response at EOS was classified into three categories: cure, relapse, and failure. Patients with resolution of signs and symptoms of pneumonia were classified as "cure", whereas those with recurrent fever related to pneumonia after day 7, after being primarily judged as improving by EOT, were classified as "relapse", and those without improvement of signs and symptoms of pneumonia or with need for alteration of antibiotics were classified as "failure".
