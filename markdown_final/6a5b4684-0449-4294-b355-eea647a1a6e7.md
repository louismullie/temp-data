## Question

What do you watch out for with aortic stensos

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to watch out for in aortic stenosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define severity and stage the disease accurately. Then, I should verify symptom status and the pitfalls of under-recognition. Next, I will review high-risk features that push toward earlier intervention. After that, I need to check guideline-based triggers for intervention versus watchful waiting. Then, I will examine the evidence base for early intervention in asymptomatic patients. I should also consider special populations like moderate AS, low-gradient phenotypes, and the elderly. Finally, I will integrate surveillance, biomarkers, and shared decision-making into a practical clinical framework.

> Let me first confirm the disease framework and staging, because misclassification here derails downstream decisions. Severe AS is typically defined by peak aortic jet velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s, mean gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg, or valve area ≤ 1.0 cm², with very severe disease around Vmax ≥ 5.0 m/s or mean gradient ≥ 60 mm Hg, and I should double-check that these thresholds align with contemporary guidelines before proceeding [^113gb2Fd] [^116BzRKN]. Hold on, I should verify progression dynamics too: once severe, symptom onset is common within 2–5 years, and the rate of progression averages about +0.3 m/s/year in velocity and −0.1 cm²/year in valve area, which helps me anticipate timing and counseling needs [^117Tk4TF] [^11654iQc].

> Next, I should review symptom assessment carefully, because patients often adapt and under-report. Classic symptoms — exertional dyspnea, angina, syncope or presyncope — mandate valve replacement in severe AS, and I need to ensure I am not missing subtle exertional intolerance in sedentary or elderly patients who curtail activity to avoid symptoms [^116d1zTg] [^112ibFtQ]. Wait, let me verify objective testing: a supervised exercise test can unmask symptoms, abnormal hemodynamics, or a drop in blood pressure during exercise, which strengthens the case for intervention even when resting history is equivocal [^116qYwCH] [^1156zo6f].

> I will now examine high-risk features in asymptomatic severe AS that warrant earlier intervention, but I should confirm each against guidelines. Very severe hemodynamics (Vmax ≥ 5.0 m/s or mean gradient ≥ 60 mm Hg) carry a markedly higher risk of events and symptom onset, supporting consideration of early surgery in appropriately selected low-risk patients [^116BzRKN]. Rapid progression of jet velocity by ≥ 0.3 m/s/year, severe valve calcification, and biomarker elevation such as BNP greater than three times normal are red flags that tilt toward earlier AVR rather than prolonged watchful waiting [^111gFBMb] [^114nfiri]. But wait, what if LV function is preserved? Even then, serial declines in LVEF to less than 60% on repeated studies or pulmonary hypertension without other explanation are concerning and may justify earlier intervention in expert hands [^115mvvQ8] [^115HkRDs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to align with guideline triggers for intervention versus surveillance. In symptomatic severe high-gradient AS, AVR is indicated; in asymptomatic patients, AVR is indicated if LVEF is less than 50%, if there is concomitant cardiac surgery, or if exercise testing reveals symptoms, hypotension, or reduced capacity [^116d1zTg] [^1151D4JR]. For asymptomatic patients without these triggers, watchful waiting with close surveillance is reasonable, but I should confirm that surveillance intervals are appropriate: every 6–12 months for severe AS, 1–2 years for moderate, and 3–5 years for mild, with earlier reassessment if symptoms or new findings emerge [^111QetAu] [^111fVvEs].

> Next, I should review the evolving evidence for early intervention in truly asymptomatic severe AS, and I need to be careful about bias. Randomized and meta-analytic data suggest that early AVR reduces all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalization compared with watchful waiting, with AVATAR showing a composite endpoint reduction and extended follow-up confirming fewer deaths and HF admissions with early surgery [^111ZygFu] [^117EbgHX]. Hmm, wait a minute, most data are observational or from small RCTs, so I should acknowledge heterogeneity and potential confounding while noting the consistency of direction favoring early intervention across multiple analyses [^117EbgHX] [^115np7Vg].

> I should double-check the role of biomarkers and myocardial injury, because they may refine risk in the gray zone. Elevated natriuretic peptides correlate with severity and outcomes, and high-sensitivity troponin may signal subclinical myocardial injury; integrating these with imaging could identify patients in whom watchful waiting risks irreversible cardiac damage [^114nfiri] [^114k2WAv]. Let me consider advanced imaging: CMR evidence of noninfarct late gadolinium enhancement reflects replacement fibrosis and portends worse outcomes even after AVR, and trials like EVOLVED are testing whether LGE-guided early intervention improves events, which could reshape timing decisions if validated [^1151sM9j].

> But wait, what if the patient has moderate AS rather than severe; I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize. Historically managed with surveillance, moderate AS is increasingly recognized as non-benign, with roughly twofold higher mortality and worse outcomes when systolic dysfunction coexists; ongoing trials like PROGRESS and TAVR UNLOAD are evaluating whether earlier TAVR benefits this group, so I should monitor closely and individualize decisions pending stronger evidence [^112HFeBA] [^112eooXk]. I should confirm surveillance cadence: yearly echocardiography is reasonable in moderate AS given the potential for progression and under-recognized symptom onset in older adults [^115mzAND].

> I will now examine low-gradient severe AS phenotypes, because misclassification is common and management differs. In low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with reduced LVEF, dobutamine stress echocardiography helps distinguish true severe from pseudosevere and assess contractile reserve, guiding the need for AVR; in normal-flow, low-gradient severe AS with preserved LVEF, I should confirm small indexed valve area and stroke volume index and consider multimodality corroboration before labeling as severe [^113gb2Fd] [^114eNfjw]. Hold on, I should verify hemodynamic conditions: measurements ideally occur when the patient is normotensive, since hypertension can mask severity; if discordant data were obtained under high BP, I should repeat after optimization to avoid missing true severe AS [^116TBffK] [^111xZgM5].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with the elderly. In adults over 65, TAVR has become the dominant modality in many systems due to lower invasiveness and comparable or favorable outcomes in higher-risk cohorts; however, I need to balance durability concerns in younger patients and the possibility that symptoms are under-reported in frail, sedentary elders, prompting lower thresholds for objective testing and earlier intervention when high-risk features are present [^1165LE4E] [^114KXrhK] [^112ibFtQ]. Let me reconsider shared decision-making here, because life expectancy, frailty, and patient preferences strongly influence the net benefit of early intervention versus watchful waiting in this group [^114rnc3g].

> I need to ensure the surveillance plan is explicit and safe, because delays in recognizing progression can be catastrophic. For severe asymptomatic AS, echocardiography every 6–12 months is appropriate, with shorter intervals if rapid progression is suspected; patient education to report new dyspnea, chest discomfort, dizziness, or reduced exertional tolerance is essential, and facilitated communication pathways can shorten time to intervention when indicated [^111QetAu] [^115FiGKC]. Hold on, I should verify that patients understand red flags and have a low threshold for contact, given the risk of acute decompensation during watchful waiting in some cohorts [^112pYsU1].

> Let me integrate this into a practical decision framework, but I should confirm alignment with guidelines at each step. First, stage severity accurately with standardized echocardiography and exclude confounders like high flow states; second, interrogate symptoms rigorously and use exercise testing when needed; third, screen for high-risk features that favor earlier intervention; fourth, apply guideline triggers to classify patients into intervention versus surveillance; fifth, tailor modality selection via Heart Valve Team discussion considering anatomy, surgical risk, age, and lifetime valve strategy; finally, embed shared decision-making that weighs near-term procedural risks against the potential for irreversible myocardial injury with delayed therapy [^1157FfNL] [^115g18HB] [^114rnc3g]. I should double-check that this approach remains dynamic as new RCTs like EASY-AS mature and as biomarker and imaging tools are validated, which may further lower intervention thresholds in selected asymptomatic patients [^1169LwGS] [^1151sM9j].

> In summary, I need to watch for four critical signals: the severity and progression of valve obstruction, the presence or emergence of symptoms or exercise intolerance, evidence of ventricular decompensation or myocardial injury, and patient-specific factors such as age, frailty, and lifetime valve considerations; balancing these elements within guideline-directed care and evolving evidence allows me to intervene before irreversible cardiac damage while avoiding unnecessary early procedures, and I should remain vigilant for shifts in the evidence base that could recalibrate timing in the near future [^117Tk4TF] [^111ZygFu] [^117EbgHX] [^114rnc3g].

In aortic stenosis, **watch for symptom onset** (exertional dyspnea, angina, syncope/presyncope) [^116d1zTg] and **rapid progression** (≥ 0.3 m/s/year increase in peak velocity) [^111gFBMb] as key triggers for intervention. Monitor for **LV dysfunction** (LVEF < 50% or decline to < 60% on serial imaging) [^115mvvQ8] [^116d1zTg], **very severe stenosis** (peak velocity ≥ 5.0 m/s or mean gradient ≥ 60 mmHg) [^116BzRKN], and **high-risk biomarkers** (BNP > 3× normal or hs-troponin elevation) [^114nfiri] [^114k2WAv]. Also watch for low-gradient severe AS [^113gb2Fd], exercise-induced hypotension [^1156zo6f], and arrhythmias (AF, conduction disease) [^111QetAu]. Use serial echocardiography [^111fVvEs], exercise testing [^116qYwCH], and biomarkers to guide timing; refer to a Heart Valve Team [^115g18HB] when intervention is considered [^113hUsRf].

---

## Clinical symptoms and functional status

- **Exertional dyspnea and heart failure**: Early signs of LV decompensation; prompt intervention reduces heart failure hospitalizations [^111QetAu] [^117EbgHX].

- **Angina**: Indicates myocardial ischemia from increased afterload and reduced coronary perfusion [^notfound].

- **Syncope or presyncope**: Reflects reduced cerebral perfusion from fixed outflow obstruction; high risk of sudden death [^notfound].

- **Exercise intolerance**: Subtle symptom in sedentary patients; exercise testing can unmask symptoms and guide timing [^116qYwCH].

---

## Hemodynamic progression

- **Rapid progression**: Peak velocity increase ≥ 0.3 m/s/year predicts early symptom onset and adverse events [^111gFBMb].

- **Very severe stenosis**: Peak velocity ≥ 5.0 m/s or mean gradient ≥ 60 mmHg; high risk of events even if asymptomatic [^116BzRKN].

- **Low-gradient severe AS**: Low-flow states or preserved EF paradoxical LFLG AS require careful evaluation and often early intervention [^113gb2Fd].

---

## Left ventricular function and remodeling

- **LV systolic dysfunction**: LVEF < 50% or decline to < 60% on serial imaging mandates intervention [^115mvvQ8] [^116d1zTg].

- **LV hypertrophy and fibrosis**: Concentric hypertrophy and fibrosis indicate advanced disease and worse outcomes [^1151sM9j].

- **Diastolic dysfunction**: Early sign of LV impairment; monitor with echocardiography and biomarkers [^115bz6s6] [^114hgCGL] [^114nfiri].

---

## Biomarkers

Biomarkers to monitor include **BNP/NT-proBNP** — levels > 3× normal indicate high risk and support early intervention [^114nfiri] — and **high-sensitivity troponin**, which signals myocardial injury and correlates with adverse outcomes [^114k2WAv].

---

## Exercise testing

Exercise testing can reveal **exercise-induced hypotension** — a BP drop > 20 mmHg during testing is a high-risk feature favoring early intervention [^1156zo6f] — and **reduced exercise capacity**, which unmasks symptoms and supports intervention timing [^114nfiri].

---

## Arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities

Arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities include **atrial fibrillation**, which is common and worsens hemodynamics; manage aggressively and consider early intervention, and **conduction disease**, with AV block or bundle branch block signaling advanced disease and the need for close monitoring.

---

## Imaging modalities and surveillance

Imaging surveillance should include **serial echocardiography** — every 6–12 months for severe AS, annually for moderate AS, and every 3–5 years for mild AS [^111QetAu] — and **cardiac MRI**, which detects myocardial fibrosis and guides timing of intervention [^1151sM9j].

---

## Patient-specific factors

Patient-specific factors include **age and comorbidities**, which influence risk–benefit and modality choice; use shared decision-making [^114rnc3g], and **patient preferences**, which should be incorporated through shared decision-making given evolving evidence [^1165LE4E].

---

## Multidisciplinary heart valve team

Multidisciplinary heart valve team involvement is essential for **complex cases** — coordinating care for severe AS with comcomitant disease — and for **individualized care**, tailoring decisions to anatomy, risk, and preferences [^115g18HB] [^113hUsRf].

---

Watch for **symptom onset**, **rapid progression**, **LV dysfunction**, **very severe stenosis**, and **high-risk biomarkers**; use serial echocardiography, exercise testing, and biomarkers to guide timing, and involve a Heart Valve Team for individualized decisions [^116d1zTg] [^114nfiri] [^115g18HB].

Introduction

Aortic stenosis is the valvular heart lesion with the highest clinical impact and mortality worldwide, accounting for half of valve-related deaths. For patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, European and American guidelines indicate that aortic valve replacement is advised as a class IB and class IA recommendation, respectively. However, more ambiguity exists in the management of patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis, where intervention is not recommended unless signs of adverse prognosis are present. These indicators include rapid progression of the valve stenosis, severe valve calcification, valve parameters reflecting the 'very severe' end of the spectrum of the disease, or signs of left ventricular impairment by echocardiographic data or blood biomarkers, although strong evidence for these is lacking.

However, many would argue that by the time the left ventricular myocardium shows direct or indirect signs of impairment, it is already too late, with irreversible damage establishedand the 'therapeutic window' for intervention missed. Additionally, studies have shown that most patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis exhibit symptoms in the first 2 years following the diagnosis. Many deaths however occur in the period of 'watchful waiting'. These observations have caused much controversy among clinicians and highlight the need for improved risk stratification models and better individualised management strategies according to each patient's risk.

The optimal timing of aortic valve intervention in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis is yet to be ascertained. Undoubtedly, after the results of the Aortic Valve ReplAcemenT versus Conservative Treatment in Asymptomatic SeveRe Aortic Stenosis (AVATAR) trial, many would argue whether the time for a change in clinical practice is fast-approaching. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised and observational studies comparing early intervention versus conservative management of patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis to synthesise and evaluate the current evidence.

### Asymptomatic aortic stenosis: from risk stratification to treatment [^111zi8fv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our understanding of the natural history of aortic stenosis has significantly increased over the last decade. There have been considerable advances in the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with aortic stenosis and in surgical and anesthetic techniques. In addition, transcatheter aortic valve replacement has established itself as a viable alternative to surgical management. Inevitably, these developments have raised questions regarding the merits of waiting for symptom onset in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis before offering treatment. Recent observational and randomized trial data suggest that early intervention in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis and normal left ventricular function may confer a prognostic advantage to a watchful waiting strategy. In this review, we highlight advances in the management and risk stratification of patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis with particular consideration of recent findings supporting early valvular intervention.

Clinical Perspective

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the one of the most common forms of valvular heart disease, affecting > 3% of adults in developed countries. Between one‐third and one‐half of patients with severe AS are asymptomatic at diagnosis. Previous perspective only supports the relationship between AS symptom onset and sharply decreased survival in untreated disease. However, more recent data have emerged to demonstrate that asymptomatic severe AS may lead to the progression to both symptoms and adverse outcomes if left untreated.

According to the 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline for managing valvular heart disease, aortic valve intervention is generally recommended for patients with severe AS presenting with symptoms or signs of ventricular decompensation. For asymptomatic AS, guidelines based on expert opinion and nonrandomized data recommend watchful waiting, with aortic valve intervention deferred until symptom onset or a left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%. Nevertheless, the appropriate timing of intervention for these patients remains controversial, and any decision requires careful assessment.

Several meta‐analyses have demonstrated the benefits of early intervention in patients with asymptomatic severe AS. However, the majority of included studies were observational or enrolled small numbers of relatively young and low‐risk patients. The primary aim of this study is to comprehensively review the available evidence from prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the optimal management strategy for patients with asymptomatic severe AS.

### Aortic stenosis: diagnosis and treatment [^111QetAu]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis affects 3% of persons older than 65 years. Although survival in asymptomatic patients is comparable to that in age- and sex-matched control patients, it decreases rapidly after symptoms appear. During the asymptomatic latent period, left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial augmentation of preload compensate for the increase in afterload caused by aortic stenosis. As the disease worsens, these compensatory mechanisms become inadequate, leading to symptoms of heart failure, angina, or syncope. Aortic valve replacement is recommended for most symptomatic patients with evidence of significant aortic stenosis on echocardiography. Watchful waiting is recommended for most asymptomatic patients. However, select patients may also benefit from aortic valve replacement before the onset of symptoms. Surgical valve replacement is the standard of care for patients at low to moderate surgical risk. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement may be considered in patients at high or prohibitive surgical risk. Patients should be educated about the importance of promptly reporting symptoms to their physicians. In asymptomatic patients, serial Doppler echocardiography is recommended every six to 12 months for severe aortic stenosis, every one to two years for moderate disease, and every three to five years for mild disease. Cardiology referral is recommended for all patients with symptomatic moderate and severe aortic stenosis, those with severe aortic stenosis without apparent symptoms, and those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Medical management of concurrent hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease will lead to optimal outcomes.

### Aortic stenosis: diagnosis and treatment [^111ni6kv]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is the most important cardiac valve disease in developed countries, affecting 3 percent of persons older than 65 years. Although the survival rate in asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis is comparable to that in age- and sex-matched control patients, the average overall survival rate in symptomatic persons without aortic valve replacement is two to three years. During the asymptomatic latent period, left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial augmentation of preload compensate for the increase in afterload caused by aortic stenosis. As the disease worsens, these compensatory mechanisms become inadequate, leading to symptoms of heart failure, angina, or syncope. Aortic valve replacement should be recommended in most patients with any of these symptoms accompanied by evidence of significant aortic stenosis on echocardiography. Watchful waiting is recommended for most asymptomatic patients, including those with hemodynamically significant aortic stenosis. Patients should be educated about symptoms and the importance of promptly reporting them to their physicians. Serial Doppler echocardiography is recommended annually for severe aortic stenosis, every one or two years for moderate disease, and every three to five years for mild disease. Cardiology referral is recommended for all patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis, those with severe aortic stenosis without apparent symptoms, and those with left ventricular dysfunction. Many patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis have concurrent cardiac conditions, such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease, which should also be carefully managed.

### Management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115wPSNr]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

The timing of intervention in patients with severe aortic stenosis remains contentious. The lack of large randomised controlled studies has been a 'deafening silence' in cardiology, with current practice often informed by observational studies, which despite their limitations timidly show a favour towards early intervention. Nonetheless, this needs to be balanced by the potentially longer need for a valve replacement, which in itself can come with risks of bleeding, endocarditis and failure. Several unanswered questions have long been discussed among clinicians. Current guidelines suggest intervention in patients with severe aortic stenosis when symptoms occur or in those without symptoms and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% or abnormal exercise test or Vmax > 5 m/s or brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) more than three times the upper normal value or features of rapid disease progression. However, it can be challenging to unmask these on many occasions, especially in patients with sedentary life or in the frail elderly population. Additionally, the presence of left ventricular impairment represents a high-risk feature that mandates intervention in these patients. Still, some argue that it may already be too late when the LVEF drops. So far, there has been an ongoing debate with studies demonstrating a low risk of death in patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis unless there is very severe aortic stenosis or signs of rapid progression or myocardial impairment. Nevertheless, a retrospective observational study by Campo et al demonstrated that almost half of the asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis would have either died or undergone surgery within 2 years of the initial recommendation for the watchful waiting strategy. This is in keeping with another retrospective registry by Pellikka et al, stating that 75% of these patients will have died or have been operated on 5 years after the diagnosis. However, evidence suggests that, although this risk is low, it is still higher than the general population and this clinical entity may not be as benign as previously thought.

### Early surgery versus conservative management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a meta-analysis [^115np7Vg]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although current guidelines generally recommend watchful waiting strategy for patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis until symptoms develop, early surgery for asymptomatic aortic stenosis remains controversial. This study aimed to compare the outcomes of early surgery versus conservative strategy for patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis.

Methods

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched through February 2020 to identify clinical trials that investigated early surgery and conservative strategy for patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis. From each study, we extracted the hazard ratio of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Subgroup analyses were conducted by dividing into severe aortic stenosis (peak aortic jet velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s, mean aortic pressure gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg, or aortic valve area ≤ 1.0 cm²) and very severe aortic stenosis (peak aortic jet velocity ≥ 4.5 m/s, mean pressure gradient ≥ 50 mm Hg, or aortic valve area ≤ 0.75 cm²) groups.

Results

One randomized controlled trial and 7 observational studies were identified. Pooled analyses demonstrated that all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality for early surgery were significantly lower compared with conservative strategy (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.36–0.68; P < .0001, hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.22–0.82; p = 0.01, respectively). Subgroup analyses showed significant reduction for early surgery in all-cause mortality (severe aortic stenosis: hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.35–0.78; p = 0.001, very severe aortic stenosis: hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.17–0.85; p = 0.02).

Conclusions

We demonstrated that early surgery was associated with significant reduction in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Further randomized trials are warranted to confirm our findings.

### Moderate aortic stenosis: culprit or bystander? [^115mzAND]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Contemporary management

The 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease and the 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease both recommend consideration for valvular replacement for moderate AS in patients who are already undergoing open heart surgery (class IIa, level of evidence C for both guidelines). The major rationale for this recommendation is the elevated perioperative risk and potential for damage to bypass grafts (if present) during repeat sternotomy should the moderate AS progress and require operative intervention in the future. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend screening patients with moderate AS with echocardiography every 1–2 years to assess for progression versus the ESC/EACTS guidelines which recommend yearly screening. Currently, guidelines do not recommend stratification of individuals at risk of rapid progression.

### Watchful waiting in aortic stenosis: the problem of acute decompensation [^112pYsU1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute decompensation with heart failure, angina, or syncope may be the first indication of undiagnosed aortic stenosis, but should be uncommon when the disorder is known and managed by watchful waiting. There is a lack of information on the proportion of patients with acute decompensated aortic stenosis with and without a prior diagnosis and their outcomes.

Methods

We examined the records of patients with aortic stenosis (International Classification of Diseases code 135.0) admitted to 3 UK hospitals between January 2015 and January 2016. We determined the number of admissions with acute decompensation and the proportion in whom aortic stenosis was and was not previously known. The characteristics and outcomes in the 2 groups were compared.

Results

Of 684 patients with aortic stenosis, 543 (79%; 95% confidence interval, 76–82) were elective admissions and 141 (21%; 95% CI, 18–24) were emergencies with acute decompensation; 86 of 141 patients (61%; 95% CI, 52–69) with known aortic stenosis were under watchful waiting and 55 of 141 patients (39%; 95% CI, 31–48) did not have a prior diagnosis. In-hospital mortality was 16% versus 13%, respectively (P = 0.48). There were no statistically significant differences in characteristics or clinical presentation between the 2 groups (P > .1 for all comparisons).

Conclusions

Approximately 1 in 5 patients admitted to the hospital with aortic stenosis have life-threatening complications due to their disorder. More than half of such patients are actively monitored for aortic stenosis before admission, exposing shortcomings of the watchful waiting management strategy. Measures to identify symptomatic patients earlier and shorten the time between symptom onset and surgery have the potential to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: challenges in diagnosis and management [^117LSP2y]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Optimal management for asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) remains controversial. Considering the increase in elderly patients, improved surgical outcomes and the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve implantation, we must reconsider the optimal management of asymptomatic severe AS. In this article, previous studies regarding the natural history of asymptomatic severe AS were reviewed to obtain a clinical perspective of AS in the growing elderly patient population. The incidence of sudden death in asymptomatic severe AS varies among studies from 0.25% to 1.7% per year, with differences related to study design and patient background. Except for very severe AS, sudden death or AS-related cardiac death without preceding symptoms is uncommon if 'watchful' waiting strategy is possible. Therefore, early operation is reasonable in very severe AS, but it is not recommended for all patients with severe AS. Using exercise tests, plasma levels of natriuretic peptides and other parameters, risk stratification of asymptomatic severe AS is needed to select patients who may have greater benefit following early operation. On the other hand, 'watchful' waiting is not always possible in real world of our practice. Patient education and periodic echocardiography are essential in 'watchful' waiting, which is not simply waiting strategy without careful monitoring. Individualised discussion regarding the indication for early operation is necessary, considering age, clinical background, predicted natural history and operative risk in each patient.

Although most asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis (AS) have an excellent prognosis with observation only, some patients with severely stenotic aortic valves in the absence of symptoms may benefit from early intervention. In this article, we will review the literature on the use of varied imaging modalities, clinical factors, and biomarker testing to risk stratify such patients. Additionally, we will review the role of medical therapy to modify the course in AS.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Integrated benefit–risk and decision-making pathways — guided actions for aortic valve replacement (AVR) selection are organized as: No current indication for AVR lists periodic monitoring of aortic stenosis (AS) severity and symptoms and re-evaluation when AS is severe or symptoms occur. When AVR is indicated but surgical AVR (SAVR) is preferred over TAVR, the document states 'SAVR recommended in lower-risk patients', notes valve durability considerations in younger patients, and that a concurrent surgical procedure may be needed. For a TAVR candidate with expected benefit > risk, actions include discussion with patient and family and proceeding with TAVR imaging evaluation and procedure. For severe symptomatic AS but benefit < risk (futility), thresholds include life expectancy < 1 year and chance of survival with benefit at 2 years < 25%, with actions including discussion with patient and family, palliative care inputs, and palliative balloon aortic valvuloplasty in selected patients.

### Quality-of-life implications of immediate surgery and watchful waiting in asymptomatic aortic stenosis: a decision-analytic model [^112XE4aF]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2011). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND- Traditional management of severe aortic stenosis (AS) is based on delay in aortic valve replacement (AVR) until the development of symptoms. Surgery for asymptomatic AS has been proposed to reduce the small risk of sudden death before AVR and avoid heart failure (HF) after AVR. Because a trial to compare these options is unlikely, we developed a Markov model to inform the choice between immediate surgery and watchful waiting in asymptomatic AS. METHODS AND RESULTS- We defined health states as preoperative, postoperative, postcomplication, and death. We calculated the implications of watchful waiting, tissue and mechanical AVR-based on risks, transitions, utilities, and cost derived from literature review. Further analyses evaluated situations thought to favor immediate surgery and watchful waiting. Sensitivity analyses were based on the likelihood of preoperative death and HF in follow-up. In the reference case (age, 65 years; post-AVR utility, 0.9; annualized pre-AVR mortality, 1%; and post-AVR HF, 11.3%), the utility of watchful waiting was superior to that of immediate mechanical or tissue AVR (quality-adjusted life-years, 7.4 versus 5.3 versus 5.3, respectively), and the cost was less than immediate surgery. Sensitivity analyses showed immediate surgery was not likely to be more effective regardless of the yearly probability of post-AVR HF in the watchful waiting group (range, 0% to 80%). Immediate surgery was likely to be effective when pre-AVR annual mortality reached 13%. CONCLUSIONS- Immediate surgery in asymptomatic severe AS does not improve outcomes unless risk of sudden death pre-AVR and HF after AVR are higher than currently reported.

### Moderate aortic valve stenosis is associated with increased mortality rate and lifetime loss: systematic review and meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event data of 409 680 patients [^112HFeBA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a prevalent valvular heart disease, imposing a substantial burden on global public health. AS frequently coexists with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Three decades ago, it was recognized that the pivotal aspect in managing patients with AS lies in the timely decision to refer for intervention.

Contemporary guidelines currently advocate for aortic valve replacement (AVR) in those with severe symptomatic AS and, by extension, in those who are asymptomatic but experience reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF < 55% by European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery guidelines, class of recommendation IIa; and LVEF < 50% by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, class of recommendation I). The latter is owed to the adverse impact of elevated afterload on the already diseased left ventricle. On the contrary, in those with moderate AS, both guidelines advocate for a "watchful waiting approach" with frequent surveillance echocardiograms (yearly by European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery guidelines, and every 1–2 years by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines) to detect any disease progression. The rationale behind the contrasting recommendations concerning the timing of intervention in AS remains a matter of discussion. Recent large‐scale observational studies found the prognosis of patients with moderate AS may be more unfavorable than previously thought, particularly when concurrent systolic dysfunction is present. Moderate AS has been associated with an ≈2‐fold increased risk of all‐cause death, which increases to ≈3‐fold among those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Consequently, specific factors such as systolic dysfunction or coronary artery disease contribute to adverse outcomes, while the mortality risk solely attributable to isolated moderate AS remains incompletely characterized.

### Rationale and design of the early valve replacement in severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis trial [^1169LwGS]. American Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Aortic valve replacement in asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis is controversial. The Early valve replacement in severe ASYmptomatic Aortic Stenosis (EASY-AS) trial aims to determine whether early aortic valve replacement improves clinical outcomes, quality of life and cost-effectiveness compared to a guideline recommended strategy of 'watchful waiting'.

Methods

In a pragmatic international, open parallel group randomized controlled trial (NCT04204915), 2844 patients with severe aortic stenosis will be randomized 1:1 to either a strategy of early (surgical or transcatheter) aortic valve replacement or aortic valve replacement only if symptoms or impaired left ventricular function develop, or other cardiac surgery becomes nessessary. Exclusion criteria include other severe valvular disease, planned cardiac surgery, ejection fraction < 50%, previous aortic valve replacement or life expectancy < 2 years. The primary outcome is a composite of cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization. The primary analysis will be undertaken when 663 primary events have accrued, providing 90% power to detect a reduction in the primary endpoint from 27.7% to 21.6% (hazard ratio 0.75). Secondary endpoints include disability-free survival, days alive and out of hospital, major adverse cardiovascular events and quality of life.

Results

Recruitment commenced in March 2020 and is open in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Serbia. Feasibility requirements were met in July 2022, and the main phase opened in October 2022, with additional international centers in set-up.

Conclusions

The EASY-AS trial will establish whether a strategy of early aortic valve replacement in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis reduces cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization and improves other important outcomes.

Very severe aortic stenosis (AS) — event risk and early surgery data indicate that with an aortic velocity ≥ 5.0 m/s or mean pressure gradient ≥ 60 mm Hg, the rate of symptom onset is approximately 50% at 2 years; in a large asymptomatic cohort (> 500 patients), an aortic velocity ≥ 5 m/s was associated with a > 6-fold increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 6.31; 95% CI: 2.61–15.9); a randomized trial of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) versus surveillance showed a significant survival benefit to early surgery in patients with aortic velocity ≥ 4.5 m/s, and decisions for very severe asymptomatic AS with low surgical risk weigh AVR versus continued watchful waiting considering age, patient–prosthesis mismatch, anticoagulation issues, and preferences.

### Moderate aortic stenosis: culprit or bystander? [^1132yPc9]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-rheumatic aortic stenosis (AS) is among the most common valvular pathologies affecting older adults in developed countries, with rates expected to increase with the ageing of the population. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is currently advocated for those with severe symptomatic AS based on substantial morbidity and mortality without intervention. By contrast, imaging surveillance is currently recommended for patients with moderate AS.

The decision to recommend non-operative treatment in moderate AS has historically been based on (1) observation of a low overall risk for sudden cardiac death with moderate rather than severe AS and (2) high procedural risk associated with AVR. Advances in surgical and catheter-based approaches to aortic valve intervention have led to improved procedural outcomes, with contemporary procedural mortality for low-risk patients with AS as low as 0.4% after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and 0.9% after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Furthermore, mounting evidence suggests a worse prognosis associated with moderate AS than previously appreciated. These developments bring into question whether the current risk/benefit paradigm has shifted in favour of earlier intervention for AS.

In this review, we summarise the contemporary understanding of moderate AS, including the epidemiology, current surveillance and management guidelines, clinical outcomes, and future areas of investigation.

### Moderate aortic stenosis: culprit or bystander? [^115Bu7aw]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-rheumatic aortic stenosis (AS) is among the most common valvular diseases in the developed world. Current guidelines support aortic valve replacement (AVR) for severe symptomatic AS, which carries high morbidity and mortality when left untreated. In contrast, moderate AS has historically been thought to be a benign diagnosis for which the potential benefits of AVR are outweighed by the procedural risks. However, emerging data demonstrating the substantial mortality risk in untreated moderate AS and substantial improvements in periprocedural and perioperative mortality with AVR have challenged the traditional risk/benefit paradigm. As such, an appraisal of the contemporary data on morbidity and mortality associated with moderate AS and appropriate timing of valvular intervention in AS is warranted. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of moderate AS, including the epidemiology, current surveillance and management guidelines, clinical outcomes, and future studies.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Integrated benefit–risk of TAVR and shared decision-making — the final treatment decision should be individualized using clinical and imaging evaluation, risk category, patient goals and expectations, and futility considerations. If the evaluation indicates that AS is not severe or symptoms are not due to AS, it may be prudent to continue periodic monitoring of AS severity and symptoms, deferring intervention until guideline-based criteria are met. Alternatively, the Heart Valve Team evaluation may conclude that the SAVR is the best option if surgical risk is low, the durability of a mechanical or other tissue valve is preferable in a younger patient, or concurrent procedures such as aortic root replacement or coronary bypass grafting are needed. Even when severe symptomatic AS is present, TAVR is considered futile when the expected benefit from TAVR is less than the expected risk; in these patients, palliative care may be the best option in terms of both quality and length of life. In patients who meet guideline-based criteria for TAVR and whose evaluation indicates the benefit is greater than risk, discussion with the patient and family should again review the likelihood of symptom relief or improved survival, possible complications and the expected recovery process, and alignment of patient goals and expectations with possible procedural outcomes.

### Early surgical intervention versus conservative management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117EbgHX]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Timing of intervention for patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) remains controversial. To compare the outcomes of early aortic valve replacement (AVR) versus watchful waiting (WW) in patients with asymptomatic severe AS.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases, in December 2021, for studies comparing early AVR with WW in the treatment of asymptomatic severe AS. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed.

Results

Twelve studies were included in which two were randomised clinical trials. A total of 4130 patients were included, providing a 1092 pooled death events. Our meta-analysis showed a significantly lower all-cause mortality for the early AVR compared with WW group, although with a high amount of heterogeneity between studies in the magnitude of the effect (pooled OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.45, p < 0.01; I² = 61%). An early surgery strategy displayed a significantly lower cardiovascular mortality (pooled OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.56, p < 0.01; I² = 64%) and heart failure hospitalisation (pooled OR 0.19; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.39, p < 0.01, I² = 7%). However, both groups had similar rates of stroke (pooled OR 1.30; 95% CI 0.73 to 2.29, p = 0.36, I² = 0%) and myocardial infarction (pooled OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.27, p = 0.14, I² = 0%).

Conclusions

This study suggests that for patients with asymptomatic severe AS an early surgical intervention compared with a conservative WW strategy was associated with a lower heart failure hospitalisation and a similar rate of stroke or myocardial infarction, although with significant risk of bias.

### Valvular aortic stenosis: disease severity and timing of intervention [^115D2fKw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Standard echocardiographic evaluation of aortic stenosis (AS) severity includes measurement of aortic velocity, mean transaortic pressure gradient, and continuity equation valve area. Although these measures are adequate for decision making in most patients, there is no single value that defines severe stenosis. Aortic stenosis affects not just the valve, but the entire vascular system, including the left ventricle (LV) and systemic vasculature. More sophisticated measures of disease severity might explain the apparent overlap in hemodynamic severity between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and might better predict the optimal timing of valve replacement. There have been several approaches to evaluation of stenosis severity based on valve hemodynamics, the ventricular response to increased afterload, ventricular-vascular coupling, or the systemic functional consequences of valve obstruction, such as exercise testing and serum brain natriuretic peptide levels. Aortic valve replacement is indicated when symptoms due to severe AS are present. In most asymptomatic patients, the risk of surgery is greater than the risk of watchful waiting so that management includes patient education, periodic echocardiography, and cardiac risk factor modification. Many adults with AS have comorbid conditions that affect both the diagnosis and management of the valve disease, including aortic regurgitation, aortic root dilation, hypertension, coronary artery disease, LV dysfunction, and atrial fibrillation. Comorbid conditions should be evaluated and treated based on established guidelines, although awareness of the potential effects of therapy in the presence of valve obstruction is needed.

### Aortic stenosis [^115Epmo6]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

In developed countries, aortic stenosis is the most prevalent of all valvular heart diseases.

Symptomatic severe disease is universally fatal if left untreated yet is consistent with a typical lifespan when mechanical relief of the stenosis is provided in a timely fashion. Management of mild disease, severe asymptomatic disease, and far advanced disease, and the effect of new percutaneous treatments, provide both controversy and exciting promise to care of patients with aortic stenosis.

### The 'wait for symptoms' strategy in asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis [^112f4sun]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Calcific aortic stenosis is a prevalent and worrisome healthcare problem. The therapeutic approach in asymptomatic aortic stenosis is not well established. We argue that the natural history of this disease is based on old incomplete studies with many limitations. Likewise, studies suggesting that replacement, either surgical or percutaneous, improves prognosis in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis have important drawbacks and do not support this strategy as the treatment of choice. Despite the lack of evidence, some groups recommend early valve replacement in patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis. There are five ongoing randomised trials which will shed light on this topic. Our conclusion is that unless a randomised study changes the evidence, valve replacement cannot be recommended in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis.

### Optimal threshold of left ventricular ejection fraction for aortic valve replacement in asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11526bFB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal threshold of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) that should prompt aortic valve replacement (AVR) in asymptomatic patients with high‐gradient severe aortic stenosis (AS) is controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between LVEF and mortality benefit in comparing early AVR versus watchful waiting in asymptomatic patients with severe AS.

Methods and Results

MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for observational studies and randomized controlled trials on adults with asymptomatic severe AS. Severe AS was defined by a peak aortic velocity ≥ 4 m/s and/or mean aortic valve gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg and/or calculated aortic valve area < 1.0 cm² or an indexed valve area < 0.6 cm². Studies comparing AVR with conservative management were included and meta‐analysis on all‐cause mortality was performed. Ten eligible studies were identified with a total of 3332 patients. In 5 observational studies comparing early AVR versus watchful waiting, our meta‐analysis showed early AVR was associated with lower mortality with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.41 (CI, 0.23–0.71; P < 0.01). In 4 observational studies comparing AVR versus no AVR, our meta‐analysis showed AVR was associated with lower mortality with a HR of 0.31 (CI, 0.17–0.58; P < 0.001). In a meta‐regression analysis pooling all 10 studies, there was no statistically significant correlation between study mean LVEF and the size of mortality benefit of AVR (P = 0.83).

Conclusions

Among asymptomatic patients with high‐gradient severe AS, AVR was associated with a mortality benefit across the spectrum of LVEF. Our study calls into question the need of an LVEF threshold for recommending AVR in this patient population.

### Management of asymptomatic severe Aortic stenosis: evolving concepts in timing of valve replacement [^115vTPHi]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

New insights into the pathophysiology and natural history of patients with aortic stenosis, coupled with advances in diagnostic imaging and the dramatic evolution of transcatheter aortic valve replacement, are fueling intense interest in the management of asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis. An intervention that is less invasive than surgery could conceivably justify pre-emptive transcatheter aortic valve replacement in subsets of patients, rather than waiting for the emergence of early symptoms to trigger valve intervention. Clinical experience has shown that symptoms can be challenging to ascertain in many sedentary, deconditioned, and/or elderly patients. Evolving data based on imaging and biomarker evidence of adverse ventricular remodeling, hypertrophy, inflammation, or fibrosis may radically transform existing clinical decision paradigms. Clinical trials currently enrolling asymptomatic patients have the potential to change practice patterns and lower the threshold for intervention.

### Optimal threshold of left ventricular ejection fraction for aortic valve replacement in asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ZqvJJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review and meta‐analysis, we found that AVR was significantly associated with decreased mortality in asymptomatic patients with high‐gradient severe AS. We further demonstrated that AVR was associated with decreased mortality not only in patients with reduced LVEF but also in patients with preserved or even supranormal LVEF.

Current society guidelines recommend watchful waiting in most patients with asymptomatic severe AS until symptom onset. This recommendation stems from previous literature demonstrating relatively low risks for mortality and sudden cardiac death among this population. 23 However, this reasoning is only part of the equation as patients might suffer other harms while waiting, and procedural outcomes might be worse when patients are older or develop left ventricular dysfunction. As described previously, watchful waiting patients likely have much higher incidence of HF than patients receiving early AVR. In terms of periprocedural outcomes, in the CURRENT‐AS (Contemporary Outcomes After Surgery and Medical Treatment in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis) registry, asymptomatic patients referred to early surgery had significantly lower operative mortality than those who had AVR after developing symptoms (1.2% versus 3.7%, P = 0.03). 15 Therefore, the risk/benefit balance may tip toward benefit in asymptomatic severe AS and explain the findings of our meta‐analysis.

Meta-analysis of observational studies

Additionally, eight observational studies, including 3496 patients, were analysed separately to assess how early intervention affects the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Table 3 summarises the main characteristics of each study, while the risk of bias assessment is demonstrated in online supplemental table 3.

Table 3
Characteristics of observational studies comparing early intervention versus conservative management

Of the total population, 1354 patients had an early aortic valve replacement and 2142 were managed conservatively with the watchful waiting approach. The meta-analysis from these studies showed that early intervention was associated with a 62% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.56), although heterogeneity was high (I² 77%) (figure 3). Online supplemental figure 3 shows the funnel plot for risk of all-cause mortality from these eight studies.

### Impact of aortic valve replacement in symptomatic low-risk patients with less than severe aortic stenosis [^117E4sNK]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The efficacy and safety of aortic valve replacement (AVR) is well established in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), but remains unknown in those with less than severe AS. The current management of patients with less than severe AS has been a conservative approach of 'watchful waiting'. AVR is usually not formally recommended until AS becomes severe, even in symptomatic patients, or when the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% in asymptomatic severe AS patients. In patients with moderate AS, AVR is only recommended when other open-heart surgery is performed. With recent findings of increased mortalityand LV maladaptation when AS severity is only moderate, a subset of patients with less than severe AS may benefit from earlier AVR.

This post hoc study from the Evolut Low Risk trial (NCT02701283) aimed to investigate clinical outcomes, valve haemodynamics and health status out to 2 years following transcatheter or surgical AVR (TAVR or SAVR) in symptomatic patients with less than severe AS.

### Which patients with aortic stenosis should be referred to surgery rather than transcatheter aortic valve implantation? [^1119kKWy]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has matured into a standard treatment option for patients with severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis (AS) across the whole spectrum of risk. The advances in the interventional treatment of AS raise the question of which patients with severe AS should be referred to surgery. The myriad of clinical permutations does not allow providing a single, uniform treatment strategy. Rather, the advent of TAVI along with established surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) fundamentally enforces the role of the multidisciplinary heart team for decision-making recommending the best individual choice of the two options based on a thorough review of clinical and anatomical factors as well as lifetime management considerations. Involvement of the informed patient expressing treatment preferences is a key for a shared decision-making process. Herein, we provide an in-depth review of evidence informing the decision-making process between TAVI and SAVR and key elements for treatment selection. Special attention is given to the populations that have been excluded from randomized clinical trials, and also lifetime management strategies of patients with severe AS are proposed.

Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines were followed for this review. This review was registered at(registration number: reviewregistry1005) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses checklist is provided in Table S1.

Criteria for Considering Studies for This Review

Published observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. We included studies on adults (18 years of age or older) of both sexes with asymptomatic severe AS. Severe AS was defined according to both American and European guidelines (peak aortic velocity ≥ 4 m/s and/or mean aortic valve gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg and/or calculated aortic valve area < 1.0 cm² or an indexed valve area < 0.6 cm²). 4, 6 Asymptomatic status was defined per individual studies' definitions and exercise testing was not required to confirm asymptomatic status. Studies that included patients with asymptomatic very severe AS (typically defined as aortic valve area < 0.75 cm 2 and peak velocity > 4.5 m/s or mean gradient > 50 mm Hg) were included and the difference in effect size between severe and very severe AS was analyzed as described later.

We included studies that compared either surgical or transcatheter AVR with conservative management. We preferentially included studies that compared an early AVR strategy (typically defined as within 3 months of diagnosis) versus a watchful waiting strategy (AVR upon development of symptoms). We also included studies that compared AVR at any time versus no AVR. Given the substantial difference in study design between these 2 types of comparisons, the pooled effect size was separately calculated and represented in the forest plot for our main meta‐analysis.

The primary outcome analyzed all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, sudden cardiac death, and HF. Included studies were required to report the primary outcome but not the secondary outcomes.

### Initial surgical versus conservative strategies in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis [^115U5bkr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines generally recommend watchful waiting until symptoms emerge for aortic valve replacement (AVR) in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS).

Objectives

The study sought to compare the long-term outcomes of initial AVR versus conservative strategies following the diagnosis of asymptomatic severe AS.

Methods

We used data from a large multicenter registry enrolling 3,815 consecutive patients with severe AS (peak aortic jet velocity > 4.0 m/s, or mean aortic pressure gradient > 40 mm Hg, or aortic valve area < 1.0 cm²) between January 2003 and December 2011. Among 1,808 asymptomatic patients, the initial AVR and conservative strategies were chosen in 291 patients, and 1,517 patients, respectively. Median follow-up was 1,361 days with 90% follow-up rate at 2 years. The propensity score-matched cohort of 582 patients (n = 291 in each group) was developed as the main analysis set for the current report.

Results

Baseline characteristics of the propensity score-matched cohort were largely comparable, except for the slightly younger age and the greater AS severity in the initial AVR group. In the conservative group, AVR was performed in 41% of patients during follow-up. The cumulative 5-year incidences of all-cause death and heart failure hospitalization were significantly lower in the initial AVR group than in the conservative group (15.4% vs. 26.4%, p = 0.009; 3.8% vs. 19.9%, p < 0.001, respectively).

Conclusions

The long-term outcome of asymptomatic patients with severe AS was dismal when managed conservatively in this real-world analysis and might be substantially improved by an initial AVR strategy.

### Low gradient aortic stenosis: assessment, treatment, and outcome [^111gKBEN]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is a commonly encountered valvular disorder in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Generally, symptomatic patients who undergo valve replacement experience a vast reduction in symptoms and a great improvement in survival. A subset of symptomatic patients in whom management is less clear are those with a small transvalvular gradient and low cardiac output, or low gradient aortic stenosis. The assessment, treatment, and outcome of this unique group of patients will be reviewed.

Effects of Interventions

The primary meta‐analysis on all‐cause mortality demonstrated consistent benefit with AVR across study type subgroups (Figure 3). 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 The pooled HR for studies that analyzed patients by early AVR versus watchful waiting is 0.41 (CI, 0.23–0.71; P < 0.01). The pooled HR for studies that analyzed patients by AVR versus no AVR is 0.31 (CI, 0.17–0.58; P < 0.001). These are similar to that reported by the single RCT of early AVR versus watchful waiting (HR, 0.33; CI, 0.12–0.90; P = 0.03). 21 There is no statistically significant difference in the effect size among the 3 subgroups (χ² = 0.42; P = 0.81).

There is statistically significant heterogeneity among pooled studies in both the early AVR versus watchful waiting group and the AVR versus no AVR group (χ² = 25.72 and 8.79, P < 0.05 for both). Judging by the τ² and I² statistics, there is substantial heterogeneity in both groups. However, it is important to note that the direction of effects is consistent for all 10 studies in the meta‐analysis and favors AVR.

### Moderate aortic valve stenosis is associated with increased mortality rate and lifetime loss: systematic review and meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event data of 409 680 patients [^116ouwtH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Implications

The increased mortality rates in patients diagnosed with moderate AS have significant clinical implications. The cornerstone of clinical management for moderate AS, as widely advocated by current guidelines, is the "watchful waiting" approach. Our findings raise questions about whether the current risk of not proactively treating moderate AS outweighs the potential benefits of AVR and suggest the possibility of a paradigm shift favoring earlier intervention. Studies have indicated that the presence of symptoms in patients with moderate AS is linked to a noteworthy rise in all‐cause mortality rates. Moreover, the presence of symptoms might hint at the existence of diastolic or subclinical systolic left ventricular dysfunction. Additionally, multiple studies emphasize that patients with elevated NT‐proBNP (N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide) levels, which correlates well with AS severity and symptom onset, experienced higher rates of death and heart failure hospitalizations compared with those with normal levels.

Emerging evidence in the moderate AS population emphasizes the importance of cardiac damage from a prognostic standpoint. Consequently, opting for a "watchful waiting" approach in patients with symptomatic moderate AS might result in additional, potentially preventable, cardiac damage, carrying significant clinical implications. Furthermore, several reports have indicated survival benefits associated with AVR in patients with moderate AS, both with and without concomitant systolic dysfunction or coronary artery disease. Due to the likelihood of selection bias inherent in observational studies, these data should be considered as hypothesis generating rather than definitive evidence. Hence, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the precise nature and magnitude of this relationship is vital as we continue to reassess treatment thresholds for AS.

Another issue to be addressed along with the subject of cardiac damage is the fact that symptoms are believed to become evident only when the AS is severe enough to beget ventricular failure. At this stage, surgical or transcatheter AVR is indicated. However, our present study shows that a less severe form of AS (moderate AS) is also associated with higher mortality rates over time. This creates a clinical puzzle to be solved regarding strategies for ideal management and timing for these individuals. Playford et al showed that dyspnea is common in both moderate and severe AS, but it is not related to the degree of cardiac damage. Therefore, symptom‐guided management decisions in AS may need revision in the future.

### Asymptomatic aortic stenosis in the elderly: a clinical review [^112ibFtQ]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Aortic stenosis is the most common form of valvular heart disease. Progression of aortic stenosis is very slow and highly variable. Decisions about when to perform valve surgery are made by subjective assessment of patient symptoms and objective measures of the valve and ventricular function by transthoracic echocardiography.

Objective

To review current concepts regarding the development, progression, and assessment of aortic stenosis; the appropriate monitoring intervals for transthoracic echocardiography; and the indications for valve procedures.

Evidence Review

Guidelines and literature search.

Findings

Angina, exertional syncope, and heart failure are key symptoms indicating a need for intervention. The frequency of valvular monitoring by transthoracic echocardiography is guided by the disease severity. Despite evidence of severe disease, valve procedures can safely be deferred if patients experience no symptoms and have normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis may subconsciously curtail their activities to avoid symptoms. Apparently, asymptomatic patients can undergo a carefully monitored exercise stress test to confirm both their asymptomatic status and hemodynamic response to exercise. Bioprosthetic valves are a good replacement alternative for older patients who are good surgical candidates and who have no need for warfarin therapy. For patients who are at high or very high risk of cardiac surgery, transcutaneous aortic valve implantation is an increasing available and preferred over medical management.

Conclusions and Relevance

Asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis require frequent monitoring of their subjective symptoms combined with objective measurement of aortic valve gradient and ventricular function by transthoracic echocardiography. Although conventional surgical replacement remains the mainstay of therapy for aortic stenosis, transcutaneous aortic valve implantation options are evolving.

### Aortic valve replacement vs. conservative treatment in asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: long-term follow-up of the AVATAR trial [^111ZygFu]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The question of when and how to treat truly asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function is still subject to debate and ongoing research. Here, the results of extended follow-up of the AVATAR trial are reported (NCT02436655, ClinicalTrials.gov).

Methods

The AVATAR trial randomly assigned patients with severe, asymptomatic AS and LV ejection fraction ≥ 50% to undergo either early surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) or conservative treatment with watchful waiting strategy. All patients had negative exercise stress testing. The primary hypothesis was that early AVR will reduce a primary composite endpoint comprising all-cause death, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or unplanned hospitalization for heart failure (HF), as compared with conservative treatment strategy.

Results

A total of 157 low-risk patients (mean age 67 years, 57% men, mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score 1.7%) were randomly allocated to either the early AVR group (n = 78) or the conservative treatment group (n = 79). In an intention-to-treat analysis, after a median follow-up of 63 months, the primary composite endpoint outcome event occurred in 18/78 patients (23.1%) in the early surgery group and in 37/79 patients (46.8%) in the conservative treatment group [hazard ratio (HR) early surgery vs. conservative treatment 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24–0.73, P = 0.002]. The Kaplan-Meier estimates for individual endpoints of all-cause death and HF hospitalization were significantly lower in the early surgery compared with the conservative group (HR 0.44; 95% CI 0.23–0.85, P = 0.012, for all-cause death and HR 0.21; 95% CI 0.06–0.73, P = 0.007, for HF hospitalizations).

Conclusions

The extended follow-up of the AVATAR trial demonstrates better clinical outcomes with early surgical AVR in truly asymptomatic patients with severe AS and normal LV ejection fraction compared with patients treated with conservative management on watchful waiting.

### Pathophysiology, emerging techniques for the assessment and novel treatment of aortic stenosis [^112eooXk]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Current management

AS is detected following a physical examination. The clinical signs include a slow rising pulse, palpable precordial thrill, narrow pulse pressure, ejection-systolic murmur radiating to the carotids, soft second heart second due to valve restriction and a fourth heart sound. Currently, transthoracic echocardiography remains the initial imaging modality to assess valve morphology and haemodynamics. Following diagnosis, patients are stratified based on symptom status, valvular anatomy and haemodynamics. Severe AS is defined by an aortic valve area (AVA) ≤ 1 cm² (or indexed AVA of ≤ 0.6 cm² m²), peak transvalvular velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s, mean pressure gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg and velocity time integral of < 0.25. Severity guides intervention timing, valve replacement being the gold standard in symptomatic patients. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is preferred in high-risk patients over surgery and its indications are expanding.

However, limitations around the timing of intervention arise; the balance between early intervention risk and irreversible cardiac damage is difficult to evaluate within current diagnostic parameters. Compounding this is the lack of robust evidence in treating severe asymptomatic AS. As a result, standard recommendations are passive and suggest watchful waiting. Interpretation of symptom severity is challenging in an elderly, comorbid, sedentary population and the rapid deterioration of symptomatic AS necessitates the need for advanced assessment techniquesCurrent research is ongoing assessing evaluating earlier valve intervention in the asymptomatic patient.

AHA and ESC guidelines currently do not recommend intervention in patients with moderate AS but it can be considered if the patient is undergoing CABG or surgical intervention on the ascending aorta or another valve. Large cohort studies do, however, show that moderate AS is not a benign condition and that these patients have poor survival rates and that AVR in this population group is associated with better outcomes. Further randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are required to guide future recommendations. The PROGRESSand Evolut EXPAND TAVR II Pivotaltrials are aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAVR in moderate AS and the TIAMARand TAVR UNLOADstudies are also investigating intervention in patients with concomitant moderate mitral regurgitation and heart failure, respectively.

### Facilitated data relay and effects on treatment of severe aortic stenosis in Europe [^114KwrGS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Many patients with severe aortic stenosis are referred late with advanced symptoms or inappropriately denied intervention. The objective was to investigate whether a structured communication to referring physicians (facilitated data relay) might improve the rate and timeliness of intervention. Methods and Results A prospective registry of consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis at 23 centers in 9 European countries with transcatheter as well as surgical aortic valve replacement being available was performed. The study included a 3-month documentation of the status quo (phase A), a 6-month intervention phase (implementing facilitated data relay), and a 3-month documentation of a legacy effect (phase-B). Two thousand one hundred seventy-one patients with severe aortic stenoses were enrolled (phase A: 759; intervention: 905; phase-B: 507). Mean age was 77.9 ± 10.0 years, and 80% were symptomatic, including 52% with severe symptoms. During phase A, intervention was planned in 464/696 (67%), 138 (20%) were assigned to watchful waiting, 8 (1%) to balloon aortic valvuloplasty, 60 (9%) were listed as not for active treatment, and in 26 (4%), no decision was made. Three hundred sixty-three of 464 (78%) patients received the planned intervention within 3 months. Timeliness of the intervention improved as shown by the higher number of aortic valve replacements performed within 3 months (59% versus 51%, P = 0.002) and a significant decrease in the time to intervention (36 ± 38 versus 30 ± 33 days, P = 0.002). Conclusions A simple, low-cost, facilitated data relay improves timeliness of treatment for patients diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis, resulting in a shorter time to transcatheter aortic valve replacement. This effect was mainly driven by a significant improvement in timeliness of intervention in transcatheter aortic valve replacement but not surgical aortic valve replacement.

### Risk stratification in asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a critical appraisal [^114SAW8y]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is one of the most common forms of acquired valvular heart disease. The development of symptoms, namely syncope, angina, or heart failure, in patients with severe aortic stenosis predicts a high likelihood of mortality. Aortic valve replacement is the current standard of care. In truly asymptomatic patients, the risk of sudden death is perceived to be low; therefore many advocate conservative management of these patients until symptoms develop. Emerging data suggest that certain markers may identify subsets of asymptomatic patients who are at a high risk of cardiac events. This review critically appraises the growing plethora of adverse prognostic markers that have been identified and evaluates how these parameters may influence clinical practice and potentially identify patients in whom early surgical intervention is warranted.

2020 ACC/AHA valvular heart disease — stage B medical therapy emphasizes that in early valvular heart disease (VHD) there are currently no therapies to prevent disease progression in the valve leaflets, so recommendations are directed toward patient monitoring with the intent to intervene once severe disease is present with symptoms or abnormal cardiovascular function. The document highlights inclusion gaps, noting that women and minorities often are underrepresented in clinical trials and calls for directed efforts to include all patient groups with numbers adequate to perform separate data analysis. It notes that, given the relatively low risk of intervention and improved options, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of intervention for severe asymptomatic VHD are important and in progress for some conditions, such as severe aortic stenosis (AS), and that clinical equipoise exists for asymptomatic severe aortic regurgitation (AR) with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function, severe primary mitral regurgitation (MR) with normal LV function and a high likelihood of valve repair, and the role of intervention for tricuspid regurgitation (TR); long-term follow-up is needed to ensure the lifetime risks of a prosthetic valve or valve repair are balanced against any benefits attributable to earlier intervention.

### Management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117BwcY8]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

The pooled meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in all-cause mortality in patients treated with the early intervention compared with those managed conservatively with the watchful waiting approach (HR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.86; I 2 0%) (figure 1). Furthermore, the early intervention resulted in a significantly reduced risk of hospitalisation for heart failure (HR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.96; I 2 15%) (figure 2). There was significant heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of cardiovascular mortality among the two studies, and while there was a trend towards improved survival this was mainly driven by the RECOVERY trial and did not reach statistical significance (HR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.78; I 2 78%) (online supplemental figure 2).

### 2017 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the management of adults with aortic Stenosis: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^113gb2Fd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis staging for TAVR candidates — patients considered for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) should have severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) (Stage D). Symptomatic severe high-gradient AS (Stage D1) is characterized by an aortic velocity of 4.0 m/s or higher and a mean transaortic gradient of 40 mm Hg or higher, with typical valve areas ≤ 1.0 cm² and indexed ≤ 0.6 cm²/m². Stage D2 severe symptomatic low-flow low-gradient AS with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (< 50%) is defined by a severely calcified valve and aortic valve area ≤ 1.0 cm², with aortic velocity < 4.0 m/s at rest that increases to at least 4.0 m/s on low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography. Stage D3 severe symptomatic low-flow low-gradient AS with normal LVEF is defined as aortic valve area ≤ 1.0 cm² with aortic velocity < 4.0 m/s and mean gradient < 40 mm Hg; key features include indexed aortic valve area ≤ 0.6 cm²/m² and stroke volume index < 35 ml/m², with confirmation when the patient is normotensive and no other explanation for symptoms.

Aortic Stenosis Phenotypes and AVR Class Indications

Patients who passed the initial screening were grouped into AS phenotypes on the basis of mean aortic valve gradient (AVG) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) reported in the index TTE, as per the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines. They were subsequently defined as having a likely indication for AVR by phenotype per the 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Guideline for the Management of Patients with Valvular Heart Disease. Patients were subsequently categorized as having symptomatic high‐gradient severe AS with preserved LVEF (mean AVG ≥ 40 mm Hg, LVEF ≥ 50%); high‐gradient severe AS with reduced LVEF (mean AVG ≥ 40 mm Hg, LVEF < 50%); symptomatic low‐gradient AS with preserved LVEF (mean AVG < 40 mm Hg, LVEF ≥ 50%, stroke volume index < 35 mL/m²); and symptomatic low‐gradient severe AS with reduced LVEF (mean AVG < 40 mm Hg, LVEF < 50%). Patients who underwent AVR were presumed to have an appropriate indication for AVR.

Data Collection and Definitions

Symptom Status and Reasons for AVR Denial/Refusal

Medical records for patients who did not receive an AVR within 1 year of their index TTE were manually reviewed by 3 study physicians (L.F. M.E. R.L.) to determine symptom status and reasons for AVR denial or refusal. Patients were identified as symptomatic if an evaluating provider made direct mention of symptomatic AS in a patient's electronic health record or recorded the presence of heart failure, angina, or syncope in the time period spanning 2 months prior and 6 months after a patient's index TTE date. Reasons for not pursuing AVR were also identified within the same time period and collapsed into nominal categories: symptoms not attributed to AS, AS not considered severe, medical uncertainty/watchful waiting, AVR evaluation initiated but delayed, medical futility, patient/family refusal, or severe AS not discussed or mentioned in clinical records.

### Sudden death in patients with severe aortic stenosis: observations from the CURRENT AS registry [^116m4KT9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a progressive disease, and survival during the asymptomatic phase has been reported to be similar to that of age‐matched controls with a low risk of sudden death when patients were followed prospectively and promptly report symptom onset. 1, 2, 3 The current guidelines generally recommend a strategy of watchful waiting until symptoms emerge for aortic valve replacement (AVR) in asymptomatic patients with severe AS, based on the low annual incidence of sudden death (< 1%/year) in asymptomatic patients with severe AS. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 However, the low annual incidence of sudden death was reported mostly from small single‐center studies conducted in the 1990s and 2000s. Inclusion of relatively younger patients in these studies might not allow us to extrapolate these findings to contemporary patients with more advanced age. There is a paucity of data regarding the predictive factors for an increased risk of sudden death in patients with severe AS, although nearly 70% of sudden death episodes were not preceded by any of the classical AS symptoms. 3, 4, 5 Therefore, we sought to investigate the incidence of sudden death and the risk factors associated with sudden death in a large contemporary multicenter registry of consecutive patients with severe AS.

Aortic stenosis — Routine follow-up of asymptomatic disease and progression rates: When severe AS is present (aortic velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s), the rate of progression to symptoms is high, with an event-free survival rate of only 30% to 50% at 2 years. With moderate AS (aortic velocity 3.0–3.9 m/s), the average annual rate of progression is an increase in velocity of 0.3 m/s, increase in mean pressure gradient of 7 mm Hg, and decrease in valve area of 0.1 cm². In patients with aortic sclerosis, defined as focal areas of valve calcification and leaflet thickening with an aortic velocity < 2.0 m/s, progression to severe AS occurs in about 10% of patients within 5 years.

### Normal-flow low-gradient aortic Stenosis: comparing the U.S. and European guidelines [^116ohj4y]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with normal-flow low-gradient (NFLG) severe aortic stenosis present both diagnostic and management challenges, with debate about the whether this represents true severe stenosis and the need for valve replacement. Studies exploring the natural history without intervention have shown similar outcomes of patients with NFLG severe aortic stenosis to those with moderate aortic stenosis and better outcomes after valve replacement than those with low-flow low-gradient severe aortic stenosis. Most studies (all observational) have shown that aortic valve replacement was associated with a survival benefit vs surveillance. Based on available data, the European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery guidelines and European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging/American Society of Echocardiography suggest that these patients are more likely to have moderate aortic stenosis. This clinical entity is not mentioned in the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines. Here we review the definition of NFLG severe aortic stenosis, potential diagnostic algorithms and points of error, the data supporting different management strategies, and the differing guidelines and outline the unanswered questions in the diagnosis and management of these challenging patients.

Regarding medical management for aortic stenosis, more specifically with respect to antihypertensive therapy, ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend to ensure optimization of BP control before measurement of AS severity by TTE, TEE, cardiac catheterization, or cardiac magnetic resonance in patients with suspected low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with normal LVEF (stage D3).

### Comprehensive update on the new indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the latest 2017 European guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease [^115HkRDs]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Interestingly, the updated guidelines now also state that SAVR should be considered in asymptomatic patients with normal ejection fraction if the surgical risk is low and one of the following findings is present: (1) very severe aortic stenosis defined by a peak velocity > 5.5 m/s, (2) severe valve calcification and a rate of peak velocity progression ≥ 0.3 m/s/year, (3) markedly elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels (> 3-fold normal range) confirmed by repeated measurements and (4) severe pulmonary hypertension (systolic pulmonary artery pressure at rest > 60 mm Hg) without other explanation. In patients without these predictive factors, watchful waiting appears safe and early surgery is unlikely to be beneficial.

For the time being, there is no evidence available showing a role for TAVR in the treatment of asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis. However, studies are on their way to investigate the potential value of TAVR for this specific patient population.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Aortic valve function — assessment of aortic stenosis (AS) for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR): Doppler transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is described as superior to other imaging modalities, and AS severity should be evaluated according to specified echocardiography recommendations and staged per AHA/ACC guidelines; if AS severity is unclear, repeat TTE at an experienced valve center can play a role, especially in low-flow, low-gradient AS with preserved ejection fraction (EF) (Stage D3). Dobutamine stress echocardiography plays an important role in identifying contractile reserve in low-flow, low-gradient AS with reduced EF (Stage D2), invasive hemodynamics may have a role in select patients, and an aortic valve calcium score has been proposed for unclear low-flow, low-gradient AS. Velocity-encoded cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) will systematically underestimate peak aortic velocity and should not be used in place of TTE for identifying peak aortic velocity and gradients.

Additional Outcomes

Few studies reported outcomes on sudden cardiac death. Only 1 study performed a proportional hazards analysis showing reduced risk of sudden cardiac death in the early AVR group (HR, 0.43; CI, 0.17–0.99). 15 Other studies reported reduced numbers of sudden cardiac death events in the AVR group, but no statistical tests were performed (Table 2).

HF hospitalization rates were compared in 3 studies. One study that compared AVR versus no AVR found similar HF hospitalization rates (0.4% versus 0.3% per person‐year), with a decrease in HF hospitalization rates in the group with AVR after the AVR operation (1.7%–0.2% per person‐year). 20 One observational study and the only RCT, both comparing early AVR versus watchful waiting, showed lower HF hospitalizations in the group with early AVR (HR, 0.19; CI, 0.09–0.36; and HR, 0.05; CI, 0.00–1.05, respectively). 15, 21

### Imaging and impact of myocardial fibrosis in aortic stenosis [^1151sM9j]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Future Directions

Myocardial fibrosis is well established as a hallmark pathological feature of left ventricular decompensation in patients with aortic stenosis; yet, it is not routinely assessed in clinical practice. In part, this has reflected the limitations of myocardial biopsy, many of which have now been overcome with advanced noninvasive imaging. The next step is to assess whether these imaging techniques will prove of clinical value in monitoring myocardial health, identifying left ventricular decompensation, and optimizing the timing of AVR.

LGE is the best validated of these approaches, is relatively simple to perform and analyze, and is supported by powerful prognostic data. Whether noninfarct LGE can be used to optimize the timing of valve intervention is currently being tested in the EVOLVED (Early Valve Replacement Guided by Biomarkers of LV Decompensation in Asymptomatic Patients With Severe AS) trial (Figure 5). This multicenter randomized controlled trial will recruit asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis for CMR imaging. Those patients with noninfarct LGE will then be randomized 1:1 to early valve intervention (SAVR or TAVR) versus the conventional approach of watchful waiting until symptom development or clinical heart failure. To mitigate the costs of CMR, patients will initially be screened with high-sensitivity troponin and an electrocardiogram, both of which are predictors of noninfarct LGE; only those patients with an abnormal electrocardiogram or a troponin ≥ 6 ng/l will proceed to CMR. The primary endpoint is a composite of all-cause mortality and unplanned aortic stenosis–related hospital admissions. This is the first randomized trial to offer targeted early intervention in patients with myocardial fibrosis and left ventricular decompensation, and the results will be of great interest. Similar randomized controlled trials will ultimately be required to establish the clinical utility of other myocardial fibrosis assessments, given that aortic valve intervention is not without risk.

Aortic stenosis — Table 14 provides "A Simplified Framework With Examples of Factors Favoring SAVR, TAVI, or Palliation Instead of Aortic Valve Intervention", outlining examples by column. Factors favoring surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) include concurrent conditions and procedure limits such as "Aortic dilatation‡ Severe primary MR Severe CAD requiring bypass grafting Septal hypertrophy requiring myectomy AF" and "Valve anatomy, annular size, or low coronary ostial height precludes TAVI Vascular access does not allow transfemoral TAVI", with frailty status "Not frail or few frailty measures". Factors favoring transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) include anatomic or prior-treatment considerations such as "Severe calcification of the ascending aorta ("porcelain" aorta)" and "Previous cardiac surgery with at-risk coronary grafts Previous chest irradiation", with frailty "Frailty likely to improve after TAVI". Factors favoring palliation include systemic burden and frailty such as "Moderate to severe involvement of ≥ 2 other organ systems", "Severe frailty unlikely to improve after TAVI", and the risk/benefit threshold "Prohibitive SAVR risk (> 15%) or post-TAVI life expectancy < 1 y". Additional context notes durability evidence: "Long-term (> 20 y) data on outcomes with surgical bioprosthetic valves are available; robust data on transcatheter bioprosthetic valves extend only to 5 y, leading to uncertainty about longer-term outcomes". The table also flags that "‡Dilation of the aortic sinuses or ascending aorta may require concurrent surgical replacement, particularly in younger patients with a BAV".

Aortic stenosis — high gradient AS track prioritizes excluding high flow before confirming severity. A high gradient generally indicates severe AS, but the only diagnostic condition to consider is abnormally high flow across the valve (SVI > 58 ml/m²), where even non-severe AS as defined by AVA ≥ 1.0 cm² may present with a high gradient; assessment should then be repeated when flow status has normalized, and the next step in high gradient AS is therefore to exclude a high flow state and determine whether it is reversible, which can often be recognized from high LVOT velocity by colour Doppler or velocity ratio.

### Impact of aortic valve replacement in symptomatic low-risk patients with less than severe aortic stenosis [^116sN82x]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

TAVR has revolutionised the management of severe AS, offering an efficacious, safe and less invasive alternative to surgery. The indications for TAVR have continued to expand but not yet for patients with less than severe AS. Although unfavourable survival outcomes in the moderate AS population have been well documented, the current management strategy for patients with less than severe AS has been 'watchful waiting', as prospective data to support earlier isolated AVR are not yet available. A recent retrospective study demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality by AVR in patients with moderate AS and a reduced LVEF. Currently, the TAVR UNLOAD trial (TAVR to Unload the Left Ventricle in Patients with Advanced Heart Failure, NCT02661451), the PROGRESS trial (Management of Moderate Aortic Stenosis by Clinical Surveillance or TAVR, NCT04889872) and EXPAND trial (Evolut EXPAND TAVR II Pivotal Trial, NCT05149755) are evaluating the efficacy of TAVR among patients with moderate AS and cardiac dysfunction, but results will not be available for some time. Our findings that TAVR and SAVR significantly improved QOL and valve haemodynamics in patients with symptomatic moderately-severe AS at low surgical risk support further investigations via randomised trials comparing isolated AVR with watchful waiting in patients with symptomatic moderate AS and a preserved LVEF.

### Treating of aortic valve stenosis in real-life: a multifaceted decision-making challenge [^116eFZxg]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

In this issue of CCI, Vejpongsa and coworkers showed that TAVR represented 20.4% of all aortic valve replacements performed in elderly patients from 21 US states in the year 2013. Patients treated with SAVR or TAVR largely overlapped in their baseline characteristics, indicating that both modalities concur in everyday life. One out of six patients was readmitted within 30 days, with no significant differences between the TAVR and SAVR in propensity score analysis. One may ask: since the indications of transcatheter and surgical treatments are interchanged for many cases, and the global results look similar, how to finally select the best therapeutic option for an individual case? Would the results be the same if patient-reported outcomes and experiences, such as pain and analgesic use, time to return to routine activities, or quality of life scores were measured? Combining traditional and patient-reported outcomes, in relation to costs, is the optimal approach to assess value in healthcare. Time has come for investigators to adopt value-based healthcare measures as endpoints in registries and clinical trials.

### Watchful observation versus early aortic valve replacement for symptomatic patients with normal flow, low-gradient severe aortic stenosis [^116gpros]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The timing of aortic valve replacement (AVR) remains controversial in symptomatic patients with normal flow, low-gradient severe aortic stenosis (AS) and preserved LVEF. We sought to compare long-term mortality of early AVR versus a watchful observation strategy.

Methods

From 2000 to 2011, we prospectively evaluated 284 consecutive symptomatic patients (136 men, age 68 ± 10years) with normal flow, low-gradient severe AS and preserved LVEF who were potential candidates for early AVR. Normal flow, low-gradient severe AS was defined as indexed aortic valve area < 0.6cm²/m² with mean gradient < 40mmHg and stroke volume index ≥ 35mL/m². Early AVR was performed on 98 patients (early AVR group), while the watchful observation strategy was selected for 186 patients (watchful observation group). Patients in the watchful observation group were referred for AVR if mean gradient was ≥ 40mmHg during follow-up.

Results

There were no significant differences between the early AVR and the watchful observation groups for the risk of overall mortality (HR 0.94 for the early AVR; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.73) or for the estimated actuarial 8-year mortality rates (17 ± 5% vs 27 ± 5%, p = 0.84) in the overall cohort. Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, comorbidity index, age, coronary artery disease, aetiology of AS and performance of AVR were associated with overall survival. For 83 propensity-score-matched pairs, the risk of overall death was not significantly different between the two groups (HR 1.13 for the early AVR, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.35, p = 0.74).

Conclusions

Early AVR and watchful observation strategy show similar survival in symptomatic patients with normal flow, low-gradient severe AS and preserved LVEF. Watchful observation with timely performance of AVR should be considered a therapeutic option.

Aortic stenosis — asymptomatic severe disease triggers and risk features: In asymptomatic AS Stage C (Vmax ≥ 4 m/s), AVR is pursued when LVEF < 50%, with other cardiac surgery, or if an exercise treadmill test (ETT) shows ↓ BP or ↓ exercise capacity. In patients without these triggers, very severe stenosis or disease activity with low surgical risk (Vmax ≥ 5 m/s or BNP > 3x normal or rapid disease progression) leads to SAVR (2a), while a decline in LVEF to < 60% on 3 serial studies leads to SAVR (2b).

### Association of high-sensitivity troponin T with outcomes in asymptomatic non-severe aortic stenosis: a post-hoc substudy of the SEAS trial [^114k2WAv]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Degenerative calcific aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a growing, global health problem affecting up to 12.4%of the projected 1.5 billion elderly aged above 65 years in 2050. Due to a shared link with age and atherosclerotic risk factors, coronary artery disease (CAD) coexists in up to 75% of older adults with AS. The association between prevalent AS and CAD, is unmistakable as 1 of 3 symptomatic patients undergo concomitant aortic valve replacement (AVR) and coronary revascularisation. Consequently, it may be challenging to determine whether new-onset symptoms of angina pectoris or heart failure are due to progression of AS or CAD in patients with initially asymptomatic AS.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin is an established biomarker of ischaemia and cardiomyocyte injury due to cardiac pressure overload. Still, there are no guideline recommendations for high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) guided monitoring during the watchful waiting of patients with AS. The current literature mainly consists of observational studies in heterogeneous populations investigating whether single measurements of cardiac troponin levels can be used as a marker of left ventricular remodelling on the pathway to end-stage heart failure and a need for AVR in severe AS. In the clinical setting, it is undetermined which hsTnT levels can be expected in an outpatient population of stable patients with asymptomatic non-severe AS. Similarly, it is unclear if hsTnT primarily associates with CAD or AS severity in patients without hemodynamically significant AS and if serial hsTnT measurements may aid further in this regard.

We, therefore, conducted an observational post-hoc analysis of the large, randomised SEAS trial(Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis), which investigated the effect of lipid-lowering therapy in 1873 patients with asymptomatic mild to moderate-severe AS, preserved systolic function and no history or symptoms of CAD. Our main objectives were: 1) to explore what patient characteristics are associated with hsTnT concentration; 2) hsTnT trajectory during one year of follow-up; and 3) to assess if hsTnT concentration at baseline is associated with adverse clinical outcomes, particularly isolated AVR, ischaemic coronary events (ICE), and all-cause mortality. We hypothesised that an hsTnT level > 14 pg/mL at baseline would be associated with more severe AS and herald a higher risk of isolated AVR, ICE, and mortality.

Aortic stenosis assessment — measurement considerations and low-flow with reduced LVEF: Doppler velocity data and invasive pressure measurements ideally are recorded when the patient is normotensive; if results indicating only moderate stenosis were recorded when the patient was hypertensive, repeat measurements when the blood pressure is better controlled ensure that a diagnosis of severe AS is not missed. Patients with severe AS and LVEF < 50% present with an aortic valve area < 1.0 cm² but a low transvalvular velocity and pressure gradient (ie, velocity < 4 m/s or mean gradient < 40 mm Hg) at rest.

Large vessel vasculitis (LVV) in remission — elective intervention and surveillance imaging guidance specifies that for patients in remission with aortic or branch artery complications not requiring urgent intervention, the role of elective endovascular or open surgical repair should be determined by a multidisciplinary team, and before intervention imaging with 18F-FDG-PET CT is often helpful to assess treatment response and quantify ongoing active inflammation. A major relapse of GCA and Takayasu arteritis includes ischemic features or evidence of active aortic inflammation resulting in branch vessel stenosis, aortic aneurysm, or dissection, whereas remission is characterized by lack of new clinical symptoms, normalization of inflammatory biomarkers, and no evidence of progressive aortic and branch artery dilation or narrowing by surveillance imaging; signs of vessel inflammation may persist even without clinical disease. For those in remission, annual surveillance imaging with CT or MRI is useful to detect disease progression in the aortic and branch arteries, and more frequent surveillance may be necessary when progression is apparent on annual imaging or if new symptoms suggest arterial stenosis.

### Prognosis of severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis with and without surgery [^115vjQe7]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This study sought to determine outcomes in patients with severe, asymptomatic aortic stenosis (AS), stratified by treatment recommendation.

Methods

Between January 2005 and December 2013, 4,998 patients had severe AS by echocardiography, of whom 308 were identified as asymptomatic by medical record review. Five patients were deemed inoperable, and 38 were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 265 patients, aortic valve replacement (AVR) was recommended in 104, and watchful waiting (WW) was recommended in 161. Probabilities of undergoing surgery and of death from recommendation date were estimated using a multistate model. Cox regression analysis was used to determine independent risk factors for death.

Results

Probability of death at 1 year after recommendation was 5.2% in the WW group and 4.7% in the AVR group. At 2 years after recommendation, survival in the AVR-recommended group was 92.5% versus 83.9% in the WW group (p = 0.044). In the WW group, the probability of dying or undergoing surgery was 43.9% by 2 years. Undergoing surgery was independently associated with higher survival in the AVR-recommended group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.17; p = 0.038) and in the WW group (HR, 0.39; p = 0.044). A higher ejection fraction (HR, 0.58; p < 0.001) was associated with better survival, whereas renal failure (HR, 2.81; p = 0.009) was associated with worse survival.

Conclusions

The strategy of early AVR is associated with improved survival in asymptomatic patients.

### Aortic stenosis: timing is everything [^1165LE4E]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The publication of this study is timely in the context of other recent data on the burden and treatment of AS. Généreux et alrecently demonstrated in the largest AS cohort to date that a disproportionately large number of patients with severe AS did not undergo AVR, suggesting underutilization of AVR. It is reasonable to believe that a significant number of these patients with severe AS had either unrecognized symptoms or early markers of poor prognosis and would have benefited from AVR. Patients with moderate AS, for whom the current standard of care is close observation, also appear to be at increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. While this may reflect under recognition of severe AS, prospective trials are underway to examine the role of early intervention in this population.

Most of the data supporting early intervention that informs current practice are derived from patients who underwent surgical AVR. In the study by Azavedo et al, only about 10% of patients underwent TAVR, which is contrary to TAVR uptake in contemporary clinical practice. In the United States, TAVR volume has surpassed surgical AVR volume in 2019, and TAVR is now the predominant method of intervention. The short-term outcomes of TAVR in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic AS are promising, and we eagerly await long-term data in this population. TAVR has permitted the treatment of AS in the elderly with multiple comorbidities, and in these patients, the long-term performance of TAVR on a 10-year scale may have limited relevance compared to that in younger patients. As TAVR is being performed in lower-risk patients, particularly younger patients, it is important to consider the implications of prosthetic valve degeneration, need for repeat intervention, and the ensuing impact on long-term outcomes even beyond 10 years. Continual re-evaluation of the timing of aortic valve intervention is paramount in view of our improving ability to accurately discern prognostically important AS and the greater number of intervention options available.

Decision-making in medicine is often biased toward improving present-day symptoms, and it can be difficult for patients to consider the future over a span of decades. Aortic stenosis, a progressive and indolent disease, needs to be considered in this timescale. Patients may be keen to defer AVR when they are asymptomatic, as they may be hesitant to undergo a procedure with an upfront morbidity cost. Practitioners may want to delay AVR until it is necessary to maximize the longevity of the prosthesis. A shared decision-making process is vital considering the age, lifestyle, and comorbidities of the patient.

### Aortic stenosis: the old disease with new (and evolving) faces [^113im1FB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

"A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence" —

Recent guidelines on the management of valvular heart disease clarified the role of gradient states in stratifying severe aortic stenosis (AS; Figure 1). We are perhaps more familiar with the indications of aortic valve replacement (AVR) in high‐gradient (HG) severe AS. The guidance on low‐gradient (LG) severe AS have added complexity in the diagnosis and management algorithms; but this is necessary to keep pace with evolving knowledge. There are some relevant caveats worth highlighting:
Although not required to define HG severe AS, aortic valve area of ≤ 1.0 cm² (indexed aortic valve area 0.6 cm²/m²) remains an important parameter to establish severity in patients with LG AS.
In LG severe AS, AVR is currently recommended in 2 specified groups of patients with symptoms: True severe AS in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; also termed classical low‐flow low‐gradient [LFLG] severe AS). True severe is to be distinguished from pseudosevere AS with further investigations such as dobutamine stress echocardiography or computed tomography calcium score of the aortic valve. Low‐flow state (indexed stroke volume ≤ 35 mL/m²) in those with preserved LVEF (also termed as paradoxical LFLG severe AS).
Currently, there are no specific recommendations proposed in asymptomatic patients with LG severe AS; and those with normal‐flow low‐gradient (NFLG) severe AS.

Figure 1
Management of severe aortic stenosis stratified by gradient states.

The recommendations for aortic valve replacement (AVR) in high‐gradient severe aortic stenosis (AS) are guided by symptoms and/or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). In the absence of symptoms and preserved LVEF, AVR may be considered in patients with high‐gradient severe AS when there is evidence of other abnormal findings. In low‐gradient states, aortic valvular area remains an important parameter to establish severity. AVR is currently recommended in 2 groups of symptomatic patients with low‐gradient severe AS: true severe in those with reduced LVEF and those with paradoxical low‐flow low‐gradient severe AS. AVA indicates aortic valvular area; EU, European Union; HTN, hypertension; LOE, level of evidence; MPG, mean pressure gradient; NFLG, normal‐flow low‐gradient; PLFLG, paradoxical low‐flow low‐gradient; SVi, indexed stroke volume; and Vm, peak aortic jet velocity.

DISCUSSION

The meta‐analysis of RCTs compared an early interventional strategy with a conservative strategy in asymptomatic patients with severe AS. The analysis demonstrated the superiority of early intervention over CM with respect to the primary composite outcome of all‐cause mortality, hospitalization for cardiovascular causes, stroke, and myocardial infarction, and with respect to the all‐cause mortality, hospitalization for cardiovascular causes, and stroke, respectively. However, significant differences in the rates of cardiac‐specific mortality and myocardial infarction were not apparent.

For patients with asymptomatic severe AS, the decision to pursue early AVR or adopt a conservative strategy until symptoms develop remains a matter of debate. Traditionally, a watchful waiting approach has been preferred. However, accumulating evidence indicates that asymptomatic severe AS often progresses and leads to serious adverse outcomes if left untreated. An observational study by Pellikka et al. following 622 asymptomatic patients with severe AS, found the proportion of freedom from AVR or death was 80%, 63%, and 25% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Another large cohort study by Lancelotti et al. pooled data from 10 clinics across Europe, the United States, and Canada. Eight hundred sixty‐one asymptomatic patients with severe AS were included in this cohort. The proportion of freedom from death was 93%, 86%, and 75% at 2, 4, and 8 years, respectively, while AVR‐free survival was 54% and 32% at 2 and 4 years, respectively. Several meta‐analyses have compared the early SAVR or TAVR with CM among asymptomatic patients with severe AS, suggesting that early surgical interventions were associated with a lower rate of all‐cause mortality, cardiac‐specific mortality, noncardiac mortality, and heart failure hospitalization compared with CM. However, most included studies were nonrandomized and observational, with several having small sample size (< 100) or lacking the baseline information of participants, making them susceptible to bias due to unmeasured confounding variables or systematic differences between early interventions group and conservative treatments groups.

ACC/AHA 2020 aortic valve intervention — adults < 65 years: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has demonstrated excellent durability, and earlier randomized trials of SAVR versus transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) enrolled older adults with a mean age in the mid-80s, while more recent lower-risk trials had a mean age in the mid-70s with very few patients < 65 years of age, so the evidence base cannot be extrapolated to these patients. Based on the published evidence, the guideline states that the most prudent course is to recommend SAVR for adults < 65 years of age unless life expectancy is limited by comorbid cardiac or noncardiac conditions, and there are no data for the use of TAVI in patients < 65 years of age; the final choice is made through shared decision-making that accounts for the patient's values and preferences.

Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging

Watchful waiting in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis and preserved LVEF is currently recommended. However, the pressure overload imposed to the LV by the stenotic valve can lead to irreversible myocardial fibrosis which has shown to portend poor prognosis even after aortic valve intervention. Singh et alinvestigated whether adverse LV remodeling progresses in the short term in 44 asymptomatic patients with moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis (83.4% male, indexed aortic valve area 0.54 ± 0.15 cm²/m²) included in the PRIMID-AS (PRognostic Importance of MIcrovascular Dysfunction in Aortic Stenosis) study. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was performed at baseline and 12-month follow-up. The authors observed a significant increase in indexed LV end-diastolic volume (from 90.7 ± 22.0 to 94.5 ± 23.1, P = 0.007) and indexed LA volume (from 52.9 ± 11.3 58.6 ± 13.6, P < 0.001), reduction in LVEF (from 57.9 ± 4.6% to 55.6 ± 4.1%, P = 0.001) and impairment in LV diastolic function (longitudinal diastolic strain rate from 1.06 ± 0.24 s⁻¹ 0.99 ± 0.24 s⁻¹, P = 0.026) despite no change in the indexed aortic valve area. In addition, there was a significant reduction in rest and stress myocardial blood flows and increases in myocardial fibrosis both on native T1 mapping and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging (Figure 3). These findings demonstrate unequivocal progression of adverse cardiac remodeling in asymptomatic moderate-severe aortic stenosis in 12 months, emphasizing the need of improved patient risk-stratification tools and potential need for earlier intervention.
