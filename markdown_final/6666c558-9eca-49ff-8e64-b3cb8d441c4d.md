## Question

Latest ADHD guidelines for treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the latest guidelines for ADHD treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which guideline sources are most authoritative and current. Then, I should verify the age-stratified treatment recommendations and ensure I'm aligning with DSM-5 diagnostic principles. Next, I will examine pharmacologic and psychosocial specifics, including titration and monitoring. After that, I need to check comorbidity management and special populations. Finally, I should review implementation, adherence, and real-world outcomes to contextualize the guidance and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary.

> Let me first confirm the primary sources so I don't anchor on outdated guidance. The 2019 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Clinical Practice Guideline is the most current U.S. pediatric standard, with explicit key action statements and an evidence-grading framework, and it is accompanied by a Process of Care Algorithm and a companion article on systemic barriers to implementation, which I should keep in mind for feasibility in primary care [^113hRVVT] [^115Wtwrf]. I should also integrate WHO's 2023 mhGAP guidance for global applicability and the CDC's 2024–2025 summaries for public-facing clarity and alignment with AAP recommendations [^111uhjrX] [^111QnuhG] [^112NzQds].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic foundation before discussing treatment, because treatment hinges on correct identification. The AAP endorses DSM-5 criteria, requiring symptoms and impairment across settings, with information from parents/guardians, teachers, and other involved clinicians, and screening for comorbid emotional, developmental, and physical conditions; this multimodal, multi-informant approach remains the backbone of evaluation in primary care [^1112LXQ4] [^111CWbYi]. I should confirm the age range too: the AAP guideline explicitly addresses children and adolescents 4 to 18 years, noting that care beyond 18 may continue in primary care but was not studied in this guideline, which matters for transition planning [^113SMVrN].

> Now, I will examine age-specific treatment recommendations, starting with preschoolers aged 4–5 years. The AAP gives a strong, Grade A recommendation for parent training in behavior management (PTBM) and/or behavioral classroom interventions as first-line. Methylphenidate may be considered if behavior therapy fails and there is moderate-to-severe functional impairment, with careful risk–benefit discussion and slower titration due to slower metabolism in this age group [^115BfU5i] [^111ENR7f]. Hold on, I should verify the medication nuance: dextroamphetamine is FDA-labeled for children under 6, but the AAP notes insufficient evidence to recommend it as initial treatment in preschoolers, so methylphenidate remains the preferred agent when medication is indicated, albeit off-label in this group [^115CzWuW] [^111xxHqY].

> Next, I should review school-aged children 6–12 years. The AAP strongly recommends FDA-approved medications together with evidence-based behavioral interventions, preferably both, given additive benefits. Stimulants have the strongest evidence, with atomoxetine and alpha-2 agonists as alternatives when stimulants are not suitable or tolerated, and educational supports (IEP/504) are integral to the plan [^116MXUN7] [^114rvD6p]. Let me double-check the strength of evidence: both medication and behavioral therapy carry Grade A recommendations in this age band, reinforcing multimodal care as standard [^116MXUN7].

> For adolescents 12–18 years, I need to ensure assent and autonomy are respected. The AAP recommends FDA-approved medications with adolescent assent and encourages behavioral interventions and school-based supports; educational accommodations remain necessary, and family/patient preference should guide the plan to support engagement and persistence with treatment [^114dD9FS] [^114HDsLd]. Hold on, I should verify the evidence grades here as well: medications and training/behavioral treatments both carry Grade A strength, aligning with adult-adolescent continuity in many systems [^114dD9FS].

> I will now examine pharmacologic specifics and titration, since optimal effect depends on methodical dosing. The AAP advises titrating to maximal benefit with tolerable side effects, typically in 3–7 day intervals, avoiding rigid mg/kg calculations because weight does not reliably predict dose response; more than 70% respond to methylphenidate in systematic trials, and over 90% respond to some psychostimulant with careful trials across classes, which supports switching rather than prematurely abandoning pharmacotherapy [^112BUW8u] [^1132vEEd]. Wait, I should confirm the monitoring cadence: regular follow-up to track symptoms, function, and adverse effects is embedded in the chronic care model and explicitly recommended in the AAP materials and CDC summaries [^1176GhuY] [^111QnuhG].

> Next, I should review psychosocial treatments and their implementation, because adherence and setting-generalization drive outcomes. Effective components include PTBM, classroom behavioral interventions, and organizational skills training; CBT can be helpful, particularly in adolescents and adults, though evidence is strongest for behavioral programs in youth and implementation often requires sustained adult-mediated environmental changes [^112woXbf] [^112fnJPV]. Let me consider WHO's stance: mhGAP recommends psychosocial interventions focused on social, cognitive, and organizational skills to improve development and functioning, which aligns with AAP's emphasis on school and family-based supports [^117XyVjB].

> I need to ensure comorbidity is addressed, as it alters both diagnosis and treatment sequencing. The AAP includes a dedicated Key Action Statement urging systematic screening and either initiation or referral for comorbid emotional, developmental, and physical conditions; this is a Grade C recommendation underscoring scope-of-practice awareness and coordinated care, especially for complex cases [^114Mn6DG] [^111CWbYi]. But wait, what if ADHD co-occurs with autism spectrum disorder? Expert consensus recommends integrated assessment and tailored multimodal treatment, with attention to communication, sensory needs, and coordination across agencies, which often exceeds routine ADHD care and justifies comanagement [^1177RJDw] [^113QDKAZ].

> Let me think about special circumstances that modify treatment choices. In adolescents with substance use concerns, evaluation and treatment for addiction should precede ADHD pharmacotherapy when feasible; if ADHD treatment is necessary, extended-release stimulants and enhanced monitoring (pill counts, PDMP checks, toxicology) are advised to mitigate diversion risk, reflecting addiction medicine guidance [^114ac7YR] [^116Xkfdt]. For preschoolers, I should reiterate the slower titration and the need to document persistent, cross-setting impairment before initiating methylphenidate, given limited but supportive evidence and off-label status in this age group [^115CzWuW] [^111xxHqY].

> I should confirm the overarching care model, because ADHD is chronic and relapsing. The AAP frames ADHD within the chronic care model and medical home, emphasizing coordinated services, education, and longitudinal monitoring; this includes written management plans, school collaboration, and periodic reassessment of symptoms, function, and comorbidities to sustain effectiveness over time [^1176GhuY] [^117LELGH]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies across ages: yes, the chronic care approach is recommended for all youth with ADHD, with developmental tailoring of interventions and supports [^1176GhuY].

> Next, I should review implementation and adherence, since guidelines often fail in real-world translation. The AAP highlights systemic barriers — time constraints, fragmented communication with schools, limited behavioral health access, and disparities by race/ethnicity — and provides a Process of Care Algorithm and quality-improvement tools to support uptake. Adherence to guidelines has improved but remains suboptimal, particularly for preschoolers and for monitoring and follow-up [^115Wtwrf] [^1172cUGP]. Hmm, wait a minute, I recall a recent adherence estimate around 50–75% by age group. Let me verify: 2022–2025 data suggest roughly 51.5% adherence in 4–5 year-olds and 74.5% in 6–17 year-olds, with declines over time, underscoring the need for workflow redesign and equity-focused interventions [^113BHGAV].

> I should also contextualize with real-world outcomes data to ensure the guidance translates into meaningful benefits. Large observational studies indicate ADHD medications are associated with reductions in injuries, accidents, criminality, and premature mortality, supporting the public health imperative to diagnose and treat appropriately; however, rising prescribing rates reflect increased recognition rather than rising prevalence, so quality of care and equitable access must remain priorities [^112bkwRs] [^116yVpJf]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: these are observational associations, but they triangulate with RCT evidence on symptom and functional gains to reinforce guideline-concordant care [^112bkwRs].

> Let me reconsider a potential pitfall: pharmacogenetic testing. I initially thought emerging tools might help personalize stimulant selection, but I should double-check the AAP position. The 2019 AAP guideline concludes that available pharmacogenetic tests lack sufficient evidence for clinical utility and are not recommended, so I should avoid suggesting them outside research contexts [^111bHsgj].

> To synthesize, I need to ensure the flow is clinically coherent and reference-aligned. Diagnose using DSM-5 with multi-informant data and screen for comorbidities; treat preschoolers first with PTBM and consider methylphenidate only if impairment persists and behavioral therapy is insufficient; treat school-aged youth with stimulant medication plus behavioral interventions and school supports; treat adolescents with assent-based medication plus behavioral and educational supports; titrate methodically to maximal benefit with tolerable side effects; manage within a chronic care model with coordinated services; and address barriers to sustain adherence and equity in outcomes [^113hRVVT] [^111uhjrX] [^111QnuhG].

The latest ADHD treatment guidelines emphasize **multimodal care** [^112tSTGB] and **shared decision-making** [^112ijMBk], with **stimulants as first-line** for ages ≥ 6 years [^114rvD6p] and **parent training as first-line** for preschoolers [^115BfU5i]. For adults, stimulants are first-line [^1119zEet], with CBT as adjuncts [^117NtrnD]; **monitor for comorbidities** [^111CWbYi] and titrate to maximal benefit with minimal adverse effects [^114vRQSV]. Regular follow-up [^114AGWH4] and individualized plans are essential [^112ijMBk].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and evaluation

- **DSM-5 criteria**: Diagnose using DSM-5 [^1112LXQ4], documenting symptoms and impairment in ≥ 1 setting, with input from parents, teachers, and clinicians [^1112LXQ4].

- **Multimodal assessment**: Use standardized rating scales and rule out alternative causes [^1112LXQ4] [^111vBXp2].

- **Comorbidity screening**: Screen for coexisting emotional, developmental, and physical conditions [^111CWbYi] [^115pr2YH].

---

## Treatment recommendations by age group

### Preschool-aged children (4–6 years)

First-line treatment is **parent training in behavior management (PTBM)** [^115BfU5i] and/or **behavioral classroom interventions** [^116jLWLf]. Medication is reserved for moderate-to-severe dysfunction unresponsive to behavior therapy; **methylphenidate** may be considered [^115BfU5i] [^115CzWuW].

---

### School-aged children and adolescents (6–18 years)

- **First-line treatment**: FDA-approved medications (stimulants) [^116MXUN7] with PTBM and/or behavioral classroom interventions; combined treatment is preferred [^114rvD6p].

- **Medication options**: Methylphenidate and amphetamines are first-line; atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine are alternatives [^114rvD6p].

- **Adolescent-specific considerations**: Use adolescent assent [^114dD9FS] and incorporate educational supports (IEP/504 plans) [^114HDsLd].

---

### Adults (≥ 18 years)

First-line pharmacotherapy consists of **stimulants** (methylphenidate or amphetamines) [^1119zEet] [^112ymcDL]. Non-pharmacological interventions include **CBT**, **organizational skills training**, and **coaching** [^112ymcDL] [^112fnJPV].

---

## Pharmacological treatment details

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Indications** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Stimulants | - Methylphenidate <br/> - Amphetamines | First-line for ≥ 6 years and adults | - Highly effective <br/> - Monitor for side effects [^114AGWH4] |
| Non-stimulants | - Atomoxetine <br/> - Guanfacine <br/> - Clonidine | Alternative or adjunctive therapy | Useful when stimulants are ineffective or contraindicated [^notfound] |

---

Dosing and titration should be **individualized** [^1132vEEd] to maximize benefit and minimize adverse effects [^114vRQSV]; **regular monitoring** should track efficacy, side effects, growth, and cardiovascular status [^114AGWH4].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

- **Parent training**: PTBM is first-line for preschoolers and adjunctive for older children [^115BfU5i] [^116MXUN7].

- **Behavioral therapy**: Classroom interventions and organizational skills training are recommended [^116MXUN7] [^117XyVjB].

- **CBT**: Effective for adults and adolescents to improve core symptoms and functioning [^112fnJPV] [^117NtrnD].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up should occur every **3–6 months** [^notfound] to assess symptoms, function, and adherence [^notfound]. Chronic care management should follow the **chronic care model** and **medical home** principles [^1176GhuY] [^115xPMWS].

---

## Special considerations

Comorbidities should be identified and managed, as they may alter **ADHD treatment** [^111CWbYi] [^114Mn6DG]. Shared decision-making engages families and patients in **treatment planning** to improve adherence and outcomes [^116MXUN7] [^112ijMBk].

---

## Emerging trends and updates

Digital health tools are being explored for **assessment, monitoring, and delivery of behavioral interventions**. Precision medicine efforts seek to tailor treatment to **genetics and individual response**, though evidence remains limited [^111bHsgj].

---

The latest ADHD treatment guidelines emphasize **multimodal care**, with stimulants first-line for ages ≥ 6 years and adults, and parent training for preschoolers. Regular monitoring, comorbidity management, and shared decision-making are core to optimal outcomes [^112tSTGB] [^1119zEet] [^114AGWH4] [^114Mn6DG].

### Systematic review of national and international guidelines on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^115YcDv3]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

During the last few years several clinical guidelines on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been published by national and international medical societies. To systematically review and compare recommendations of selected ADHD guidelines, we performed a systematic search in online guideline databases and PubMed in order to retrieve guideline texts. Guidelines meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed and recommendations on assessment and treatment extracted. The AGREE instrument was used to assess methodological quality. Of the 26 guidelines identified, 13 were selected for further analysis: 11 guidelines deal with ADHD in childhood and adolescence and 5 guidelines cover transitional patients and/or ADHD in adults. The methodological quality of ADHD guidelines is moderate to good. They reflect similarities and differences of healthcare systems. Diagnosis throughout the lifespan is based on a detailed clinical history. There is greater agreement on evidence-based pharmacological treatment than on psychosocial interventions, reflecting the strength of evidence.

### Updates in pharmacologic strategies in adult attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^111my1vz]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) significantly worsens quality of life and long-term functional outcomes in adults. Individual impairments in adults with ADHD can be further contextualized within considerable costs to society at large. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved stimulants and nonstimulant medications can significantly improve ADHD symptoms in adults. In the past 2 decades, the United States FDA has expanded approval of pharmacotherapeutic options for adult ADHD. However, limitations still persist in available psychotropics for certain patient populations such as those with comorbid substance use or cardiovascular illness. Clinicians therefore must appreciate several ongoing investigations into medications with unique mechanisms of action. This article reviews the current FDA approved and emerging medication options while providing guidelines for pharmacologic management of adult ADHD.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115CzWuW]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Preschool-aged children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) — medication evidence, indications, and dosing: Evidence regarding dextroamphetamine's use in preschool-aged children with ADHD is not adequate to recommend it as an initial ADHD medication treatment at this time, and no nonstimulant medication has sufficient rigorous study to be recommended for treatment of ADHD of children 4 through 5 years of age. Although methylphenidate has the strongest evidence for safety and efficacy in preschool-aged children, it has not yet met the level needed for FDA approval; evidence includes 1 multisite study of 165 children and 10 other smaller, single-site studies ranging from 11 to 59 children, for a total of 269 children, with seven of the 10 single-site studies revealing efficacy, and its use remains on an off-label basis. Before initiating medication, the clinician should assess the severity of the child's ADHD; only preschool-aged children with ADHD and moderate-to-severe dysfunction should be considered, defined by symptoms that have persisted for at least 9 months, dysfunction in both home and other settings, and dysfunction that has not responded adequately to PTBM. For dosing, the rate of metabolizing methylphenidate is slower in children 4 through 5 years of age, so a low dose should be given to start with increases in smaller increments, and maximum doses have not been adequately studied in preschool-aged children.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^114HDsLd]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Adolescent ADHD treatment (KAS 5c) states that for adolescents age 12 years to the 18th birthday, the PCC should prescribe FDA-approved medications for ADHD with the adolescent's assent and is encouraged to prescribe evidence-based training interventions and/or behavioral interventions as a treatment of ADHD, if available; educational interventions and individualized instructional supports are a necessary part of any treatment plan and often include an IEP or a rehabilitation plan (504 plan). These carry Grade A, strong recommendation for medications and Grade A, strong recommendation for training and behavioral treatments for ADHD with the family and school.

### Evidence-based guidelines for management of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in adolescents in transition to adult services and in adults: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^111WAv4F]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an established diagnosis in children, associated with a large body of evidence on the benefits of treatment. Adolescents with ADHD are now leaving children's services often with no readily identifiable adult service to support them, which presents problems as local pharmacy regulations often preclude the prescription of stimulant drugs by general practitioners (GPs). In addition, adults with ADHD symptoms are now starting to present to primary care and psychiatry services requesting assessment and treatment. For these reasons, the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) thought it timely to hold a consensus conference to review the body of evidence on childhood ADHD and the growing literature on ADHD in older age groups. Much of this initial guidance on managing ADHD in adolescents in transition and in adults is based on expert opinion derived from childhood evidence. We hope that, by the time these guidelines are updated, much evidence will be available to address the many directions for future research that are detailed here.

### Improving the efficacy and effectiveness of evidence-based psychosocial interventions for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents [^111eaMRU]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based treatments for ADHD - an Overview

Multiple groups, committees, and professional organizations have provided the field with recommendations for evidence-based treatment approaches for ADHD. There is clear consensus across these recommendations that pharmacological treatments, notably stimulant medication, psychosocial treatments, and a combination of these two approaches have the strongest evidence base. Table 1 provides a brief overview of the major conclusions of each guideline for the treatment of ADHD in children. It is clearly recommended that families should receive psychoeducation regarding ADHD, and that the evidence-based psychosocial treatments are behavioral parent training (BPT), behavioral interventions in classroom and peer settings, and organizational skills training.

Table 1
Review of practice parameters and treatment guidelines for ADHD.

ADHD attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, FDA food and Drug Administration, PTBM parent training behavior management.

There are inconsistencies among the guidelines that make broad statements of consensus difficult. For instance, there are differences in precision in recommendations for psychosocial treatments, with some very broad in scope compared to others with more precise recommendations regarding particular treatment types (e.g. BPT) and particular populations (e.g. children under six;). Broad suggestions of seeking "psychological" or "educational" treatment is unhelpful in some guidelines and practice parameters, as there are many approaches that fall under this category and some are clearly efficacious whereas other approaches commonly deployed do not have evidence of efficacy for ADHD. There are also differences in the strength of recommendations, with more contemporary guidelines emphasizing multimodal treatments more so than older guidelines. However, perhaps most notably, there is not clear consensus among the recommendations on the best sequence or combination of treatments for ADHD, even though this is a key question for most families pursuing treatment for ADHD. It is also important to note that most guidelines focus on proximal ADHD treatment – as ADHD is now conceptualized as a life-course persistent disorder, treatment efforts will need to be protracted across time and appropriate for evolving developmental levels.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^111orm8m]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, more specifically with respect to pharmacotherapy (indications), AAP 2019 guidelines recommend to offer U.S. FDA-approved medications along with parent training in behavior management and/or behavioral classroom intervention, preferably both, in pediatric patients 6–12 years old (elementary and middle school-aged) with ADHD.

### Practice patterns and guideline adherence in the management of attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^1119GkwF]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Current data are limited on compliance with guidelines for the treatment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Methods

A survey assessing compliance with ADHD guidelines for diagnosis and management was distributed to pediatricians in a practice research network. Comparisons were made by practitioner characteristics.

Results

In all, 42/76 surveys were returned (55%). Respondents largely adhered to American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines. A lower percentage reported compliance for rescreening with a standardized tool (80%), use of electrocardiograms (78% rarely use), and the use of routine additional testing (80% rarely use). Academic practitioners were more likely to rescreen (100% vs 79%, P < .05). Private practitioners more often used newer therapeutic agents (7% vs 44%, P < .01). Older graduates were more comfortable diagnosing at a young age (93% vs 56%, P < .01) and were more comfortable using sleep agents (60% vs 15%, P < .01).

Conclusion

Pediatricians largely adhered to AAP guidelines. These findings support changes made to the guidelines in 2011. Differences in practice patterns exist by practitioner experience, location, and practice type.

### A review of clinical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^117WR9Pv]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances. CPGs have evolved during the last 2 decades from general consensus statements by prominent practitioners in the field to highly structured instruments. The Institute of Medicine has laid out specific standards for selecting the experts who develop a CPG and the process by which CPGs are developed. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been the focus of more than 20 CPGs created by governments and professional societies, both in the United States and internationally. There is a good deal of consensus across these CPGs regarding the principles of the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. Drawing on the rich research base in ADHD, all CPGs emphasize the need for screening, a diagnosis based on history and standardized rating scales, as well as the use of evidence-based psychosocial and pharmacologic treatments. They vary in terms of their emphasis on the role of psychosocial treatment and the degree to which they address comorbid disorders in ADHD. Although limited research has shown ADHG CPGs do change provider practice, there is no research examining if the changes in practice brought about by CPGs impact patient outcomes.

### ADHD: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^114AGWH4]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics ADHD guideline — medication titration and monitoring in primary care states Action statement 6: Primary care clinicians should titrate doses of medication for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to achieve maximum benefit with minimum adverse effects (quality of evidence B/strong recommendation). Because stimulants might produce positive but suboptimal effects at a low dose in some children and youth, titration to maximum doses that control symptoms without adverse effects is recommended instead of titration strictly on a milligram-per-kilogram basis. The findings from the MTA study suggested that more than 70% of children and youth with ADHD respond to one of the stimulant medications at an optimal dose when a systematic trial is used, and stimulant medications can be effectively titrated on a 3- to 7-day basis. Children in the MTA who were treated in the community with care as usual received lower doses of stimulants with less frequent monitoring and had less optimal results. Education of parents is an important component to ensure cooperation in titration, and the primary care clinician should alert parents and children that changing medication dose and occasionally changing a medication type might be necessary, that the process might require a few months to achieve optimal success, and that medication efficacy should be systematically monitored at regular intervals.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^116XBR6j]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

hyperactivity disorder/hyperactivity disorder

ADHD is a childhood onset, neurodevelopmental disorder with genetic and environmental origins characterised by pervasive behavioural symptoms of hyperactivity, inattentiveness and impulsivity that have been present for at least 6 months and adversely impact on daily functioning and development. ADHD is highly prevalent. Research combining data from multiple sources and analysed using meta-regression reported a worldwide-pooled estimate of 5.29–7.2% in children, 2.5% in adults and between 2.8% in older adulthood. Symptoms must persist across the lifespan, although the relative balance and the specific manifestations of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive characteristics vary across individuals, and may change over the course of development, e.g. in particular hyperactive-impulsive symptoms commonly reduce with age.

The diagnostic criteria for ADHD are presented in DSM-5 and the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 11th edition beta, (ICD-11). Whilst the basic symptom criteria did not change from the revision of DSM-IV, DSM-5 increased the typical age of onset to age 12 (previously age 7). The definition of ADHD was expanded to more accurately characterise the experience of adults, and the number of symptoms was relaxed for adults (> 17 years) who are now required to have five or more symptoms that have persisted for at least 6 months in the inattention and/or hyperactive-impulsive domains. For a diagnosis made in childhood, the number of symptoms remained as 6, respectively. Symptoms must be pervasive and interfere with or reduce the quality of social, academic and occupational functioning. They must not be better explained by other conditions, such as intellectual disability. The change in nomenclature from 'subtypes' in DSM-IV to 'presentations' in DSM-5 reflects increasing evidence that symptoms are often fluid within individuals across their lifespan rather than stable traits. The 'presentation' represents the person's current symptomatology which may change over time: For example, in ADHD, inattentiveness may be relatively stable across development, but hyperactivity and impulsiveness often wane with age. Also, importantly, ASD is no longer an exclusion criterion, which is a fundamental change from DSM-IV and this, together with other comorbid conditions, should be noted. The advance preview of ICD-11 was published in June 2018, and this no longer refers to ADHD as hyperkinetic disorder. Other than that, it appears to be essentially similar to DSM-5.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^116jUPyw]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) chronic care management — KAS 4 states that ADHD is a chronic condition; therefore, the PCC should manage children and adolescents with ADHD in the same manner that they would children and youth with special health care needs, following the principles of the chronic care model and the medical home (Table 5), and this is a Grade B: strong recommendation. The rationale provided is that for many individuals, ADHD causes symptoms and dysfunction over long periods of time, even into adulthood, and that available treatments address symptoms and function but are usually not curative.

Stimulant titration and monitoring in pediatric ADHD emphasize individualized dosing and timely follow-up: "it is recommended to titrate from a low dose to one that achieves a maximum, optimal effect in controlling symptoms without adverse effects". "Calculating the dose on the basis of milligrams per kilogram has not usually been helpful because variations in dose have not been found to be related to height or weight". "Stimulant medications can be effectively titrated on a 7-day basis, but in urgent situations, they may be effectively titrated in as few as 3 days". "The PCC should alert parents and children that changing medication dose and occasionally changing a medication may be necessary for optimal medication management, may require a few months to achieve optimal success, and that medication efficacy should be monitored at regular intervals".

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^1177RJDw]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Individuals with co-occurring hyperactivity disorder/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can have complex presentations that may complicate diagnosis and treatment. There are established guidelines with regard to the identification and treatment of ADHD and ASD as independent conditions. However, ADHD and ASD were not formally recognised diagnostically as co-occurring conditions until the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5) was published in 2013. Hence, awareness and understanding of both conditions when they co-occur is less established and there is little guidance in the clinical literature. This has led to uncertainty among healthcare practitioners when working with children, young people and adults who present with co-existing ADHD and ASD. The United Kingdom ADHD Partnership (UKAP) therefore convened a meeting of professional experts that aimed to address this gap and reach expert consensus on the topic that will aid healthcare practitioners and allied professionals when working with this complex and vulnerable population.

Method

UK experts from multiple disciplines in the fields of ADHD and ASD convened in London in December 2017. The meeting provided the opportunity to address the complexities of ADHD and ASD as a co-occurring presentation from different perspectives and included presentations, discussion and group work. The authors considered the clinical challenges of working with this complex group of individuals, producing a consensus for a unified approach when working with male and female, children, adolescents and adults with co-occurring ADHD and ASD. This was written up, circulated and endorsed by all authors.

Results

The authors reached a consensus of practical recommendations for working across the lifespan with males and females with ADHD and ASD. Consensus was reached on topics of (1) identification and assessment using rating scales, clinical diagnostic interviews and objective supporting assessments; outcomes of assessment, including standards of clinical reporting; (2) non-pharmacological interventions and care management, including psychoeducation, carer interventions/carer training, behavioural/environmental and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) approaches; and multi-agency liaison, including educational interventions, career advice, occupational skills and training, and (3) pharmacological treatments.

Conclusions

The guidance and practice recommendations (Tables 1, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 10) will support healthcare practitioners and allied professionals to meet the needs of this complex group from a multidisciplinary perspective. Further research is needed to enhance our understanding of the diagnosis, treatment and management of individuals presenting with comorbid ADHD and ASD.

### ADHD diagnosis and treatment guidelines: a historical perspective [^116RkW44]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral condition and the second most common chronic illness in children. The observance of specific behaviors in multiple settings have remained the most successful method for diagnosing the condition, and although there are differences in specific areas of the brain, and a high heritability estimate (∼76%), they are not diagnostically specific. Medications, and particularly stimulant medication, have undergone rigorous studies to document their efficacy dating back to the 1970s. Likewise, behavioral interventions in the form of parent training and classroom programs have demonstrated robust efficacy during the same time period. Both medication and behavioral interventions are symptomatic treatments. The availability of only symptomatic treatments places ADHD in the same category as other chronic conditions such as diabetes and asthma. Successful treatment of most individuals requires ongoing adherence to the therapy. Improved communication between patients and their families, primary and mental health providers, and school personnel is necessary for effective ADHD treatment. Further enhancement of electronic systems to facilitate family, school, and provider communication can improve monitoring of ADHD symptoms and functional performance. The American Academy of Pediatrics ADHD guidelines were initially developed to help primary care clinicians address the needs of their patients with ADHD and were further refined with the second revision in 2019.

American Academy of Pediatrics ADHD guideline — preschool-aged children (4–5 years of age): For preschool-aged children (4–5 years of age), the primary care clinician should prescribe evidence-based parent- and/or teacher-administered behavior therapy as the first line of treatment (quality of evidence A/strong recommendation) and may prescribe methylphenidate if the behavior interventions do not provide significant improvement and there is moderate-to-severe continuing disturbance in the child's function. In areas in which evidence-based behavioral treatments are not available, the clinician needs to weigh the risks of starting medication at an early age against the harm of delaying diagnosis and treatment (quality of evidence B/recommendation). Aggregate evidence quality: A for behavior; B for methylphenidate. Harms/risks/costs: Both therapies increase the cost of care, and behavior therapy requires a higher level of family involvement, whereas methylphenidate has some potential adverse effects. Benefits-harms assessment: Given the risks of untreated ADHD, the benefits outweigh the risks. Role of patient preferences: Family preference is essential in determining the treatment plan. Strength: strong recommendation.

AHRQ research questions for ADHD diagnosis and treatment — The subcommittee developed research questions for an evidence-based review sponsored by 1 of the Evidence-based Practice Centers of the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ); these questions assessed 4 diagnostic areas and 3 treatment areas on the basis of research published in 2011 through 2016, guided by key clinical questions for children and adolescents 4 to 18 years of age. Diagnostic questions addressed the comparative diagnostic accuracy of approaches usable in primary care or by specialists among children younger than 7 years of age; the comparative diagnostic accuracy of EEG, imaging, or executive function approaches among individuals aged 7 to their 18th birthday; the adverse effects associated with being labeled correctly or incorrectly as having ADHD; and whether more formal neuropsychological, imaging, or genetic tests improve the diagnostic process. Treatment questions addressed the comparative safety and effectiveness of pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic treatments of ADHD; the risk of diversion of pharmacologic treatment; and the comparative safety and effectiveness of different monitoring strategies to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment or changes in ADHD status.

American Academy of Pediatrics ADHD guideline methodology — The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) collaborated with several organizations to develop a working subcommittee, met over a 2-year period, and planned review/revision in 5 years. The diagnostic review was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and evidence evaluation involved AAP, CDC, and University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center staff; treatment-related evidence relied on an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review supplemented by CDC. Diagnostic issues were focused on 5 areas: ADHD prevalence in the general US population aged 21 years or younger and among patients presenting to pediatricians' or family physicians' offices; co-occurring mental disorders with 1 or more specified conditions; functional impairments across domains; whether behavior rating scales remain the standard of care; and the prevalence and diagnostic accuracy of abnormal findings on selected medical screening tests. Treatment issues were focused on 3 areas.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) outlines that ADHD is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders of childhood affecting academic achievement, well-being, and social interactions, and situates this update within prior AAP guidance, which first provided evaluation and diagnosis recommendations in 2000 with treatment recommendations in 2001, and a 2011 revision that included a process of care algorithm (PoCA). Since the release of the 2011 guideline and the revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to the fifth edition, the current revision makes only incremental updates, adds a key action statement related to diagnosis and treatment of comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD, and updates the PoCA to assist in implementing the recommendations. The guideline also notes identification of numerous systemic barriers to adoption and a companion article in the Supplemental Information addressing systemic barriers and presenting recommendations to address those barriers, with this article supporting the recommendations of the clinical practice guideline and PoCA.

AAP Task Force on Mental Health integration — The guideline states its purpose is to support primary care providers in developing alliances with families, preventing and identifying mental health conditions early, and collaborating with mental health clinicians. It notes that diagnosis and management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and youth are particularly challenging in primary care because limited payment and the recommended procedures require more time, including coordination with schools and continuous, coordinated care. The document adds that relegating mental health conditions exclusively to mental health clinicians is not a viable solution due to limited access, that access to psychologists for further cognitive assessment may be limited by education-system availability and third-party payer restrictions, and that cultural differences in ADHD diagnosis and treatment are important, may be more prominent because of family and teacher perceptions, and are beyond the scope of the guideline to detail.

### Treatment strategies for ADHD: an evidence-based guide to select optimal treatment [^112ijMBk]. Molecular Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and impairing disorder affecting children, adolescents, and adults. Several treatment strategies are available that can successfully ameliorate symptoms, ranging from pharmacological to dietary interventions. Due to the increasing range of available options, an informed selection or prioritization of treatments is becoming harder for clinicians. This review aims to provide an evidence-based appraisal of the literature on ADHD treatment, supplemented by expert opinion on plausibility. We outline proposed mechanisms of action of established pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments, and we review targets of novel treatments. The most relevant evidence supporting efficacy and safety of each treatment strategy is discussed. We review the individualized features of the patient that should guide the selection of treatments in a shared decision-making continuum. We provide guidance for optimizing initiation of treatment and follow-up of patients in clinical settings.

ADHD — preschool-aged children: PTBM is the recommended primary intervention for preschool-aged children with ADHD as well as children with ADHD-like behaviors whose diagnosis is not yet verified. Clinicians do not need to have made an ADHD diagnosis before recommending PTBM because PTBM has documented effectiveness with a wide variety of problem behaviors, regardless of etiology, and the intervention's results may inform the subsequent diagnostic evaluation. Clinicians are encouraged to recommend that parents complete PTBM, if available, before assigning an ADHD diagnosis. After behavioral parent training is implemented, the clinician can obtain information from parents and teachers through DSM-5–based ADHD rating scales, and referral to an early intervention program or enrolling in a PTBM program can help provide information about the child's behavior in other settings or with other observers; the evaluators for these programs and/or early childhood special education teachers may be useful observers, as well. When observing symptoms across multiple settings as required by the DSM-5, focused checklists can be used to aid in the diagnostic evaluation.

### Clinical recommendations in current practice guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in adults [^113ABjvw]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder in which approximately two thirds of patients experience impairment in adulthood. Although some adults with ADHD were diagnosed as children, many are first diagnosed as adults. This poses particular challenges given the limited familiarity with ADHD of many adult mental health services. As a result, several organizations, including the Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the National Institutes of Health, and the British Association for Psychopharmacology, have developed practice guidelines for the assessment and treatment of adults with ADHD. This article reviews those guidelines in order to examine current best practices in adult ADHD. There is considerable agreement among these guidelines, which should be a critical part of moving from emerging knowledge to patient care, although both empirical evaluation and ongoing updates as new knowledge emerges will be important for their future development.

### Considerations and evidence for an ADHD outcome measure [^114DqUin]. Academic Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The 2011 American Academy of Pediatrics attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) guideline emphasizes monitoring and measuring outcomes of children diagnosed with ADHD; however, recommendations for how to measure improvement are less clear. A long-term goal was to develop an outcome measure that assesses the quality of care for children with ADHD. As a first step in that process, we conducted a literature synthesis on the efficacy and effectiveness of guideline-recommended ADHD treatments on patient outcomes.

Methods

A literature search was conducted in PubMed according to PRISMA protocol and using MeSH terms. US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria were used to assess the level of evidence. Studies of interest were published after 2002 and assessed prospective ADHD improvement using recommended ADHD treatments.

Results

The systematic review resulted in 35 studies. According to USPSTF criteria, included studies were level I (n = 24), level II-1 (n = 1), and level II-2 (n = 10) and were rated as good (n = 20) or fair (n = 15). DSM-criteria-based rating scales were used most frequently to measure ADHD treatment outcomes. All included treatments resulted in ADHD improvement. Regardless of outcome measure, tool, or treatment type, symptom reduction and improvement were relatively large, with mean percentage reductions ranging from 20% to 86% on ADHD-Behavior Rating Scales scales, with only 1 study with < 25% reduction. Effect sizes ranged from 0.15 to 4.57.

Conclusions

On the basis of this literature review, a consistent pattern of improvement in pediatric ADHD patients' core symptoms emerged across studies, study designs, and recommended treatment approaches. This evidence supports the notion that an improvement of core symptoms within 1 year could satisfy the requirements of an effective outcome measure, which should be further investigated.

ADHD psychosocial treatments — effectiveness and implementation: Some psychosocial treatments for children and adolescents with ADHD have been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of ADHD, including behavioral therapy and training interventions; however, the diversity of interventions and outcome measures makes it challenging to assess a meta-analysis of psychosocial treatment effects alone or with medication, and the long-term positive effects of psychosocial treatments have yet to be determined. Ongoing adherence to psychosocial treatment is a key contributor to its beneficial effects, making implementation of a chronic care model for child health important to ensure sustained adherence, and behavioral therapy involves training adults to influence environmental contingencies to improve behavior in that setting.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111856Kf]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterised by age-inappropriate and impairing levels of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity, or a combination. It is estimated to affect around 5% of school-age children (aged ≤ 18 years)and 2.5% of adults worldwide. Annual incremental costs for ADHD have been estimated at US$143–266 billion in the USAand are substantial in other countries. Available pharmacological treatments for ADHD include psychostimulants (eg, methylphenidate and amphetamines) and non-psychostimulant medications (eg, atomoxetine and α2-agonists). In the past few decades, prescriptions for ADHD drugs have increased significantly both in the USAand other countries. However, even though recommended in clinical guidelines, the efficacy and safety of ADHD medications remains controversial. Furthermore, current guidelines are inconsistent in their treatment recommendations. Although some guidelines rank methylphenidate over amphetamines (eg, in children), others recommend psychostimulants as first-line treatment without any distinction between methylphenidate and amphetamines being made. Additionally, the non-psychostimulant atomoxetine is variously recommended by available guidelines as third-line, second-line, and potentially first-line treatment. The methods used for sequencing these recommendations are not always specified and most commonly — including the 2018 UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines — incorporate national drug licencing regulatory approval and cost-effectiveness with expert opinion in conjunction with the few head-to-head comparisons that are available.

Preschool-aged children with ADHD — medication initiation should follow severity-based criteria and evidence. Before initiating medications, "the physician should assess the severity of the child's ADHD", and "only those preschool-aged children with ADHD who have moderate-to-severe dysfunction should be considered for medication", with severity defined as "symptoms that have persisted for at least 9 months", "dysfunction… in both the home and other settings", and lack of adequate response to behavior therapy; if behavior therapy is insufficient, "medication can be prescribed". For dosing, metabolism is slower "in children 4 through 5 years of age", so "they should be given a lower dose to start" with "smaller increments", and "Maximum doses have not been adequately studied". Regarding agents and evidence, "Dextroamphetamine is the only medication approved by the FDA for use in children younger than 6 years of age", but despite on-label status "does not make it possible to recommend at this time", while most evidence is from methylphenidate: "1 multisite study of 165 children and 10 other smaller single-site studies… (total of 269 children); 7 of the 10 single-site studies found significant efficacy", though its use in preschoolers "remains off-label".

The AAP provides clinical guidance and other resources to assist with the diagnosis and treatment of children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Tools are provided for pediatricians, patients, families and teachers to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the patients functioning and behaviors leading to a proper diagnosis and successful treatment plan. ADHD Overview ADHD is the most common neurobiological disorder in the United States and more than 9 percent of children aged 2–17 receive an ADHD diagnosis during their childhood. Most children diagnosed with ADHD had at least 1 comorbidity and approximately 18 percent had 3 or more. These comorbidities increase the complexity of diagnosis, evaluation and treatment of these children. The majority of care for children with ADHD is provided by their primary care physician, though multiple barriers exist that are impediments to providing excellent ADHD care.

AAP Recommendations In this clinical practice guideline, AAP addresses the challenges in evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of children and adolescents from 4 to 18 years of age. An update of the 2011 guideline, the guideline now includes an additional key action statement to address coexisting and comorbid conditions in children with ADHD. The guideline is accompanied by two additional documents, a process of care algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD and an article on systemic barriers to the care of children and adolescents with ADHD.

Areas for future research — there is a need to conduct research on topics pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in primary care, including assessment of ADHD and its common comorbidities; identification and/or development of reliable primary care instruments to assess functional impairment and monitor improvement; refinement of developmentally informed assessment procedures for evaluating ADHD in preschoolers; study of medications and other therapies used clinically but not FDA approved for ADHD; determination of the optimal schedule for monitoring children and adolescents with ADHD, including factors for adjusting by age, symptom severity, and progress reports; evaluation of the effectiveness and adverse effects of medications used in combination (such as a stimulant with an α-adrenergic agent, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or atomoxetine); evaluation of processes of care to assist PCCs to identify and treat comorbid conditions and of the effectiveness of various school-based interventions; comparisons of medication use and effectiveness across ages, including harms and benefits; development of methods to involve families and improve adherence to psychosocial and medication treatments; and research into psychosocial treatments, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and cognitive training.

### Treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: overview of the evidence [^1115oRQX]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Quality Improvement, Subcommittee on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, reviewed and analyzed the current literature for the purpose of developing an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the treatment of the school-aged child with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This review included several key reports, including an evidence review from the McMaster Evidence-Based Practice Center (supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality), a report from the Canadian Coordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment, the Multimodal Treatment for ADHD comparative clinical trial (supported by the National Institute of Mental Health), and supplemental reviews conducted by the subcommittee. These reviews provided substantial information about different treatments for ADHD and their efficacy in improving certain characteristics or outcomes for children with ADHD as well as adverse effects and benefits of multiple modes of treatment compared with single modes (eg, medication or behavior therapies alone). The reviews also compared the effects of different medications. Other evidence documents the long-term nature of ADHD in children and its classification as a chronic condition, meriting the application of general concepts of chronic-condition management, including an individual treatment plan with a focus on ongoing parent and child education, management, and monitoring. The evidence strongly supports the use of stimulant medications for treating the core symptoms of children with ADHD and, to a lesser degree, for improving functioning. Behavior therapy alone has only limited effect on symptoms or functioning of children with ADHD, although combining behavior therapy with medication seems to improve functioning and may decrease the amount of (stimulant) medication needed. Comparison among stimulants (mainly methylphenidate and amphetamines) did not indicate that 1 class outperformed the other.

### Evidence-based… [^112ymcDL]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

The primary goal of treatment is to minimize the impact of ADHD symptoms on patient function while maximizing the patient's ability to compensate or cope with any remaining difficulties. Not all symptoms can be resolved with treatment; it is important to manage expectations of treatment and to promote a sense of responsibility and personal agency in patients. Overview of Treatment Recommendations for Adults ADHD outlines a general approach to treating ADHD in adults. Briefly, treatment of ADHD in adults includes: Cognitive Component: Focused on identifying and modifying "thinking errors" or "thought distortions" so that the patient's thoughts are more aligned with success and confidence.

Behavioral Component: Involves engineering the environment to be more conducive to concentration and focus, and learning what reinforces and maintains problem behaviors, and constructive behaviors so that constructive changes can be implemented that support the patient's ability to function well. It includes training in skills to promote relaxation and quiet the mind; communication skills training and exposure therapy, which helps a patient, overcome certain fears and avoidance. It also includes behavioral rehearsal, behavioral practice, and role-playing. Metacognitive therapy is as a type of therapy that involves changing how people think rather than what they are thinking about. Metacognitive therapy suggests stepping back from specific thoughts and instead understand one's own thinking style. Changing one's own patterns or style of thinking could have a broad impact on how one manages their life.

In this way, metacognitive therapy is distinct from cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses more on the content of people's thoughts. In people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, problems with metacognition more often encompass difficulty in planning or executing tasks. The goal of metacognitive therapy in ADHD is to improve organization skills, planning, time management, and resolve thinking distortions that lead to negative moods and the perception of limited options. There is no research looking at exercise and adults with ADHD, but there is some research showing improvement of ADHD with exercise on children and adolescents. There is not enough research to conclude what type, intensity, or duration is best. Exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, and should be recommended for both health and possible ADHD benefits. When patients fail to get regular exercise, it could be an indication that ADHD is affecting their organizational skills.

Currently, two classes of FDA-approved medications are used for ADHD treatment: stimulant and non-stimulant. Methylphenidate and amphetamine are the two most commonly used stimulant medications for treatment of ADHD in adults. They both affect dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake in certain parts of the brain and, as a result, increase the amount of these neuro
- transmitters to facilitate brain functioning. While methylphenidate and amphetamine have different mechanisms of action in the brain, they generally have a similar effect in terms of improvement of ADHD symptoms. View a general overview on medication treatments for ADHD and how the medications work. Atomoxetine is currently the only non-stimulant approved by the FDA for the treatment of ADHD in adults. It is a potent selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115fgAZ5]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is 1 of the most common neurobehavioral disorders of childhood and can profoundly affect children's academic achievement, well-being, and social interactions. The American Academy of Pediatrics first published clinical recommendations for evaluation and diagnosis of pediatric ADHD in 2000; recommendations for treatment followed in 2001. The guidelines were revised in 2011 and published with an accompanying process of care algorithm (PoCA) providing discrete and manageable steps by which clinicians could fulfill the clinical guideline's recommendations. Since the release of the 2011 guideline, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has been revised to the fifth edition, and new ADHD-related research has been published. These publications do not support dramatic changes to the previous recommendations. Therefore, only incremental updates have been made in this guideline revision, including the addition of a key action statement related to diagnosis and treatment of comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD. The accompanying process of care algorithm has also been updated to assist in implementing the guideline recommendations. Throughout the process of revising the guideline and algorithm, numerous systemic barriers were identified that restrict and/or hamper pediatric clinicians' ability to adopt their recommendations. Therefore, the subcommittee created a companion article (available in the Supplemental Information) on systemic barriers to the care of children and adolescents with ADHD, which identifies the major systemic-level barriers and presents recommendations to address those barriers; in this article, we support the recommendations of the clinical practice guideline and accompanying process of care algorithm.

### The child with ADHD: using the AAP clinical practice guideline. American Academy of Pediatrics [^115ohTqZ]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics developed an evidence-based clinical practice guideline that provides recommendations for the assessment and diagnosis of school-aged children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This guideline, the first of two guidelines to provide recommendations on this condition, is intended for use by primary care clinicians. The second set of guidelines will address the treatment of children with ADHD. The guideline contains six recommendations for the diagnosis of ADHD: (1) in a child six to 12 years of age who presents with inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, academic underachievement or behavior problems, primary care clinicians should initiate an evaluation for ADHD; (2) the diagnosis of ADHD requires that a child meet the criteria for ADHD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; (3) the assessment of ADHD requires evidence directly obtained from parents or caregivers regarding the core symptoms of ADHD in various settings, the age of onset, duration of symptoms and degree of functional impairment; (4) the assessment of ADHD also requires evidence directly obtained from a teacher (or other school professional) regarding the core symptoms of ADHD, duration of symptoms, degree of functional impairment and associated conditions; (5) evaluation of the child with ADHD should include assessment for coexisting conditions; and (6) other diagnostic tests are not routinely indicated to establish the diagnosis of ADHD but may be used for the assessment of coexisting conditions.

It is also important for PCCs to be aware of health disparities and social determinants and strive to provide culturally appropriate care; the accompanying PoCA provides supplemental implementation support, including use of standardized rating scales to diagnose ADHD, assessing for comorbid conditions, documenting diagnostic and treatment procedures, monitoring treatment and outcomes, and providing families with written management plans.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^117CqHwF]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) epidemiology and comorbidity in children and adolescents — In a national survey, 8.4% of children 2 to 17 years of age currently had ADHD, representing 5.4 million children; among those with current ADHD, almost two-thirds were taking medication, approximately half had received behavioral treatment in the past year, and nearly one quarter had received neither type of treatment of ADHD. The median age of diagnosis was 7 years, with approximately one-third diagnosed before 6 years of age, and more than half were first diagnosed by a PCC, often a pediatrician. Boys are more than twice as likely as girls to receive a diagnosis; as individuals with ADHD enter adolescence, their overt hyperactive and impulsive symptoms tend to decline, whereas their inattentive symptoms tend to persist. Learning and language problems are common comorbid conditions, the majority of both boys and girls meet diagnostic criteria for another mental disorder, boys are more likely to exhibit externalizing conditions like oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, and girls with ADHD are more likely than boys to have a comorbid internalizing condition like anxiety or depression. Although there is a greater risk of receiving a diagnosis of ADHD for children who are the youngest in their class, for most children, retention is not beneficial.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115Wtwrf]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Process of care algorithm (PoCA) and systems barriers — the guideline is supported by 2 accompanying documents, including a PoCA and an article on systemic barriers to care. In this revised guideline and accompanying PoCA, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment are a continuous process, and the PoCA provides recommendations for implementing the guideline steps, although there is less evidence for the PoCA than for the guidelines; the section on evaluating and treating comorbidities has also been expanded. There are many system-level barriers that hamper adoption, and the procedures recommended in this guideline necessitate spending more time, developing a care management system with school and other community stakeholders, and providing continuous, coordinated care. There is some evidence that African American and Latino children are less likely to have ADHD diagnosed and are less likely to be treated for ADHD, and special attention should be given to these populations when assessing comorbidities and when treating ADHD symptoms. Given the nationwide problem of limited access to mental health clinicians, pediatricians and other PCCs are increasingly called on to provide services, and the AAP holds that primary care pediatricians should be prepared to diagnose and manage mild-to-moderate ADHD, anxiety, depression, and problematic substance use, as well as co-manage patients who have more severe conditions with mental health professionals.

Conclusions

The co-occurrence of ADHD and ASD is common, and the presence of both conditions exacerbates difficulties above those experienced by either condition alone. The identification and assessment of ADHD and ASD is complex due to shared aetiologies, overlapping symptoms and shared characteristics. The intervention and management of both conditions is complicated by the core features of both disorders and by co-occurring neurodevelopmental and mental health conditions. These may have a significant impact on engagement, effectiveness and outcomes of both pharmacological and psychological interventions. Neurodevelopmental conditions are often missed in children and adults, especially when they present with high rates of comorbidity that healthcare practitioners are more readily able to recognise, e.g. anxiety and depression. This is further complicated by the change in symptom presentation as young people grow up, with reported decline in hyperactive/impulsive symptoms in ADHD and improved social communication in ASD. These 'improvements' however may be offset by the development of additional mental health problems and associated impairments that persist into adulthood.

Hence, UKAP hosted a meeting of experts in ADHD and ASD from a range of disciplines with the aim of reaching a consensus regarding the most appropriate methods of identifying and assessing co-occurring ADHD and ASD. We further sought to agree the most effective interventions and treatments for ADHD and ASD in children and adults. The consensus recommendations for practice are summarised in Tables 1, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 10.

Barriers to achieving positive outcomes exist within the clinical, social, and educational spheres. These include poor access to care; lack of training for healthcare staff, teachers and allied professionals; inadequate knowledge about female presentation; lack of care coordination and poor inter-agency working; high rates of comorbidity and functional problems that limit the individual's ability to engage effectively with a service; inability of the individual to advocate for themselves; stigma (even within the family); need for age-appropriate psychoeducational initiatives; poor coping strategies and substance misuse issues which may significantly impact on an individual's ability to engage with a service and/or in specific interventions. Unfortunately, some barriers are a result of rigid adherence to the same clinical plan that has been in effect over many years without modifications being made in line with the developments in presentation and needs of the child or adult. A willingness to make changes to accommodate the varied needs of individuals with co-occurring ADHD and ASD over the years will help to eradicate the barriers.

Key points
- The American Academy of Pediatrics has developed a clinical practice guideline that provides recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
- This guideline is based on the best available evidence, and is intended for use by primary care providers, such as pediatricians, family physicians, and other healthcare providers. Diagnosis and evaluation of ADHD The AAP guidelines for diagnosis and evaluation of ADHD recommend that healthcare providers complete these steps:

- Evaluate children and adolescents ages 4 to 18 years for ADHD if they are having academic or behavioral problems and show inattention, A hyperactivity, B or impulsivity. C
- Get reports on the child's symptoms from parents or guardians, school staff, and mental health workers involved with their care, and get information from the child or adolescent as well.
- Use rating scales and other sources to document the symptoms and ensure that DSM-5 criteria have been met.
- Rule out any other possible conditions that can cause similar symptoms.
- Screen for other conditions that might coexist with ADHD, including emotional or behavioral disorders, developmental disorders, and physical conditions.
- Refer children to a specialist if they detect co-occurring conditions that they are not experienced in treating or diagnosing. Treatment recommendations The AAP guidelines for treatment of ADHD recommend that
- Children and adolescents with ADHD should be treated the same as would any other child or adolescent with special healthcare needs, following the principles of the chronic care model and the medical home. Did you know.

AAP treatment guidelines by age group Children ages 4–6 years The first line of treatment should include:

- Parent training in behavior management; and/or
- Behavioral classroom interventions. ADHD medications for children ages 4–6 years Methylphenidate may be used in children 4–6 years of age if behavioral interventions do not provide significant improvementand the child continues to have serious problems. School-age children and adolescents Recommended treatment for children and adolescents includes:

- FDA-approved medications along with
- Parent training in behavior management; and/or
- Behavioral classroom interventions. Treatments often work best when used together. For all children attending school, the school is a necessary part of any treatment plan.

These plans can include:

- Educational interventions; and
- Individual school supports, such as school environment and behavioral supports. School treatment plans often include an Individualized Education Program or a 504 plan that describes accommodations. Healthcare providers supporting children with special healthcare needs Any child or adolescent who is taking medication The AAP guidelines for treatment of ADHD recommend that
- The healthcare provider adjusts the patient's medication dose as needed to achieve the most benefit with the least amount of tolerable side effects.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^116ecRc4]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) guideline conclusions state that evidence is clear with regard to the legitimacy of the diagnosis of ADHD and the appropriate diagnostic criteria and procedures required to establish a diagnosis, identify comorbid conditions, and effectively treat with both psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions. The steps required to sustain appropriate treatments and achieve successful long-term outcomes remain challenging, however. As noted, this clinical practice guideline is supported by 2 accompanying documents available in the Supplemental Information: the process of care algorithm (PoCA) and the article on systemic barriers to the care of children and adolescents with ADHD. Full implementation of the guideline's key action statements (KASs), the PoCA, and the recommendations to address barriers to care may require changes in office procedures and the identification of community resources. The page lists development of standardized and documented tools to help primary care providers identify comorbid conditions; development of effective electronic and Web-based systems to help gather information to diagnose and monitor children and adolescents with ADHD; improvements to systems for communicating with schools, mental health professionals, and other community agencies to provide effective collaborative care; development of more objective measures of performance to more objectively monitor aspects of severity, disability, or impairment; assessment of long-term outcomes for children in whom ADHD was first diagnosed at preschool ages; and identification and implementation of ideas to address the barriers that hamper the implementation of these guidelines and the PoCA.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, with a worldwide population prevalence in epidemiological studies of around 7.2% in children and 2.5% in adults. The diagnosis of ADHD is based on the presence of pervasive, developmentally inappropriate, and impairing levels of hyperactivity, inattentiveness, and impulsivity. When untreated, individuals with ADHD are prone to a wide range of poor outcomes such as defiant, disruptive, and antisocial behaviours, emotional problems, self-harm, substance misuse, educational underachievement and exclusion from school, difficulties with employment and relationships, and criminality. Therefore, timely recognition and appropriate treatment of ADHD are essential to enhance long-term well-beings of individuals with the condition. Current guidelines often recommend a combination of non-pharmacological (e.g. behavioural or cognitive therapy) and pharmacological treatment, depending on the patient's age, levels of impairment, and comorbidities.

### A systematic review and analysis of long-term outcomes in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: effects of treatment and non-treatment [^117NtrnD]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The short-term effect of ADHD treatment on symptoms is well characterized. Beyond this, the longer-term consequences have been the focus of numerous individual studies but comprehensive synthesis of the available data has yet to be conducted, thus the present systematic review was performed, focusing on comprehensive summary of long-term outcomes of ADHD. Short-term studies have demonstrated decreases in core symptoms with pharmacotherapy, but there is less evidence for longer-term benefits. Poor adherence and persistence on therapy, comorbidities, poor follow-up and difficulty in accessing consistent medication management from the healthcare system may contribute to difficulty in measuring long-term effects of medication. Non-pharmacological interventions such as specialized training for parents of children with ADHD and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for adults also reduce symptoms, and a multimodal approach may have greater effect. Both non-pharmacological (that is, psychological, social, and educational) and pharmacological treatments for ADHD are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines with treatment selection depending on the age of the individual and ADHD severity. Recently published European adult guidelines for the treatment of ADHD indicate that both medications and non-pharmacological interventions may be effective for adults with ADHD, although more research specifically in adults is needed.

The importance of long-term studies has been recognized for more than a decade. ADHD treatment guidelines as well as conclusions drawn by health technology assessment agencies recognize that ADHD is potentially a lifelong condition with a profound effect on quality-of-life. Several of these organizations recognize a need for further study of the long-term consequences of ADHD and of its treatment. For example, the NICE guidelines state that 'More research is needed on the influences on eventual outcome, and should include enquiry about the possible benefits (and risks) of early diagnosis and treatment'. Guidelines from the Oregon Health and Science University propose that 'Good-quality evidence on the use of drugs to affect outcomes relating to global academic performance, consequences of risky behaviors, social achievements, etc. is lacking'. Because many studies of long-term outcomes (LTOs) have in fact been conducted, these statements may be more reflective of the quality and variability of data, rather than a lack of ADHD LTO studies. Comprehensive analysis of all available data would therefore be of value, and such an analysis is the purpose of the present review.

### Performance improvement CME: adult ADHD [^1114B9qe]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and is now understood to be a lifelong condition for most individuals. Unfortunately, many adults with ADHD are not being diagnosed, possibly due to insufficient diagnostic criteria, the complex presentation of the disorder, and a reluctance by physicians to diagnose the disorder in adults. Additionally, many of those who have been diagnosed with ADHD do not receive adequate treatment despite the availability of established and effective agents. Performance Improvement CME (PI CME) is an educational activity in which clinicians retrospectively assess their current clinical practice, choose areas for improvement and implement interventions based on treatment guidelines and health care standards, and then re-evaluate their clinical practice to assess the improvements made. This PI CME activity focuses on improving the diagnosis and treatment of adult ADHD.

### Increased prescribing of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder medication and real-world outcomes over time [^112bkwRs]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, affecting approximately 5.3% of youths and 2.5% of adults worldwide. Individuals with ADHD present increased risks for a wide array of psychiatric and somatic conditions, serious functional outcomes, and premature death. This makes the delivery of safe and effective treatments, that improve both the core symptoms and related impairments, a key public health issue. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that ADHD medications are effective in reducing core ADHD symptoms and large observational studies further indicate they are associated with lower risks of real-world outcomes, including injuries, crime, transport crashes, suicide attempts, and unnatural-cause mortality.

Until recent years, in many countries, the administrative prevalence of diagnosed ADHD was much lower than the estimated epidemiological prevalence. However, the diagnosis of ADHD and prescription of ADHD medication has increased substantially worldwide over the last decade. A recent study reported an annual rise of 9.7% in ADHD medication use across 64 countries between 2015 and 2019. Sweden has seen a particularly sharp increase in ADHD medication use over the years. From 2006 to 2020, ADHD medication use in children increased nearly 5-fold, from 0.6% to 2.8%, and more than 10-fold in adults, from 0.1% to 1.3% during this period, positioning Sweden among countries with the highest rates of ADHD medication prescription globally. Similar trends are seen in other European countries. Research suggests that these increases in prescription are not a response to actual increases in ADHD prevalence, but rather reflect changes in diagnostic criteria and the way that these are interpreted, changes in parental perception of impairment, and increased clinician and community awareness of ADHD. These increases in ADHD medication prescriptions have been particularly pronounced in adults and females. In the US, while the overall prevalence in adults receiving ADHD medication increased from 0.5% to 2.0% from 2001 to 2015, the prevalence in women aged 15 to 44 years increased from 0.9% in 2003 to 4.0% in 2015. These significant shifts highlight a critical question: do those receiving ADHD medication today benefit from the treatment in the same way as those who received it a decade ago? Understanding these evolving dynamics is essential for optimizing treatment strategies across diverse patient populations, as well as for informing treatment guidelines and recommendations for both children and adults.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: update on recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^113p8UYm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition with a high societal burden. The present guidelines summarise current literature, generating expert consensus recommendations for the treatment of ADHD in children and adults. These guidelines also provide a review of recent research in the fields of neuroimaging, neuropsychology and genetics of ADHD. Novel discoveries in these areas have informed physiological models for the disease. Since the publication of the previous British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines in 2008, new drugs have been licensed and further compounds are being investigated. The publication of randomised controlled trials of psychological interventions has contributed to the range of treatment options for ADHD. As the disorder has been diagnosed more frequently there has been greater focus on comorbid conditions and how they impact treatment. Services have continued to develop for the treatment of ADHD in adults and care agreements have been introduced to facilitate access to treatment.

### Review of pediatric attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder for the general psychiatrist [^1176M6sc]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and impairing psychiatric condition, affecting significant numbers of children and adolescents. General psychiatrists serve, both by choice and out of necessity, in the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents who have ADHD and in the education of patients and their families. For many clinicians, however, there are numerous unanswered questions regarding the diagnosis and therapeutic interventions for ADHD. This article provides general psychiatrists with a practical overview and update on the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric ADHD. Background information, recent relevant research, current evidence-based practice guidelines, and tips for clinical practice are reviewed in this article. The information is presented in a question-answer format.

Key points
- Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder can often be managed with the right treatment.
- Treatment recommendations vary by age group.
- Types of treatment for ADHD include behavior therapy and medications. My child has been diagnosed with ADHD — Now what. When a child is diagnosed with ADHD, parents often have concerns about which treatment is right for their child. ADHD can often be managed with the right treatment. There are many treatment options, and what works best can depend on the person, their family, and their environment. To find the best options for children, it is recommended that parents work closely with others involved in their child's life — teachers, coaches, and other family members. Treatment types Behavior Therapy
- Behavior therapy, including training for parents; and Medications
- Stimulants
- Non-stimulants.

Treatment recommendations By Age Group For children with ADHD younger than 6 years of age, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends parent training in behavior management as the first line of treatment, before medication is tried. For children 6 years of age and older, the recommendations include medication and behavior therapy together — parent training in behavior management for children up to age 12 and other types of behavior therapy and training for adolescents. Schools can be part of the treatment as well. AAP recommendations also include adding behavioral classroom intervention and school supports. Learn more about how the school environment can be part of treatment. Good treatment plans will include close monitoring of whether and how much the treatment helps the child's behavior, as well as making changes as needed along the way.

ADHD treatment recommendations Behavior therapy, including training for parents ADHD affects not only a child's ability to pay attention or sit still at school, but it also affects relationships with family and other children. Children with ADHD often show behaviors that can be very disruptive to others. Behavior therapy is a treatment option that can help reduce these behaviors and can help increase self-regulation skills. it is often helpful to start behavior therapy as soon as a diagnosis is made. Behavior therapy overview for parents Behavior therapy is an important part of treatment for children with ADHD. Behavior therapy for children The goals of behavior therapy are to learn or strengthen positive behaviors and eliminate unwanted or problem behaviors. Behavior therapy for ADHD can include
- Parent training in behavior management
- Behavior therapy with children
- Behavioral interventions in the classroom These approaches can also be used together.

For children who attend early childhood programs, it is usually most effective if parents and educators work together to help the child. The following are suggestions that may help with your child's behavior: Sample suggestions Create a routine. Manage distractions. Limit choices. Be clear and specific when you talk with your child. Help your child plan. Use goals and praise or other rewards. Discipline effectively. Create positive opportunities. Provide a healthy lifestyle. Children younger than 6 years of age For young children with ADHD, behavior therapy is an important first step before trying medication because:

- Parent training in behavior management gives parents the skills and strategies to help their child.
- Parent training in behavior management has been shown to work as well as medication for ADHD in young children.
- Young children have more side effects from ADHD medications than older children.

### ADHD treatment recommendations | CDC… [^112NzQds]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

ADHD Treatment Recommendations The American Academy of Pediatrics published a clinical practice guideline that provides recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This guideline is based on the best available evidence, and is intended for use by primary care providers, such as pediatricians, family physicians, and other healthcare providers. Diagnosis and Evaluation of ADHD The AAP guidelines for diagnosis and evaluation of ADHD recommend that primary care providers complete these steps:

- Evaluate children and adolescents ages 4 to 18 years for ADHD if they are having academic or behavioral problems and show inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity.
- Get reports on the child's symptoms from parents or guardians, school staff, and mental health workers involved with their care, and get information from the child or adolescent as well.
- Use rating scales and other sources to document the symptoms and ensure that DSM-5 criteria have been met.
- Rule out any other possible conditions that can cause similar symptoms.
- Screen for other conditions that might coexist with ADHD, including emotional or behavioral disorders, developmental disorders, and physical conditions.
- Refer children to a specialist if they detect co-occurring conditions that they are not experienced in treating or diagnosing. Read more about this recommendation. The behavior therapy with best evidence with young children with ADHD is Parent Training in Behavior Management.

Treatment The AAP guidelines for treatment of ADHD recommend: Children and adolescents with ADHD should be treated the same as would any other child or adolescent with special healthcare needs, following the principles of the chronic care model and the medical home. Children ages 4–6 years
- The first line of treatment should include
- Parent training in behavior management; and/or
- Behavioral classroom interventions.
- Methylphenidate may be used if behavioral interventions do not provide significant improvement and the child continues to have serious problems. Children and adolescents 6–18 years Recommended treatment for children and adolescents includes
- FDA-approved medications along with
- Parent training in behavior management and/or
- Behavioral classroom interventions. Treatments often work best when used together. For all children attending school, the school is a necessary part of any treatment plan.

These plans can include
- Educational interventions; and
- Individual school supports, such as school environment and behavioral supports. School treatment plans often include an Individualized Education Program or a 504 plan that describes accommodations. Any child or adolescent who is taking medication The AAP guidelines for treatment of ADHD recommend that
- The primary care provider adjusts the patient's medication dose as needed to achieve the most benefit with the least amount of tolerable side effects.
- For adolescents, medications should be used with patient approval. Read more about this recommendation. Read more about the role of healthcare providers in assisting children with special needs.

### Clinical practice guideline: treatment of the school-aged child with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^116aJsSB]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This guideline, the second in a set of policies on this condition, is intended for use by clinicians working in primary care settings. The initiation of treatment requires the accurate establishment of a diagnosis of ADHD; the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) clinical practice guideline on diagnosis of children with ADHD(1) provides direction in appropriately diagnosing this disorder. The AAP Committee on Quality Improvement selected a subcommittee composed of primary care and developmental-behavioral pediatricians and other experts in the fields of neurology, psychology, child psychiatry, education, family practice, and epidemiology. The subcommittee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Evidence-based Practice Center at McMaster University, Ontario, Canada, to develop the evidence base of literature on this topic.(2) The resulting systematic review, along with other major studies in this area, was used to formulate recommendations for treatment of children with ADHD. The subcommittee also reviewed the multimodal treatment study of children with ADHD(3) and the Canadian Coordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment report (CCOHTA).(4) Subcommittee decisions were made by consensus where definitive evidence was not available. The subcommittee report underwent extensive review by sections and committees of the AAP as well as by numerous external organizations before approval from the AAP Board of Directors. The guideline contains the following recommendations for the treatment of a child diagnosed with ADHD:

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115BfU5i]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ADHD KAS 5a — preschool-aged children (age 4 years to the sixth birthday) with ADHD: The PCC should prescribe evidence-based behavioral parent training in behavior management (PTBM) and/or behavioral classroom interventions as the first line of treatment, if available (grade A: strong recommendation); methylphenidate may be considered if these behavioral interventions do not provide significant improvement and there is moderate-to-severe continued disturbance in functioning, and where behavioral treatments are unavailable the clinician needs to weigh the risks of starting medication before the age of 6 years against the harm of delaying diagnosis and treatment (grade B: strong recommendation). Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A for PTBM and Grade B for methylphenidate with a strong recommendation, family preference is essential in determining the treatment plan, both therapies increase cost and PTBM requires high family involvement whereas methylphenidate has some potential adverse effects, both PTBM and methylphenidate have relatively low risks and initiating treatment at an early age has additional benefits, and other stimulant or nonstimulant medications have not been adequately studied in this age group.

### ADHD: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^112gBHf8]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Preschool-aged ADHD treatment (ages 4–5 years) — behavioral therapy and medication considerations — are summarized: A number of special circumstances support the recommendation to initiate ADHD treatment in preschool-aged children (ages 4–5 years) with behavioral therapy alone first; the multisite study of methylphenidate was limited to preschool-aged children who had moderate-to-severe dysfunction, and many children (ages 4–5 years) experience improvements in symptoms with behavior therapy alone with overall evidence for behavior therapy in preschool-aged children described as strong. Behavioral programs for children 4 to 5 years of age typically run as group parent-training programs and have a lower cost. Many young children with ADHD might still require medication, medication is not contraindicated for children 4 through 5 years of age, and only 1 multisite study has carefully assessed medication use in preschool-aged children.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbidity screening — KAS 3 directs that, in the evaluation of a child or adolescent for ADHD, the PCC should include a process to at least screen for comorbid conditions, including emotional or behavioral conditions (eg, anxiety, depression, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorders, substance use), developmental conditions (eg, learning and language disorders, autism spectrum disorders), and physical conditions (eg, tics, sleep apnea), with a Grade B: strong recommendation. The table classifies aggregate evidence quality as Grade B and strength as Strong recommendation, noting benefits that identifying comorbid conditions is important in developing the most appropriate treatment plan, risks that the major risk is misdiagnosing the comorbid condition(s) and providing inappropriate care, and an assessment that there is a preponderance of benefits over harm. The page also states that the majority of both boys and girls with ADHD also meet diagnostic criteria for another mental disorder and that in some cases, the presence of a comorbid condition will alter the treatment of ADHD.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^113SMVrN]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) guideline scope and updates — the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guideline addresses the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD in children from age 4 years to their 18th birthday. For this document, preschool-aged refers to children from age 4 years to the sixth birthday. Pediatricians and other primary care clinicians may continue to provide care after 18 years of age, but care beyond this age was not studied for this guideline. Since 2011 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), was released; the new research and DSM-5 do not support dramatic changes, so this guideline includes only incremental updates and adds a key action statement about the diagnosis and treatment of coexisting or comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD.

### ADHD: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115pr2YH]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) — coexisting conditions assessment and referral: A variety of other behavioral, developmental, and physical conditions can coexist in children who are evaluated for ADHD, including learning problems, language disorder, disruptive behavior, anxiety, mood disorders, tic disorders, seizures, developmental coordination disorder, or sleep disorders. Given this likelihood, primary care clinicians should conduct assessments that determine or at least identify the risk of coexisting conditions, and the primary care clinician might benefit from additional support and guidance or might need to refer a child with ADHD and coexisting conditions to subspecialists for assessment and management; the subspecialists could include child psychiatrists, developmental-behavioral pediatricians, neurodevelopmental disability physicians, child neurologists, or child or school psychologists. The AAP has developed algorithms and a toolkit for assessing and treating (or comanaging) common developmental disorders and mental health concerns in children. Aggregate evidence quality is B with strength stated as strong recommendation; benefits note that identifying coexisting conditions is important for developing the most appropriate treatment plan, harms/risks/costs note that the major risk is misdiagnosing the conditions and providing inappropriate care, and the benefits-harms assessment states there is a preponderance of benefit over harm.

### Components of cognitive-behavioural therapy for mitigating core symptoms in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analys [^112fnJPV]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Background

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity due to impairment of brain functions. People with ADHD experience various challenges in both childhood and adulthood, which can adversely affect various aspects of daily life stability, maintenance of interpersonal relationships and career development.

The current evidence-based guidelines for ADHD treatment recommend physiological approaches such as pharmacological interventions; although these can improve inhibitory function to some extent, complete remission is rare, and the core symptoms of ADHD persist even with physiological treatment in most cases. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline also recommends psychotherapy, especially cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) which has been reported to be effective in improving the core symptoms of ADHD.

CBT is a complex intervention that includes various cognitive and behavioural components, and therapists assess the symptoms and characteristics of each patient individually and prescribe CBT techniques to address their problems accordingly. Thus, determining which CBT components are beneficial or which ones are detrimental for ADHD is crucial for optimising treatment. However, discussions regarding which components of CBT are more effective or potentially harmful in the context of the diverse challenges associated with ADHD have not progressed appreciably.
