## Question

A patient describes feeling extreme anxiety due to events with a girl that he likes.

The girl had shown positive signs of interest, and the student was going to ask her out. The student says that he stressed before then, but nothing significant. However, the girl had told him that she was starting to date someone else, which drastically increased his general anxiety. She said that she found this date "boring" and said she thought "it wasn't going anywhere". However, recently she went on a second date, and that drastically increased the patients stress.

The patient describes being very distracted by the thought of this even during work, and often having an elevated heart rate, and feeling restless. The patient sometimes has difficulty sleeping, wakes up in the middle of the night in sweat, and wakes up very early unable to go back to bed.

The patient has no diagnosed history of mental illness, anxiety, or depression. What should the patient do, and what other info is needed?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the patient should do about anxiety symptoms triggered by romantic rejection and what additional information is needed to guide care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic formulation and whether this meets criteria for an anxiety disorder. Then, I should verify severity and functional impairment. Next, I will consider differential diagnoses and comorbidities. After that, I need to outline immediate, evidence-based interventions and when to consider medication. Finally, I should specify what additional information is needed and how to monitor progress, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic formulation. The patient has prominent worry, autonomic hyperarousal (elevated heart rate, restlessness, sweating), sleep disturbance with middle and terminal insomnia, and concentration impairment, persisting beyond two weeks and causing functional interference at work. This pattern is consistent with generalized anxiety disorder, and the timing after a stressor fits an adjustment disorder with anxious features, though I should not jump to conclusions without confirming duration and exclusion criteria.

> Wait, let me verify severity and functional impact. The symptoms are distressing, intrusive, and impairing work performance, which supports at least moderate severity. I should also screen for avoidance behaviors, because avoidance reinforces anxiety and predicts worse outcomes, and I need to check for comorbid depression and substance use, which are common and can shape treatment choice [^113GmhGZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I initially thought this might be social anxiety disorder given the interpersonal trigger, but I should double-check: SAD typically involves fear of negative evaluation in social or performance situations with marked avoidance, whereas here the core is worry about a specific relationship outcome and broader autonomic arousal, which aligns better with GAD or adjustment disorder. I should confirm the absence of panic attacks, obsessions/compulsions, and trauma exposure to exclude PD, OCD, and PTSD respectively [^114akfGQ] [^111PE4DV].

> Next, I should review immediate, evidence-based interventions. For mild-to-moderate anxiety, CBT is first-line and can be delivered individually or in groups. Given the functional impairment, I would prioritize CBT now rather than watchful waiting, and I would pair this with sleep hygiene and stress-reduction strategies to prevent chronicity. If access is limited, I would consider guided self-help CBT or digital CBT programs as acceptable alternatives [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I address medication judiciously. For short-term relief of severe anxiety or insomnia, a time-limited course of a benzodiazepine can be considered, but I should confirm no substance use disorder, respiratory disease, or concurrent CNS depressants, and I must plan a strict taper to avoid dependence. Buspirone is a non-benzodiazepine option for GAD that avoids dependence risk, though it is less effective for acute severe anxiety, and I should set expectations about onset and monitor for side effects [^116rQP9z] [^114caqSx].

> Let me consider what additional information is essential. I should confirm the exact timeline of symptoms relative to the stressor, quantify functional impairment at work and socially, screen for depression with PHQ-9 and anxiety with GAD-7, assess suicide risk, and ask about substance use, caffeine, and sleep habits. I also need to check for prior anxiety episodes, family history of anxiety or depression, and any medical conditions or medications that could mimic anxiety, because these factors influence diagnosis, treatment selection, and monitoring cadence [^notfound].

> I should double-check the monitoring plan. Weekly check-ins for the first month to track symptoms, sleep, functioning, and treatment engagement are reasonable, then spacing out as stability improves. I will reassess diagnosis if symptoms persist beyond six months or if new features emerge, and I will monitor for benzodiazepine dependence if used, employing a slow, individualized taper when discontinuing [^117WZCH8].

> But wait, what if symptoms are actually subsyndromal and will remit spontaneously? Even then, early CBT can prevent chronicity and teach coping skills, and for insomnia, CBT-I is preferred to medication when feasible. I should align choices with patient preference and readiness to change, using shared decision-making to set goals and expectations [^112ijTwy].

> In summary, I recommend initiating CBT now, implementing sleep hygiene and stress management, and reserving short-term medication for severe distress or insomnia with a clear exit plan. I will screen comprehensively for comorbidities and risk factors, and I will monitor closely to ensure improvement and adjust the plan as needed, documenting functional outcomes and patient-reported progress at each visit [^112ijTwy].

This patient is experiencing **situational anxiety** with autonomic symptoms and sleep disturbance triggered by romantic uncertainty. The most appropriate next step is to **confirm the diagnosis and severity** using standardized screens (GAD-7, PHQ-9, and a suicide risk assessment) and to **start CBT-based strategies** for anxiety and sleep, with mindfulness and activity scheduling, while avoiding benzodiazepines unless symptoms are severe and short-term. If symptoms persist beyond 6 weeks or cause significant impairment, consider a short course of buspirone or an SSRI, and refer to mental health for CBT. Additional information needed includes onset/duration, functional impact, prior anxiety/depression, substance use, medical conditions, and support system.

---

## Clinical assessment and diagnosis

- **Diagnostic criteria**: The patient's symptoms align with situational anxiety or adjustment disorder with anxious features, characterized by excessive worry, autonomic arousal, and sleep disturbance triggered by a specific stressor (romantic uncertainty) [^1154zumc].

- **Differential diagnosis**: Rule out generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), panic disorder, and major depressive disorder (MDD) based on duration, triggers, and symptom pattern [^114akfGQ].

- **Severity assessment**: Use the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale to quantify severity and monitor progress [^notfound].

---

## Immediate clinical recommendations

### Non-pharmacological interventions (first-line)

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: CBT is the gold standard for anxiety disorders, focusing on identifying and challenging maladaptive thoughts, reducing avoidance, and developing coping strategies [^111ekqrb].

- **Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)**: Mindfulness meditation and acceptance strategies can reduce anxiety and improve emotional regulation [^notfound].

- **Sleep hygiene**: Establish a consistent sleep schedule, limit caffeine, avoid screens before bedtime, and use relaxation techniques to improve sleep quality [^notfound].

- **Activity scheduling**: Encourage regular physical activity and social engagement to reduce rumination and improve mood [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacological interventions (if symptoms persist or are severe)

- **Buspirone**: A non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic effective for generalized anxiety symptoms, with minimal risk of dependence or withdrawal [^114caqSx].

- **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)**: Consider SSRIs (e.g. sertraline, escitalopram) if symptoms persist beyond 6 weeks or cause significant impairment. Monitor for side effects and response [^notfound].

- **Benzodiazepines**: Avoid routine use due to risks of dependence, withdrawal, and cognitive impairment. Reserve for short-term, severe anxiety with careful monitoring [^113JPZFd].

---

## Additional information needed

To refine diagnosis and guide treatment, obtain the following:

| **Information category** | **Specific details needed** |
|-|-|
| Symptom timeline | - Onset <br/> - Duration <br/> - Course (worsening/improving) |
| Functional impact | - Work performance <br/> - Social functioning <br/> - Daily activities |
| Prior psychiatric history | - Previous anxiety/depression <br/> - Treatment history <br/> - Response |
| Medical history | - Chronic illnesses <br/> - Medications <br/> - Substance use |
| Support system | - Family <br/> - Friends <br/> - Social support |
| Stressors | - Academic/work stress <br/> - Family issues <br/> - Financial stress |

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Arrange **regular follow-up** (every 2–4 weeks initially) to monitor symptoms, functioning, and treatment adherence, and use **standardized scales** (GAD-7, PHQ-9) to track progress and adjust treatment as needed [^116MCM1j]. Educate the patient about anxiety, coping strategies, and when to seek help, and coordinate care with mental health professionals if symptoms persist or worsen.

---

## Conclusion

The patient is experiencing **situational anxiety** with autonomic symptoms and sleep disturbance. Confirm the diagnosis and severity with standardized screens, initiate CBT-based strategies, and reserve medication for persistent or severe symptoms. Gather additional information to tailor care and monitor progress with regular follow-up.

### Semantic clinical artificial intelligence vs native large language model performance on the USMLE [^115L7b3i]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

USMLE Input Prompt

The following is a sample input prompt for the USMLE(a second example is given in the eAppendix in Supplement 1):

A 24-year-old recent college graduate comes to the office because of a 3-year history of increased frequency of urination and occasional incontinence whenever she travels. She says the urinary symptoms typically begin a few days before she is going to fly and they stop the day after she arrives at her destination. She says she is anxious about flying. She reports having had similar but milder symptoms prior to examinations before graduating. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Urinalysis and urine culture are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step? (A) Recommend behavioral therapy, (B) Recommend psychoanalytic psychotherapy, (C) Recommend that the patient avoid any stressful activities that cause the problem, (D) Review the patient's sexual history, or (E) Reassure the patient that her symptoms will resolve in time.

Native 13B Incorrect Answer

The native 13B model provided the following incorrect answer and justification:

Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be: (E) Reassure the patient that her symptoms will resolve in time. The patient's symptoms of increased frequency of urination and occasional incontinence are likely related to her anxiety about flying, as they occur only before and during travel. The fact that the symptoms resolve after the patient arrives at her destination suggests that they are related to stress and anxiety rather than a physical condition. Recommending behavioral therapy (A) or psychoanalytic psychotherapy (B) may be appropriate in the long term, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time. Recommending that the patient avoid stressful activities (C) may also be a viable option, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Reviewing the patient's sexual history (D) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms and would not be an appropriate next step. Therefore, the best option is to reassure the patient that her symptoms will resolve in time and provide her with support and resources to manage her anxiety.

### Treatment principles in adults and development of patient-reported outcomes in cyclic vomiting syndrome [^112jAijC]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

2.9.2 Development ofspecific to

Methods and applications of PRO/COA have been fast evolving in recent years (e.g. the FDA's PFDD guidance documents #1–#4), which outline key aspects and steps (e.g. a general roadmap to patient‐focused outcome measurement shown in Figure 2) to understand the effects of treatment in clinical trials, taking into account the condition of interest and the desired outcomes from the patient perspective, and incorporating this knowledge into the selection, adaptation, or development of appropriate endpoints reflective of outcomes meaningful and important to patients. It means that in the context of CVS, disease‐specific PROs need to demonstrate validity and responsiveness for the intervention in the context in question in accordance with good research practices.

FIGURE 2
FDA's roadmap to patient‐focused outcome measurement in clinical trials. US FDA, "Patient‐Focused Drug Development: Selecting, Developing, or Modifying Fit‐for‐Purpose Clinical Outcome Assessments", Guidance for Industry, Food and Drug Administration Staff, and Other Stakeholder.

The development of CVS‐specific PRO measures has evolved recently and shown initial evidence in a few studies. For example, a study on concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing by interviews with adult and pediatric patients was conducted to identify CVS cardinal symptoms and to understand their impact on patients. As the concepts of interest may change over time of development, these interviews with as many relevant patient/caregiver groups as possible/feasible are to identify those issues that are most important to all patients. Furthermore, insights from medical experts experienced in treating patients with CVS to understand relevant signs/symptoms are critical. Another study used social media netnography to identify and gain a comprehensive understanding of patient experiences (e.g. impact on physical, mental, and social health) based on "unfiltered" social media posts. More recently, the in‐depth understanding of longitudinal patient experience was investigated in a 6‐month prospective, non‐interventional, decentralized study among adults with CVS using electronic daily diaries. The study tested the concepts related to CVS episodes based on the clinical guideline criteria generated from consensus, and the results show marked heterogeneity of CVS episodes and highlight the need to better define and characterize episodes in patients with CVS.

Third, the possible need for psychosocial support is emphasised. The anxieties of living with risk of a future chronic condition have been previously outlined; and while early detection and management may bring many benefits, these benefits can be reduced or in some cases outweighed if the result causes significant distress, has a negative impact on parenting and/or relationships, or triggers unhelpful coping strategies such as adoption of disordered eating behaviours or pursuit of potentially untested and unsafe 'cures'. Patients and parents with pre‐existing difficulties with anxiety and or/depression who may be more vulnerable to experiencing difficulties adapting to and living with the knowledge of future illness may need extra support. Similarly, appropriate referral for clinical psychology for assessment and support will be an important part of the care we provide for these patients; which has significant implications for workforce given the difficulties already encountered across services in meeting the needs of people with established diabetes.

Fourth, the guidance highlights the need for further research, particularly in adults where the natural history of T1D not well understood. All interested people with early T1D should be offered trial participation. In the UK, we have the UK T1D Consortia with a clinical trial finder and the latest information in T1D research. We are also due to have a registry for all children and adults with one or more islet autoantibodies — one role is to be able contact individuals about suitable trials.

We have previously been aware of people with early‐stage T1D before the need for insulin. Many of them have historically been identified and followed up through research studies, but as a recognition of these stages and as screening programmes increase, we need to be adept at managing them in clinical care. We believe these guidelines will facilitate equitable care across the different geographical and demographic population of the UK.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^113zNTUq]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Behavioral and mental health considerations in tinnitus — Work Group directives — state that "When behavioral/mental health concerns are suspected, the Work Group recommends that providers discuss the biopsychosocial factors that can contribute to tinnitus and related functioning". The guideline further states, "Providers should also assess the patient's interest in pursuing behavioral health treatment to address tinnitus-related distress or mental health symptoms that might contribute to or exacerbate their tinnitus". It notes that "Validated behavioral health screening questionnaires, as outlined in Table E-2 below, have also been used to screen for specific concerns", and that "As with any questionnaire, results do not necessarily indicate a need for further services but should be combined with overall patient concerns and desire for further services, unless specifically outlined in policy (e.g., for concerns related to suicide)". The page adds, "One way to assess a patient's interest in pursuing a referral to such services is to include language, such as the following, on intake packets or within the clinical assessment", followed by suggested phrasing: "For many people, stress and mood concerns can contribute to their tinnitus symptoms, and treatment for those concerns can help to optimize health and reduce symptoms. Are you interested in hearing more about a potential referral for behavioral health?"

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^114LPDP9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Patient safety during tapering without consent — communication, documentation, and monitoring steps include that when initiating a taper without a patient's consent, clinicians should carefully explain the reasons for their decision to the patient and their care partners, if applicable, and clinicians should also carefully document the rationale for initiating the taper and related discussions. Clinicians should then explain to patients that their next prescription will be at a lower dose and describe how they will monitor and manage patient symptoms and concerns during the tapering process, and the tapering process should be patient-centered. It is important for clinicians to closely monitor a patient's response to the taper and adjust the strategy as appropriate. Clinicians should be mindful of any potential bias when initiating a taper against a patient's wishes, and if clinicians and patients and their care partners continue to disagree on the need for a taper after this discussion, clinicians may consider referral for a second opinion. The CGC noted that some patients may become aggressive, threaten legal action, or suggest that progressing with the taper may lead them to suicide, and the CGC recommends that healthcare systems have established policies and procedures to guide clinicians in their response to these situations in ways that are responsive to a patient's needs and supports ready access to risk management services.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1164VNik]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Many patients with psychiatric disorders are able to taper from BZDs in outpatient settings, but some may require a more intensive level of care. BZD tapering may exacerbate or cause recurrence of psychiatric symptoms that may warrant more intensive clinical oversight. Clinicians should consider any underlying psychiatric conditions and relevant treatment history, prior to beginning a BZD taper. Clinicians can consider using the LOCUS for guidance determining the appropriate treatment setting for patients with psychiatric disorders (see Box 9).

Box 9 Level of Care Utilization System: Levels of Care

For more information, see

Patients who have used BZDs for a long time may be reluctant to taper the medication due to fear of experiencing adverse effects related to discontinuation. As BZD tapering can lead to rebound psychiatric symptoms (e.g. anxiety, insomnia), clinicians should optimize evidence-based treatments for any co-occurring psychiatric disorders prior to initiating a BZD taper or concurrently if clinically indicated (e.g. due to significant imminent risks related to continued BZD use). Non-BZD therapies such as SSRIs, CBT, and other evidence-based interventions may be appropriate alternatives to BZD for many patients (see Appendix 4). – Clinicians should also consider evidence-based suicide screening such as the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) or Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ) tool for patients at risk.

Clinicians should educate patients regarding potential rebound psychiatric symptoms and how they will be managed and offer or refer for appropriate mental health services. As discussed in the " Adjunctive Interventions During the Tapering Process ", providing behavioral interventions during the BZD taper is associated with successful discontinuation of BZD. –

Patients with PTSD

The VA recommends that clinicians avoid prescribing BZDs to patients with symptoms of PTSD and provides guidance on alternative treatments for management of anxiety and insomnia in these patients.BZDs are ineffective for the treatment of PTSD; they do not reduce the core symptoms of PTSD or improve PTSD-related sleep dysfunction. BZD use is associated with an increased risk of substance use, depression, and aggression; increased PTSD severity; and decreased efficacy of trauma-focused psychotherapy. When tapering BZD in patients with PTSD, clinicians should consider that withdrawal from BZDs can worsen existing PTSD symptoms (e.g. increased anxiety, rage, increased nightmares, intrusive thoughts, hyperalertness). The CGC noted that clinicians can consider consulting with psychiatric specialists to develop a tapering strategy that minimizes these risks.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114v7Gmk]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to screening for anxiety and depression, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider screening for anxiety symptoms in patients with diabetes. Consider discussing diabetes-related worries and referring to a qualified behavioral professional for further assessment and treatment if anxiety symptoms indicate interference with diabetes self-management behaviors or QoL.

### Lorazepam [^116rQP9z]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Lorazepam is indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety or anxiety associated with depressive symptoms. Anxiety or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic.

The effectiveness of lorazepam in long-term use, that is, more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

### Updates and future perspectives on neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease [^113M2G2X]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Elucidating the underlying neurobiology of NPS, and how this impacts AD risk, has garnered substantial interest as it provides insights into novel biological markers and mechanisms that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention. Recent evidence provides continued support for the association between AD‐specific markers and the presence and severity of NPS, reiterating that the presence of NPS is a marker of AD risk and disease progression. However, the intersection between neurobiology and health disparities and how this relates to NPS and MBI has not been thoroughly investigated. Future studies should investigate how disparities intersect with sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status when investigating the neurobiology of NPS. These studies would inform how our understanding of the neurobiology of NPS is generalizable or unique based on underlying disparity, which would inform the conduct of future research studies and clinical trials, and ensure that evidence is interpreted appropriately.

COVID‐19 has undoubtedly impacted patients, caregivers, and the health‐care system. Specifically, patients have experienced increased presence and severity of NPS, which have increased the associated burden on caregivers. Furthermore, with increased psychotropic use, not only is the health‐care system experiencing an increased economic burden but patients are subjected to adverse effects associated with polypharmacy. Therefore, knowledge users are encouraged to review the evidence of studies conducted during COVID‐19 appropriately, understanding that NPS are likely more prevalent and more severe compared to studies conducted prior to COVID‐19. Of importance, the long‐term effects of COVID‐19 on the trajectory of NPS in patients with AD remain largely unexplored. Investigating the longitudinal effects of long COVID on NPS in AD is essential for informing post‐pandemic care and developing strategies that can be integrated into clinical frameworks for potential future health crises.

Recent clinical trials for the management of NPS are a necessary critical step to improving the lives of patients with underlying NPS. As currently approved pharmacological treatments for the management of NPS have high‐risk safety profiles and modest efficacy, the investigation of novel therapeutic agents addresses a high unmet clinical need for patients with NPS. In addition to studies investigating the safety and efficacy of novel agents for the management of NPS, future studies are encouraged to investigate the efficacy of non‐pharmacological intervention for NPS, which could be implemented prior to the initiation of psychotropics, or in combination with psychotropics. Future trials are also encouraged to use appropriate diagnostic tools and assessments to optimize patient enrichment and monitoring of treatment response.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^116YR1UV]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Psychosocial issues in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) — Anxiety and depression are highly prevalent and are reported by > 60% of those with ADPKD, with identified independent risk factors including female sex, increased kidney size, progression to kidney failure, and loss of a first-degree relative with ADPKD; the occurrence of anxiety over an uncertain future should be anticipated in young people before and after presymptomatic testing and/or diagnosis, and healthcare providers may underestimate and overlook psychological issues especially in early stages; problems can manifest as nonspecific somatic symptoms and symptoms such as abdominal distension, sleep disturbances, and pain impact overall quality of life, so some may need psychological interventions and/or referral to social care services and healthcare providers should consider working with accredited psychology or psychiatry providers and healthcare teams should be aware of psychological support needs in different stages of life.

Approach to care in the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense — patient-centered care emphasizes a patient-centered, whole/holistic health approach with individualized, evidence-based care and communication tailored to needs. VA/DoD clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) "encourage providers to use a patient-centered, whole/holistic health approach (i.e., individualized treatment based on patient needs, characteristics, and preferences)". This approach "aims to treat the particular condition while also optimizing the individual's overall health and wellbeing". The guideline states that "all patients should have access to individualized evidence-based care", and notes patient-centered care "can decrease patient anxiety, increase trust in providers, and improve treatment adherence". It adds that a whole/holistic health approach "empowers and equips individuals to meet their personal health and wellbeing goals", and that "good communication is essential and should be supported by evidence-based information tailored to each patient's needs". An "empathetic and non-judgmental approach" is described as facilitating "discussions sensitive to sex, culture, ethnicity, and other differences".

### Donanemab: appropriate use recommendations [^116TY27K]. The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). High credibility.

Donanemab infusion-related reactions — incidence and management — are described with specific rates and actions. In TRAILBLAZER-ALZ2, infusion-related reactions occurred in 8% compared to 0.5% with placebo, reactions typically developed within 30 min with 70% within the first 4 infusions, and in the phase 3 trial 57% were mild and 39% moderate. Donanemab infusions should be stopped immediately if patients are experiencing grade 2 or higher infusion-related reactions, with mild symptoms treated with diphenhydramine and acetaminophen every 4–6 h and more significant or persistent symptoms treated with oral dexamethasone (0.75 mg/day for 2–3 days) or oral methylprednisolone (80 mg twice per day for 2–3 days). Donanemab treatment should be discontinued if patients experience grade 3 or higher infusion-related reactions, and after a prior grade 1–2 reaction prophylactic pre-treatment should be initiated with diphenhydramine 25–50 mg and acetaminophen 650–1000 mg 30 min before the next infusion, escalating if ineffective to oral dexamethasone (0.75 mg) or oral methylprednisolone (80 mg) 60–90 min before infusion and maintaining the regimen until the patient remains asymptomatic following 2–4 further infusions.

The Tapering Process

Recommendations for the Tapering Process

6 Clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper. The pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
7 Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).
8 Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
9 Clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Implementation Considerations
Prior to beginning a taper, clinicians should conduct a thorough medication and health review, with particular attention to other psychoactive medications and conditions that may be impacted during the taper.
Clinicians should design the overall tapering strategy to minimize harms, considering the risk of harm related to continued BZD use and the risk of harms related to tapering the BZD (e.g. withdrawal symptoms, recurrence of symptoms for which the BZD was originally prescribed).
Clinicians should consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (i.e. 5%) for the first reduction to assess a patient's initial response, unless there are imminent safety concerns.
For patients who are likely to have strong physical dependence (e.g. those who have been taking a high dose for more than a year), clinicians should consider a slower taper. For the first reduction, consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (e.g. 5%). For further reductions, clinicians should adjust based on patients' initial response, considering reduction of 5 to 10% every 6–8 weeks, or slower as appropriate.
Clinicians can consider the higher end of the dose reduction range (i.e. 10–25%) for patients who are unlikely to have significant physical dependence (i.e. patients who have been taking a lower dose of BZD for a shorter period of time [e.g. less than 3 months]) but for whom tapering is indicated.
When developing tapering strategies, clinicians should consider patients' current BZD dose and half-life, frequency and duration of BZD use, co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, and responses to previous missed doses and any prior BZD tapering attempts. Clinicians should also consider patient concerns and anxiety around tapering.
When patients are taking multiple doses of BZDs each day, clinicians should carefully consider which dose to reduce first. For example, first reducing earlier doses may be appropriate if insomnia is a greater concern, whereas first reducing later doses may be more appropriate if daytime anxiety is a greater concern.
Tapering strategies, including dosing frequency, should account for the pharmacokinetic properties of the BZD to avoid sharp declines in BZD receptor occupancy.
Clinicians should monitor patients for symptoms of withdrawal and recurrence with each dose reduction. Virtual or telephonic check-ins can be leveraged for this purpose.
Clinicians should monitor patients for post-acute signs and symptoms of withdrawal for 2–4 weeks after full discontinuation of the BZD. Clinicians should manage any ongoing symptoms, as appropriate (see " Management of Protracted Withdrawal "), and regularly monitor patients until symptoms are resolved. Telehealth, including audio-only check-ins, may help facilitate monitoring.
Clinicians should consider pausing or slowing the pace of the taper and/or making smaller dose reductions for patients experiencing significant symptoms related to the BZD taper.
The BZD tapering process can be more difficult for patients as they approach the point of discontinuation. Clinicians should proactively consider smaller dose reductions and/or slowing the pace of dose reductions as the taper progresses.
If patients are unable to tolerate further BZD dose reductions, clinicians can consider — in partnership with patients, their care partners, and other members of the care team — maintaining patients on the lower BZD dose with regular risk–benefit assessments consistent with Recommendation 1.
In some limited instances when patients are experiencing intolerable symptoms, returning to the prior BZD dose and pausing the taper until symptoms stabilize may be appropriate.
In limited instances when necessary for patient safety, inpatient and medically managed residential settings may use more rapid tapering strategies (see "Tapering with Very Long-Acting Agents").

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^114U6wEu]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Central nervous system toxicity with BIC — onset, manifestations, frequency, risk factors, prevention/monitoring, and management are summarized as follows: Onset is 1–63 days after starting BIC (as late as 233 days for schizoaffective disorders). Presentations include neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression or exacerbation of preexisting depression, suicidal ideation or attempted suicide, schizoaffective disorders, anxiety) and other CNS manifestations (sleep disturbances, dizziness, insomnia). In children, one child (1%) had Grade 2 insomnia and anxiety that led to drug discontinuation in clinical trials. In adults, abnormal dreams, dizziness, and insomnia occurred in 1–5% of adults, while suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, schizoaffective disorders, and depression occurred in < 1% of adults; a recent study reported a 3.3% short-term BIC-related discontinuation rate due to neuropsychiatric AEs after ART switch in a large cohort of adults with HIV in routine clinical practice setting. Risk factors include preexisting depression or other psychiatric conditions and history of ARV-related neuropsychiatric symptoms. Prevention/monitoring states to use with caution in the presence of psychiatric conditions or in children and adolescents with a history of ARV-related neuropsychiatric symptoms. Management guidance includes: for persistent or severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, consider discontinuing BIC if a suitable alternative exists; for mild symptoms, continue BIC and counsel that symptoms are likely to resolve with time.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^117WZCH8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Implementation considerations for benzodiazepine (BZD) tapering — preparation, pacing, dependence-adjusted cadence, and monitoring — emphasize safety and individualized adjustments. Prior to beginning a taper, clinicians should conduct a thorough medication and health review, with particular attention to other psychoactive medications and conditions that may be impacted during the taper, and clinicians should design the overall tapering strategy to minimize harms, considering the risk of harm related to continued BZD use and the risk of harms related to tapering the BZD. Clinicians should consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (i.e., 5%) for the first reduction to assess a patient's initial response, unless there are imminent safety concerns, and for further reductions clinicians should adjust based on patients' initial response, considering reduction of 5 to 10% every 6–8 weeks, or slower as appropriate. For patients likely to have strong physical dependence (e.g., those who have been taking a high dose for more than a year), clinicians should consider a slower taper, whereas clinicians can consider the higher end of the dose reduction range (i.e., 10–25%) for patients unlikely to have significant physical dependence (e.g., lower dose for a shorter period [e.g., less than 3 months]) but for whom tapering is indicated. Clinicians should monitor patients for symptoms of withdrawal and recurrence with each dose reduction and should monitor for post-acute signs and symptoms of withdrawal for 2–4 weeks after full discontinuation of the BZD; virtual or telephonic check-ins can be leveraged for this purpose. Clinicians should consider pausing or slowing the pace of the taper and/or making smaller dose reductions for patients experiencing significant symptoms related to the BZD taper.

Onset and service utilization in pediatric MEB problems: Approximately 50% of adults with behavioral health problems report that disorders first manifested in early adolescence, and anxiety disorders and ADHD are the earliest disorders to emerge, often in the preschool and early school-age years. There is an approximately 2- to 4-year period between symptom appearance and when a child meets diagnostic criteria for an MEB problem. In 2019, approximately 25% of children ages 12 to 17 years reported receiving mental health services; treatment reached approximately 78% of children with depression, 59% with anxiety, and 53% with behavior problems.

### The COVID-19 pandemic experience for patients with central nervous system tumors: differences in patient-reported outcomes and practice recommendations [^113o7yFz]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Given that cancer patients more frequently interact with the healthcare system, substantial changes in healthcare delivery related to the pandemic, such as the transition to telehealth, may have disproportionately impacted this vulnerable population. One study focusing on the use of telemedicine in a neurosurgery clinic found that although satisfaction with telehealth was relatively high, difficulties did arise, including initial set-up for first-time telemedicine users, difficulty navigating the telehealth platform, management of patients without access to appropriate technology, difficulties with physical examination, and informality undermining the typical patient–clinician dynamic that is often critical to developing a therapeutic relationship. On one hand, telemedicine may improve healthcare access for some, especially for individuals who may struggle with overcoming the barrier of in-person clinic visits (such as severely depressed or fatigued individuals or those with social, economic, and geographical barriers to travel to specialized centers). Conversely, telehealth may restrict access for others, particularly for those with limited access to or knowledge of the technology, as well as for individuals who may benefit from building a meaningful in-person connection with their clinical team, which, again tends to benefit patients with significant mood disturbance.

Due to the high symptom burden that CNS tumor patients experience throughout their illness trajectory, it may be valuable to consider screening, interventions, and self-management strategies that can be completed remotely via telehealth platforms, particularly if future pandemics or health crises occur that require similar mitigation strategies. In recent work by Jones et al. the authors proposed a series of initiatives that may promote effective care for cancer patients and survivors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adoption of remote symptom monitoring for patients is one recommendation that may improve targeted care, even in spite of reduced in-person visits. The NOB has recently led the development of a smartphone application, called My STORI, which empowers patients with CNS tumors to track and self-manage common symptoms that they experience throughout their illness trajectory. Such web-based symptom monitoring initiatives have shown promise in increasing cancer patient survival when compared to standard imaging surveillance aloneand may help improve communication between patients and neuro-oncology clinicians, as well as promote patient self-efficacy in managing their symptoms.

### Health anxiety in a neurological setting [^1156REhh]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Health anxiety is a common issue in neurology clinics. However, it needs to be separated from normal health concerns as well as from the category of functional symptoms and disorders. Reassurance in health anxiety, which the patient often seeks, is ineffective and can worsen the problem. There are effective and brief psychological treatments; however, for patients to engage with treatment, they need to receive accurate early diagnosis and education. This article explains the nature of health anxiety and introduces the rationale of its treatment. We make several practical suggestions to help neurologists to maximise the chances of successfully referring their patients for psychological therapy.

### Buprenorphine [^1154QDPK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.8 Unstable Patients

Healthcare providers will need to decide when they cannot appropriately provide further management for particular patients. For example, some patients may be abusing or dependent on various drugs, or unresponsive to psychosocial intervention such that the healthcare provider does not feel that he/she has the expertise to manage the patient. In such cases, the healthcare provider may want to assess whether to refer the patient to a specialist or more intensive behavioral treatment environment. Decisions should be based on a treatment plan established and agreed upon with the patient at the beginning of treatment.

Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with, or referred to, more intensive and structured treatment.

2.9 Discontinuing Treatment

The decision to discontinue therapy with buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets or buprenorphine sublingual tablets after a period of maintenance should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan.

### Prednisone [^115gkKx5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice, while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

### Clinical features and genetic mechanisms of anxiety, fear, and avoidance: a comprehensive review of five anxiety disorders [^113GmhGZ]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Avoidance behavior: consequence or co-contributor?

Avoidance behavior, a defensive response, is a hallmark of anxiety disorders, serving to temporarily reduce the distress caused by fear or anxiety. However, this avoidance paradoxically reinforces anxiety and fear by preventing exposure to the feared stimulus, perpetuating the anxiety disorder. Avoidance manifests in various forms, ranging from the avoidance of social situations by individuals with SAD to the avoidance of open spaces by individuals with AG; furthermore, the severity of avoidance behaviors is correlated with both the chronicity and overall severity of anxiety disorders.

Avoidance behavior is also associated with poorer treatment outcomes, particularly in SP, where high levels of avoidance predict lower responsiveness to exposure-based therapy. Additionally, avoidance behaviors are related to an earlier onset in certain anxiety disorders, such as SAD and PD, where avoiding feared stimuli can lead to earlier development of chronic symptoms. Early-onset anxiety disorders, including SP and SAD, often emerge during critical developmental periods such as childhood or adolescence, potentially disrupting socialization and academic progress, and establishing persistent avoidance patterns that extend into adulthood.

In contrast, later-onset disorders such as GAD tend to develop during adulthood, potentially resulting in fewer habitual avoidance patterns. Although avoidance is typically considered a consequence of anxiety and fear, the evidence suggests that it may also act as a cocontributor, maintaining or exacerbating anxiety through a cycle of negative reinforcement. This feedback loop inhibits habituation to the feared stimuli, prolonging and intensifying anxiety over time.

Clinical features of five anxiety disorders

Figure 1 illustrates the relationships between the intensities of fear and anxiety across five anxiety disorders, as well as the relationships between the intensity of avoidance behaviors and the age of onset for each disorder, based on previous studies (established diagnostic criteria and assessment scales) and our expert consensus. These intensities represent typical assessments but may vary depending on the clinical setting and individual patient experience. These values may serve as useful general references rather than absolute consensus indicators.

### Buspirone hydrochloride (bucapsol) [^116L1ZJB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

3. **Apprehensive expectation**: anxiety, worry, fear, rumination, and anticipation of misfortune to self or others.

4. **Vigilance and scanning**: hyperattentiveness resulting in distractibility, difficulty in concentrating, insomnia, feeling "on edge", irritability, impatience.

The above symptoms would not be due to another mental disorder, such as a depressive disorder or schizophrenia. However, mild depressive symptoms are common in GAD.

The effectiveness of buspirone hydrochloride in long-term use, that is, for more than 3 to 4 weeks, has not been demonstrated in controlled trials. There is no body of evidence available that systematically addresses the appropriate duration of treatment for GAD. However, in a study of long-term use, 264 patients were treated with buspirone hydrochloride for 1 year without ill effect. Therefore, the physician who elects to use buspirone hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

### Intimacy and sexual well-being in couples coping with sexual interest / arousal disorder: the importance of perceived partner responsiveness [^113pcDNK]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Participants

The sample consisted of 263 couples (M ageP1 = 34.16, SD = 9.95; M ageP2 = 35.71, SD = 10.56) who had been together for an average of 9 years (SD = 7.7). Participants were recruited as part of a bi-center prospective study. Recruitment took place at two sites, Université de Montréal and Dalhousie University, through mostly online advertisement (eg, Facebook, Instagram, blogs). Couples were eligible to participate if they were 18 years of age or older, residing in Canada or the United States, and in a relationship for at least one year with a minimum of 4 in-person contacts per week within the last month. One member of the couple had to identify as a woman or be an individual who was assigned female at birth and meet the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for SIAD. Couples were ineligible if the person with SIAD was pregnant, breastfeeding, less than a year postpartum, trying to conceive, receiving hormonal therapy related to sexual desire (oral contraceptive accepted), or receiving a treatment for SIAD at the beginning of the study.

A total of 292 couples were initially enrolled in the study following a clinical interview (see Procedure). Of those, 27 couples had at least one partner who did not complete the survey and 2 couples were withdrawn for failing attention checks which were embedded in the baseline survey. These couples were therefore not included in the final sample, resulting in a total of 263 couples. Most individuals with SIAD identified as cisgender women (n = 239), while 24 identified as gender diverse. As for partners, the majority identified as cisgender, man or woman, (n = 230), and 33 as gender diverse. In terms of sexual orientation, most individuals with SIAD identified as heterosexual (n = 174), as did their partners (n = 207), while 89 individuals with SIAD and 56 partners identified with sexual diversity. This sample was well educated with an average of 16.14 years (SD = 2.97) of schooling since first grade for individuals with SIAD and 15.09 years (SD = 3.13) for partners, with most participants occupying a full-time job. Detailed sociodemographic characteristics of the sample are listed in Table 1.

### The road to young-onset dementia diagnosis: findings from the joint solutions project [^1137z6gk]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

3.5.3 Research trials

Following a diagnosis, people with YOD and their caregivers are often referred to research trials. The majority of clinician respondents (81%) agreed or strongly agreed on the importance of providing information about these trials, while 45% of caregivers reported receiving such information. Some caregivers find participating in trials helpful for gaining knowledge and contributing to society.

The clinical researcher leading the research was the best source of information for our family, they were better than any medical professional and answered all our questions and pointed us in the right directions despite living in another state and not being a health professional rather a scientific researcher. (Caregiver)

However, a barrier to referrals is that some clinicians are unaware of available trials. If trials are introduced, participants emphasized the importance of considering timing and sensitivity, noting that raising research participation immediately after diagnosis may not be appropriate while people are still processing the news, and may pose a barrier to patient engagement.

There needs to be a level of sensitivity by the medical practitioner when discussing research involvement. Raising the topic of research shortly after giving the person their diagnosis of dementia is often perceived as very insensitive and prompted by self‐interest. Extra care and measured timing of such information needs to be carefully considered. (Clinician)

It was too soon after his diagnosis. He needed to process this as it was life changing. (Caregiver)

Participants also emphasized the importance of managing expectations and clarifying that research does not guarantee favorable outcomes. Some respondents appreciated having the autonomy to choose whether, when, and what research to participate in, while others faced barriers such as eligibility restrictions (e.g. medical comorbidities, age cut‐offs, severity of condition), reluctance to participate (e.g. anxiety/stress‐inducing, perceived invasiveness), or inability to engage (e.g. caregiver lacking time to take them to appointments).

Diagnostic workflow for suspected AD/ADRD emphasizes sequential formulation: In most cases, the goal is to determine whether the patient has a diagnosable brain disease affecting cognition or behavior, with the first step being determination that a person does or does not have dementia and integration of reliable history with performance on tests of cognitive function in multiple domains; the second step — determination of the cognitive-behavioral syndrome — may warrant additional information or specialist consultation, and a neuropsychological evaluation by a neuropsychologist proficient in AD/ADRD assessment is often invaluable and can also be very helpful to suggest next steps; third, clinicians implicate a specific disease and/or consider the likely cause(s) of cognitive impairment or dementia, recognizing a persistent differential diagnosis and using risk and resilience factors and established clinical diagnostic criteria while the field evolves toward separating clinical syndromes from likely neuropathologic changes informed by core and ancillary biomarkers.

### Venlafaxine hydrochloride (venlafaxine) [^11713Y6m]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.

Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance

Clinical studies were performed to examine the effects of venlafaxine on behavioral performance of healthy individuals. The results revealed no clinically significant impairment of psychomotor, cognitive, or complex behavior performance. However, since any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that venlafaxine hydrochloride therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.

Angle-Closure Glaucoma

Patients should be advised that taking venlafaxine tablets can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle-closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle-closure glaucoma, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open-angle glaucoma is not a risk factor for angle closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible.

Sexual Dysfunction

Advise patients that use of venlafaxine tablets may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider (see WARNINGS).

Pregnancy

Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy.

Nursing

Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are breast–feeding an infant.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^113SymKq]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy–associated central nervous system (CNS) toxicity — cabotegravir (CAB) — includes neuropsychiatric symptoms with "Mood disorders, including depression and suicidal ideation or attempt" and "Anxiety disorders", as well as other CNS manifestations such as "Sleep disorders", "Dizziness", "Headache", and "Somnolence". In children, "Insomnia was reported in 1 of 8 adolescents in the ongoing MOCHA trial", and in adults Phase 3 trials reported "2–4% pooled incidence… for CNS AEs, including sleep disorders, dizziness, and headache", plus "5% pooled incidence for anxiety, 3% for depression and < 1% for suicidal ideation in Phase 3 trials at 48 weeks, with comparable incidence in CAB and control groups". Risk notes state "Preexisting depression or other psychiatric conditions could be contributing factors, but causal links have not clearly been identified", and "CAB exposure did not differ between study participants with and without CNS or neuropsychiatric manifestations". Monitoring guidance states "Monitor individuals for depressive symptoms or self-injurious thoughts or behavior, especially with prior history of such symptoms", and management guidance states "Promptly evaluate severe depressive symptoms, self-injurious behavior, or other CNS symptoms for a possible relationship with CAB and assess risks and benefits of continued CAB treatment". If CAB is discontinued, guidance specifies to "Counsel the individual about prolonged residual CAB levels in the blood for 52 weeks or longer and monitor frequently for symptom resolution" and to "Ensure that a new suppressive regimen is started within 30 days of last injection".

### New and evolving dimensions in the pediatrician-family-patient relationship: maintaining and managing boundaries: clinical report [^116CEg8v]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Self-disclosure — physician sharing of personal information during clinical encounters is described as "controversial", can "expend valuable time" and "shift the focus of the encounter from the patient's needs to the physician", is "often non sequitur", and its impact on "patient satisfaction" and "compliance with medical recommendations" "remains unclear". Risks include that self-disclosure "can also expose patients to physicians biases and vulnerabilities that may undermine trust… as well as a physician's ability to be objective", which "can increase the risk of harming a patient", and "personal disclosure related to social, cultural, religious, or other demographics" is "considered by some to be a boundary crossing". Potential benefits are noted: "Self-disclosure can deepen therapeutic relationships with patients, build trust and rapport, communicate a shared humanity, and be an effective means in which to respond to suffering", and illness‑ or care‑related disclosures "can convey a shared understanding and empathy… that has the potential to have a positive impact". Appropriateness depends on intent; "Self-disclosure done with the intent to benefit the patient by building trust and rapport is more easily justifiable", and "If there were uncertainty around intent… it would be prudent not to do so". Context also matters: "Self-disclosure should not be used indiscriminately, gratuitously, or without tact", clinicians should "match the delivery of information… to the preferences of the patient or caregiver", and, when aligned with preferences, disclosure "may be appropriate when utilized in small, measured amounts and in ways clearly connected to the patient's benefit"; "Physician self-reflection is required to know how much to share and when to limit further disclosure as it no longer is for the patient's benefit".

### Supporting students with anxiety in school-AAP… [^114H1bX2]. AAP (2024). Medium credibility.

Anxiety disorders are among most common disorders facing children and adolescents but are often underrecognized and undertreated. Incidence of anxiety has risen tremendously over the past decade and now affects up to 30% of adolescents. Anxiety is a healthy human emotion essential for survival, however anxiety disorders are distinct clinical conditions that first present in elementary school or earlier and can significantly impair children's and adolescents' ability to function at their optimal level in the classroom. Anxiety can often coexist with depression and ADHD. Anxiety and Anxiety Disorders in Children and Adolescents Anxiety is a healthy human emotion that helps children and adolescents prepare for challenges like taking a test or manage dangerous situations like riding a bike on a busy street. Healthy anxiety is usually expectable and proportionate to the challenge. Typically, the better prepared the person is the less anxiety they will experience.

For example:

- A student studied hard for the test and is prepared;
- An adolescent is highly skilled at bike riding, wears a helmet and protective clothing, and rides only in the bike lane. In contrast, the less prepared a child or adolescent is, the more anxiety they might experience. That said, some children and adolescents live in situations where they are exposed to persistent and severe stressors. They can have severe and persistent anxiety – an expectable and appropriate reaction to challenging life circumstances.

Healthy Anxiety in the Classroom A teacher may notice that some students:

- Come to school less prepared and thus, have more anxiety about the schoolwork;
- Have problems with learning and have more anxiety about their area of challenge;
- Have problems paying attention or sitting still and have anxiety about not understanding and doing the work in the classroom;
- Live in challenging environments and have anxiety about their safety and the wellbeing of their family, and home/neighborhood environment. All of the above situations would be 'normal', expectable anxious reactions to challenging circumstances. In the examples above, students
- With good coping skills, and family and teacher support will do better;
- Without good coping skills or family or teacher support will do less well.

What Differentiates Healthy Anxiety from Symptoms of an Anxiety Disorder There are 4 main types of anxiety disorders:

- Separation Anxiety Disorder;
- Social Anxiety Disorder;
- Selective Mutism;
- Generalized Anxiety Disorder;
- Additional types of anxiety include panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobia substance/medication induced anxiety. The 4 main types of anxiety disorders begin in elementary school or even before, however, they are not always identified or treated until adolescence. Sadly, many students never get assessed or treated. The triggers for these anxiety disorders are normal developmental activities that most children routinely master or even enjoy. The school environment by its nature exposes students to developmentally appropriate challenges and thus schools are environments where students will commonly demonstrate symptoms of an anxiety disorder.

### Anxiety and quality-of-life for parents of children with undiagnosed rare conditions: a multi-site quantitative survey study [^116sy7A8]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Our results shine a light on the mental health burden and quality‐of‐life impact of caring for a child with a rare, undiagnosed condition. Health professionals should be alert to and proactively inquire about parents' emotional state so they can identify those who might be experiencing poor psychological functioning, high levels of anxiety, and/or poor health‐related quality‐of‐life. Providing families with emotional support as well as access to services and resources to improve well‐being and cope with the challenges of caregiving is key. Further research to understand whether receipt of a genetic diagnosis has a positive impact on these psychological constructs is important. In our T2 survey, we will reevaluate this cohort and compare psychosocial health and functioning in those parents for whom a diagnosis is made with those who are still undiagnosed following WGS.

General information on insomnia disorder — patient education emphasizes that insomnia disorder can be a difficult experience but "there are treatments that are effective"; insomnia symptoms are usually first brought on because of stressful life events and sleep difficulties can persist "due to the coping strategies used that were unhelpful", so "the solution must address the unhelpful coping strategies that cause your insomnia to persist". When also treating a comorbid condition, the script states that insomnia is "not merely a symptom of another condition" and "we should treat the insomnia as well". If symptoms have been of short duration, patients are told that strategies adopted to cope "can promote a chronic problem" and "I'd like to get you started with a behavioral treatment to avoid that happening if possible".

### Alteplase (Activase) [^114tnxmb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

3-Hour Infusion in AMI Patients

In a double-blind, randomized trial (n = 138) comparing 3-hour infusion of Activase to placebo (Study 4), patients infused with Activase within 4 hours of onset of symptoms experienced improved left ventricular function at Day 10 compared to the placebo group, when ejection fraction was measured by gated blood pool scan (53.2% vs. 46.4%, p = 0.018). Relative to baseline (Day 1) values, the net changes in ejection fraction were + 3.6% and -4.7% for the treated and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.0001). The treated group had a reduced incidence of clinical heart failure (14%) compared to the placebo group (33%) (p = 0.009).

In a double-blind, randomized trial (n = 5013) comparing 3-hour infusion of Activase to placebo (Study 5), patients infused with Activase within 5 hours of AMI symptom onset experienced improved 30-day survival compared to the placebo arm. At 1 month, the overall mortality rates were 7.2% for the Activase group and 9.8% for the placebo group (p = 0.001). At 6 months, the overall mortality rate for Activase-treated patients was 10.4% compared to the placebo arm (13.1%, p = 0.008).

14.3	Acute Massive Pulmonary Embolism (PE)

Study 6 was a comparative randomized trial (n = 45) in which 59% of patients (n = 22) treated with Activase (100 mg over 2 hours) experienced moderate or marked lysis of pulmonary emboli when assessed by pulmonary angiography 2 hours after treatment initiation. Activase-treated patients also experienced a significant reduction in pulmonary embolism-induced pulmonary hypertension within 2 hours of treatment (p = 0.003). Pulmonary perfusion at 24 hours, as assessed by radionuclide scan, was significantly improved (p = 0.002).

### Linvoseltamab-gcpt (Lynozyfic) [^114X3uZ8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)

LYNOZYFIC can cause cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which can be serious or life-threatening.

In LINKER-MM1, CRS occurred in 46% (54/117) of patients who received LYNOZYFIC at the recommended dose, with Grade 1 CRS occurring in 35% (41/117) of patients, Grade 2 in 10% (12/117), and Grade 3 in 0.9% (1/117) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Thirty-eight percent (45/117) of patients had CRS following step-up dose 1, including 1 patient who experienced Grade 3 CRS; 8% (9/117) had an initial CRS event following a subsequent dose. Seventeen percent (19/113) of patients developed CRS after step-up dose 2, 10% (11/111) developed CRS after the first full 200 mg dose of LYNOZYFIC, and 3.6% (4/110) developed CRS after the second full dose. Recurrent CRS occurred in 20% (23/117) of patients. The median time to onset of CRS from the end of infusion was 11 (range: -1 to 184) hours after the most recent dose with a median duration of 15 (range: 1 to 76) hours.

Clinical signs and symptoms of CRS included, but were not limited to pyrexia, chills, hypoxia, tachycardia, and hypotension.

Administer pretreatment medications and initiate therapy according to LYNOZYFIC step-up dosing to reduce the incidence and severity of CRS [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of CRS after infusion. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur.

At the first sign of CRS, immediately evaluate patients for hospitalization, manage per current practice guidelines, and administer supportive care; withhold LYNOZYFIC until CRS resolves and modify the next dose or permanently discontinue LYNOZYFIC based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: an expert consensus [^116Z9sec]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
Overview of available data supporting the use of LAIs in bipolar disorder (including BP‐I).

Four‐year prospective data from the Systematic Treatment Optimization Program have shown that best practices (e.g. safe and effective maintenance treatment regimens, psycho‐education, cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, family‐focused therapy, and peer‐support and stress‐management programs) in the treatment of first‐episode mania in patients living with BP‐I resulted in remission and recovery. Additionally, while recurrence was common, minimizing recurrence within the first year through risk‐factor modification (e.g. reducing anxiety, stress, and comorbid alcohol/substance abuse) may alter the course of the disease. Therefore, timely intervention with LAIs represents a critical opportunity for HCPs to engage in shared decision‐making with the patient and their supporters, helping them make informed decisions about treatments and setting the wheels in motion for positive long‐term outcomes, including the prevention of key disease concerns such as relapse.

LAIs have shown better efficacy in preventing mania than depression in patients living with bipolar disorder; therefore, LAIs may be a useful first‐line treatment for patients with a manic predominant polarity, but should probably not be recommended to patients who have a depressive predominant polarity. Given that many patients living with bipolar disorder have a clear tendency toward one pole or another, there is a need for longitudinal course specifiers to help HCPs to better understand a particular patient and make informed decisions regarding treatment choices and approach. However, it is important to highlight that second‐ or third‐generation LAIs should be the preferable option because first‐generation LAIs may worsen symptoms of depression, which, in turn, may result in non‐adherence.

3.2 The formulation

While LAIs offer convenience in the form of longer administration intervals, the injectable formulation does result in several potential barriers to early initiation and long‐term adherence, including accessibility challenges (availability, infrastructure, and maintenance logistics) and HCP and patient attitudinal barriers.

### Bromocriptine mesylate [^114TFm6m]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS

During clinical trials, dizziness, drowsiness, faintness, fainting, and syncope have been reported early in the course of bromocriptine mesylate therapy. In postmarketing reports, bromocriptine mesylate has been associated with somnolence, and episodes of sudden sleep onset, particularly in patients with Parkinson's disease. Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported very rarely. All patients receiving bromocriptine mesylate should be cautioned with regard to engaging in activities requiring rapid and precise responses, such as driving an automobile or operating machinery.

Patients being treated with bromocriptine mesylate and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes must be advised not to drive or engage in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g., operating machines).

Patients receiving bromocriptine mesylate for hyperprolactinemic states associated with macroadenoma or those who have had previous transsphenoidal surgery should be told to report any persistent watery nasal discharge to their physician. Patients receiving bromocriptine mesylate for treatment of a macroadenoma should be told that discontinuation of drug may be associated with rapid regrowth of the tumor and recurrence of their original symptoms.

Patients and their caregivers should be alerted to the possibility that patients may experience intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges and other intense urges and the inability to control these urges while taking bromocriptine mesylate. Advise patients and their caregivers to inform their healthcare provider if they develop new or increased uncontrolled spending, gambling urges, sexual urges, or other urges while being treated with bromocriptine mesylate [see PRECAUTIONS].

Especially during the first days of treatment, hypotensive reactions may occasionally occur and result in reduced alertness, particular care should be exercised when driving a vehicle or operating machinery.

Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they wish to discontinue bromocriptine mesylate or decrease the dose of bromocriptine mesylate. Advise patients who have been prescribed a lower dose or who have been withdrawn from the drug to notify their healthcare provider if they have withdrawal symptoms such as fever, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, insomnia, sweating, or pain (see Precautions).

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Core element one: whom to evaluate and how to establish shared goals — evaluation initiation and partnership are emphasized, including that "Any middle-aged or older patient who self-reports — or whose spouse, family, or other informant (or clinician) reports — concerns regarding symptoms of cognitive, behavioral, or functional decline — should undergo an evaluation to determine whether they might have a cognitive-behavioral syndrome arising due to specific neuropathologic changes (Recommendation 1)". The guidance states that "A clinician should not assume 'normality' or ascribe cognitive or behavioral symptoms to 'normal aging' without an appropriate evaluation", and that optimal evaluation "is grounded in the biopsychosocial model of health and illness". It highlights "the critical importance — in most situations — of including both the patient and an informant or care partner in the diagnostic and disclosure process", and notes that dementia-related impairments "dictate the need to engage a care partner in the communication of the diagnosis, optimally from the beginning". For communication and goal-setting, "The clinician should use patient-centered communication to develop a partnership with the patient or with the patient and a care partner to (1) establish shared goals for the evaluation process and (2) assess capacity (understanding and appreciation) to engage", and it affirms that "The timely evaluation of an individual with cognitive or behavioral symptoms concerning for MCI or dementia represents best medical practice".

### Buspirone hydrochloride [^114caqSx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Buspirone hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic.

The efficacy of buspirone hydrochloride tablets has been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials of outpatients whose diagnosis roughly corresponds to Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Many of the patients enrolled in these studies also had coexisting depressive symptoms and buspirone hydrochloride tablets relieved anxiety in the presence of these coexisting depressive symptoms. The patients evaluated in these studies had experienced symptoms for periods of 1 month to over 1 year prior to the study, with average symptom duration of 6 months. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (300.02) is described in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, III1as follows:

Generalized, persistent anxiety (of at least 1 month continual duration), manifested by symptoms from three of the four following categories:

Motor tension: shakiness, jitteriness, jumpiness, trembling, tension, muscle aches, fatigability, inability to relax, eyelid twitch, furrowed brow, strained face, fidgeting, restlessness, easy startle.
Autonomic hyperactivity: sweating, heart pounding or racing, cold, clammy hands, dry mouth, dizziness, lightheadedness, paresthesias (tingling in hands or feet), upset stomach, hot or cold spells, frequent urination, diarrhea, discomfort in the pit of the stomach, lump in the throat, flushing, pallor, high resting pulse and respiration rate.
Apprehensive expectation: anxiety, worry, fear, rumination, and anticipation of misfortune to self or others.
Vigilance and scanning: hyperattentiveness resulting in distractibility, difficulty in concentrating, insomnia, feeling "on edge", irritability, impatience.

### Clinical features and genetic mechanisms of anxiety, fear, and avoidance: a comprehensive review of five anxiety disorders [^117HzReU]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

AG

Fear

Extremely high (★★★★★), particularly in situations where individuals perceive that they cannot escape or receive help during a panic attack. Common fears include being in crowds, open spaces, or public transportation.

Anxiety

High and pervasive (★★★★☆), not only in feared situations but also in anticipation of entering these environments.

Avoidance

High (★★★★☆), with individuals often becoming housebound, severely limiting their social and occupational functioning. The onset of avoidance among individuals with AG typically occurs between late teens and mid-30s; however, AG may also develop following PD.

SP

Fear

Extremely high (★★★★☆ to ★★★★★), directly tied to a specific object or situation (e.g. heights, animals, flying). Exposure to a phobic stimulus triggers immediate fear responses, often resulting in panic-like symptoms.

Anxiety

Moderate anxiety (★★☆☆☆ to ★★★☆☆), which is generally low in the absence of the phobic stimulus but can escalate to high levels when the feared object or situation is anticipated or encountered.

Avoidance

Very high (★★★★☆ to ★★★★★), with individuals going to great lengths to avoid the phobic stimulus, leading to significant lifestyle restrictions and a reduced quality of life. The onset of avoidance among individuals with SP is typically in childhood, and earlier onset often leads to more ingrained avoidance behaviors over time.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^1114LfUM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.5 Clinical Supervision

Treatment should be initiated with supervised administration, progressing to unsupervised administration as the patient's clinical stability permits. Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablet is subject to diversion and abuse. When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patient's level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication.

Ideally patients should be seen at reasonable intervals (e.g., at least weekly during the first month of treatment) based upon the individual circumstances of the patient. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. Periodic assessment is necessary to determine compliance with the dosing regimen, effectiveness of the treatment plan, and overall patient progress.

Once a stable dosage has been achieved and patient assessment (e.g., urine drug screening) does not indicate illicit drug use, less frequent follow-up visits may be appropriate. A once-monthly visit schedule may be reasonable for patients on a stable dosage of medication who are making progress toward their treatment objectives. Continuation or modification of pharmacotherapy should be based on the healthcare provider's evaluation of treatment outcomes and objectives such as:

1. Absence of medication toxicity

2. Absence of medical or behavioral adverse effects

3. Responsible handling of medications by the patient

4. Patient's compliance with all elements of the treatment plan (including recovery-oriented activities, psychotherapy, and/or other psychosocial modalities)

5. Abstinence from illicit drug use (including problematic alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use)

If treatment goals are not being achieved, the healthcare provider should re-evaluate the appropriateness of continuing the current treatment.

2.6 Unstable Patients

Healthcare providers will need to decide when they cannot appropriately provide further management for particular patients. For example, some patients may be abusing or dependent on various drugs, or unresponsive to psychosocial intervention such that the healthcare provider does not feel that he/she has the expertise to manage the patient. In such cases, the healthcare provider may want to assess whether to refer the patient to a specialist or more intensive behavioral treatment environment. Decisions should be based on a treatment plan established and agreed upon with the patient at the beginning of treatment.

Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with, or referred to, more intensive and structured treatment.

### Depression and anxiety symptom networks across the lifespan [^111iWXWs]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

The analysis of symptom centrality again revealed some age-related consistencies but also discrepancies in the structure of depression-anxiety symptom network. In both age groups, anxiety symptoms, and particularly 'panic', were more central within the symptom network compared to depressive symptoms, echoing some who suggest anxiety symptoms play a prominent role in the overall experience of distress relative to depressive symptoms. Importantly, we observed an age-related difference in bridging symptoms, with rumination emerging as the strongest bridge symptom in younger adults, but restlessness emerging as the strongest bridge symptom in older adults. Bridging symptoms are particularly informative, as they reflect symptoms that statistically link distinct symptom domains — in this case, depression and anxiety — and may therefore serve as potential conduits for comorbidity. For instance, in younger adults, individuals experiencing persistent ruminative thoughts may be more likely to also report anxiety symptoms, whereas in older adults, somatic agitation such as restlessness may similarly link anxiety and depressive symptoms. These findings suggest a potential shift in the mechanisms underlying comorbidity, from cognitive-affective pathways in youth to more somatic manifestations in older age. Supporting this interpretation, evidence suggests that depression and anxiety can manifest differently in older adults, with a greater emphasis on somatic complaints and physical symptoms. Clinically, this highlights the need to tailor screening and diagnostic tools to the symptom profiles most relevant for each age group in order to facilitate the identification of those at risk for mixed depressive-anxiety presentations.

HORIZANT may cause significant driving impairment [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. The duration of driving impairment after starting therapy with HORIZANT is unknown. Patients taking HORIZANT should not drive until they have gained sufficient experience to assess whether HORIZANT impairs their ability to drive. However, prescribers and patients should be aware that patients' ability to assess their own driving competence, as well as their ability to assess the degree of somnolence caused by HORIZANT, can be imperfect. Whether the impairment is related to somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] or other effects of HORIZANT is unknown.

### Clinical features and genetic mechanisms of anxiety, fear, and avoidance: a comprehensive review of five anxiety disorders [^111pDmt6]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Anxiety, fear, and avoidance: conceptual framework

Core differences between anxiety and fear

Anxiety and fear are related but conceptually distinct states. Fear is an acute emotional response to a real or perceived immediate threat, activating the autonomic nervous system and preparing the body for a fight-or-flight reaction. In contrast, anxiety is a more diffuse, future-oriented state of unease or worry without a specific external stimulus. The primary distinction between the two lies in their temporal orientation: fear is reactive to immediate danger, whereas anxiety is anticipatory and concerned with potential future threats. On the basis of three responses, namely, verbal-subjective, overt motor acts, and somato-visceral activity, fear is characterized by thoughts of imminent threat, urges to escape, and a strong autonomic surge resulting in physical symptoms such as sweating, trembling, heart palpitations, and nausea, whereas anxiety is often expressed through worry, avoidance, and muscle tension.

Several studies support the distinction between fear and anxiety on the basis of self-reported symptoms. A two-factor model, which distinguishes between physiological arousal (e.g. heart racing) and subjective anxiety (e.g. nervousness, inability to relax), has demonstrated a better fit than a one-factor model across diverse populations, including children/adolescents, undergraduates, and psychiatric outpatients. These findings indicate that fear is more closely associated with autonomic arousal, whereas anxiety is linked to subjective cognitive distress. However, while fear and anxiety are conceptually distinct, the symptoms of these states exist along a continuum and are likely to diverge and converge to varying degrees. Clinically, anxiety disorders can lean toward fear (e.g. AG) or anxiety (e.g. GAD), but these disorders frequently overlap. Anxiety can heighten fear responses, while fear can contribute to persistent anxious states, reinforcing a cycle of avoidance and distress.

### Mental health of pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis after 18 months on elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor therapy [^113oCpQR]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Research studies are conflicting regarding new highly effective modulators and the association with mental health symptoms for adults and adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF). For younger children, small studies and case reports indicate a wide range of effects, ranging from improvement in mood to the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, a large placebo-controlled study indicated no causal connection. This study evaluates the frequency and severity of mental health symptoms in children and adolescents while taking elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI).

Methods

The study includes 81 pediatric patients with CF followed at Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH). Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Anxiety and Depression, Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7) were used to screen for depression and anxiety. Age-appropriate questionnaires were completed over the first 18 months after initiating ETI.

Results

At baseline, majority of participants reported mental health symptoms within normal limits (WNL). For participants with elevated baseline measures, depressive and anxiety symptoms significantly decreased throughout the study period. Depending on the metric, patients experiencing depressive and anxiety symptoms dropped to 2–3% (n = 1, on each depressive measure) and 0% (n = 0, on either anxiety measures) respectively by 18 months.

Conclusion

Most pediatric patients with CF did not endorse symptoms of depression or anxiety disorders at ETI initiation. Over the first 18 months of ETI usage, the percentage of patients with these symptoms decreased, suggesting that the percentage of patients experiencing severe symptoms of depression and anxiety may decrease with ongoing use of ETI.

### Cyclobenzaprine (cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride) [^117E9mnX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Because of its atropine-like action, cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with a history of urinary retention, angle-closure glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and in patients taking anticholinergic medication.

Impaired Hepatic Function

The plasma concentration of cyclobenzaprine is increased in patients with hepatic impairment (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics, Hepatic Impairment). These patients are generally more susceptible to drugs with potentially sedating effects, including cyclobenzaprine. Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride tablets should be used with caution in subjects with mild hepatic impairment starting with a 5 mg dose and titrating slowly upward. Due to the lack of data in subjects with more severe hepatic insufficiency, the use of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride in subjects with moderate to severe impairment is not recommended.

Information for Patients

Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants, may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. In the elderly, the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with the use of cyclobenzaprine, with or without concomitant medications, is increased. In elderly patients, cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride should be initiated with a 5 mg dose and titrated slowly upward.

Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride and other drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tramadol, bupropion, meperidine, verapamil, or MAO inhibitors. Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, and be instructed to seek medical care immediately if they experience these symptoms (see WARNINGS, and see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions)

### Clinical features and genetic mechanisms of anxiety, fear, and avoidance: a comprehensive review of five anxiety disorders [^114JLRVA]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

SAD

Fear

Very high (★★★★☆), particularly in situations involving potential social rejection or when a negative evaluation is anticipated. The fear is typically focused on social interactions or performance situations.

Anxiety

High and persistent (★★★★☆), often occurring well in advance of the feared event. Individuals may experience anticipatory anxiety days or weeks before the actual event.

Avoidance

Significant (★★★★☆), leading individuals to avoid any situation where they fear being judged. This avoidance can severely affect social and occupational functioning. The age of onset for SAD is typically early adolescence, around age 13, and avoidance behaviors may become deeply ingrained if left untreated.

GAD

Fear

Low (★★☆☆☆), lower than in other anxiety disorders. Fear in GAD patients is often not tied to specific triggers but is generalized to involve multiple domains, such as health, finances, or safety.

Anxiety

Extremely high and chronic (★★★★★), affecting multiple areas of life. Individuals experience excessive uncontrollable worry, which affects more days than not over a period of six months.

Avoidance

Mild (★★☆☆☆), less pronounced than other anxiety disorders, although individuals may avoid situations that heighten their worries, such as stressful tasks or conflict situations. The onset of avoidance among individuals with GAD typically occurs in early adulthood, often in the early 30 s, with avoidance being less prominent but growing over time as a coping mechanism for chronic worry.

PD

Fear

High (★★★☆☆ to ★★★★☆), extremely high during panic attacks. Individuals often experience intense fear of losing control, dying, or going insane.

Anxiety

High anticipatory anxiety (★★★★☆), with individuals fearing the occurrence of future panic attacks, which can become as disabling as the attacks themselves.

Avoidance

Moderate to high (★★★☆☆ to ★★★★☆). Individuals begin to avoid places or situations where they have experienced panic attacks, fearing recurrence. This avoidance can lead to the development of AG, where individuals may avoid leaving their homes altogether. The onset of avoidance among individuals with PD typically ranges between late adolescence and early adulthood, around the ages of 20–24 years.

### Anxiety disorders in children and adolescents… [^111ekqrb]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

3 Prevalence rates are approximately 20% for specific phobias, 9% for social anxiety disorder, 8% for separation anxiety disorder, and 2% each for agoraphobia, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder.
3. 4 In the past decade, there has been increasing concern over the impact of social media use and engagement with online content on anxiety symptoms and the development of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. The impact can have positive and negative associations and varies by gender, age, social media platform, and time spent using. Fear of missing out and validation seeking drive engagement with and time spent on social media and can lead to increases in general anxiety symptoms and anxiety around body image. 5 Cyberbullying can lead to increased anxiety and risk of anxiety disorders, especially in marginalized youths, although positive effects of increased connection to online communities have been noted.

5 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child and adolescent mental health has become a growing concern. A 2021 meta-analysis that included more than 80, 000 youths in 29 studies showed a pooled prevalence of clinically elevated anxiety symptoms of 21%, with higher prevalence rates in data collected later in the pandemic and in girls.
6. Screening The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents eight to 18 years of age. There is insufficient evidence to support screening in children younger than eight years.
7. Clinical Presentation Symptoms include excessive anxiety, fear, or worry that is out of proportion to the situation, event, person, object, or threat. Symptom context and triggers can help distinguish between specific anxiety disorders.

Physical symptoms of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents manifest as autonomic nervous system activation, including diaphoresis, palpitations, chest tightness, nausea, faintness, chills, and muscle tightness. Peak autonomic nervous system activation is seen in panic attacks, which can occur with any anxiety disorder. Additional behavioral responses indicative of an anxiety disorder include avoidance of or reluctance to engage in certain activities or with certain objects or individuals. Children can display behaviors such as crying, tantrums, or clinging when confronting or anticipating engagement with a situation, event, person, object, or threat. Anxiety disorder symptoms persist over time and negatively impact functioning in one or more domains, such as education and social and interpersonal performance. Clinicians should also inquire about trauma history, current psychosocial stressors, current and past social functioning with adults and peers, and educational performance. Assessing for suicide risk, including self-harming behaviors and suicidal ideation, is critical. 3, 8. A detailed psychosocial history and comprehensive picture of current stressors allow for the differentiation of developmentally appropriate worries, fears, and stress responses from an anxiety disorder. 8, 9 Identifying individual and family strengths, resources, and support is important for developing a therapeutic alliance.
3. PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES For mild to moderate symptoms, strong evidence from randomized trials supports the use of cognitive behavior therapy, delivered individually or in group settings, as a first-line treatment. 13 with a number needed to treat of 6 for the primary outcome of remission of any anxiety disorder diagnosis vs. wait-list controls. 14 CBT focuses on how thoughts affect mood and behavior.

### Cladribine (Mavenclad) [^115Swri9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

The recommended cumulative dosage of MAVENCLAD is 3.5 mg per kg body weight administered orally and divided into 2 yearly treatment courses (1.75 mg per kg per treatment course) (see Table 1). Each treatment course is divided into 2 treatment cycles:

Administration of First Treatment Course

First Course/First Cycle: start any time.
First Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of First Course/First Cycle.

Administration of Second Treatment Course

Second Course/First Cycle: administer at least 43 weeks after the last dose of First Course/Second Cycle.
Second Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of Second Course/First Cycle.

Administer the cycle dosage as 1 or 2 tablets once daily over 4 or 5 consecutive days [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1)]. Do not administer more than 2 tablets daily.

Following the administration of 2 treatment courses, do not administer additional MAVENCLAD treatment during the next 2 years. Treatment during these 2 years may further increase the risk of malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The safety and efficacy of reinitiating MAVENCLAD more than 2 years after completing 2 treatment courses has not been studied.

2.3 Missed Dose

If a dose is missed, patients should not take double or extra doses.

If a dose is not taken on the scheduled day, then the patient must take the missed dose on the following day and extend the number of days in that treatment cycle. If two consecutive doses are missed, the treatment cycle is extended by 2 days.

2.4 Administration

MAVENCLAD tablets are taken orally, with water, and swallowed whole without chewing. MAVENCLAD can be taken with or without food.

Separate administration of MAVENCLAD and any other oral drugs by at least 3 hours during the 4 to 5 day MAVENCLAD treatment cycles [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].

MAVENCLAD is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures [see References (15)]. MAVENCLAD is an uncoated tablet and must be swallowed immediately once removed from the blister. If a tablet is left on a surface, or if a broken or fragmented tablet is released from the blister, the area must be thoroughly washed with water.

The patient's hands must be dry when handling the tablets and washed thoroughly afterwards. Avoid prolonged contact with skin.

### The effectiveness of bubble-blowing as a distraction technique during pediatric intravenous cannulation: a randomized controlled trial [^111KwTbm]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Differences in anxiety scores between groups may provide greater insight into the effectiveness of the distraction methods at different stages of the IV insertion process. At baseline and at IV cannulation, our patients showed similar anxiety scores to those reported during the initial validation of the mYPAS and in previous studies of anxiety at induction of anesthesia. However, immediately before IV cannulations, significantly fewer patients in the bubble‐blowing group demonstrated anxiety higher than baseline compared to the video‐watching group, which could indicate these children were more effectively distracted by the bubbles and could better cope with any new sensations at this time. Breathing exercises, including bubble‐blowing, can distract a child's attention from pain and induce vagus nerve stimulation, cortisol reduction, and antidepressant neurotransmitter secretion. Bubble‐blowing combines play with a relaxation breathing exercise, making it a type of play therapy. In our study, the therapeutic benefits of bubble‐blowing may have prevented the escalation of anxiety levels more effectively than video‐watching.

### Triazolam [^113JPZFd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Amphetamine sulfate [^111Jnx6R]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Amphetamine sulfate tablets, USP are indicated for:

Narcolepsy
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity as an integral part of a total treatment program which typically includes other remedial measures (psychological, educational, social) for a stabilizing effect in children with behavioral syndrome characterized by the following group of developmentally inappropriate symptoms: moderate to severe distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. The diagnosis of the syndrome should not be made with finality when these symptoms are only of comparatively recent origin. Nonlocalizing (soft) neurological signs, learning disability, and abnormal EEG may or may not be present, and a diagnosis of central nervous system dysfunction may or not be warranted.
Exogenous Obesity as a short term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on caloric restriction for patients refractory to alternative therapy, e.g., repeated diets, group programs, and other drugs. The limited usefulness of amphetamines (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY) should be weighed against possible risks inherent in use of the drug, such as those described below.

### Clinical features and genetic mechanisms of anxiety, fear, and avoidance: a comprehensive review of five anxiety disorders [^111RrVEp]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Genetics related to three anxiety groups

Twin and family studies have consistently shown that genetic factors significantly contribute to the development of anxiety disorders, although the degree of heritability varies across the five disorders (Fig. 3). SAD has heritability rates ranging from approximately 40% to 60%, with evidence suggesting that heritability may change with age and that SAD aggregates in families. GAD is also moderately heritable, with estimates ranging from 30% to 50%. Family studies indicate that GAD shares genetic factors with depression and other anxiety disorders. PD shows a heritability estimate of approximately 40%, with family studies highlighting an increased risk of PD, other anxiety disorders, and depression in first-degree relatives. AG shares genetic risk factors with PD, and twin studies estimate that AG heritability. For SP, twin studies suggest heritability rates between 40% and 60%. However, heritability can vary on the basis of the type of phobia, with blood–injury–injection phobia showing higher heritability (60%) than animal or situational phobias (45%).

Fig. 3
Relationships between the intensity of avoidance behaviors and the heritability for each anxiety disorder.

Mean heritability, along with its range, is shown for each disorder, positioned according to the intensity of avoidance behaviors.

Among fear, anxiety, and avoidance behaviors, genetic factors play a substantial role across all three traits. Avoidance behaviors show the strongest heritability, followed by fear. While avoidance behaviors may be secondary to fear and anxiety, early-onset anxiety disorders such as SP and SAD suggest that avoidance behaviors may be more strongly influenced by genetic factors (Fig. 3). These behaviors often emerge early in development and are central to the progression of the disorder. Across anxiety groups, a gradient of genetic involvement is evident: fear-dominant disorders tend to show a higher degree of heritability than mixed and anxiety-dominant disorders (Fig. 3). Although fear and anxiety may share some overlapping genetic factors, previous studies have suggested that fear and anxiety have distinct biological mechanisms. The amygdala plays a central role in fear processing, whereas the HPA axis and serotonergic regulation are more involved in chronic stress and anxiety. These findings support the hypothesis that different genetic pathways may influence the specific manifestations of anxiety disorders. PD and SAD fall into a mixed category where genetic influences from both fear and anxiety come together. This finding aligns with neurobiological evidence showing that while a genetic gradient exists, fear and anxiety share some genetic origins but also have distinct differences.

### Effective patient-physician communication [^111Lp34u]. ACOG (2025). High credibility.

Effective patient–physician communication — background and key elements — is described as foundational to care, noting that effective communication between physicians and patients is the cornerstone of the patient–physician relationship, can build positive relationships, enable sharing power, and lead to mutual trust, and improves patient experiences and health outcomes; building blocks include acknowledgment of a patient's identity and experiences, clarity of information, patient activation and participation, knowledge-related power and authority, emotional proximity and shared experiences, and managing health care and relational goals, and in practical terms this translates to communication behaviors that demonstrate humility to close the patient–physician relationship distance and achieve effective communication, particularly for marginalized patient populations.

### Subthreshold manic symptoms as a risk factor for depressive, anxiety and substance use: results of a prospective study in the general population [^113wiEEC]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Indicated prevention aimed at high-risk individuals with subthreshold psychiatric symptoms should alleviate the disease burden caused by depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders (further called: common mental disorders, CMD). This study investigates subthreshold manic symptoms (subM) as a possible risk factor for CMD and, for comparison, bipolar disorder type I and II (BD).

Methods

We assessed three-year manifestation of CMD and onset of BD in an adult cohort (n = 4618) representative of the Dutch general population. SubM was defined as elevated mood or irritability lasting at least four days, without meeting DSM-IV criteria for BD. Manifest CMD were absent at baseline and present in the subsequent three years, irrespective of lifetime occurrence (manifestation = onset and recurrence). Onset BD was absent at lifetime and baseline and present in the subsequent three years.

Results

Individuals with subM had a significantly increased risk of manifest depressive (odds ratio (OR) 2.3–2.9; p for trend < 0.001) and anxiety disorders (1.5–5.9; < 0.001) and of onset BD (6.4–43.8; < 0.001), but not of substance use disorders, as compared to those without manic symptoms. BD risk was elevated strongest. Increased risks persisted after adjustment for sociodemographic variables, presence of other CMD and lifestyle factors.

Conclusions

SubM precedes forthcoming depressive, anxiety and bipolar disorders on short term. Their presence should be considered a relevant predictor in the psychopathological pathway of mood- and anxiety disorders. Moreover, we recommend to include subM in research on risk prediction tools and preventive interventions for mood- and anxiety disorders.

### Clinical features and genetic mechanisms of anxiety, fear, and avoidance: a comprehensive review of five anxiety disorders [^111PE4DV]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health disorders characterized by excessive fear, anxiety, and related behaviors such as avoidance. These disorders are highly prevalent worldwide, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 30%. Anxiety disorders can be categorized as follows: social anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), agoraphobia (AG), and specific phobia (SP). Although obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibit some overlapping features with anxiety disorders, they are not classified within this category and are therefore excluded from this review. The primary reason for their exclusion is that both OCD and PTSD are categorized separately from anxiety disorders in current international diagnostic criteria (DSM-5) due to their distinct neurobiological and clinical characteristics. OCD is characterized by intrusive obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, which are primarily driven by distress and cognitive rigidity rather than by fear and avoidance, as seen in anxiety disorders. PTSD, on the other hand, is primarily defined by trauma-related re-experiencing, hyperarousal, and emotional numbing, distinguishing it from the fear-anxiety spectrum of traditional anxiety disorders. Neurobiological studies further suggest that OCD involves dysfunctions in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuitry, while PTSD is linked to impaired fear extinction mechanisms in the amygdala-prefrontal network. Additionally, distinct epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, may regulate gene expression in these disorders. Given these distinctions, this review focuses specifically on the five anxiety disorders traditionally categorized within the anxiety spectrum: SAD, GAD, PD, AG, and SP. Each anxiety disorder presents a unique profile of symptoms, but they share common features of heightened anxiety, fear, and avoidance behaviors.

### Treatment… [^112oiQkw]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders, particularly panic disorder, occur more frequently in patients with chronic medical illnesses than in the general population. 5 Conversely, patients with anxiety disorders are more likely than others to develop a medical illness, 6, 7 and the presence of an anxiety disorder may prolong the course of a medical illness. 2 Patients with anxiety disorders have higher rates of mortality from all causes.
4. Characteristics of Generalized Anxiety Disorder The definition of GAD has changed over time. Originally, little distinction was made between panic disorder and GAD. As panic disorder became better understood and specific treatments were developed, GAD was defined in the. 10 emphasize the psychic component rather than the somatic or autonomic symptoms.

In addition to the DSM-IV framework, the symptoms of GAD can be conceptualized as being contained in three categories: excessive physiologic arousal, distorted cognitive processes and poor coping strategies. 11 The symptoms associated with each of these categories are listed in Table 2. 10,
11. 10 criteria, the worry and other associated symptoms must be present for at least six months and must adversely affect the patient's life. 10 The diagnosis can be challenging because the difference between normal anxiety and GAD is not always distinct 12 and because GAD often coexists with other psychiatric disorders.
13. The lifetime prevalence of GAD is
4. 1 to 6. 6 percent, 14 which is higher than that of the other anxiety disorders. The prevalence of GAD in patients visiting physicians' offices is twice that found in the community.

15 It is more prevalent in women than in men, 1 with the median age of onset occurring during the early 20s. 13 The onset of symptoms is usually gradual, although GAD can be precipitated by stressful life events. The condition tends to be chronic with periods of exacerbation and remission.
13. Evaluation The evaluation process for patients with anxiety is outlined in Figure

1. INITIAL ASSESSMENT After obtaining a patient history, the physician should try to categorize the anxiety as acute or persistent. 15, 16 Acute anxiety lasts from hours to weeks and is usually preceded by a stressor. Often, comorbid conditions are not present. 15 Persistent anxiety lasts for months to years and can include what is called "trait anxiety.

" Trait anxiety can be viewed as part of a patient's temperament; for instance, a patient may say, "I've always been nervous, but I don't know about what". Although there is usually not a precipitating stressor in most cases of persistent anxiety, a stressor can exacerbate the patient's baseline level of anxiety. This situation is called "double anxiety". 15 GAD is a form of persistent anxiety and can occur in patients with or without trait anxiety. 2 These patients warrant a full medical evaluation because there may be no indication that GAD is the etiology. Conversely, physicians should include a psychiatric disorder in the differential diagnosis when symptoms are vaguely described, do not conform to known pathophysiologic mechanisms, persist after a negative work-up and are not resolved by reassurance.

### Adjustment to cancer: anxiety and distress (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^1154zumc]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

For more information, see Depression and Cancer-Related Post-Traumatic Stress. Anxiety often appears at various times during cancer screening, diagnosis, treatment, and recurrence. It can also affect the health behaviors of people at risk of cancer, contributing to actions that might prevent cancer. For example, when women with high levels of anxiety learn that they have a genetically higher risk of developing breast cancer than they had previously believed, they might perform breast self-examination less frequently. For patients undergoing cancer treatment, anxiety may also heighten the expectancy of pain, other symptoms of distress, and sleep disturbances, and it can be a major factor in anticipatory nausea and vomiting. Regardless of severity, anxiety can substantially interfere with the quality of life of cancer patients and their families, and should be evaluated and treated.

Psychosocial distress: Distress in cancer has been defined as "a multifactorial unpleasant experience of a psychological, social, spiritual, and/or physical nature that may interfere with one's ability to cope effectively with cancer, its physical symptoms, and its treatment. Distress extends along a continuum, ranging from common normal feelings of vulnerability, sadness, and fears to problems that can become disabling, such as depression, anxiety, panic, social isolation, and existential and spiritual crisis. " For more information, see the Psychosocial Distress section., are less severe than in diagnosable mental disorders such as major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, and do not represent normal bereavement. For more information, see The Adjustment Disorders section.

Anxiety disorders: Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders whose common symptoms include excessive anxiety, worry, fear, apprehension, and/or dread. Although some anxiety can be adaptive — particularly in response to stressors such as cancer — anxiety disorders are excessive, unwarranted, often illogical fears, worry, and dread. Types of anxiety disorders in the DSM-5 include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. For more information, see the Anxiety Disorders: Description and Etiology section.
- Disability.
- Poorer quality of life.
- Ongoing, unmet psychosocial needs. Regarding the prevalence of distress, one study of 236 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer found that 41% reported distress scores higher than 5 on the DT.

In this same group of women, 11% reported symptoms suggestive of major depression, and 10% reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress. A few predictors of distress have been identified. In a large sample of patients with mixed cancer diagnoses, those reporting a score of 4 or higher on the DT were more likely to be women; to have poorer functional performance; and to have reported problems with housing, dealing with children, dealing with a partner, depression, fears, nervousness, sadness, worry, and 14 of 20 physical ailments. As to predictors of posttreatment distress, a longitudinal study of 224 patients with head and neck cancer found that participants were more likely to experience an anxiety disorder immediately after treatment when they were diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer or had experienced childhood abuse.

### The effectiveness of bubble-blowing as a distraction technique during pediatric intravenous cannulation: a randomized controlled trial [^116CTPTp]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Future research could focus on offering these modalities outside of the medical imaging environment. Infection control protocols limited the use of bubble‐blowing in our operating rooms. However, future studies could identify sterile techniques to implement bubbles or similar active distraction techniques that can be implemented in or near a sterile environment. Alternatively, facilities with anesthetic induction rooms could benefit from the use of bubbles. Children who were excluded from our study for assessment reasons (nonverbal and autistic patients) may also benefit from bubble‐based distraction. Future work should investigate the use of bubble‐blowing as an active distraction technique for neurodiverse, fearful, or anxious children to inform anxiety and pain management strategies that accommodate a wider variety of patients.

In conclusion, bubble‐blowing distraction did not significantly reduce pain or anxiety scores during IV cannulations before general anesthesia in young children compared to passive video watching. This could reflect pre‐existing, effective management of pain and anxiety in clinical practice.

### Clinical features and genetic mechanisms of anxiety, fear, and avoidance: a comprehensive review of five anxiety disorders [^114akfGQ]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

SAD is characterized by a pronounced fear of social or performance situations, where individuals worry about being negatively judged or observed by others. This fear drives avoidance behaviors such as avoiding public speaking or social gatherings, which can severely impair social and occupational functioning. GAD is characterized by chronic, excessive worry about various topics, often without a clear trigger. The persistent worry leads to generalized feelings of tension and apprehension, often affecting multiple areas of daily life. PD is associated with recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, accompanied by intense fear and physical symptoms such as heart palpitations, sweating, and dizziness. The anticipatory anxiety of having another attack often contributes to the development of AG, where individuals avoid places or situations where escape might be difficult or where help might not be available. AG often presents as the avoidance of open spaces, crowded areas, or public transportation. Finally, SP involves intense fear of a specific object or situation, such as heights, animals, or flying. Exposure to a feared stimulus triggers immediate fear responses, which often result in avoidance behaviors. Although these disorders present distinct patterns of symptoms, such as varying intensities of fear and anxiety, different ages of onset, and unique behavioral manifestations, these anxiety disorders share the core features of heightened anxiety and fear, often accompanied by avoidance behaviors.

This narrative review integrates current knowledge on the interactions among anxiety, fear, and avoidance behaviors across these five anxiety disorders. On the basis of the intensity of fear, anxiety, and avoidance behaviors, we can categorize these five anxiety disorders into three distinct groups: fear-dominant (SP, AG), mixed (PD, SAD), and anxiety-dominant (GAD). This review synthesizes findings from clinical, neuropsychological, brain function, treatment, genetic, and epigenetic studies, with a particular focus on how these components across fear, anxiety and avoidance behaviors contribute to disorder-specific profiles.

Fire safety for travelers — lodging selection and evacuation planning: "To prevent fire-related injuries, travelers should select accommodations no higher than the 6th floor (fire ladders generally cannot reach higher than the 6th floor) and confirm that hotels have smoke alarms and, preferably, sprinkler systems". Counsel that they "might want to bring their own smoke alarms" and "should always identify ≥ 2 escape routes from buildings". "Crawling low under smoke and covering one's mouth with a wet cloth are helpful for escaping a fire", and "Families should agree on a meeting place outside the building in case of a fire".
