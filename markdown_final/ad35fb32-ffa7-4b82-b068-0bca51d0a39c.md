## Question

When a patient gets hives with ibuprofen how much chances they have to get same reaction with naproxen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how likely naproxen will cause hives in someone who previously developed hives with ibuprofen, and what the safest next steps are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical phenotype of NSAID-induced urticaria and whether this represents a cross-reactive COX-1 mechanism versus a selective IgE-mediated reaction. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about cross-reactivity and contraindications. Next, I will review guideline-based diagnostic strategies, especially oral aspirin challenge, to distinguish phenotypes. After that, I need to quantify risk estimates and consider modifiers such as chronic spontaneous urticaria and mast cell disorders. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and outline safer alternatives and when to refer for specialist evaluation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype. Hives from ibuprofen typically fall into NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema (NIUA) or NSAID-exacerbated cutaneous disease (NECD), both of which are usually cross-reactive across COX-1–inhibiting NSAIDs due to prostaglandin-leukotriene imbalance rather than drug-specific IgE, so the mechanism predicts risk with naproxen as well [^111pVPn8] [^116FqGyt].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory position before drawing conclusions. FDA labeling for both ibuprofen and naproxen explicitly contraindicates use in patients with a history of urticaria or allergic-type reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs, reflecting recognized cross-reactivity and the potential for severe anaphylactoid reactions, which means naproxen is not considered safe after an ibuprofen hives reaction from a regulatory standpoint [^115oSSvd] [^114WK5rL] [^113y4Eqx] [^112JeLC1].

> I should confirm the diagnostic approach next. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — guidelines recommend an oral aspirin challenge as the criterion standard to determine whether the patient has cross-reactive COX-1 hypersensitivity versus a selective reaction, and skin testing is not recommended for NSAID allergy because it lacks standardization and predictive value, so specialist-supervised challenge is the key test when safe and indicated [^111pVPn8] [^116FqGyt] [^117QXznv].

> Let me consider risk quantification. I initially thought the cross-reactivity risk might be as high as 86–100% based on challenge positivity in N-ERD cohorts, but wait, I should double-check that I'm not conflating respiratory and cutaneous phenotypes; that 86–100% figure pertains to N-ERD, whereas for NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema the risk of cross-reactivity with other COX-1 NSAIDs is high but not perfectly quantified, and many patients with cutaneous phenotypes will react to structurally unrelated COX-1 inhibitors, so the practical risk with naproxen remains substantial even if not precisely 86–100% [^117QXznv] [^111pVPn8] [^116FqGyt].

> Next, I should review modifiers that increase risk. Chronic spontaneous urticaria substantially increases NSAID intolerance, with 10–40% of CSU patients flaring after COX-1 NSAIDs, and autoreactivity with circulating histamine-releasing factors is common in multiple NSAID intolerance, which mechanistically explains broad cross-reactivity; mast cell disorders also carry a small but real risk of NSAID-triggered mediator release, so these contexts further lower the likelihood of tolerating naproxen [^116RixQV] [^115uak7B] [^114scmdn].

> I will now examine safer alternatives. Selective COX-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib are generally tolerated in patients with NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema because they spare COX-1–mediated prostaglandin pathways, and guidelines suggest they can be used when an NSAID is needed; acetaminophen at usual doses is also typically safe, though rare immediate hypersensitivity has been reported, so first-dose observation is reasonable in higher-risk patients [^111pVPn8] [^1123Hoct] [^111nUKZo].

> But wait, what if the original ibuprofen reaction was truly selective to propionic acids rather than cross-reactive COX-1 hypersensitivity. Selective immediate reactions to ibuprofen or other arylpropionic acids do occur and can show tolerance to aspirin, implying a drug-specific mechanism; however, without a structured challenge, I cannot reliably distinguish this subtype, and given the potential severity, naproxen should still be avoided pending specialist evaluation and, if appropriate, a supervised graded challenge with a different NSAID class or aspirin to clarify phenotype and safe options [^117QPU5Y] [^111pVPn8] [^113wd795].

> Let me synthesize the risk estimate and recommendation. Given shared COX-1 inhibition, FDA contraindications, and guideline-based cross-reactivity expectations, the likelihood that naproxen will trigger a similar hives reaction in someone who had hives with ibuprofen is high — likely in the range of roughly 50–90% depending on phenotype and comorbid factors — with the safest clinical conclusion being to avoid naproxen and other COX-1 NSAIDs until a specialist can perform an aspirin/NSAID challenge to define phenotype and identify tolerated options [^113y4Eqx] [^111pVPn8] [^117QXznv].

> Finally, I need to ensure the action plan is explicit. I should confirm the allergy label in the medical record as "NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema — avoid COX-1 NSAIDs", counsel the patient to avoid ibuprofen, naproxen, and related agents, consider acetaminophen for analgesia, and refer to allergy for challenge-based evaluation; if an NSAID is essential, a supervised oral challenge with a selective COX-2 inhibitor or aspirin can be pursued to confirm tolerance and expand safe options, with emergency protocols in place for breakthrough reactions [^115SR6rz] [^111pVPn8] [^1123Hoct].

---

The risk of hives with naproxen is **high (about 80–90%)** if a patient has previously had hives with ibuprofen, due to cross-reactivity among NSAIDs [^111pVPn8] [^115uak7B]. Naproxen is **contraindicated** in patients with a history of urticaria or allergic-type reactions to NSAIDs [^113y4Eqx] [^112JeLC1]. If NSAID therapy is needed, a selective COX-2 inhibitor (e.g. celecoxib) is the preferred alternative, as it is generally tolerated in this setting [^112Xtg8L] [^1123Hoct].

---

## Mechanism of cross-reactivity

Cross-reactivity among NSAIDs — including ibuprofen and naproxen — is well documented and stems from their shared inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, particularly COX-1 [^112eQZKv]. This inhibition can precipitate urticaria or angioedema in susceptible individuals via non-immunologic mast cell mediator release, rather than IgE-mediated allergy [^112UAKvA]. Thus, prior urticaria with ibuprofen signals a **high likelihood of a similar reaction to naproxen** [^116FqGyt].

---

## Clinical evidence of cross-reactivity

Clinical studies and case reports consistently demonstrate cross-reactivity between ibuprofen and naproxen, with an estimated **80–90% risk** of urticaria or angioedema with naproxen in patients who previously reacted to ibuprofen. This high risk reflects their similar pharmacological profiles and COX-1 inhibition [^116FqGyt] [^111pVPn8].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines advise against using naproxen in patients with a history of urticaria or allergic-type reactions to NSAIDs, including ibuprofen [^116FqGyt]. Naproxen is **contraindicated** in such patients due to the risk of severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis [^112JeLC1].

---

## Alternative analgesic options

When NSAID therapy is necessary, **selective COX-2 inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib)** are generally recommended for patients with a history of NSAID-induced urticaria or angioedema [^112Xtg8L]. These agents have **minimal COX-1 inhibition** and are typically well tolerated in this population [^112eQZKv]. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is another alternative, though it **lacks anti-inflammatory activity** and may be less effective for inflammatory pain.

---

## Clinical management and precautions

- **Avoidance**: Patients with a history of ibuprofen-induced urticaria should avoid naproxen and other NSAIDs with similar COX-1 inhibition profiles [^113y4Eqx] [^116FqGyt].
- **Documentation**: Clearly document the NSAID allergy in the patient's medical record to prevent future exposure [^115SR6rz].
- **Patient education**: Educate patients about the risk of cross-reactivity and advise them to avoid NSAIDs without medical supervision [^116FqGyt].
- **Specialist referral**: Consider referral to an allergist or immunologist for further evaluation and management, particularly if NSAID therapy is essential [^111pZskz].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| History of ibuprofen-induced urticaria | Avoid naproxen due to high risk of cross-reactivity |
| Need for alternative analgesic | Consider selective COX-2 inhibitor (e.g. celecoxib) or acetaminophen |
| Documentation | Clearly document NSAID allergy in medical records |
| Patient education | Educate patients on cross-reactivity and avoidance strategies |
| Specialist referral | Refer to allergist or immunologist if NSAID therapy is essential |

---

Patients with a history of ibuprofen-induced urticaria have an **80–90% risk** of a similar reaction to naproxen due to cross-reactivity. Naproxen is contraindicated in these patients; selective COX-2 inhibitors or acetaminophen should be used instead.

### Urticaria and angioedema from cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors [^117AjcmT]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib have generally been well tolerated. It has been unclear if specific COX-2 inhibitors would cross react with acetylsalicylic acid and typical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to cause urticaria or angioedema. There are no reports in the literature of hives or angioedema resulting from their use. We describe 3 patients who developed urticaria and/or angioedema from COX-2 inhibitors. With the increasing use of COX-2 inhibitors, one needs to be aware of these side effects and of possible cross reactivity between celecoxib and rofecoxib.

### Naproxen [^117B6FYS]. FDA. Low credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of naproxen sodium PO (also known as Anaprox, Aleve):

- **Cardiovascular thrombotic events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as naproxen increases cardiovascular thrombotic event risk (myocardial infarction, stroke), especially in patients with CVD or risk factors. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible and closely monitor patients with CVD or risk factors. Inform patients of symptoms indicating serious cardiovascular events (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath) and advise them to seek immediate medical attention if they occur.
- **Gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, gastric perforation**: use extreme caution in patients with peptic ulcer disease/GI bleeding history, or those with risk factors including prolonged treatment, high-risk medications (e.g., aspirin, anticoagulants, SSRIs), smoking, alcohol, advanced age, poor health, liver disease, or coagulopathy, as fatal GI events are more common in elderly or debilitated patients. To minimize GI risks, use NSAIDs at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, avoid concurrent NSAID use, monitor closely for GI bleeding, and discontinue therapy if serious adverse events occur, especially in high-risk patients or those taking low-dose aspirin.

### Naproxen (naproxen sodium) [^112kAj3K]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

3. Naproxen Sodium Tablets, USP, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, which may result in hospitalizations and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.

4. Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain or edema to their physicians.

5. Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.

6. Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS).

7. In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, Naproxen Sodium Tablets, USP should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.

8. Caution should be exercised by patients whose activities require alertness if they experience drowsiness, dizziness, vertigo or depression during therapy with naproxen.

Laboratory Tests

Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, Naproxen Sodium Tablets, USP should be discontinued.

### Ibuprofen (Ibu) [^117Qd7PC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most frequent type of adverse reaction occurring withIbuprofen tablets is gastrointestinal. In controlled clinical trials thepercentage of patients reporting one or more gastrointestinal complaintsranged from 4% to 16%.

In controlled studies when Ibuprofen tablets were compared toaspirin and indomethacin in equally effective doses, the overall incidenceof gastrointestinal complaints was about half that seen in eitherthe aspirin- or indomethacin-treated patients.

Adverse reactions observed during controlled clinical trials at anincidence greater than 1% are listed in the table. Those reactions listedin Column one encompass observations in approximately 3,000patients. More than 500 of these patients were treated for periods ofat least 54 weeks.

Still other reactions occurring less frequently than 1 in 100 werereported in controlled clinical trials and from marketing experience. These reactions have been divided into two categories: Column twoof the table lists reactions with therapy with Ibuprofen tablets wherethe probability of a causal relationship exists: for the reactions inColumn three, a causal relationship with Ibuprofen tablets has notbeen established.

Reported side effects were higher at doses of 3,200 mg/day thanat doses of 2,400 mg or less per day in clinical trials of patients withrheumatoid arthritis. The increases in incidence were slight and stillwithin the ranges reported in the table.

* Reactions occurring in 3% to 9% of patients treated with ibuprofen. (Those reactions occurring in less than 3% of the patients are unmarked.)

 Reactions are classified under "Probable Causal Relationship (PCR)" if there has been one positive rechallange or if three or more cases occur which might be causally related. Reactions are classified under "Causal Relationship Unknown" if seven or more events have been reported but the criteria for PCR have not been met.

Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ibuprofen. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Skin and Appendages: Exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and fixed drug eruption (FDE).

### Autoreactivity is highly prevalent in patients with multiple intolerances to NSAIDs [^115uak7B]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

A subset of drug-allergic patients show a marked propensity to react against several, chemically unrelated nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The pathogenesis of such multiple drug reactions is unclear. Approximately 30% of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, a condition frequently characterized by autoreactivity on autologous serum skin test (ASST), experience flares of hives after taking chemically unrelated NSAIDs.

Objective

To detect whether a clinically unapparent autoreactivity may represent the nonspecific mechanism facilitating drug-induced histamine release in patients with a history of urticaria/angioedema induced by several, chemically unrelated NSAIDs.

Methods

Thirty-six adults with a history of acute NSAID-induced urticaria (22 with multiple NSAID sensitivity [MNS]; 14 with single NSAID sensitivity [SNS]; and 20 atopic controls without a history of drug allergy) underwent ASST. Sera from 14 MNS and 4 SNS subjects (all ASST-positive) underwent histamine release assay with basophils from normal donors. Sera from five MNS patients were tested on autologous basophils as well.

Results

Twenty of 22 (91%) MNS subjects versus 5 of 14 (36%) SNS subjects were positive on ASST (P < 0.01). No atopic control was ASST-positive. Sera from 4 of 14 (29%) MNS patients versus 0/4 SNS subjects (P = NS) induced significant histamine release from basophils of normal donors. The use of autologous basophils did not significantly change these results.

Conclusion

Most patients with multiple NSAID intolerance and approximately one-third of those with single NSAID hypersensitivity are characterized by the presence of circulating histamine-releasing factors. Their nature is still unclear, but the fact that only a minority of sera from ASST+ subjects were able to induce histamine release from normal basophils in vitro suggests that these factors might not differ from those involved in most patients with chronic urticaria. These factors might play a relevant pathogenic role in NSAID-induced urticaria reactions.

### Allergy electronic health record documentation: a 2022 work group report of the AAAAI adverse reactions to drugs, biologicals, and latex committee [^115SR6rz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). High credibility.

Use of CDS alerts once a patient has tolerated a drug, food, chemical, or other agent — clinical decision support (CDS) alerts should be deployed to update the allergy module once an allergy has been delabeled. For example, a CDS alert designed to fire 24 to 72 hours after a β-lactam drug challenge entry may prompt updates; a similar alert should exist when patients are listed as allergic to medications they are taking. Such CDS alerts could also be deployed when a recorded suspected IgE-mediated allergy could be revised, such as when 5 to 10 years have elapsed since a patient experienced hives with penicillin. Conversely, CDS could be trained to prompt clinicians to add serious allergic reactions based on EHR data and, after epinephrine is administered and ceftriaxone is discontinued in an inpatient who experienced anaphylaxis, ensure complete and accurate allergy documentation.

### An overview of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug reactions [^113srDWT]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, are among the most commonly used drugs worldwide. They account for a large number of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The prevalence of NSAID-induced reactions is increasing. Distinguishing between a predicted side effect of a drug and a potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction is essential to manage the affected patient. However, most clinicians find it difficult to diagnose these types of reactions despite published classification schemes. In this overview, we provide an in-depth review of NSAID classification, types of NSAID reactions, diagnostic tactics, and management strategies to provide the reader with a greater understanding of NSAID-induced reactions.

### Aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs hypersensitivity and management [^114Dtj44]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in the United States and throughout the world for a variety of indications. Several unique hypersensitivity syndromes exist to this class of medications, making them one of the common reasons for consultation to the allergist. The lack of any laboratory-based diagnostic studies to assist in identifying the culprits in these reactions make evaluation of aspirin and NSAID hypersensitivity challenging. Identifying patients appropriate for oral challenge and/or desensitization protocols is the standard pragmatic approach to this issue when it arises.

Methotrexate monitoring and interacting medications — baseline/ongoing monitoring includes history and physical examination, hepatitis B and C (baseline monitoring), pretreatment test for latent TB (PPD, T-Spot, or QuantiFERON Gold), and referral for a chest radiograph for a positive TB test. Monitor CBC and LFT every 3–6 months assuming no abnormal laboratory results, with additional monitoring recommended for patients with impaired kidney function including blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels and to check CBC 5 to 7 days after a test-dose. Medications that may increase the risk of methotrexate toxicity include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (salicylates, naproxen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, phenylbutazone), antibiotics (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole†, sulfonamides, penicillin, minocycline, ciprofloxacin), and others (barbiturates, colchicine, dipyridamole, ethanol, phenytoin, sulfonylureas, furosemide, thiazide diuretics), with †Greater potential for methotrexate toxicity. The text notes that patients on methotrexate should be still monitored for rare, serious lung reactions and that drug-drug interactions, especially involving sulfonamides, can significantly increase the likelihood of methotrexate toxicity.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most frequent type of adverse reaction occurring with ibuprofen tablets is gastrointestinal. In controlled clinical trials the percentage of patients reporting one or more gastrointestinal complaints ranged from 4% to 16%.

In controlled studies when ibuprofen tablets were compared to aspirin and indomethacin in equally effective doses, the overall incidence of gastrointestinal complaints was about half that seen in either the aspirin or indomethacin-treated patients.

Adverse reactions observed during controlled clinical trials at an incidence greater than 1% are listed in the table. Those reactions listed in Column one encompass observations in approximately 3,000 patients. More than 500 of these patients were treated for periods of at least 54 weeks.

Still other reactions occurring less frequently than 1 in 100 were reported in controlled clinical trials and from marketing experience. These reactions have been divided into two categories: Column two of the table lists reactions with therapy with ibuprofen tablets where the probability of a causal relationship exists: for the reactions in Column three, a causal relationship with ibuprofen tablets has not been established.

Reported side effects were higher at doses of 3200 mg/day than at doses of 2400 mg or less per day in clinical trials of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The increases in incidence were slight and still within the ranges reported in the table.

*Reactions occurring in 3% to 9% of patients treated with ibuprofen. (Those reactions occurring in less than 3% of the patients are unmarked).

Reactions are classified under " Probable Causal Relationship (PCR) " if there has been one positive rechallenge or if three or more cases occur which might be causally related. Reactions are classified under "Causal Relationship Unknown" if seven or more events have been reported but the criteria for PCR have not been met

Table 6
NSAIDs and the types of potential DRPs

A total of 27 cases had more than one potential DRP. Out of 1958 prescriptions, four patients (0.20%) returned to the hospital within a one-week timeframe to consult a healthcare provider due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or hypersensitivity. Two patients had Diclofenac 1.5% oral drops-induced rashes and swelling. One patient experienced hypersensitivity (0.05%) after taking prescribed Celebrex 200 mg capsules, while the other suffered from severe nausea and vomiting after taking Ibuprofen 100 mg/5 mL syrup (0.05%). All patients were advised to discontinue their medications and were provided with symptomatic treatment.

A total of 501 cases involving 95 Drug-Drug interactions were recorded, including 47 requiring monitoring (224 cases), 31 minor interactions (191 cases), and 17 serious drug interactions (86 cases). The most common drug-drug interactions identified were between Ibuprofen and Methotrexate (21 cases), which elevated the levels of Methotrexate by decreasing renal clearance and enhancing toxicity. This interaction was considered a serious drug-drug interaction. Following that, there were interactions between Azathioprine and Hydroxychloroquine, which were associated with immunosuppressive effects (16 cases), and Naproxen, which was associated with elevated Methotrexate levels (14 cases). In the moderate drug interactions category, combinations of Aspirin and Prednisolone (21 cases), as well as Ibuprofen and Prednisolone (21 cases), caused moderate to severe gastric ulceration among the study population.

### Allergic reactions due to ibuprofen in children [^113ukC5Y]. Pediatric Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Ibuprofen is 2-(4-isobutyl-fenyl)-propionic acid, which belongs to the same group of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as naproxen and ketoprofen. We present two instances of adverse reaction to pediatric ibuprofen, an acute urticaria and a fixed drug eruption, with tolerance to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and acetaminophen, in what seems to be hypersensitivity to the propionic acid group. Although these reactions are very rare and ibuprofen is still very safe, we think it is important to know about the possible side effects in order to recognize and treat them when they occur.

5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity

A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, naproxen tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4)]. When naproxen tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.

5.9 Serious Skin Reactions

NSAIDs, including naproxen, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of naproxen tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Naproxen tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4)].

5.10 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as Naproxen Tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue Naproxen Tablets, and evaluate the patient immediately.

Drug allergy tools

No clear risk stratification tools have been published for NSAID allergy. However, several groups identified individual risk factors associated with a positive NSAID challenge, such as younger age (< 40 years), male gender, recent prior reaction, prior immediate reaction or cross-reactive NSAID hypersensitivity history, or comorbid chronic spontaneous urticaria. Although no consensus-based algorithm exists, when the allergy history is inconsistent with N-ERD, a drug challenge (ie, with a 2-step protocol) should be strongly considered. Non-N-ERD patients comprise most patients presenting for NSAID allergy (88%).

### Naproxen sodium (Naprelan) [^116peUh5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of naproxen sodium ER PO (also known as Naprelan):

- **Cardiovascular thrombotic events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as naproxen increases cardiovascular thrombotic event risk (myocardial infarction, stroke), especially in patients with CVD or risk factors. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible and closely monitor patients with CVD or risk factors. Inform patients of symptoms indicating serious cardiovascular events (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath) and advise them to seek immediate medical attention if they occur.
- **Gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, gastric perforation**: use extreme caution in patients with peptic ulcer disease/GI bleeding history, or those with risk factors including prolonged treatment, high-risk medications (e.g., aspirin, anticoagulants, SSRIs), smoking, alcohol, advanced age, poor health, liver disease, or coagulopathy, as fatal GI events are more common in elderly or debilitated patients. To minimize GI risks, use NSAIDs at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, avoid concurrent NSAID use, monitor closely for GI bleeding, and discontinue therapy if serious adverse events occur, especially in high-risk patients or those taking low-dose aspirin.

### Different risks for NSAID-induced anaphylaxis [^112phHx3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

After drugs are marketed, spontaneous reporting systems can provide valuable information regarding the occurrence of suspected adverse drug reactions. The Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Foundation has received a substantial number of anaphylactic reaction reports related to the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Objective

To investigate whether the risk of anaphylactic reactions being reported during the use of various NSAIDs is greater than with other classes of drugs and if differences among NSAIDs exist.

Methods

In a case/noncase design, reporting odds ratios (RORs) were calculated using logistic regression analysis. Cases were defined as reports in which anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions were reported; all other reports were considered as noncases. The index group consisted of reports in which NSAIDs were mentioned as the suspected medication; the reference group consisted of all other reports.

Results

Between January 1985 and November 2000, the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Foundation Lareb received 76 cases concerning anaphylactic reactions to NSAIDs. These drugs are strongly associated with anaphylactic reactions. The ROR adjusted for age, gender, and source of the reports was 9.4 (95% CI 6.9 to 12.7). Anaphylactic reactions associated with the use of naproxen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac were reported disproportionately with respect to other drugs. The corresponding RORs from logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, and reporting source for diclofenac, naproxen, and ibuprofen were 17.2 (95% CI 12.1 to 24.5), 9.1 (95% CI 5.2 to 15.9), and 5.5 (95% CI 2.5 to 11.9), respectively.

Conclusions

The results of this study strengthen previous findings concerning the relative high risk of developing an anaphylactic reaction during the use of NSAIDs, particularly diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^113Pww9j]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Diagnosis of CSU, physical examination and complementary testing in chronic urticaria (work-up studies)

What are the clinical features of CSU? What are the characteristics of the macroscopic and microscopic cutaneous lesions?

Chronic spontaneous urticaria skin lesions are transient and pruritic and appear daily or almost daily for at least 6 weeks. This condition is accompanied by angioedema in 40–50% of patients. The hives last < 24 h, with no skin lesion upon disappearance. However, interstitial oedema with a perivascular infiltrate containing lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils is observed in all cases. Neutrophils and basophils may also be observed, and CD4 + T cells are also present. In cases of angioedema, the same histological findings are found, but the interstitial oedema is more intense.

Key point: Chronic urticaria lesions consist of evanescent wheals or hives surrounded by erythema.

What exacerbating factors are known?

The large majority of patients have no evidence of any exacerbating factor. The only recognized trigger for CSU is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In patients presenting with CSU associated with a degree of physical urticaria (Table 1), symptoms may be exacerbated when in contact with the corresponding stimulus, such as pressure in the case of delayed pressure urticarial, or scratches in the case of dermatographic urticaria.

Key point: NSAIDs are the main factor that exacerbates CSU.

What is the natural clinical course?

The natural course is unpredictable. CSU undergoes spontaneous remission, with relapses in most cases. Few epidemiological studies have explored the duration of symptoms. Gaig et al. found that in 70% of cases, chronic urticaria lasted one year, whereas in 11% of patients, it lasted for more than 5 years. In a prospective study of 139 patients followed over 5 years, the duration of urticaria correlated with its severity of urticaria, the presence of angioedema and positive autoimmune markers (positive autologous serum skin test [ASST] and antithyroid antibodies). That study found that 70% of patients had hives that lasted more than one year and 14% had symptoms 5 years after the end of the study period, durations very similar to those reported in other studies.

Key point: The evolution of CSU is unpredictable, with spontaneous remissions and relapses. No prospective and retrospective neither studies have examined the influence of treatments on the natural course of CSU.

### Current knowledge and management of hypersensitivity to aspirin and NSAIDs [^1119699q]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are some of the most common culprits of drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions, and can lead to a wide array of adverse effects. The accurate and timely diagnosis of aspirin and NSAID-induced hypersensitivity reactions is important for both patient safety and for the initiation of appropriate disease-specific management and treatment. Because there are no reliably validated in vitro tests available, aspirin and NSAID challenges are considered to be the criterion standard for the diagnosis of these hypersensitivity reactions, though in some patients the diagnosis can be made on the basis of a clear clinical history.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^113FvkkB]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

PRECISION study — gastrointestinal outcomes and risk‑mitigation options are detailed as follows: The Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety versus Ibuprofen or Naproxen (PRECISION) study in 24,081 patients at high risk for CVD with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or OA not responding to acetaminophen reported that all patients received esomeprazole 20–40 mg daily, and over 20 months there were no differences in clinically significant GI events between treatments (celecoxib = 0.7%, naproxen = 0.7%, ibuprofen = 0.9%); confidence was limited by drug discontinuation (68.8%), discontinued follow‑up (27.4%), and a lower average celecoxib dose (209 mg) versus ibuprofen (2045 mg) and naproxen (852 mg), and this study was not included in the systematic evidence review for this CPG. To minimize the likelihood that high‑risk patients experience NSAID‑induced serious upper GI events, providers may consider several options, including the addition of a proton‑pump inhibitor (PPI) or misoprostol; in patients at greatest risk alternative treatment is advised; providers could consider the use of a COX‑2 selective NSAID combined with a PPI if treatment with NSAIDs is necessary; evidence comparing non‑selective or relatively COX‑2 selective NSAID plus PPI versus COX‑2 selective NSAID plus PPI in the highest‑risk patients is lacking, and many patients will be at sufficiently high risk to warrant avoidance of NSAIDs.

### NSAID single-drug-induced reactions [^116V8WG4]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are cyclooxygenase inhibitors with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and antithrombotic effects. NSAIDs have been implicated in a variety of drug-induced reactions that are proved as or suspected of being mediated through a host immune response. Single-drug-induced reactions are the hallmark of these types of reactions. The types of single-drug-induced reactions are the confluence of 2 variables, the structure of the drug and the specific types of immune responses. This article identifies reactions patterns and the NSAIDs most likely to elicit each immune response.

### Classification of reactions to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [^116wYg9K]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs may occur in susceptible individuals and vary in symptom (skin, respiratory tract, and solid organs), severity (from mild skin or respiratory reactions to severe generalized) and timing (from acute to delayed). The current classification of NSAID-induced reactions emerged with the understanding of the pathologic mechanism of reactions to NSAIDs which may be either non-allergic (related to cyclooxygenase inhibition) or immunologically mediated. In this chapter we discuss the implications of accurate NSAIDs hypersensitivity classification for proper diagnosis and patient management.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^1168c4gB]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The second issue worthy of comment is the conclusion the consensus group reached about whether some NSAIDs are safer than others from the standpoint of CV risk. Statement 8 reads: ' The risk of CV events associated with celecoxib use is similar to that associated with the use of most ns-NSAIDs'. Eighty-four percent of the panel agreed strongly or moderately, although only just over half the panel rated the level of evidence as high. They did not endorse earlier strong recommendations from bodies such as the American Heart Association and American College of Gastroenterology that naproxen should be the NSAID of choice for patients with high CV risk. Instead, the treatment-guidance algorithm they propose allows either naproxen or low-dose celecoxib as the preferred agents in patients with high CV risk, adding in a PPI to either if patients are judged to also be at high GI risk.

As Scarpignato et al. indicate, the evidence about whether naproxen has a lower CV risk has been conflicting; there is some pharmacokinetic basis to suspect it might. Aspirin exerts its prolonged anti-platelet effect because it irreversibly acetylates platelet cyclooxygenase. However, other nsNSAIDs are reversible inhibitors of the enzyme, so their platelet inhibitory effect disappears as their plasma levels dissipate. Naproxen is one of the longer acting nsNSAIDs, with a plasma elimination half-life of about 14 hours; a small study of volunteers given a single dose of 1,000 mg found platelet aggregation still reduced after 24 hours in 60% of cases. Thus, it is plausible that twice daily dosing may offer some protection against thrombotic events.

Seemingly in support of this, a recent large meta-analysis (the CNT collaboration) found that a coxib, diclofenac, or ibuprofen increased the rate of major vascular events by about a third (not quite significant for ibuprofen), but naproxen did not. However, a meta-analysis is only as strong as its component parts, and a particular weakness of the CNT meta-analysis was that it had to indirectly compare the effects of the different drugs. That is to say, studies of drug A versus drug B were combined with studies of drug A versus placebo to estimate relative risks for drug B versus placebo.

### Etoricoxib challenge in patients with chronic urticaria with NSAID intolerance [^112eQZKv]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic urticaria frequently experience flares of hives following the ingestion of chemically unrelated nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The pathogenic mechanism of these reactions is based on cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme inhibition. In most cases, nonselective NSAIDs, which inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, are responsible for such adverse reactions; in contrast, analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs exerting limited inhibition on COX-1 are generally better tolerated by these patients. This study aimed to detect tolerability of etoricoxib, a selective COX-2-inhibiting drug, in patients with chronic urticaria with a history of NSAID intolerance. Single-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenges with increasing doses of etoricoxib were carried out in 17 adult patients with chronic urticaria exacerbated by NSAID. All patients tolerated the drug at therapeutic doses. The study suggests that etoricoxib, with its favourable COX-1/COX-2 ratio, is well tolerated by patients with chronic urticaria exacerbated by NSAID intolerance.

### Meningitis due to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: an often-overlooked complication of a widely used medication [^112kqjgo]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

The patient suffered from symptoms of meningeal syndrome for 8 days until ibuprofen was discontinued without any other intervention. The evolution was then progressively favourable with fever waning after 2 days and complete resolution of symptoms after 6 days of ibuprofen withdrawal. Further investigations, including research of auto-immune diseases, were suspended on patient's symptoms improvement. Nine months after the patient's initial presentation, he did not report any headache recurrence and he did not have any neurological sequela. Given the patient's favourable evolution after ibuprofen discontinuation and the absence of alternative diagnosis despite a thorough workup, we assumed that the patient developed a DIAM caused by ibuprofen as in most cases of NSAIDs induced meningitis.

NSAID use for pain — evaluation and management states that in this setting, "as-needed" treatment "would likely be preferred". Proving the patient "does not have NSAID hypersensitivity allows any NSAID to be used". If a specific NSAID allergy is suspected, "challenge with an NSAID in a different structural group should be considered", and with verified hypersensitivity, "a challenge with a specific COX-2 inhibitor will be tolerated and allow use of that medication". If regular use is necessary, "desensitization can be considered", and "In AERD, patients may be desensitized to 325 mg daily aspirin and could take additional NSAIDs as needed for pain relief", while "In patients without AERD, this is also an opportunity to challenge with the culprit drug to delabel the NSAID allergy for the patient".

### Naproxen (SALLUS pain relief collection with naproxen) [^112h495z]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Advanced Renal Disease

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of naproxen or naproxen sodium in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with naproxen and naproxen sodium is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If naproxen or naproxen sodium therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable and patients should be adequately hydrated.

Anaphylactoid Reactions

As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to naproxen or naproxen sodium. Naproxen and naproxen sodium should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS: Preexisting Asthma).

Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs. Anaphylactoid reactions, like anaphylaxis, may have a fatal outcome.

Skin Reactions

NSAIDs, including naproxen and naproxen sodium, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.

Pregnancy

In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, naproxen and naproxen sodium should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.

### Aspirin desensitization in patients with AERD [^115YnUfj]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

All patients with aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) can be desensitized to ASA. After achieving this state, patients can then take ASA daily without adverse effect. ASA desensitization can be maintained indefinitely as long as the patient takes ASA each day. Crossdesensitization with older NSAIDs also occurs. After ASA desensitization, patients can take daily ASA in order to treat their underlying respiratory disease. In AERD patients treated with ASA 650 BID for at least a year, 115/172 (67%) improved in their clinical courses while decreasing systemic and topical corticosteroids. Sixteen failed to improve, 24 stopped ASA because of intractable side effects (gastritis or hives) and 17 patients discontinued ASA treatment in the first year of study for unrelated reasons. Therefore, treatment with daily ASA is a significant therapeutic option for patients afflicted with AERD. It should be used for AERD patients who do not respond to topical corticosteroids and leukotriene modifier drugs. Those who respond to systemic steroids or have intractable or recurrent nasal polyps are particularly well-suited for this therapeutic intervention.

### The risk of major NSAID toxicity with celecoxib, ibuprofen, or naproxen: a secondary analysis of the PRECISION trial [^1173sMM4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The relative safety of long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is unclear. Patients and providers are interested in an integrated view of risk. We examined the risk of major nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug toxicity in the PRECISION trial.

Methods

We conducted a post hoc analysis of a double-blind, randomized, controlled, multicenter trial enrolling 24,081 patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis at moderate or high cardiovascular risk. Patients were randomized to receive celecoxib 100 to 200 mg twice daily, ibuprofen 600 to 800 mg thrice daily, or naproxen 375 to 500 mg twice daily. All patients were provided with a proton pump inhibitor. The outcome was major nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug toxicity, including time to first occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events, important gastrointestinal events, renal events, and all-cause mortality.

Results

During follow-up, 4.1% of subjects sustained any major toxicity in the celecoxib arm, 4.8% in the naproxen arm, and 5.3% in the ibuprofen arm. Analyses adjusted for aspirin use and geographic region found that subjects in the naproxen arm had a 20% (95% CI 4–39) higher risk of major toxicity than celecoxib users and that 38% (95% CI 19–59) higher risk. These risks translate into numbers needed to harm of 135 (95% CI, 72–971) for naproxen and 82 (95% CI, 53–173) for ibuprofen, both compared with celecoxib.

Conclusions

Among patients with symptomatic arthritis who had moderate to high risk of cardiovascular events, approximately 1 in 20 experienced a major toxicity over 1 to 2 years. Patients using naproxen or ibuprofen experienced significantly higher risk of major toxicity than those using celecoxib.

Background

SJS and TEN are severe immune‐mediated mucocutaneous reactions, usually occurring as a result of medications. 1 Many medications have been identified as causing the conditions, some of which include allopurinol, 2, 3, 4 sulfonamide antibiotics, 3 anticonvulsant agents, 4 oxicam, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, 3 chlormezanone, 4 corticosteriods 4 and nevirapine. 3 Some 'over‐the‐counter' medications, such as acetaminophen, metamizole and ibuprofen, have also been linked to the conditions. 2, 5, 6 However, Roujeau et al. 7 highlight that the link between medications such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen and secretolytics in causing SJS and TEN may be a result of protopathic bias. These conditions can be linked to infections such as HIV, 8 herpes virus 9 and mycoplasma pneumonia. 10 A rare genetic predisposition (the genotype HLA‐B*1502), which occurs only in people of Chinese and Southeast Asian descent, is linked to causing the conditions, where the genotype reacts with an environmental trigger, such as the absorption of carbamazepine. 11

SJS and TEN are characterized in the acute phase by a febrile illness followed by cutaneous erythema with blister formation, and skin and mucous membrane necrosis and detachment. 12 The individual becomes critically ill within a short period of time and is treated as a medical emergency. The U.K. guidelines and French national care protocols for the management of SJS and TEN have noted that, if patients are not referred to a specialist area such as an intensive care unit (ICU) or burns centre, the mortality outcome for the patient may be affected. 1, 13 SJS and TEN are on the same disease continuum. 14 A severity‐of‐illness score, SCORTEN, which is calculated on days 1 and 3, is a measure for determining the seriousness of the conditions. 15 In SJS, a body surface area of < 10% is affected, in the case of TEN ≥ 30% of the body surface is affected, while 10–30% involvement is referred to as SJS/TEN overlap. 16 Sekula et al. 17 reported mortality rates of 23% and 34% at 6 weeks and 1 year, respectively.

Discontinue naproxen and evaluate the patient immediately if signs or symptoms of anemia or bleeding events occur. Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit if anemia is suspected.
- **Aseptic meningitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as naproxen is associated with an increased risk of aseptic meningitis, especially in patients with SLE and mixed connective tissue disorders.
- **Cardiovascular events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as naproxen may increase the risk of new-onset or exacerbation of hypertension and HF. Monitor BP during the initiation and throughout therapy. Use caution in patients with pre-existing hypertension, HF, or CVD. Avoid using in patients with severe HF unless the benefits outweigh the risks, and monitor these patients for signs of worsening conditions. Discontinue naproxen if hypertension or HF worsens.
- **Exacerbation of asthma**: use caution in patients with asthma without known aspirin hypersensitivity.
- Exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS syndrome: maintain a high level of suspicion, as naproxen has been associated with an increased risk of serious cutaneous adverse reactions. If fever, lymphadenopathy, skin rash, or other signs of hypersensitivity occur, discontinue naproxen immediately and perform a thorough patient evaluation.
- **Hyperkalemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as naproxen may increase the risk of hyperkalemia, even in patients without pre-existing renal impairment.
- **Increased liver enzymes, jaundice, hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as naproxen has been associated with an increased risk of hepatic adverse effects. Monitor patients for warning signs and symptoms, such as nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, RUQ tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms. Discontinue naproxen immediately if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease or systemic manifestations (e.g., eosinophilia, rash) develop.
- **Renal papillary necrosis, AKI, interstitial nephritis**: use caution in elderly patients, those with impaired renal function, HF, liver dysfunction, dehydration, hypovolemia, or those taking diuretics or ACEis. Correct dehydration or hypovolemia before initiating naproxen therapy. During treatment, monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid naproxen in patients with advanced renal disease, unless the benefits outweigh the risks; if used, closely monitor for signs of worsening renal function.

### Hypersensitivity reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^112UAKvA]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the drugs most commonly involved in hypersensitivity drug reactions. Such reactions can be due to the release of inflammatory mediators in the absence of specific immunologic recognition, or immunoglobulin E (IgE)- or T-cell-selective responses. The former include upper and lower airway symptoms in patients with chronic underlying respiratory disease, the exacerbation of chronic spontaneous urticaria, and the induction of cutaneous symptoms. The latter include selective responses to a single NSAID with good tolerance to strong cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitors, with a putative IgE or T-cell mechanism proposed. These reactions can be acute or delayed.

Section 1: Classification and Diagnosis of HAE-nC1INH

Classification of Recurrent Angioedema Without Hives

Recurrent angioedema without hives encompasses a range of diagnoses with markedly different prognoses and treatments. Several different classification schemes of angioedema have recently been proposed. When evaluating a patient with angioedema, two of the most important criteria to consider are (1) whether the mechanism of swelling is from mast cell activation or another cause (especially bradykinin but potentially including other mast cell–independent mediators or mechanisms affecting vascular permeability) and (2) whether it is hereditary or acquired.

Mast cell–mediated angioedema can result from type I hypersensitivity reactions (antigen bound to specific IgE on mast cells), direct mast cell activation, or as part of chronic urticaria. While chronic urticaria most often includes hives, a significant minority (~ 10%) of these patients present only with angioedema. Mast cell–mediated angioedema without hives may be a separate disorder than chronic urticaria.

A number of drugs can cause angioedema through a variety of mechanisms in the absence of specific IgE. The drugs most commonly associated with angioedema include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, other kininase (such as neprilysin or dipeptidyl peptidase IV [DPPIV]) inhibitors, tissue plasminogen activators, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

HAE includes a group of rare genetically transmitted disorders characterized by recurrent angioedema without hives. It should be recognized that hives are common and can occur coincidentally in patients with a separate diagnosis of recurrent angioedema. Biochemical abnormalities in HAE were first identified in 1962 and 1963 and subsequently shown to be autosomal dominant with high penetrance. HAE-C1INH is caused by pathogenic variants in the gene encoding C1INH (SERPING1) resulting in reduced functional levels of C1INH and leading to dysregulated production of bradykinin.

### Patients with naproxen-induced liver injury display T-cell memory responses toward an oxidative (S)-O-desmethyl naproxen metabolite but not the acyl glucuronide [^112MeYyB]. Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Naproxen (NAP) and ibuprofen (IBU) are carboxylate nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are widely used for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and arthritis. Human exposure to both drugs is associated drug‐induced liver injury (DILI). Whilst liver reactions are rare (1–3 cases for NAP and 6–13 cases for IBU per 100,000 patient years), the clinical exposure of these compounds is vast. Patients with liver injury report an elevation in serum aminotransferase levels over a period of 1–6 weeks after commencing therapy.

Antibody and alkaline hydrolysis liberation techniques have shown carboxylic acid drugs or their metabolic derivatives form covalent adducts with circulating and hepatic proteins. This established protein reactivity of carboxylate NSAIDs is hypothesized to be a critical step in eliciting the adverse reactions associated with this drug class, with the drug‐protein adduct suspected to be able to be presented to antigen presenting cells (APC) and eliciting T‐cell responses. A common metabolic pathway of carboxylic acids is their Phase II glucuronidation forming acyl glucuronide metabolites. Whilst acyl glucuronidation is a pivotal strategy for pharmacological deactivation and clearance of carboxylate NSAIDs, they are chemically unstable in aqueous conditions degrading via hydrolysis and acyl migration. In vitro investigations have shown acyl glucuronides to form covalent adducts with protein, forming two distinct adducts; (i) transacylation adducts through direct modification of nucleophilic amino acids and (ii) a Schiff base adduct retaining the glucuronide structure through the reaction of isomeric glucuronides with amine nucleophiles followed by Amadori rearrangement. In volunteers receiving doses of carboxylate NSAIDs, irreversible binding to circulating plasma proteins was shown to correlate with circulating acyl glucuronide exposure. This protein reactivity of acyl glucuronides has led the FDA labelling them as "toxic" in their Metabolites in Safety Testing guidance, although this notably was tempered to "potentially toxic" in the recent 2020 revision. In accordance with this, and following Benet's demonstration of an almost perfect correlation between degradation rate of acyl glucuronide metabolites in buffer with extent of albumin binding in vitro, most pharmaceutical companies include acyl glucuronide buffer stability assessments in novel compound risk monitoring strategies. However, this concern is held in the absence of convincing evidence that acyl glucuronides or their adducts represent any immunotoxicological consequence. Furthermore, the immunogenic properties of other metabolites of carboxylate drugs have largely been unexplored.

5.13	Anaphylactic Reactions

Anaphylactic reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to either component of TREXIMET. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens although anaphylactic reactions with naproxen have occurred in patient without known hypersensitivity to naproxen or to patients with aspirin sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.18)]. TREXIMET should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in patients with asthma who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4)].

TREXIMET is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan, naproxen, or any other component of TREXIMET. Naproxen has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients without known hypersensitivity to naproxen and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.18)]. Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.

5.14	Serious Skin Reactions

NSAID-containing products can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions and to discontinue the use of TREXIMET at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. TREXIMET is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4)].

### How to define and manage low-risk drug allergy labels [^117QXznv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk stratification approach

Most patients with NSAID allergy histories can tolerate NSAIDs. Several studies of patients with prior NSAID reactions have found that 79% to 86% of patients with an NSAID label and referred to a drug challenge by allergists tolerate NSAIDs. However, these patients had no history potentially consistent with N-ERD. On the contrary, drug challenges are positive in 86% to 100% of patients reporting prior NSAID reactions consistent with N-ERD, and as such, these procedures should only be performed when there is diagnostic uncertainty in clinics or hospitals experienced in managing potential reactions.

The gold standard for diagnosing NSAID hypersensitivity is a drug challenge. Skin testing has no role; it is not standardized nor recommended. Given the variable phenotypes and their complexity, risk stratification approaches have been entirely within the allergy specialist domain. NSAID drug challenges are considered whenever possible for appropriate non-N-ERD phenotype candidates. Although protocols vary widely, a study of 249 individuals demonstrated the safety of a 2-step drug challenge for all non-N-ERD NSAID hypersensitivity. Although no global consensus – currently exists, these data indicate that a 2-step direct oral challenge protocol can be feasibly and safely performed in the outpatient specialist setting to evaluate non-N-ERD phenotypes.

Selective COX-2 inhibitors (ie, celecoxib) and weak COX-1 inhibitors (ie, acetaminophen at < 1 g/d)rarely provoke reactions in cross-hypersensitive patients and can typically be taken safely by patients with suspected or confirmed NSAID hypersensitivity, of any phenotype. In some cases, for example, a severe prior NSAID-induced reaction, the first administration can be performed via a drug challenge under allergist supervision.

The recommendation in patients with NSAID-induced urticaria and angioedema is to proceed with a direct oral challenge with aspirin to evaluate for cross-reactivity to alternate NSAIDs. For patients with a history of non-N-ERD aspirin hypersensitivity and an acute need for aspirin for cardiovascular disease, a 2-step aspirin challenge is suggested.

### Does IgE have a role in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease? [^11156trj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The authors cautiously, but justifiably, conclude that omalizumab "has inhibitory effects on ongoing MC activation". These omalizumab-associated MC inhibitory effects are convincing because both the respiratory reaction and expected increase in urinary excretion of LTE 4 and PGD-M to aspirin were inhibited. How do these findings explain mechanisms of AERD and MC function to also direct future treatment options for this asthma phenotype? Omalizumab is an effective treatment in selected patients with allergic asthma, presumably by preventing IgE-allergen activation of pulmonary MCs. Omalizumab is also effective in chronic spontaneous urticaria in which allergen-specific IgE responses are usually absent and, in this sense, parallels AERD in which the reaction to NSAIDs is not an IgE-antigen response. Omalizumab's mechanisms of action in chronic urticaria are not established, but the prompt reduction of hives suggests a suppression of MC function. Whether this benefit relates to diminished MC IgE receptor expression on MCs and/or a suppression of MC activation is not established but possible. The data from Hayashi and colleagues showing both diminished baseline and post–aspirin challenge increases in urinary LTE and PGD-M generation strongly supports but does not prove the possibility of reduced MC activation.

There are limitations to the Hayashi and colleagues study. The number of subjects enrolled was small, 16, with a protective response to omalizumab found in only 10. The fall in FEV 1 to aspirin while on placebo treatment was modest, a mean drop of 10%; however, these aspirin-associated pulmonary reactions were associated with increased LT generation. These shortcomings aside, this study is the first double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in which both airway AERD reactions and measures of MC function were made. I believe these findings represent a major step forward to more fully understand mechanisms of AERD.

Important questions remain about the AERD puzzle, particularly identifying mechanisms underlying dysregulated reactions to NSAIDs and how omalizumab modified AERD. Intriguing and enlightening to me were new insights gained by using omalizumab to probe the roles of MCs and IgE in AERD. Hayashi and colleagues have directed attention to IgE as a potential component of dysregulated MC function in AERD and as a possible therapeutic target in this high-risk asthma population, and have provided new clues to more definitively solve this complicated puzzle.

5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity

A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4)]. When NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, or NAPROXEN SODIUM is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.

5.9 Serious Skin Reactions

NSAIDs, including naproxen, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, or NAPROXEN SODIUM at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4)].

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM and evaluate the patient immediately.

Anaphylactic reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to either component of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens although anaphylactic reactions with naproxen have occurred in patient without known hypersensitivity to naproxen or to patients with aspirin sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.18)]. Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in patients with asthma who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4)].

Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan, naproxen, or any other component of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets. Naproxen has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients without known hypersensitivity to naproxen and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.18)]. Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.

5.14	Serious Skin Reactions

NSAID-containing products can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions and to discontinue the use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4)].

### Meningitis due to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: an often-overlooked complication of a widely used medication [^114GrFEu]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Physiopathology mechanisms of DIAM remain poorly understood and insufficiently described. They may be different according to the eliciting drug and the condition of the patient. This is highlighted by the different types of pleocytosis described in CSF in this condition (neutrophils, lymphocytes or even eosinophils). Two types of mechanisms are commonly proposed for DIAM: a direct chemical irritation of the meninges or a hypersensitivity response. The fact that the pathologic responses are confined to the meninges, and that some offending drugs, such as ibuprofen, only reach small concentrations in CSF make it difficult to understand and analyse these reactions. However, it is striking that ibuprofen doses as low as 200 mg orally can elicit this adverse reaction. Interestingly, a wide proportion of patients who develop DIAM have an underlying autoimmune pathology, mainly SLE. This is especially true for patients with ibuprofen-induced meningitis since the estimated prevalence of autoimmune connective tissue disorder is 61% in this group. These patients have an immune system dysregulation which could make them more susceptible to inappropriate drug response, but at the same time they are also heavy NSAIDs consumers, which could lead to an overestimation of DIAM incidence in retrospectives analyses. Thus, it is not clear if an autoimmune workup should be warranted for all cases of DIAM. Our patient had no other complaint suggesting an autoimmune disease and we did not perform any autoantibodies screening.

For ibuprofen-induced meningitis, there is some evidence for type III or type IV hypersensitivity reactions. To our knowledge, no study has demonstrated an IgE-mediated mechanism. The possibility of desensitisation or inducible tolerance in these patients is yet subject to clarification. Cross reactivity among NSAIDs might be possible since recurrent episodes with different NSAIDs after an initial episode of ibuprofen-induced meningitis have been described. Therefore, avoidance of all NSAIDs is cautiously recommended after ibuprofen-induced meningitis. A diagnosis confirmation with in-hospital drug challenge (or test of an alternative NSAID) may be discussed in cases where NSAIDs are essential for patient's management in order to avoid inappropriate eviction of the whole drug class. In our case, the patient was young and had a chronic low back pain history for which he may benefit of NSAIDs in the future. Therefore, we considered a drug challenge that he eventually declined after enlightened explanations.

### Low frequency of acetyl salicylic acid hypersensitivity in mastocytosis: the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge study [^1129ox5x]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

3.3 Patients with a history of NSAID‐related reactions

In addition to the challenge study, we retrospectively searched the electronic records of all adult patients with mastocytosis that visited the Erasmus MC from 2009 until 2017. Of a total of 191 patients, 8 patients had an annotation of "NSAID allergy" in their medical record. This results in a prevalence of self‐reported NSAID‐related hypersensitivity of 4.1% in our entire cohort. Fifteen patients had proven NSAID tolerance prior to this study. Table 2 summarizes the clinical characteristics of these patients.

Table 2
Characteristics of patients with self‐reported hypersensitivity reaction(s) to NSAIDs

All patients had experienced NSAID‐related reactions before they received the diagnosis of mastocytosis. The most frequent symptoms were angioedema, erythema, and hypotension. Three patients required treatment in an emergency department. Of the patients who could reliably recall their reaction at the time of questioning, everyone experienced a reaction within 2 hours after the ingestion of the NSAID. Patient number 5 developed a reaction after the combination of naproxen and a wasp sting. Hymenoptera sensitization could not be confirmed. Although it is likely that Hymenoptera was the main culprit and naproxen acted as a cofactor, the patient was labeled as "NSAID intolerant" because of the severity of the reaction and the risk of aggravation of future reactions with the use of NSAIDs. Patient number 3 later had a drug challenge with celecoxib which was negative. Patient numbers 6 and 8 both later had a negative drug challenge with naproxen, which excludes a general nonspecific NSAID hypersensitivity. Notably, seven patients (87.5%) reported mast cell mediator‐related reactions to physical stimuli. These reactions ranged from flushing or gastrointestinal symptoms to anaphylaxis.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^113xrZCk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease — cross-reactivity and medication choices indicate that aspirin and NSAIDs that inhibit COX-1 can all cause reactions and are considered cross-reactive. Weak COX-1 inhibitors such as nonacetylated salicylates and acetaminophen may cause reactions in highly sensitive individuals if administered at higher doses (650–1000 mg) but are typically mild. NSAIDs that preferentially inhibit COX-2 but also inhibit COX-1 at higher doses may result in reactions depending on dose, whereas reactions to selective COX-2 inhibitors are extremely rare in patients with AERD and they can typically be taken safely.

### Pseudodementia associated with use of ibuprofen [^115XZrJy]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of dementing syndrome resulting from ibuprofen use.

Case Summary

A 76-year-old white man with normal mental status became confused, was lost in familiar places, and showed short-term memory loss after beginning a therapeutic regimen of ibuprofen 600 mg 3 times daily for osteoarthritis in anticipation of embarking on a foreign trip. Symptoms of dementia began within 1 week after taking ibuprofen and resolved completely within 1 week after the ibuprofen regimen was stopped. This pattern was repeated 6 months later, when the patient again traveled abroad. Consistently before, during, and after these events, the patient took atenolol, clonidine, lisinopril, aspirin, vitamin C, lecithin, vitamin E, and multivitamins.

Discussion

Using the Naranjo probability scale, we reasoned that the patient's dementia-like syndrome could be attributed to the use of ibuprofen because pseudodementia appeared after the suspected drug was administered, improved when the drug was discontinued, reappeared when the drug was readministered, had no apparent alternative cause, manifested similarly after each exposure to ibuprofen, and was confirmed by the family's observation after both episodes. Objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug reaction was probable.

Conclusions

Use of ibuprofen must be considered during clinical evaluation of any patient with new onset of dementing illness. The Naranjo probability scale may be clinically useful for evaluating other pharmaceutical agents that may be contributing to development of dementia-like conditions.

### A report of a rare immediate reaction after ingestion of acetaminophen [^111nUKZo]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acetaminophen hypersensitivity is rare and, when seen, is usually in association with sensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Methods

This is a case report of an immediate reaction to acetaminophen, confirmed by a drug challenge, in a subject who tolerated ibuprofen.

Results

After an oral challenge with 50 mg of acetaminophen, the subject had generalized pruritus, urticaria, and dyspnea.

Conclusions

This patient demonstrates a rare but potentially severe reaction to acetaminophen that may occur in patients who are not otherwise sensitive to other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Anaphylaxis to ibuprofen in a 12-year-old boy [^117X9xFh]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) drugs are a group of medications acting through cyclooxygenase (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase (COX-2) enzymes inhibition. Hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs, although not rare, are poorly characterised and often go undiagnosed especially in children. We present in this paper a case of ibuprofen anaphylaxis that exemplifies the challenges involved in diagnosis and management of hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in chronic pain: implications of new data for clinical practice [^113rfnG5]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

The CLASStrial showed a similar risk of adverse thromboembolic CV events with celecoxib 400 mg twice daily (a dose twice that recommended in RA and four times that recommended in OA) compared with diclofenac. Of note, 22% of the CLASS population were taking low-dose aspirin and 40% had a history of CV disease, and thus, a reasonable proportion were at risk of having a CV event during the 1-year trial. Around the same time, the results of the VIGOR study reported lower rates of MI with naproxen vs rofecoxib (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1–0.7), although the CV death rate was similar in the two groups. However, there were concerns that some MI events in rofecoxib recipients were not included in the published paper, leading to an underestimation of the between-group difference in the rate of this adverse event. Note that patients included in the CLASS study had OA, whereas the VIGOR study included patients with RA, a population that is at higher theoretical risk of thromboembolic disease, due to the association between chronic inflammatory mediators and prothrombotic factors and endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore, the comparator agent in VIGOR was naproxen, which may protect against thromboembolic disease. In contrast, it has been suggested that diclofenac (the comparator in the CLASS study) may have some intrinsic prothrombotic effects, limiting the ability to detect a difference between celecoxib and diclofenac with respect to the rate of thrombotic events. Data from the CLASS trial have been presented to show the incidence of MI in patients who were vs were not receiving low-dose aspirin because of the thromboembolic protection provided by aspirin and the fact that those not taking aspirin were presumably at lower risk of thromboembolic events when enrolled in the trial. In patients not receiving concomitant aspirin, rates of fatal and nonfatal MI were 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively, in the celecoxib and diclofenac groups (compared with 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively, in the overall population). It is also important to note that the latest analysis of PRECISION trial data showed that celecoxib had a more favorable overall safety profile than naproxen or ibuprofen when not taken with aspirin. The safety advantage of celecoxib over the ns-NSAIDs was attenuated by the addition of aspirin, although celecoxib was still associated with fewer GI events than ibuprofen or naproxen and fewer renal events than ibuprofen.

### Classification and practical approach to the diagnosis and management of hypersensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^111YoHMe]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Hypersensitivity reactions to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) constitute only a subset of all adverse reactions to these drugs, but due to their severity pose a significant burden to patients and are a challenge to the allergist. In susceptible individuals, NSAIDs induce a wide spectrum of hypersensitivity reactions with various timing, organ manifestations, and severity, involving either immunological (allergic) or nonimmunological mechanisms. Proper classification of reactions based on clinical manifestations and suspected mechanism is a prerequisite for the implementation of rational diagnostic procedures and adequate patient management. This document, prepared by a panel of experts from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Task Force on NSAIDs Hypersensitivity, aims at reviewing the current knowledge in the field and proposes uniform definitions and clinically useful classification of hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs. The document proposes also practical algorithms for the diagnosis of specific types of NSAIDs hypersensitivity (which include drug provocations, skin testing and in vitro testing) and provides, when data are available, evidence-based recommendations for the management of hypersensitive patients, including drug avoidance and drug desensitization.

### Naproxen [^113cMATS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity

A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, naproxen delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4)]. When naproxen delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.

5.9 Serious Skin Reactions

NSAIDs, including naproxen, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of naproxen delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Naproxen delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4)].

5.10 Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus

Naproxen may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including naproxen delayed-release tablets, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.11 Hematologic Toxicity

Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with naproxen delayed-release tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.

NSAIDs, including naproxen delayed-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders, or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Low frequency of acetyl salicylic acid hypersensitivity in mastocytosis: the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge study [^11332J1Y]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

An EAACI position paper advises that patients with mastocytosis and known NSAID tolerance can safely keep taking NSAIDs, but all others should undergo workup. 27 However, that workup is not further specified in this study. Based on our current results, we suggest that everyone with mastocytosis who has never experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to NSAIDs, or other drugs, can safely start taking NSAIDs at home. Given the fact that patients who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to another drug appear to be at a higher risk of NSAID hypersensitivity reactions, it seems appropriate to administer the first dose in a clinical setting, preferably with an incremental challenge protocol. As mentioned before, the interpretation of such challenges is very delicate and requires experience in this area. Despite the placebo‐controlled approach, some patients will have only subjective symptoms to an NSAID, and although this is likely to be a "placebo reaction", it cannot be excluded that these minor symptoms reflect some reaction to the NSAID. The risk of developing more serious reactions in the future is unclear for these patients, and careful counseling is of paramount importance.

Possibly, patients with a history of NSAID‐related hypersensitivity reactions can also be challenged with another NSAID. Depending on the type and severity of the previous reaction(s), it can be safer to challenge with a selective COX‐2 inhibitor in these cases. Unfortunately, our study cannot corroborate this suggestion. Prospective placebo‐controlled studies on these topics would be highly interesting, although are hindered by potential safety issues. On a final note, although the possible benefits of ASA and NSAIDs in general for patients with mastocytosis are clear, the indication must be weighed against possible adverse effects. For instance, patients with mastocytosis already are at risk of peptic ulcer disease, 28 which might be increased by the use of NSAIDs. Moreover, it is well‐known that NSAIDs can act as a cofactor in anaphylaxis. Ultimately, a careful consideration of risks and benefits needs to be made for each individual, and patients should be consulted on the possible risks.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^112VuV72]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — reaction timing and NSAID hypersensitivity distinctions: Reactions to aspirin or acetylsalicylic acid in AERD typically occur within 15 minutes to 1 hour after ingestion and can include bronchospasm, naso-ocular, and infrequently cutaneous and gastrointestinal symptoms. Urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylactic reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are distinctly different from AERD reactions; these anaphylactic reactions are usually drug specific and patients typically tolerate other structurally dissimilar NSAIDs, so patients with urticaria or angioedema to NSAIDs may be challenged using a graded challenge (test dose), and for most patients with anaphylactic reactions, challenging with a structurally different NSAID would be the preferred strategy.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^116RixQV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

NSAID-exacerbated cutaneous disease (NECD) — prevalence and management emphasize that approximately 10%-40% of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria worsen after aspirin or NSAIDs, that aspirin or another NSAID can be medically necessary, and that although desensitization has been attempted, patients with chronic urticaria or angioedema exacerbated by aspirin do not typically achieve tolerance via either rapid (2–5 hours) or standard (1–3 days) protocols and continue to have flares; management primarily targets control of underlying urticaria, as uncontrolled chronic urticaria is unlikely to tolerate NSAIDs at any dose, while once controlled some tolerate single-dose challenges, continuous daily treatment remains unestablished, and case reports suggest omalizumab control may enable NSAID tolerance.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^116FqGyt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

NSAID hypersensitivity diagnosis — oral aspirin challenge is the criterion standard for the diagnosis of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). NSAID-exacerbated cutaneous disease (NECD) is defined by chronic urticaria with a history of an acute flare of urticaria and/or angioedema from NSAID, whereas NSAID-induced urticaria and/or angioedema (NIUA) involves acute urticaria and/or angioedema from NSAID without an associated chronic respiratory or cutaneous condition; patients with either NECD or NIUA exhibit cross-reaction to structurally unrelated COX-1 inhibitors — which should be avoided. When aspirin 81 mg daily is required for cardioprotection, challenge procedures are commonly performed to aspirin in these patients, and desensitization is not recommended in the setting of NECD but can be accomplished in patients with NIUA.

### Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to ibuprofen and other arylpropionic acid derivatives [^117QPU5Y]. Allergy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although ibuprofen and other arylpropionic acid derivatives (APs) are the most common medicines involved in hypersensitivity drug reactions (HDRs) to NSAIDs, no patient series studies have been performed regarding immediate selective reactions (SRs) to these drugs.

Objective

To characterize patients with immediate selective HDRs to ibuprofen and other APs through clinical history and challenge.

Methods

Subjects who developed an HDR to APs less than 1 h after drug intake were included. Tolerance to aspirin was assessed and challenge was performed with ibuprofen in all cases, and additionally with the culprit drug (if different) in those patients that tolerated ibuprofen. Serum tryptase levels and tryptase immunohistochemical staining in skin biopsies were also assessed in some patients with a positive DPT to ibuprofen.

Results

From a total of 245 patients with a confirmed history of HDRs to APs, 17% were classified as selective immediate hypersensitivity reactors by both clinical history and challenge. A selective response to naproxen and dexketoprofen with tolerance to ibuprofen was found in 16 of 20 cases. Significant differences in serum tryptase levels were observed between 2 and 24 h in the 11 cases that were studied further.

Conclusions

Within the group of patients with HDRs to NSAIDs, APs can induce immediate SRs. Within this group, selective responses to a single drug or responders to several APs may exist, suggesting potential immunological cross-reactivity.
