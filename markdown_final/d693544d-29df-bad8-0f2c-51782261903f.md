## Question

Exenatide in AIS management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of exenatide in acute ischemic stroke management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why exenatide was hypothesized to help in AIS. Then, I should verify the pivotal randomized trial data and its limitations. Next, I will review guideline positions and regulatory status. After that, I need to distinguish acute-phase management from secondary prevention. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight knowledge gaps that could change practice in the future.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and rationale. Hyperglycemia in acute ischemic stroke is common and worsens outcomes, and insulin protocols are cumbersome and hypoglycemia-prone, so a glucose-dependent agent with potential neuroprotection was attractive; exenatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, crosses the blood–brain barrier in animal models and has shown neuroprotective effects independent of glycemia, which supports a mechanistic rationale for early administration in AIS [^114ji7au] [^113n5oPb] [^1155ekJM].

> Wait, let me verify the pivotal evidence. The TEXAIS randomized clinical trial enrolled adults with AIS within 9 hours of onset and compared exenatide 5 mcg subcutaneously twice daily for 5 days versus standard care; the primary outcome of a ≥ 8-point NIHSS improvement at 7 days was not significantly different (61.2% vs 56.7%; adjusted OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.79–1.88; P = 0.38), and there was no difference in 90-day functional outcomes, although exenatide significantly reduced hyperglycemia without any hypoglycemia and caused only mild, transient gastrointestinal adverse effects [^1128o32d] [^113n5oPb] [^117GLbco].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review limitations that could obscure benefit. TEXAIS was underpowered because recruitment was stopped early at 350 patients (target 528), used an open-label design, and did not capture infarct volume or recanalization status, which could confound neurological outcomes; importantly, reperfusion rates exceeded 50% and were balanced between groups, but the trial was not designed to detect differences in infarct growth or reperfusion injury mitigation, so a true neuroprotective signal could have been missed [^113n5oPb] [^116ewMPv].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. The 2019 AHA/ASA AIS guideline states that pharmacologic neuroprotective agents are not recommended, reflecting decades of negative trials; TEXAIS does not overturn this, and exenatide is not included in acute-phase recommendations, whereas the 2021 AHA/ASA secondary prevention guideline recommends GLP-1 receptor agonists for patients with T2D and ASCVD to reduce cardiovascular events, including stroke, which pertains to chronic risk reduction rather than acute treatment [^114neEki] [^1167nFBt] [^116dfqKG].

> I need to check regulatory status to avoid overreach. Exenatide is FDA-approved only for type 2 diabetes mellitus, not for acute ischemic stroke, so any inpatient use for AIS would be off-label and should be framed as investigational or within a trial context until definitive efficacy is established [^111j3bpH] [^113PCmyj].

> Let me consider the distinction between acute-phase management and secondary prevention. In the acute window, TEXAIS shows no neurological benefit, so exenatide should not be used routinely for AIS neuroprotection; in contrast, for long-term stroke risk reduction in T2D, multiple meta-analyses and guidelines support GLP-1 receptor agonists, with semaglutide and dulaglutide showing significant reductions in nonfatal stroke, supporting their use for prevention in appropriate patients with diabetes and high cardiovascular risk [^115A5u7n] [^113HFHqE] [^1167nFBt].

> But wait, what if there is a subgroup or mechanistic niche where exenatide helps. Preclinical data suggest time-sensitive neuroprotection and potential benefits when given very early, and a post hoc meta-analytic signal with nerinetide in ultra-early, reperfusion-selected patients hints that neuroprotection may require strict timing and reperfusion context; similarly, real-world data associating GLP-1 use with better post-stroke outcomes are hypothesis-generating but not definitive for acute-phase therapy, underscoring the need for adequately powered, imaging-enriched trials starting within 3 hours and integrated with reperfusion strategies [^115BFjJo] [^115AkJgv] [^111FcG8a].

> I should double-check practical implications for current care. For acute hyperglycemia in AIS, guidelines continue to endorse insulin-based protocols targeting 140–180 mg/dL with close monitoring to avoid hypoglycemia; exenatide is not a substitute for insulin in the acute setting, though its favorable hypoglycemia profile is intriguing and warrants further study, particularly in continuous glucose monitoring frameworks that capture dynamic glycemic excursions linked to infarct growth [^111j5G3A] [^117NtFun] [^115eDj5u].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Exenatide should not be used for acute ischemic stroke neuroprotection outside of a clinical trial, as TEXAIS showed no neurological benefit despite improved glycemic control; however, for patients with T2D at high cardiovascular risk, GLP-1 receptor agonists are recommended for stroke risk reduction in secondary prevention, and future research should test earlier initiation, imaging selection of salvageable tissue, and integration with reperfusion to detect a neuroprotective signal that has eluded broad, pragmatic designs [^1128o32d] [^1167nFBt] [^115A5u7n] [^111Shirx].

---

Exenatide is **not recommended** for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) management because the TEXAIS randomized trial showed no improvement in neurological outcomes at 7 days or 90 days compared with standard care [^1128o32d] [^113n5oPb]. While exenatide reduced hyperglycemia without hypoglycemia, this did not translate into clinical benefit, and current AHA/ASA guidelines do not endorse its use in AIS [^114neEki]. Exenatide may be considered for glycemic control in AIS patients with diabetes, but insulin remains the standard for acute hyperglycemia management [^111j5G3A].

---

## Clinical evidence from the TEXAIS trial

The TEXAIS trial was a **phase 2, multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint (PROBE) study** that enrolled 350 patients with AIS within 9 hours of onset [^113n5oPb]. Patients were randomized to receive either exenatide (5 mcg subcutaneously twice daily for 5 days or until discharge) or standard care. The primary outcome was a ≥ 8-point improvement in NIHSS score or NIHSS 0–1 at 7 days; secondary outcomes included functional independence (mRS 0–2) at 90 days and safety endpoints [^1128o32d].

Key results include:

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference between exenatide and standard care (61.2% vs 56.7%; adjusted OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.79–1.88; P = 0.38) [^1128o32d].
- **Secondary outcomes**: No significant differences in 90-day functional independence or other neurological endpoints [^113n5oPb].
- **Safety**: Exenatide significantly reduced hyperglycemia without hypoglycemia, but caused mild gastrointestinal side effects (nausea/vomiting in 3.5% vs 0% with standard care) [^113n5oPb].

---

## Mechanisms of action relevant to AIS

Exenatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, has **plausible mechanisms** relevant to AIS:

- **Glycemic control**: Glucose-dependent insulin secretion and glucagon suppression, reducing hyperglycemia without hypoglycemia [^114ji7au].
- **Neuroprotection**: Preclinical data suggest anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects, with potential to reduce infarct size and promote recovery [^115BFjJo] [^1155ekJM].
- **Blood–brain barrier penetration**: Exenatide may cross the BBB, enabling direct neuroprotective effects [^114ji7au].

Despite these mechanisms, the TEXAIS trial did not demonstrate clinical benefit, indicating that **translation from preclinical to clinical outcomes remains uncertain** [^1128o32d].

---

## Comparison with standard care

Standard care for AIS includes reperfusion therapies (IV thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy), antiplatelet therapy, blood pressure management, and glycemic control with insulin [^112ccePF] [^111KTQkh]. Exenatide was compared with standard care in TEXAIS and **did not show superiority** in neurological outcomes, limiting its role to adjunctive glycemic control rather than disease-modifying therapy [^1128o32d].

---

## Safety profile

Exenatide had a **favorable safety profile** in TEXAIS, with no hypoglycemia and minimal gastrointestinal adverse effects. However, long-term safety data in AIS are limited, and ongoing monitoring is warranted if used off-label for glycemic control [^113n5oPb].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current AHA/ASA guidelines **do not recommend** exenatide for AIS management. They emphasize evidence-based reperfusion therapies, antiplatelet therapy, and insulin-based glycemic control, with no endorsement of GLP-1 agonists for acute neuroprotection or glycemic management in AIS [^114neEki] [^111KTQkh].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Ongoing research may clarify the role of GLP-1 agonists in AIS, including:

- **Timing and dosing**: Earlier administration or different dosing strategies may influence outcomes [^115BFjJo].
- **Patient selection**: Identifying subgroups (e.g. diabetics, severe hyperglycemia) who may benefit from GLP-1 agonists [^115A5u7n].
- **Combination therapies**: Exploring synergistic effects with reperfusion therapies or other neuroprotective agents [^111Shirx].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

Based on current evidence, **exenatide should not be used** for neuroprotection or as a primary treatment in AIS. It may be considered for glycemic control in AIS patients with diabetes, but insulin remains the standard of care for acute hyperglycemia management [^111KTQkh]. If used, it should be administered cautiously with monitoring for gastrointestinal side effects and in consultation with endocrinology specialists.

---

Exenatide is **not recommended** for AIS management due to lack of clinical benefit in the TEXAIS trial. It may be considered for glycemic control in diabetic AIS patients, but insulin remains the standard. Ongoing research may refine its role, but current guidelines do not endorse its use in AIS.

The study TEXAIS was published by Christopher F Bladin and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Stroke. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the TEXAIS study, the trial question was: what is the role of exenatide in patients with AIS? In the TEXAIS study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the TEXAIS study, the population was: 346 patients (105 female, 241 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with AIS ≤ 9 hours of stroke onset. The key exclusion criteria were known allergy/hypersensitivity to exenatide; receipt of other glucose-like peptide-1 receptor agonists; history of active pancreatitis; impaired renal function. In the TEXAIS study, the interventions were: n = 174 exenatide (a subcutaneous injection of 5 mcg BID for 5 days or until hospital discharge) n = 172 standard care (stroke unit care as per local hospital protocols). In the TEXAIS study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in ≥ 8-point improvement in NIHSS score at 7 days poststroke (61.2% vs. 56.7%; OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.88). In the TEXAIS study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in mRS scores 0–2 at day 90 (74% vs. 74.7%; OR 0.96, 96% CI 0.56 to 1.66) No significant difference in median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score at day 90 (0 points vs. 1 points; AD -1 points, 95% CI -2.73 to 0.73) Borderline significant increase in median difference in National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score between baseline and day 90 (3 points vs. 3 points;). In the TEXAIS study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in death and serious adverse events at day 90. significant difference in at least 1 episode of nausea and vomiting (3.5% vs. 0%) and adverse event (36.2% vs. 26.2%) over treatment period. In the TEXAIS study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with AIS ≤ 9 hours of stroke onset, exenatide was not superior to standard care with respect to ≥ 8-point improvement in NIHSS score at 7 days poststroke.

### Incretin-based antihyperglycemic agents for the management of acute ischemic stroke in patients with diabetes mellitus: a review [^113jvm1p]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke. Moreover, patients with DM suffer more severe strokes and have worse functional outcome following an acute stroke than patients without DM. In this context, data from animal studies and emerging evidence from clinical studies suggest that incretin-based antihyperglycemic agents might exert beneficial effects in patients with DM who suffer ischemic stroke. It appears that these agents exert neuroprotective actions that might both reduce infarct size and promote recovery. The present review summarizes the evidence on the potential role of incretin-based antihyperglycemic agents in the management of acute ischemic stroke.

### Management of poststroke hyperglycemia: results of the TEXAIS randomized clinical trial [^113n5oPb]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

Hyperglycemia in acute ischemic stroke reduces the efficacy of stroke thrombolysis and thrombectomy, with worse clinical outcomes. Insulin-based therapies are difficult to implement and may cause hypoglycemia. We investigated whether exenatide, a GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonist, would improve stroke outcomes, and control poststroke hyperglycemia with minimal hypoglycemia.

METHODS:

The TEXAIS trial (Treatment With Exenatide in Acute Ischemic Stroke) was an international, multicenter, phase 2 prospective randomized clinical trial (PROBE [Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-Point] design) enrolling adult patients with acute ischemic stroke ≤ 9 hours of stroke onset to receive exenatide (5 µg BID subcutaneous injection) or standard care for 5 days, or until hospital discharge (whichever sooner). The primary outcome (intention to treat) was the proportion of patients with ≥ 8-point improvement in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (or National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores 0–1) at 7 days poststroke. Safety outcomes included death, episodes of hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and adverse event.

RESULTS:

From April 2016 to June 2021, 350 patients were randomized (exenatide, n = 177, standard care, n = 173). Median age, 71 years (interquartile range, 62–79), median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 4 (interquartile range, 2–8). Planned recruitment (n = 528) was stopped early due to COVID-19 disruptions and funding constraints. The primary outcome was achieved in 97 of 171 (56.7%) in the standard care group versus 104 of 170 (61.2%) in the exenatide group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.79–1.88]; P = 0.38). No differences in secondary outcomes were observed. The per-patient mean daily frequency of hyperglycemia was significantly less in the exenatide group across all quartiles. No episodes of hypoglycemia were recorded over the treatment period. Adverse events of mild nausea and vomiting occurred in 6 (3.5%) exenatide patients versus 0 (0%) standard care with no withdrawal.

CONCLUSIONS:

Treatment with exenatide did not reduce neurological impairment at 7 days in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Exenatide did significantly reduce the frequency of hyperglycemic events, without hypoglycemia, and was safe to use. Larger acute stroke trials using GLP-1 agonists such as exenatide should be considered.

### Incretin-based antihyperglycemic agents for the management of acute ischemic stroke in patients with diabetes mellitus: a review [^116fxS1H]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Several preclinical studies consistently showed that GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce infarct volume and improve the functional outcome after ischemic stroke. These beneficial effects appear to be mediated by anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic actions of these agents. On the other hand, glucose lowering does not appear to be implicated in the neuroprotective effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists, suggesting that they could have a role in the management of both diabetic and non-diabetic patients who suffer an ischemic stroke. More limited data suggest that DPP-4 inhibitors might also ameliorate neuronal damage following an ischemic stroke. However, it is unknown whether these results will translate into a clinical benefit in humans. Well-designed studies are needed to clarify the role of incretin-based antihyperglycemic agents in the management of acute ischemic stroke and to define the optimal dose and time of administration.

### Incretin-based antihyperglycemic agents for the management of acute ischemic stroke in patients with diabetes mellitus: a review [^111j5G3A]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability worldwide. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke. Indeed, patients with T2DM have a 2- to 6-fold higher risk of ischemic stroke and are also at higher risk of stroke recurrence. Moreover, T2DM is associated with more severe stroke, resulting in higher rates of mortality and long-term dependency.

During the acute phase of ischemic stroke, hyperglycemia is frequently observed and is associated with larger infarct and worse outcome. Serum glucose levels persistently greater than 200 mg/dl, especially during the first 24 h after stroke, independently predict expansion of the ischemic area and poor neurological outcomes, suggesting that management of hyperglycemia is an essential part of the acute management of patients with ischemic stroke. Regarding in-patient glycemic control, the American Diabetes Association recommends a glucose target between 140 and 180 mg/dl for most patients in non-critical care units and subcutaneously administered insulin is considered the agent of choice. Recent guidelines for the early management of acute stroke issued by the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association make similar recommendations. However, insulin therapy is associated with increased incidence of hypoglycemia and does not appear to reduce mortality in hospitalized patients. Moreover, treatment with insulin does not appear to have any effect on the neurological deficit after an acute ischemic stroke.

In this context, emerging evidence suggests that incretin-based antihyperglycemic agents, i.e. dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, might exert beneficial effects in patients with T2DM who suffer ischemic stroke. It appears that these agents exert neuroprotective actions that might both reduce infarct size and promote recovery. The present review summarizes the evidence on the potential role of incretin-based antihyperglycemic agents in the management of acute ischemic stroke. We also briefly discuss the effects of these agents on the incidence of ischemic stroke in patients with T2DM. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

### Management of poststroke hyperglycemia: results of the TEXAIS randomized clinical trial [^117GLbco]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemia in acute ischemic stroke reduces the efficacy of stroke thrombolysis and thrombectomy, with worse clinical outcomes. Insulin-based therapies are difficult to implement and may cause hypoglycemia. We investigated whether exenatide, a GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonist, would improve stroke outcomes, and control poststroke hyperglycemia with minimal hypoglycemia.

Methods

The TEXAIS trial (Treatment With Exenatide in Acute Ischemic Stroke) was an international, multicenter, phase 2 prospective randomized clinical trial (PROBE [Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-Point] design) enrolling adult patients with acute ischemic stroke ≤ 9 hours of stroke onset to receive exenatide (5 µg BID subcutaneous injection) or standard care for 5 days, or until hospital discharge (whichever sooner). The primary outcome (intention to treat) was the proportion of patients with ≥ 8-point improvement in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (or National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores 0–1) at 7 days poststroke. Safety outcomes included death, episodes of hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and adverse event.

Results

From April 2016 to June 2021, 350 patients were randomized (exenatide, n = 177, standard care, n = 173). Median age, 71 years (interquartile range, 62–79), median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 4 (interquartile range, 2–8). Planned recruitment (n = 528) was stopped early due to COVID-19 disruptions and funding constraints. The primary outcome was achieved in 97 of 171 (56.7%) in the standard care group versus 104 of 170 (61.2%) in the exenatide group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.79–1.88]; P = 0.38). No differences in secondary outcomes were observed. The per-patient mean daily frequency of hyperglycemia was significantly less in the exenatide group across all quartiles. No episodes of hypoglycemia were recorded over the treatment period. Adverse events of mild nausea and vomiting occurred in 6 (3.5%) exenatide patients versus 0 (0%) standard care with no withdrawal.

Conclusions

Treatment with exenatide did not reduce neurological impairment at 7 days in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Exenatide did significantly reduce the frequency of hyperglycemic events, without hypoglycemia, and was safe to use. Larger acute stroke trials using GLP-1 agonists such as exenatide should be considered.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

American Heart Association (AHA) acute ischemic stroke (AIS) guideline update — scope, population, and methods are summarized as follows: The guidelines detail prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation and treatment with intravenous and intra-arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including secondary prevention measures that are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks, and provide general recommendations to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. Recommendations are restricted to adults and to secondary prevention measures that are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks, and recommendations for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are not included. The guideline uses the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/AHA Class of Recommendations (COR) and Level of Evidence (LOE) format, with new or revised recommendations accompanied by 250-word knowledge bytes and data supplement tables in Data Supplement 1 and Data Supplement 2. Development and review steps included peer review of the draft 2018 guidelines by 4 expert peer reviewers; approvals on November 29, 2017 and December 11, 2017; online publication January 24, 2018; an April 18, 2018 revision deleting 7 specific recommendations and all of Section 6; submission in June 2018 with inclusion of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with > 100 participants and clinical outcomes at least 90 days after AIS; and subsequent review by 14 peer reviewers, with additional RCTs addressing AIS published between November 2018 and April 2019 reviewed.

### Management of poststroke hyperglycemia: results of the TEXAIS randomized clinical trial [^114ji7au]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

An alternative to insulin-based therapies is glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists that stimulate the release of insulin and suppress glucagon release. Importantly, the actions of GLP-1R agonists are highly glucose dependent — as blood glucose levels decrease, the GLP-1 activity subsides, significantly reducing the likelihood of hypoglycemia. GLP-1 receptors are present throughout the body, including the brain. Exenatide is a rapid-onset (median 2.1 hours) GLP-1 receptor agonist, administered as a subcutaneous injection, which is lipophilic, readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, and limits glucose transport into the cerebral gray matter. Animal studies indicate that exenatide attenuates oxidative-induced cellular apoptosis, promotes antiapoptotic proteins, and reduces brain infarct volume. Importantly, this effect is independent of insulin and hence independent of glucose levels. Exenatide is, therefore, potentially protective against the major mechanisms of cellular injury following stroke, both directly (anti-inflammatory/apoptosis) and indirectly (antihyperglycemia). The rapid onset of action of exenatide is favorable to target the time-critical ischemic penumbra.

The aim of the TEXAIS randomized clinical trial (Treatment With Exenatide in Acute Ischemic Stroke) was to determine if the early use of exenatide can improve neurological outcomes by reducing the occurrence of hyperglycemia (without causing hypoglycemia) in acute ischemic stroke.

Effects of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists on Ischemic Stroke Risk

Several large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluated the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on the incidence of ischemic stroke in patients with T2DM. In the Evaluation of Lixisenatide in Acute Coronary Syndrome (ELIXA) trial (n = 6068 patients with an acute coronary event within 180 days before screening), lixisenatide had no effect on the risk of nonfatal stroke during a median follow-up of 25 months. In the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) (n = 14,752 patients with or without established cardiovascular disease), extended-release exenatide also had no effect on the incidence of fatal or nonfatal stroke. In the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) trial (n = 9340 patients ≥ 50 years old with coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease of stage 3 or greater, or chronic heart failure of New York Heart Association class II or III or ≥ 60 years old with microalbuminuria or proteinuria, hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction, or ankle–brachial index < 0.9), liraglutide had no effect on the incidence of fatal or nonfatal stroke or transient ischemic attack during a median follow-up of 3.8 years. In the Harmony Outcomes (n = 9463 patients with established coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral vascular disease), albiglutide had no effect on the risk of fatal or nonfatal stroke during a median follow-up of 1.6 years. In contrast, in the Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN-6) (n = 3297 patients ≥ 50 years old with coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease of stage 3 or greater, or chronic heart failure of New York Heart Association class II or III or ≥ 60 years old with microalbuminuria or proteinuria, hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction, or ankle–brachial index < 0.9), treatment with semaglutide reduced the risk of nonfatal stroke by 39% during a median observation time of 2.1 years. In a meta-analysis of ELIXA, LEADER, and SUSTAIN-6, GLP-1 receptor agonists had no effect on the risk of stroke.

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) — glucose management specifies that hypoglycemia should be treated and provides a reasonable target range for hyperglycemia treatment. Hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 60 mg/dL) should be treated in patients with AIS, and evidence indicates that persistent in-hospital hyperglycemia during the first 24 hours after AIS is associated with worse outcomes than normoglycemia; thus, it is reasonable to treat hyperglycemia to achieve blood glucose levels in a range of 140 to 180 mg/dL and to closely monitor to prevent hypoglycemia.

### Stroke prevention and treatment in people with type 2 diabetes: is there a role for GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) analogues? [^1121usYP]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death, and people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have a greater risk of stroke and death or disability from stroke. The underlying pathophysiology associating stroke and T2D is complicated by the association of risk factors for stroke frequently seen in people with T2D. Treatments to reduce the excess risk of new-onset stroke or to improve outcomes in people with T2D following stroke would be of major clinical interest. In practice, the focus of care in people with T2D remains treating risk factors for stroke, such as lifestyle and pharmacological interventions for hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and glycemic control. More recently, cardiovascular outcome trials primarily designed to assess the cardiovascular safety of GLP-1RAs (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor analogues) have consistently observed a reduced stroke risk in people with T2D. This is supported by several meta-analyses of cardiovascular outcome trials observing clinically important risk reductions in stroke. Moreover, phase II trials have described reductions in poststroke hyperglycemia in people with acute ischemic stroke suggestive of improved outcomes following admission to hospital with acute stroke. In this review, we discuss the increased risk of stroke in people with T2D and outline the key associated mechanisms responsible. We discuss the evidence from cardiovascular outcome trials exploring GLP-1RA use and highlight areas of potential interest for future work in this rapidly developing area of clinical research.

GLP-1 Receptor Agonists and Acute Ischemic Stroke

Activation of GLP-1 receptor by GLP-1 has been shown to be neurotrophic and to protect neurons against various insults. Moreover, GLP-1 has been shown to cross the blood–brain barrier. Liraglutide can also pass the blood–brain barrier but it is unclear whether other GLP-1 receptor agonists have the same property. Accordingly, several preclinical studies evaluated the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists in models of acute ischemic stroke. In these studies, a consistent reduction in infarct size was noted, along with an improvement in the functional outcome and a decrease in the neurological deficit. These benefits have been observed with the use of both exenatide and liraglutide. In the only study that compared these agents, they were similarly effective in improving brain perfusion and motor and cognitive deficits and in reducing brain edema, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in diabetic mice with middle cerebral artery-induced stroke.

Notably, a neuroprotective effect was observed when GLP-1 receptor agonists were administered either prior to or after the ischemic insult. However, in one study, exenatide was not beneficial when administered more than 3 h after ischemic stroke, suggesting that there is a limited time frame for this treatment. In contrast, liraglutide improved the functional outcome even when administered 1 day after stroke. In studies that compared different times of administration after stroke, GLP-1 receptor agonists appeared to be more beneficial when administered immediately after the ischemic insult.

Very few studies compared the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists with other antihyperglycemic agents in animal models of ischemic stroke. In an early study in diabetic and non-diabetic rats, treatment with liraglutide for 14 days prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced stroke reduced the infarct volume and the neurological deficit more than vehicle and also attenuated oxidative stress, increased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and reduced the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, resulting in decreased apoptosis of neuronal cells in the ischemic hemisphere. These benefits were similar in diabetic and non-diabetic rats. In contrast, stroke volume, neurological deficit, and severity of oxidative stress were similar in diabetic rats receiving either insulin or vehicle. In a more recent study in diabetic rats, treatment with liraglutide for 7 days prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced stroke reduced brain infarct volume whereas metformin had no effect despite similar reductions in blood glucose levels.

### Glucagonlike peptide-1 receptor agonists versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors in ischemic strokes with diabetes 2 [^114zRB9a]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with comorbid type 2 diabetes (T2D) have an adverse prognosis after stroke including increased risk of recurrent stroke, mortality, readmission, and poorer cognitive outcome. Given the high prevalence of T2D in ischemic stroke patients, 33% in a recent meta‐analysis, this represents an important challenge within stroke care. Despite the significantly increased risk of stroke as well as adverse poststroke outcomes, there is a paucity of available treatments that specifically target the risk of stroke in patient with T2D.

A series of large‐scale cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) have created robust clinical evidence of cardiovascular benefits with a reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events with glucagonlike peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) and sodium–glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) in patients with T2D and high cardiovascular risk or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Two CVOTs using GLP‐1RA also demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of nonfatal stroke and a subsequent meta‐analysis of all the CVOTs of GLP‐1RAs found a reduction in the risk of fatal or nonfatal stroke. As SGLT2i did not show a reduction in stroke and dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors (DPP‐4is) have not shown cardiovascular benefits, the recent stroke and diabetes guidelines recommend the use of GLP‐1RA in patients with a history of AIS or transient ischemic attack.

However, research focusing on real‐world populations of AIS patients with comorbid T2D including comparative analyses of the newer glucose‐lowering medications is sparse.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes, including stroke severity, mortality, recurrent stroke, readmission, and length of stay in AIS patients with comorbid T2D treated with either a GLP‐1RA or DPP‐4i prior to the index stroke.

CONCLUSIONS

We found an association of reduced risk of a "very severe stroke" and lower 30‐ and 365‐day mortality in AIS patients with T2D treated with a GLP‐1RA prior to the AIS compared to patients treated with a DPP‐4i. These results together with the results of the CVOTs underline the importance of considering GLP‐1RA in patients at high risk of a stroke or after a stroke.

Third, reperfusion rates were higher than expected (> 50% of patients) but were evenly matched across the 2 groups. TEXAIS did not record brain infarct size or vessel recanalization status (after tPA and mechanical thrombectomy), all factors which could potentially impact changes in NIHSS in the 2 treatment groups. However, reperfusion therapy had no differential effect on primary outcome (Figure 2).

Fourth, TEXAIS was a pragmatic study, and while all sites were encouraged to follow standard stroke treatment guidelines, 60% of the patients were recruited by the top 3 sites, and local hospital practices may possibly have impacted generalizability of the results.

In conclusion, treatment with exenatide in routine patients with acute ischemic stroke significantly reduced the frequency of hyperglycemic events and was safe to use but did not result in a significant reduction in neurological impairment at 7 days. The favorable profile of exenatide (and possibly other GLP-1 agonists) warrants further investigation in larger clinical trials.

### Management of poststroke hyperglycemia: results of the TEXAIS randomized clinical trial [^115eDj5u]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

TEXAIS is the first phase 2 multicenter randomized clinical trial investigating the use of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide, administered within 9 hours of stroke onset, in patients with acute ischemic stroke, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes, or admission blood glucose level (cFPG). No significant differences were observed between the exenatide and standard care groups in the primary efficacy end point of early neurological improvement, mortality, or secondary efficacy end points of functional recovery at 90 days. The presence of diabetes, or admission glucose level, did not affect the primary outcome.

Importantly, the safety profile of exenatide was highly favorable with no episodes of hypoglycemia. No dextrose rescue therapy was required, despite being used in a diverse patient population in which a significant proportion were normoglycemic. The use of exenatide resulted in consistently lower daily glucose readings, and significantly fewer recorded episodes of hyperglycemia across all IQRs. Some patients (3.5%) treated with exenatide experienced nausea (and occasional vomiting), a well-described side effect of GLP-1 agonists. However, these events were mild, short-lived, and easily treated.

The detection, timing, and subsequent treatment of PSH are highly variable. In TEXAIS, the time window of 9 hours was focused on early treatment, while the ischemic penumbra is susceptible to the impact of hyperglycemia. The median time from stroke onset to first dose was 6.7 hours, indicating that treatment was initiated early enough to achieve this. Studies using continuous glucose monitoring have identified 2 phases of PSH: an early phase within the first 8 hours and a later phase at about 66 hours poststroke. Studies have demonstrated that persistent hyperglycemia on serial glucose monitoring is an independent predictor of stroke infarct expansion as measured by magnetic resonance imaging and is associated with increased short- and long-term mortality and worse functional outcome. Interestingly, for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, the serial profile of glycemic status (ie, the dynamic change over time) was a more robust indicator of stroke evolution and clinical outcome than an isolated measure of glucose on admission to hospital.

### Incretin-based antihyperglycemic agents for the management of acute ischemic stroke in patients with diabetes mellitus: a review [^1155ekJM]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

The beneficial effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists in animal models of ischemic stroke appear to be GLP-1 receptor-dependent, since knockout mice not expressing GLP-1 receptors show no benefit from GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment. Moreover, GLP-1 receptor expression is reduced in ischemic brain regions and this decrease is reversed by GLP-1 receptor agonists. Several mechanisms appear to be implicated in the neuroprotective effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists. These agents attenuate microglial activation in the infracted area, which also appears to play a role in neuronal death. GLP-1 receptor activation also inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 through the modulation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. The latter induces an inflammatory response, which also contributes to neuronal death. Exenatide was also shown to reduce the production of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha. Inhibition of neuronal apoptosis has also been shown to be associated with a decrease in infarct size during treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Activation of GLP-1 receptor also reduces oxidative stress following ischemic stroke and this appears to contribute to the reduction in infarct size. On the other hand, the neuroprotective effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists appear to be glucose-lowering independent, since they are observed in non-diabetic animals and despite the absence of change in glucose levels. It also appears that GLP-1 receptor agonists do not affect cerebral blood flow.

### Outcomes of GLP-1 receptor agonist use following ischemic stroke: a propensity score-matched real-world analysis [^111FcG8a]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1As) have been shown to be beneficial in primary stroke prevention for high-risk patients. However, their benefits following major ischemic events are unclear. Herein, we present real-world analysis assessing outcomes of GLP-1A following major ischemic event.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study utilized the TriNetX platform. Adults (≥ 18 years) with AIS treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) were identified; exposure was any US FDA-approved GLP-1A initiated within 6 months of the index stroke. The comparator was IVT-treated patients without GLP-1A exposure. Outcomes assessed at 5 years included major adverse health-care events (MAHEs): number of emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality. One-to-one propensity score matching balanced baseline characteristics. We estimated risk difference/risk ratio/odds ratio, 5-year Kaplan-Meier (KM) event probabilities with log-rank tests, and Cox hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs; small cells (≤ 10) were masked per data-use agreement.

Results

Of 69,005 eligible patients, 549 received GLP-1A and 68,938 did not; after matching, 432 per group were analyzed. GLP-1A exposure was associated with lower all-cause mortality (7.4% vs 14.1%; HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39–0.93), lower ED visits (37% vs 47%; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63–0.95), and lower inpatient hospitalizations (31.9% vs 45.4%; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55–0.85); KM log-rank p ≤ 0.05 for all. Median time to first MAHE was longer with GLP-1A (1293 vs 897 days for hospitalization and 886 vs 603 days for ED visits).

Conclusions

GLP-1A therapy after IVT is associated with favorable long-term safety and utilization signals and warrants confirmation in a prospective study with standardized initiation.

### Management of acute ischemic stroke [^112ccePF]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) consists of a multidisciplinary approach that more than ever requires the involvement of the critical care specialist. Before the 1990s, treatment options for AIS were limited and mainly focused on symptomatic management, secondary prevention, and rehabilitation. Since then, the entire field was revolutionized by two major introductions. The first groundbreaking innovation that dramatically transformed acute stroke care on the basis of a National Institutes of Neurological Disease and Stroke (NINDS) landmark study was the Federal Drug Administration's (FDA) approval of IV tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) in 1995. IV-tPA remained the mainstay of treatment for about 2 decades until 2015 when more sophisticated clinical trials showed robust outcomes for endovascular therapy (EVT). In the ICU, additional strategies aimed at optimizing patient's physiology can interface between triage and/or revascularization and discharge to rehabilitation.

### The use of GLP-1 receptor agonists in hospitalised patients: an untapped potential [^114zQrs6]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

In a pilot study of 11 patients with acute ischaemic stroke, subcutaneous exenatide (for a median of 6 days) restricted the incidence of hyperglycaemia (> 8.6 mmol/L) to less than 5%, with no hypoglycaemia. Of note, nausea and vomiting occurred in half the cohort, 7 which may prove to be a limiting factor in future studies. A large phase 2 trial is underway: the Trial of Exenatide in Acute Ischaemic Stroke (TEXAIS) is a 3‐year, multicentre, open‐label randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing exenatide with standard care. It aims to recruit 528 patients with a clinically meaningful primary end‐point of major neurological improvement at 7 days. 13

Exendin‐4 is a 39 amino acid peptide originally isolated from the oral secretions of the Gila monster lizard. It shares 53% sequence homology with GLP‐1 and has been used in a number of preclinical studies. 33 Murine studies of ischaemic brain damage using Exendin‐4 34 and liraglutide 35 show that they are capable of crossing the blood‐brain barrier to act directly on the brain to produce neuroprotective and anti‐inflammatory effects. 36, 37 The neuroprotective properties that GLP‐1 RAs have shown in animal studies have also led to their evaluation in patients with brain injury after cardiac arrest. A dual‐centre study in Denmark has investigated the neuroprotective effects of exenatide administered within 4 hours of the return of spontaneous circulation to comatose patients resuscitated from out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest. 14 The efficacy endpoint was the area under curve (AUC) from 0 to 72 hours after admission of neuron‐specific enolase — a predictor of outcomes after cardiac arrest. 38 Although exenatide was effective in normalising blood glucose (median blood glucose 8 hours after admission was 5.8 mmol/L vs 7.3 mmol/L, in placebo; P < .0001), exenatide did not reduce neuron‐specific enolase levels and did not significantly improve a composite end‐point of death and poor neurological function after 180 days. 14 Of note, exenatide was not administered until after the return of spontaneous circulation which could limit the effectiveness. More recently, a 6‐hour infusion of either 17.4 μg of exenatide or placebo, within 4 hours from sustained return of spontaneous circulation, showed that exenatide lowered glucose and increased the clearance of lactate (a surrogate marker for adequate tissue perfusion 39) by 21% more than placebo. 15

Background and Purpose- The purpose of these guidelines is to provide an up-to-date comprehensive set of recommendations in a single document for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. The intended audiences are prehospital care providers, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospital administrators. These guidelines supersede the 2013 Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) Guidelines and are an update of the 2018 AIS Guidelines. Methods- Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Members were not allowed to participate in discussions or to vote on topics relevant to their relations with industry. An update of the 2013 AIS Guidelines was originally published in January 2018. This guideline was approved by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee and the AHA Executive Committee. In April 2018, a revision to these guidelines, deleting some recommendations, was published online by the AHA. The writing group was asked review the original document and revise if appropriate. In June 2018, the writing group submitted a document with minor changes and with inclusion of important newly published randomized controlled trials with > 100 participants and clinical outcomes at least 90 days after AIS. The document was sent to 14 peer reviewers. The writing group evaluated the peer reviewers' comments and revised when appropriate. The current final document was approved by all members of the writing group except when relationships with industry precluded members from voting and by the governing bodies of the AHA. These guidelines use the American College of Cardiology/AHA 2015 Class of Recommendations and Level of Evidence and the new AHA guidelines format. Results- These guidelines detail prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation and treatment with intravenous and intra-arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including secondary prevention measures that are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks. The guidelines support the overarching concept of stroke systems of care in both the prehospital and hospital settings. Conclusions- These guidelines provide general recommendations based on the currently available evidence to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. In many instances, however, only limited data exist demonstrating the urgent need for continued research on treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

### GLP-1 secretion in acute ischemic stroke: association with functional outcome and comparison with healthy individuals [^116prro3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study shows elevated GLP-1 levels in patients who recently suffered an ischemic stroke and were treated with rtPA with the levels being stable 3 months later, suggesting that this elevation could be a marker of an increased stroke risk but this would need confirmation in other trials with prospective design of longer follow-up. Moreover, the results must be interpreted with some caution as they could suggest an ongoing compensatory protective mechanism in individuals at high stroke risk. We also found that the plasma GLP-1 measured in the acute phase of stroke has no predictive value for the outcome of a stroke. Whether a more sustained increase of endogenous GLP-1 or administration of GLP-1 analogues in the recovery phase after stroke could improve neurological outcome and improve recovery are fundamental questions to be addressed in future studies.

### Pharmacological brain cytoprotection in acute ischaemic stroke-renewed hope in the reperfusion era [^111Shirx]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

For over 40 years, attempts to develop treatments that protect neurons and other brain cells against the cellular and biochemical consequences of cerebral ischaemia in acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) have been unsuccessful. However, the advent of intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy has taken us into a new era of treatment for AIS in which highly effective reperfusion therapy is widely available. In this context, cytoprotective treatments should be revisited as adjunctive treatment to reperfusion therapy. Renewed efforts should focus on developing new drugs that target multiple aspects of the ischaemic cascade, and previously developed drugs should be reconsidered if they produced robust cytoprotective effects in preclinical models and their safety profiles were reasonable in previous clinical trials. Several development pathways for cytoprotection as an adjunct to reperfusion can be envisioned. In this Review, we outline the targets for cytoprotective therapy and discuss considerations for future drug development, highlighting the recent ESCAPE-NA1 trial of nerinetide, which produced the most promising results to date. We review new types of clinical trial to evaluate whether cytoprotective drugs can slow infarct growth prior to reperfusion and/or ameliorate the consequences of reperfusion, such as haemorrhagic transformation. We also highlight how advanced brain imaging can help to identify patients with salvageable ischaemic tissue who are likely to benefit from cytoprotective therapy.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prediabetes — epidemiology, stroke associations, and cardiometabolic therapy signals are as follows: The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes among US adults is 9%, and prediabetes and diabetes are associated with increased risk for first ischemic stroke (RR, 1.5%–3.7% for diabetes). Prediabetes is present in ≈30% of patients with acute ischemic stroke and is associated with increased risk for recurrence, and T2D is also present in ≈30% of patients with ischemic stroke with recurrence risk (RR, ≈1.6). Recent trials show at least one drug in each of three glucose-lowering classes — thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like protein 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor — can reduce risk for MACEs in T2D with established atherosclerotic vascular disease, while cardiovascular outcome trials of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors do not suggest a specific effect on stroke but rather on cardiovascular death, MI, and heart failure.

Fig. 1
Potential mechanisms of stroke protection mediated by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, with a focus on their intracerebral effects

Although our review highlights several promising effects of GLP-1RAs in the brain, there are some limitations that should be acknowledged. Only very limited studies reported negative results on the anti-stroke effects of GLP-1 and GLP-1RAs, which, along publication bias, favor positive outcomes. Moreover, the non-clinical studies were mainly conducted in homogeneous rodent models, limiting their representation of human stroke, which is a highly heterogeneous, multifactorial disorder. Infarct progression in the human brain is also presumed to be 2–3 times slower than in the rodent brain. In addition, given that most non-clinical studies evaluating the anti-stroke effects of GLP-1RAs were performed in animal models of acute ischemic stroke, in which GLP-1 or its analogues were administered before, during, or after stroke induction, the mechanistic effects of GLP-1RAs in preventing stroke on the long-term need further investigation. To date, most clinical studies investigating the anti-stroke effects of GLP-1RAs estimated the risk of an ischemic stroke event, without focusing on mechanistic or functional outcomes. Hence, further research is still needed to understand the most important mechanisms involved in GLP-1RA-mediated stroke protection specifically in the human diabetic brain and to connect the described experimental studies to clinical stroke. There are currently two ongoing randomized, phase II studies (NCT02829502; NCT03287076) performed in patients with ischemic stroke to evaluate the impact of exenatide therapy on various mechanistic outcomes such as CBF velocity, endothelial function, inflammation, and post-stroke hyperglycemia. When available, the results of these two clinical studies may enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of stroke protection by GLP-1RAs in humans.

### Effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on incidence and outcomes of ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113BWqUs]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) demonstrate cardiovascular benefits beyond glycemic control, but the benefits of protection across cerebrovascular and cardiovascular territories remain incompletely studied in the literature. We aim to evaluate whether GLP-1 RAs provide balanced protection against stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) and identify factors that modify this protection.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing GLP-1 RAs with placebo that reported cerebrovascular and cardiovascular outcomes. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for stroke and MI and developed a novel Territorial Benefit Ratio (TBR = HR stroke/HR MI) to quantify relative cerebrovascular versus coronary protection. Meta-regression analyses identified factors modifying territorial protection.

Results

Eleven trials with 85373 participants met inclusion criteria. GLP-1 RAs significantly reduced stroke (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80–0.96) and MI (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79–0.97), resulting in an overall balanced TBR of 1.01 (95% CI 0.89–1.15). Protection patterns varied significantly by patient subgroups: prior stroke history provided better stroke protection (HR 0.73, NNT 54), while prior MI history provided better MI protection (HR 0.79, NNT 55). MI protection emerged earlier within the first six months (HR 0.81), while stroke protection strengthened over time (over 24months: HR 0.80). Renal dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension shifted protection towards stroke, while dyslipidemia provided better MI protection.

Conclusions

GLP-1 RAs demonstrate a protection-in-territory-at-risk pattern with important temporal findings and results translated. These findings support a personalised approach to GLP-1 RA therapy that considers patients' vascular history and risk profiles. The earlier emergence of MI protection and later strengthening of stroke protection deliver significant highlights for clinical expectations and treatment persistence.

DPP-4 Inhibitors and Acute Ischemic Stroke

Accumulating preclinical data suggest that DPP-4 inhibitors might exert neuroprotective actions in animal models of ischemic stroke. In diabetic mice, administration of linagliptin for 4 weeks prior to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced stroke resulted in a noticeable, albeit not statistically significant, trend towards reduction of stroke volume. In contrast, glimepiride had no effect on stroke volume. Moreover, stereological counting of surviving neurons revealed significantly more (approximately 30%) surviving neurons in linagliptin-treated mice than in glimepiride-treated animals. Therefore, treatment with linagliptin prior to ischemic stroke appears to exert neuroprotective effects. These effects appear to be unrelated to the glucose-lowering effect of linagliptin. Indeed, glucose levels decreased to a similar degree in linagliptin- and glimepiride-treated mice. Moreover, in non-diabetic mice, both linagliptin and glimepiride induced a comparable and non-significant reduction in stroke volume and an increase in the number of surviving neurons. In another study in non-diabetic mice, treatment with alogliptin for 3 weeks prior to ischemic stroke also reduced the volume of the infracted lesion and alleviated the severity of neurological deficit. In contrast with GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors do not appear to cross the blood–brain barrier. It is possible that the neuroprotective effects of DPP-4 inhibitors are due to an increase in GLP-1 levels in the brain. However, other investigators showed that the beneficial effects of DPP-4 inhibitors in animal models of ischemic stroke are independent of GLP-1. Another possible explanation is that DPP-4 has many other substrates except GLP-1, including peptides with potential neurotrophic or neuroprotective effects. These include glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, and stromal cell-derived factor 1a (SDF-1a). In preclinical models, these peptides were shown to promote synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, to inhibit apoptosis, and to reduce stroke size. Indeed, linagliptin increased brain SDF-1a levels in mice subjected to stroke whereas inhibition of SDF-1a abolished the beneficial effects of linagliptin on stroke volume and motor function. In addition, alogliptin was shown to increase the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a potent brain neuroprotective cytokine, both in the cortex and in the whole forebrain. Notably, acute administration of linagliptin at the time of stroke does not affect the outcome; therefore, it is questionable whether DPP-4 inhibitors have a role in the acute management of patients with ischemic stroke. Despite these promising results of preclinical studies, there are very few data regarding the role of DPP-4 inhibitors in improving the outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke. In a small study (n = 123), we reported that patients who were hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke and were treated with DPP-4 inhibitors prior to stroke had a trend for less severe stroke at admission and also had better functional outcome and lower in-hospital mortality than patients treated with other antihyperglycemic agents.

### Protection against stroke with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117X91Dw]. European Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

In experimental stroke models pretreatment with the newly introduced antidiabetic agents, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects. Published evidence with regard to the effect of treatment with GLP-1R agonists on the risk of stroke was evaluated. Data from prospective randomized placebo-controlled trials up to October 2018 involving GLP-1R agonists which reported cardiovascular outcomes as primary end-points of efficacy and/or safety were meta-analysed. Five eligible multicentre randomized placebo-controlled trials (ELIXA, LEADER, SUSTAIN, EXSCEL and HARMONY) were included. The pooled analysis (n = 42 358) showed a significant reduction by 13% in the risk of total stroke from treatment with GLP-1R agonists versus placebo (risk ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.78–0.98, P = 0.021) with no significant heterogeneity between trials (Q = 4.094, P = 0.393, I² = 2.307%). When only fatal stroke was included (this applied for the ELIXA, LEADER, EXSCEL and HARMONY trials), active treatment was associated with a non-significant reduction by 16% compared with placebo (risk ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.60–1.17, P = 0.29). The findings of this meta-analysis support the evidence from earlier experimental studies calling attention to potential 'stroke protective' effects from treatment with GLP-1R.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines on blood pressure management in acute ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage [^117JcHu7]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Data from 18 RCTs were considered in the analysis of the effect of blood pressure lowering treatment on death and/or disability.– Seven included patients with ICH but reported results separately for ICH and AIS subgroups. One trial did not discriminate between AIS and ICHbut was included based on the assumption that AIS contributed to the majority of patients. Three trials included patients who received IVT, but the proportion receiving IVT was low, and the results were available separately for subgroups according to IVT either in the main paper, or in subsequent post hoc analyses. Notably, the majority of studies excluded patients with extremely high systolic blood pressure levels (> 220 mm Hg) and many included patients up to 72 hours of symptom onset.

Most of the patients were recruited from the three RCTs described below:

The Scandinavian Candesartan Acute Stroke Trial (SCAST) recruited 2029 patients with AIS (n = 1733) and ICH (n = 274) and systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg within 30 hours of onset and compared treatment with candesartan for seven days with placebo on co-primary end points at six months. Eight percent of patients with AIS received IVT. Blood pressure was lower in the treatment group at day 7 (−5/−2 mm Hg difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressures). There were neutral effects on the two co-primary endpoints: 1) poor functional outcome at six months (ordinal shift on mRS) and 2) composite outcome of vascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke during the six months follow-up period. There were no significant differences between the candesartan and placebo groups in mortality, functional outcome or recurrent ischaemic stroke in the subgroup of 1733 patient with AIS.

### The use of GLP-1 receptor agonists in hospitalised patients: an untapped potential [^114tWuur]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

The use of GLP‐1 RA in non‐ST elevation myocardial infarction (nSTEMI) was examined in a study of 90 patients randomised to liraglutide (0.6 mg for 2 days, 1.2 mg for 2 days, followed by 1.8 mg for 3 days) or placebo for 7 days; liraglutide improved LV ejection fraction by 4.7% more than placebo after 3 months. 67 However, this seems a modest improvement and may not translate into measurable clinical outcomes. A significant improvement has been defined as an increase in the ejection fraction of ≥ 8% (which is two times the interobserver variability with echocardiography). 68

Is it feasible to achieve rapid normalisation of glucose after myocardial infarction with GLP‐1? This was addressed in a study of 40 patients admitted to a CCU with hyperglycaemia ranging from 7.8 to 22.2 mmol/L. 69 Patients received intravenous exenatide as a bolus followed by a fixed dose infusion for up to 48 hours. Exenatide effectiveness was benchmarked to historical controls treated with insulin infusions. There was no difference in performance in the attainment of a target glucose range of 5.6 to 7.8 mmol/L although exenatide was discontinued in three patients after failure to achieve glycaemic control. Control was achieved without any episodes of severe hypoglycaemia (< 2.8 mmol/L) although nausea (occurring in 16 patients) was problematic. By far, the largest trial to date has been the Evaluation of LIXisenatide in Acute coronary syndrome (ELIXA) study. 70 This randomised 6068 patients within 180 days of a cardiovascular event that required hospitalisation. Once‐daily subcutaneous injection of 20 mcg lixisenatide, as an add‐on therapy to background antidiabetic medications, for 25 months was noninferior to placebo for the composite occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, hospitalisation for unstable angina or heart failure, and revascularization. This study provided data for cardiovascular safety of lixisenatide but no advantage. The 6‐month window from cardiovascular event to recruitment does, however, make it distinct from the trials described.

### Benefits of GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) receptor agonists for stroke reduction in type 2 diabetes: a call to action for neurologists [^111GhuG7]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

People living with diabetes are at higher risk for stroke and have a poorer prognosis following a stroke event than those without diabetes. Data from cardiovascular outcome trials and meta-analyses indicate that GLP-1RAs (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists) reduce the risk of stroke in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Accordingly, many guidelines now recommend the addition of GLP-1RAs to ongoing antihyperglycemic regimens to lower the risk of stroke in type 2 diabetes. The current work summarizes evidence supporting the use of GLP-1RAs for stroke reduction in people with type 2 diabetes and offers 2 new resources for neurologists who are considering GLP-1RAs for their patients-a list of frequently asked questions with evidence-based answers on safely initiating and managing GLP-1RAs, and a practical decision-making algorithm to assist in using GLP-1RAs as part of a stroke reduction strategy.

Characteristics and outcomes

Baseline characteristics of all the included events were determined at the time of the stroke admission, unless otherwise indicated in the text or in Table S1.

The comorbidity of AIS was characterized using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The CCI was given without diabetes and diabetes‐related complications. Furthermore, the characteristics included socioeconomics, laboratory results, stroke severity, and prestroke medication. The laboratory results (HbA1c, cholesterol, and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]), if available, represented the measurement closest to the stroke admission date within a 7‐day time window. The stroke severity was assessed with the score on the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) recorded at the time of hospital admission. A patient was considered a user of a given class of medication (statins, antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, and other glucose‐lowering medications) at baseline if the patient had redeemed a prescription within the year prior to the stroke admission. The duration of T2D was defined as time from first glucose‐lowering medications to time of the stroke admission.

The clinical outcomes were as follows: very severe index stroke (SSS score = 0–14); mortality, recurrent stroke, and all‐cause, unplanned readmissions at 30 and 365 days; and the length of stay (acute and total hospital stay). Please see Table S1 for further details and data sources of the clinical outcomes.

A subgroup analysis of the ENOS trial within 48 hours of stroke onset compared GTN to no GTN in 425 AIS patients presenting with elevated systolic blood pressure levels (140–220 mm Hg) who also received treatment with intravenous alteplase. A total of 204 and 221 patients were randomised to active and control groups respectively. GTN was not associated with improved three-month functional outcome compared to placebo (unadjusted common OR per 1-point worsening across all mRS scores at three months: 0.93, 95%CI: 0.66–1.30).

An individual patient data meta-analysis of different RCTs evaluating the safety and efficacy of NO for blood pressure management in acute stroke has reported that among 98 AIS patients treated with IVT, GTN was associated with improved functional outcomes at three months compared to placebo (unadjusted common OR per 1-point worsening across all mRS grades: 0.32, 95%CI: 0.15–0.69). However, this was not confirmed in the RIGHT-2 trial, although the GTN group had a trend towards less haemorrhagic transformation (3% vs 8%; OR: 0.38, 95%CI: 0.13–1.13; p = 0.082).

### GLP-1 receptor agonists and risk of adverse cerebrovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115HFoxW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

The effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) on ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke and transient ischemic attacks (TIA) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains undetermined.

Objective

To pool effects of GLP-1RAs on adverse cerebrovascular outcomes and investigate impact of baseline variables on these effects.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and clinical trial registry websites were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) ≥ 24 weeks duration in adults with T2DM (PROSPERO: CRD42022331547). Adjudicated cerebrovascular events in GLP-1RA treatment vs control arms were pooled together to calculate risk ratios (RR) using fixed-effects model. Subgroup analysis was performed based on individual drugs, treatment duration, and baseline patient characteristics. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE framework.

Results

We identified 28 RCTs involving 74 148 patients (57% male; median [range], age 58 [52–67] years, BMI 32 [25.4–37.2] kg/m2, T2DM duration 9 [3.5–15.4] years, treatment duration 52 [24–259] weeks). GLP-1RA use in T2DM was associated with significantly decreased risk of adverse cerebrovascular outcomes vs placebo/active comparator (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.76–0.91; I2 = 0%). Pooling data from cardiovascular outcome trials (n = 8), GLP-1RA treatment vs placebo was associated with reduced risk of nonfatal stroke (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76–0.94; I2 = 0%) but not fatal stroke (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.61–1.05; I2 = 0%). GLP-1RA use was associated with reduced risk of ischemic stroke (RCTs = 12; RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60–0.89; I2 = 0%), composite of ischemic stroke/TIA (RCTs = 16; RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65–0.90; I2 = 0%), but not hemorrhagic stroke (RCTs = 3; RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.51–1.64; I2 = 0%). Treatment benefits differed according to baseline eGFR and diabetes duration (P interaction < .1). Benefits were statistically significant for dulaglutide, subcutaneous/oral semaglutide (P < .05). Sensitivity analysis, excluding shorter-acting lixisenatide, eliminated the heterogeneity between individual GLP-1RA effects.

Conclusion

GLP-1RAs, particularly longer-acting formulations, reduced ischemic cerebrovascular events in T2DM. Observed benefits were significantly higher in patients with shorter T2DM duration and higher eGFR.

### Imaging of acute ischemic stroke [^117Loq9q]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

For decades, imaging has been a critical component of the diagnostic evaluation and management of patients suspected of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). With each new advance in the treatment of AIS, the role of imaging has expanded in scope, sophistication, and importance in selecting patients who stand to benefit from potential therapies. Although the field of stroke imaging has been evolving for many years, there have been several major recent changes. Most notably, in late 2017, the window for treatment expanded to 24 h from onset of stroke symptoms in selected patients. Furthermore, for those patients in expanded time windows, guidelines issued in early 2018 now recommend the use of "advanced" imaging techniques in the acute setting, including CT perfusion and MRI, to guide therapeutic decision-making. With these and other changes, the emergency radiologist must be prepared to handle a growing volume and complexity of AIS imaging. This article reviews the various imaging modalities and techniques employed in the imaging of AIS patients, with an emphasis on recommendations from recent randomized controlled trials and national consensus guidelines.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to summarize the therapeutic advances and evidence in the medical management of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Recent evidence comparing the efficacy and safety of tenecteplase (TNK) with alteplase for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in AIS will be highlighted. Recent advances and evidence on improving micro-circulation following endovascular procedures and neuroprotection will be reviewed.

Recent Findings

A significant number of randomized control studies now support the use of tenecteplase for IVT in AIS. TNK 0.25mg/kg single bolus is as effective and well tolerated as alteplase 0.9mg/kg infusion for IVT in AIS. Evidence from randomized control trials (RCTs) has shown effective and well tolerated expansion of the therapeutic window of IVT in the wake-up stroke and up to 9h after last seen well, using advanced neuroimaging with computed tomography perfusion/MRI. Early evidence suggests that intra-arterial alteplase may help improve microcirculation in patients with large vessel occlusion following successful thrombectomy. However, more trials are required to confirm the results. Similarly, early evidence from a recent RCT showed that remote ischemic conditioning confers potential neuroprotection and improves outcomes in AIS.

Summary

Converging evidence has demonstrated that for patients with ischemic stroke presenting at under 4.5h from the onset, TNK is comparable to alteplase. These data along with the practical advantages of TNK have resulted in a shift to replace intravenous TNK as the standard for thrombolysis. Ongoing studies of IVT with TNK are focussed on defining the optimal dose, expanding the time window with multimodal imaging and defining the role of thrombolysis for bridging patients with stroke due to large vessel occlusion.

### Safety and efficacy of nerinetide in patients with acute ischaemic stroke enrolled in the early window: a post-hoc meta-analysis of individual patient data from three randomised trials [^115AkJgv]. The Lancet: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Background

In three neuroprotection trials of nerinetide for acute ischaemic stroke, inconclusive results have been reported with respect to the prespecified primary outcome. However, none of the trials faithfully replicated the inclusion criteria of the animal studies that provided the rationale for the clinical trials-ie, treatment within 3 h of stroke onset and selected for reperfusion without previous thrombolysis. We aimed to investigate whether a clinical benefit of nerinetide might be seen in the subgroup of patients enrolled in these three clinical trials who met the criteria used in the animal studies.

Methods

In this post-hoc individual patient data meta-analysis, we pooled data from the ESCAPE-NA1, ESCAPE-NEXT, and FRONTIER trials, which were done at 135 stroke centres in 13 countries (Canada, Australia, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA). We included all participants who were enrolled within 3 h of acute ischaemic stroke onset, treated with study drug (nerinetide or placebo; randomised 1:1), and selected for reperfusion with thrombolysis, endovascular thrombectomy, or both. The primary endpoint was the number of responders at day 90, which was defined as people with a favourable outcome as per the primary endpoint prespecified in their respective trial. The primary endpoint was analysed by logistic regression, adjusted for age, stroke severity, and trial.

Findings

Between March 26, 2015, and Jan 31, 2023, 2487 participants were enrolled in the three trials, of whom 690 met criteria for this pooled analysis (389 participants in the nerinetide group and 301 participants in the placebo group). 364 (53%) of 690 participants were men and 326 (47%) were women. The median age of participants was 76 years (IQR 66–83) and median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 17 (11–21). 216 (56%) of 389 participants were responders at day 90 in the nerinetide group compared with 144 (48%) of 301 in the placebo group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.48, 95% CI 1.07–2.06; p = 0.017). 62 (16%) of 389 people in the nerinetide group died compared with 55 (18%) of 301 people in the placebo group (aOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.53–1.24; p = 0.34). No safety concerns were identified in either group.

Interpretation

Nerinetide showed a clinically significant benefit over several outcome measures, including the modified Rankin Scale score, the incidence of stroke worsening, and infarction volumes. Neuroprotection with nerinetide might, therefore, be indicated for patients within 3 h of stroke onset and who are selected for reperfusion. These inclusion criteria should be tested in a future trial.
