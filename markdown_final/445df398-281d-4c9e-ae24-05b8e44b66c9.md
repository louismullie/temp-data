## Question

Best NSAID for arthritis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which NSAID is best for arthritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "arthritis" means clinically, because osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis have different treatment frameworks. Then, I should verify what "best" implies in terms of efficacy, safety, and context of use. Next, I will review comparative efficacy data across NSAIDs and formulations. After that, I need to weigh safety profiles, including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks. Finally, I will align choices with guideline recommendations and synthesize a practical, patient-centered hierarchy of options, including when to use topical agents, COX-2 inhibitors, and nonselective NSAIDs, and when to avoid NSAIDs altogether.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. "Arthritis" in most treatment questions refers primarily to osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, and hand, but I should not conflate this with inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis or axial spondyloarthritis, where NSAIDs are adjuncts rather than disease-modifying monotherapy; guidelines for OA emphasize NSAIDs as first-line pharmacologic therapy, whereas in RA and axial spondyloarthritis NSAIDs are used for symptom control alongside DMARDs or as first-line for axial pain, respectively [^116qRMqb] [^111vENoB] [^115YX5cL].

> I need to define what "best" should mean. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: "best" is not a single drug but the optimal balance of analgesic and anti-inflammatory efficacy, safety in the context of comorbidities, duration of benefit, and patient-specific factors such as age, GI/CV/renal risk, and joint distribution. Guidelines consistently advise using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, with ongoing monitoring for adverse effects, which frames how we should rank options [^116qRMqb] [^111FPXWy] [^111pmNaf].

> Next, I should review comparative efficacy. High-quality network meta-analyses show that among oral NSAIDs, diclofenac 150 mg/day and etoricoxib 60 mg/day have the highest probability of being the most effective for OA pain, with robust effect sizes around −0.57 to −0.58 versus placebo, and both achieving at least the minimum clinically important difference with high probability. Celecoxib 200 mg/day is effective but with smaller effects than diclofenac or etoricoxib in these analyses, and paracetamol is consistently inferior to NSAIDs for pain relief in OA [^112zJNkq] [^112FV3bJ] [^116DqX4k].

> Wait, let me verify the time course of benefit because durability matters clinically. A systematic review and meta-analysis of knee OA trials found NSAID effects peak at about 2 weeks and wane thereafter, which reinforces the principle of reassessing early and limiting chronic use; this temporal pattern should temper expectations for long-term monotherapy with NSAIDs in OA [^116Gjhim].

> I will now examine topical NSAIDs, especially for knee and hand OA. Topical diclofenac provides clinically meaningful pain relief with substantially reduced systemic exposure; network meta-analyses and Cochrane reviews indicate topical diclofenac is effective versus placebo and comparable to oral NSAIDs in some contexts, with far fewer GI and renal adverse events, though local skin reactions are more common; importantly, topical NSAIDs are recommended as first-line pharmacotherapy for localized knee or hand OA, particularly in older adults or those at higher GI/CV risk [^115yBWuL] [^111zWfCP] [^116QTzV7].

> Hold on, I should verify the safety hierarchy because it often dictates the "best" choice. Nonselective NSAIDs increase risks of GI bleeding and ulcers, and all NSAIDs, including COX-2 inhibitors, carry cardiovascular risk signals. Naproxen tends to have the most favorable cardiovascular profile among nonselective NSAIDs in observational syntheses, whereas COX-2 inhibitors reduce upper GI events but may increase CV risk at higher doses or in susceptible patients. PRECISION suggested celecoxib at moderate doses was noninferior to naproxen or ibuprofen for CV outcomes, but dose capping and design limitations complicate interpretation, so I should be cautious in overgeneralizing [^1118DVQd] [^114JVWCc] [^116VXc8j].

> Let me consider special populations and comorbidities. In patients with high GI risk, a COX-2 inhibitor or a nonselective NSAID with a PPI is reasonable. In those with high CV risk, naproxen is often preferred if an NSAID is necessary, and all NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest time with close monitoring. In older adults or those with CKD, topical NSAIDs are attractive to mitigate systemic toxicity, and oral NSAIDs should be avoided or minimized when possible [^116qRMqb] [^116qESXw] [^1118DVQd] [^116QTzV7].

> Next, I should review guideline direction to ensure alignment. The ACR strongly recommends oral NSAIDs as initial oral medication for hand, hip, and knee OA when not contraindicated, with attention to safety monitoring. AAOS guidelines similarly endorse oral NSAIDs for hip and knee OA, and emphasize the lowest effective dose. EULAR guidance for hand OA supports short courses of oral NSAIDs when needed, and contemporary pain society consensus recommends topical NSAIDs before oral agents due to lower systemic toxicity, especially for knee OA [^116qRMqb] [^111FPXWy] [^111cSWs9] [^1115C9BN].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that my hierarchy reflects both efficacy and safety. For most patients with localized knee or hand OA, especially older adults or those with GI/CV/renal risk, topical diclofenac is the best first-line NSAID because it achieves meaningful pain relief with markedly reduced systemic risk. For patients with hip OA or polyarticular disease where topical therapy is impractical or insufficient, oral NSAIDs are appropriate, with naproxen favored when CV risk is a concern and diclofenac or a COX-2 inhibitor considered when GI risk predominates. Celecoxib is a reasonable alternative when GI risk is high and CV risk is acceptable, recognizing similar analgesic efficacy to nonselective agents in many trials [^115yBWuL] [^111zWfCP] [^1118DVQd] [^114PJh6g] [^112yCzN1].

> But wait, what if the patient has rheumatoid arthritis or axial spondyloarthritis. I need to ensure I do not overstate NSAIDs as disease-modifying therapy; in RA, NSAIDs are adjuncts for symptom control while DMARDs treat the underlying disease, and in axial spondyloarthritis, NSAIDs are first-line for pain and stiffness but continuous therapy may be preferred in active disease, with the choice individualized to response and risk; thus, "best" still hinges on balancing efficacy with GI/CV/renal risk and comorbidity profile [^111vENoB] [^116jRRe1] [^115YX5cL].

> Finally, I should confirm practical prescribing principles. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration, reassess at 2 to 4 weeks given the early peak and subsequent decline in benefit, monitor for GI, CV, and renal adverse effects, and consider gastroprotection when indicated. Avoid NSAIDs in patients with decompensated heart failure, active GI bleeding, or advanced CKD, and coordinate with the patient's full medication list to mitigate interactions and cumulative risk [^116Gjhim] [^116qRMqb] [^111pmNaf].

The best NSAID for arthritis is **individualized** based on patient-specific risks and comorbidities [^116qRMqb]. For most patients, **naproxen is preferred** for its favorable cardiovascular profile [^1118DVQd] and strong efficacy, while **ibuprofen is a practical OTC alternative** with balanced GI/CV risk when used short-term at moderate doses. Celecoxib is the **preferred option for high GI risk** (e.g. history of ulcers, concurrent anticoagulants) but requires caution in patients with cardiovascular disease. Topical NSAIDs (especially diclofenac) are **first-line for localized knee/hand OA** [^116QTzV7] due to lower systemic risk [^111zWfCP]. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, and always consider comorbidities, drug interactions, and patient preferences [^116qRMqb].

---

## Comparative efficacy of NSAIDs

NSAIDs have broadly similar efficacy for arthritis pain; however, **network meta-analyses** show small differences at maximal approved doses [^112zJNkq]:

- **Diclofenac 150 mg/day**: highest efficacy for pain and function (effect size ~0.57) [^112zJNkq].
- **Etoricoxib 60 mg/day**: comparable efficacy to diclofenac (effect size ~0.58) [^112zJNkq].
- **Celecoxib 200 mg/day**: effective but slightly lower than diclofenac/etoricoxib [^112zJNkq].
- **Naproxen and ibuprofen**: similar efficacy, with naproxen having a more favorable CV profile [^117V382s].

---

## Safety profiles and contraindications

Safety varies by agent and patient risk; **individualized risk assessment is essential**:

| **Risk category** | **Preferred nsaid** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Cardiovascular risk | Naproxen | Lower CV risk; avoid COX-2 inhibitors if high CV risk [^1118DVQd] |
| Gastrointestinal risk | Celecoxib ± PPI | Lower GI bleeding risk; PPI further reduces GI events [^116qESXw] |
| Renal impairment | Avoid NSAIDs if possible | NSAIDs can worsen renal function; use lowest dose if necessary |
| Pregnancy | Avoid NSAIDs after 20 weeks | Risk of fetal renal dysfunction and oligohydramnios [^117VzcnA] |

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing NSAID choice

- **Age**: Older adults have higher GI/CV/renal risk; use lower doses and consider topical agents [^111FMfWZ].
- **Comorbidities**: tailor to CV, GI, renal, and hepatic conditions [^115AiWkh].
- **Concomitant medications**: avoid interactions (e.g. anticoagulants, antihypertensives) [^116qRMqb].
- **Patient preferences**: consider formulation, dosing frequency, and prior responses [^113FDzTe].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Guidelines consistently recommend NSAIDs as **first-line pharmacologic therapy** for OA when not contraindicated, with agent selection individualized to risk profile and patient preference [^116qRMqb] [^111FPXWy] [^111oSURj]. The **ACR/Arthritis Foundation** strongly recommends oral NSAIDs for knee, hip, and hand OA, with topical NSAIDs preferred for localized disease, especially in older adults or those at higher systemic risk [^116qRMqb] [^116QTzV7]. The **AAOS** likewise recommends oral NSAIDs for hip and knee OA when not contraindicated, emphasizing the lowest effective dose and shortest duration [^111FPXWy] [^115RX6NK].

---

## Practical recommendations

- **General use**: naproxen or ibuprofen at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^115RX6NK].
- **High GI risk**: celecoxib ± PPI; avoid high-dose NSAIDs [^111nAcGX].
- **High CV risk**: naproxen preferred; avoid COX-2 inhibitors if possible [^1118DVQd].
- **Localized OA (knee/hand)**: topical diclofenac first-line due to lower systemic risk [^1115C9BN].
- **Renal impairment**: avoid NSAIDs if possible; use acetaminophen or topical agents [^117Ljd9e].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Emerging options include **COX-inhibiting nitric oxide donors** and **LOX/COX inhibitors** (e.g. licofelone), which may offer improved GI/renal tolerability, though more data are needed [^115ANP6y]. Advances in topical formulations aim to enhance local delivery while minimizing systemic exposure [^111zWfCP].

---

The best NSAID for arthritis is **individualized**: naproxen or ibuprofen for most, celecoxib for high GI risk, and topical diclofenac for localized disease. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, with ongoing monitoring and shared decision-making [^116qRMqb] [^115pjtA3] [^115yBWuL].

Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for knee osteoarthritis are recommended to improve pain and function when not contraindicated (Strength of Recommendation: Strong). Meta-analyses report that non-selective oral NSAIDs compared to controls demonstrated a meaningful reduction in pain and a meaningful improvement in function, and that celecoxib, the only available selective COX-2 oral NSAID on the United States market, demonstrated a meaningful reduction in pain and improved function. The comparison of non-selective and selective COX-2 oral NSAIDs shows no significant difference in effectiveness. Given safety considerations, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a black-box warning for NSAIDs citing an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events and serious gastrointestinal events; providers should consider patient comorbidities, the type of NSAID administered, dose, and duration of administration, and we recommend the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible for the patient. Specific patient contraindications need to be assessed on an individual basis, and although selective COX-2 oral NSAIDs were developed to reduce gastrointestinal adverse events compared to non-selective oral NSAIDs, meta-analysis did not reveal a significant reduction in gastrointestinal adverse events.

### Safety of celecoxib versus traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in older patients with arthritis [^116VXc8j]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

In accordance with the FDA's mandate for reassurance on long-term CV safety of celecoxib, a postmarketing clinical trial titled the Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety vs Ibuprofen or Naproxen (PRECISION) was conducted. The trial findings revealed that celecoxib at moderate doses (up to 400 mg/day) was noninferior to ibuprofen or to naproxen in terms of CV adverse outcomes. However, the PRECISION trial had a major flaw in its design: due to regulatory restrictions, celecoxib up-titration was not permitted particularly in 89.9% of study patients with osteoarthritis, while the doses of the comparator NSAIDs could have been escalated as needed for symptom management. Hence, the dose of celecoxib may not have been equipotent to that of comparator drugs, potentially confounding the results: administering a higher dose of the comparator NSAIDs was more effective in reducing pain, but perhaps put patients at an increased risk of developing adverse GI, CV, and renal events as compared to celecoxib use with dose capping. Interestingly, the findings in the current study in general indicated an increased risk of CV consequences with celecoxib relative to traditional NSAIDs, which might have been influenced by higher-than-approved doses of celecoxib used in a considerable proportion of patients included herein. Despite the dosing guidelines recommendations with regard to dose escalation up to 200 mg/day for osteoarthritis patients and up to 400 mg/day for rheumatoid arthritis patients, it was noted that 24.3% of osteoarthritis-only patients on celecoxib received more than 200 mg/day, and, more importantly, 4.7% of celecoxib-treated patients received more than 400 mg/day in the current study.

### Celecoxib for osteoarthritis [^112yCzN1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and is caused by degeneration of the joint cartilage and growth of new bone, cartilage and connective tissue. It is often associated with major disability and impaired quality of life. There is currently no consensus on the best treatment to improve OA symptoms. Celecoxib is a selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

Objectives

To assess the clinical benefits (pain, function, quality of life) and safety (withdrawals due to adverse effects, serious adverse effects, overall discontinuation rates) of celecoxib in osteoarthritis (OA).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and clinical trials registers up to April 11, 2017, as well as reference and citation lists of included studies. Pharmaceutical companies and authors of published articles were contacted.

Selection Criteria

We included published studies (full reports in a peer reviewed journal) of prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral celecoxib versus no intervention, placebo or another traditional NSAID (tNSAID) in participants with clinically- or radiologically-confirmed primary OA of the knee or hip, or both knee and hip.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently performed data extraction, quality assessment, and compared results. Main analyses for patient-reported outcomes of pain and physical function were conducted on studies with low risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding of participants and personnel.

Main Results

We included 36 trials that provided data for 17,206 adults: 9402 participants received celecoxib 200 mg/day, and 7804 were assigned to receive either tNSAIDs (N = 1869) or placebo (N = 5935). Celecoxib was compared with placebo (32 trials), naproxen (6 trials) and diclofenac (3 trials). Studies were published between 1999 and 2014. Studies included participants with knee, hip or both knee and hip OA; mean OA duration was 7.9 years. Most studies included predominantly white participants whose mean age was 62 (± 10) years; most participants were women. There were no concerns about risk of bias for performance and detection bias, but selection bias was poorly reported in most trials. Most trials had high attrition bias, and there was evidence of selective reporting in a third of the studies. Celecoxib versus placeboCompared with placebo celecoxib slightly reduced pain on a 500-point Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scale, accounting for 3% absolute improvement (95% CI 2% to 5% improvement) or 12% relative improvement (95% CI 7% to 18% improvement) (4 studies, 1622 participants). This improvement may not be clinically significant (high quality evidence). Compared with placebo celecoxib slightly improved physical function on a 1700-point WOMAC scale, accounting for 4% absolute improvement (95% CI 2% to 6% improvement), 12% relative improvement (95% CI 5% to 19% improvement) (4 studies, 1622 participants). This improvement may not be clinically significant (high quality evidence). There was no evidence of an important difference for withdrawals due to adverse events (Peto OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.15) (moderate quality evidence due to study limitations). Results were inconclusive for numbers of participants experiencing any serious AEs (SAEs) (Peto OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.36), gastro-intestinal events (Peto OR 1.91, 95% CI 0.24 to 14.90) and cardiovascular events (Peto OR 3.40, 95% CI 0.73 to 15.88) (very low quality evidence due to serious imprecision and study limitations). However, regulatory agencies have warned of increased cardiovascular events for celecoxib. Celecoxib versus tNSAIDsThere were inconclusive results regarding the effect on pain between celecoxib and tNSAIDs on a 100-point visual analogue scale (VAS), showing 5% absolute improvement (95% CI 11% improvement to 2% worse), 11% relative improvement (95% CI 26% improvement to 4% worse) (2 studies, 1180 participants, moderate quality evidence due to publication bias). Compared to a tNSAID celecoxib slightly improved physical function on a 100-point WOMAC scale, showing 6% absolute improvement (95% CI 6% to 11% improvement) and 16% relative improvement (95% CI 2% to 30% improvement). This improvement may not be clinically significant (low quality evidence due to missing data and few participants) (1 study, 264 participants). Based on low or very low quality evidence (downgraded due to missing data, high risk of bias, few events and wide confidence intervals) results were inconclusive for withdrawals due to AEs (Peto OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.27), number of participants experiencing SAEs (Peto OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.28), gastro-intestinal events (Peto OR 0.61, 0.15 to 2.43) and cardiovascular events (Peto OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.25). In comparisons of celecoxib and placebo there were no differences in pooled analyses between our main analysis with low risk of bias and all eligible studies. In comparisons of celecoxib and tNSAIDs, only one outcome showed a difference between studies at low risk of bias and all eligible studies: physical function (6% absolute improvement in low risk of bias, no difference in all eligible studies). No studies included in the main comparisons measured quality of life. Of 36 studies, 34 reported funding by drug manufacturers and in 34 studies one or more study authors were employees of the sponsor.

Authors' Conclusions

We are highly reserved about results due to pharmaceutical industry involvement and limited data. We were unable to obtain data from three studies, which included 15,539 participants, and classified as awaiting assessment. Current evidence indicates that celecoxib is slightly better than placebo and some tNSAIDs in reducing pain and improving physical function. We are uncertain if harms differ among celecoxib and placebo or tNSAIDs due to risk of bias, low quality evidence for many outcomes, and that some study authors and Pfizer declined to provide data from completed studies with large numbers of participants. To fill the evidence gap, we need to access existing data and new, independent clinical trials to investigate benefits and harms of celecoxib versus tNSAIDs for people with osteoarthritis, with longer follow-up and more direct head-to-head comparisons with other tNSAIDs.

### Safe prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with osteoarthritis – an expert consensus addressing benefits as well as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks [^115gs5XV]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

NSAIDs are an essential part of our therapeutic armamentarium despite their well characterized GI and CV risk profiles. The time is now ripe for offering the patient with OA the safest and most cost-effective therapeutic option, thus preventing serious adverse events, which could have important QoL and resource use implications. The integration of existing guidelines with the present one, together with a careful evaluation of both GI and CV risk factors, should allow clinicians to correctly manage OA patients without expanding the already growing NSAID epidemic. In the future, the potential chemopreventive effects of NSAIDs/coxibs and of low-dose aspirin on GI (as well as non-GI) cancers may impact the benefits and risks equation, observed in the arthritic population, and expand the use of these compounds.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary management of osteoarthritis of the hip [^117Ljd9e]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacological management: NSAIDs — "When not contraindicated, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) should be used to reduce pain and improve function in the treatment of symptomatic hip osteoarthritis", with "Quality of Evidence: High" and "Strength of Recommendation: Strong". The guideline rationale states "Five studies (three moderate quality and two high quality) compared oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) with placebo for treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip and showed improvement in pain and function scores", that "Compared to placebo, all five studies reported on pain and uniformly reported improvement in pain with the use of oral NSAIDs", and that "The Western Ontario McMaster Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score was reported in all studies, all of which reported improvement in WOMAC function with NSAIDs compared to placebo". Head-to-head articles reported "lumiracoxib showed similar efficacy to celecoxib", "celecoxib 200mg/day and 400mg/day showed similar efficacy to naproxen", and "similar efficacy between valdecoxib 10mg and naproxen". Under benefits/harm, "Contraindications that should be considered include, but are not limited to, patients with chronic kidney disease or patients with significant cardiac conditions that may be at an elevated risk of myocardial infarction". Outcome importance notes "The use of non-opioid medications such as NSAIDs for nonoperative treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip is extremely important to minimize the use of opioids". Cost/resource statements note NSAIDs are "widely available and an extremely cost-effective treatment" but "there is limited comparative data on the cost-effectiveness of oral NSAIDs compared to other nonoperative treatments of osteoarthritis of the hip". For implementation, "This recommendation should be readily implemented as it does not influence a major change in clinical practice" and "Oral NSAIDs are widely available. Thus, this recommendation should be easily implemented with no apparent barriers to adoption".

### Clinical experience with cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors [^116ncCov]. Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are chronic conditions requiring long-term therapy for pain relief. Currently prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provide symptomatic efficacy, but are frequently associated with gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities such as dyspepsia and ulcerations. In a small but significant number of cases, complications including perforations and massive bleeding develop and these may be fatal. A desirable therapeutic strategy would maintain efficacy while minimizing gastric intolerance. Two potential approaches have been suggested: (i) administration of NSAIDs in combination with gastroprotective compounds; or (ii) administration of potentially safer anti-inflammatory compounds which act via selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The selective COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib and celecoxib consistently demonstrate efficacy comparable to conventional NSAIDs in patients with RA and OA, but have a significantly reduced propensity to cause GI toxicity. In many cases, the gastric effects of therapeutically active doses of COX-2 inhibitors are indistinguishable from placebo. The safety benefits of COX-2 inhibitors given alone appear similar to combined therapy with conventional NSAIDs and gastroprotective agents. Findings warrant the consideration of COX-2 inhibitors as first-line therapy in patients requiring long-term pain relief.

### Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for acute and chronic pain [^116k5w8k]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Understanding nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use and impact on common rheumatic and arthritic conditions is critical to reconciling their appropriate use with their potentially serious adverse effects. NSAIDs have a profound impact on the treatment of connective tissue disorders because of their ability to address the underlying cause with specific benefits of decreasing stiffness and inflammation, and improving mobility. NSAID use is twice as common as opioid use, and inappropriate use of NSAIDs is widespread. NSAID use should be monitored and the impact understood to mitigate the risks. NSAID discontinuation should be evidence based and individualized to specific requirements.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^116QTzV7]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Medication selection and clinical considerations in osteoarthritis — for some patients with more limited disease in whom medication is required, topical NSAIDs represent an appropriate first choice, whereas for others, particularly with hip OA or polyarticular involvement, oral NSAIDs are more appropriate. The appropriate use of other oral agents, particularly acetaminophen and opioids, will continue to evolve. Despite the many options available, some patients may continue to experience inadequate symptom control, and clinicians treating patients in these circumstances should choose interventions with a low risk of harm; there are controversies in interpretation of the evidence, particularly with regard to the use of glucosamine and chondroitin, acupuncture, and intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^116qRMqb]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are strongly recommended for patients with knee, hip, and/or hand osteoarthritis (OA), and they remain the mainstay of the pharmacologic management of OA. A large number of trials have established their short-term efficacy, and oral NSAIDs are the initial oral medication of choice in the treatment of OA, regardless of anatomic location, and are recommended over all other available oral medications. While the guideline did not address the relative merits of different NSAIDs, there is evidence suggesting that certain agents may have more favorable side effect profiles than others, and safe use includes appropriate patient selection with regular monitoring for potential adverse gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal side effects and potential drug interactions; doses should be as low as possible, and NSAID treatment should be continued for as short a time as possible.

### Update of ACR guidelines for osteoarthritis: role of the coxibs [^113PRGa8]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recently provided an update to the guidelines published in 1995 on the management of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee and hip. Members of the Ad Hoc Committee on OA Guidelines followed an evidence-based medicine approach to revise the guidelines by reviewing an extensive literature search of the Cochrane and Medline databases and published abstracts, and discussing evidence with expert rheumatologists. The goal of the guidelines is to provide recommendations to control patients' OA pain, improve function and health-related quality of life, and avoid therapeutic toxicity. As in the original guidelines, nonpharmacologic interventions involving patient education and physical measures are recommended following initial diagnosis of OA. The pharmacologic algorithm was updated to include currently available therapeutic agents. Acetaminophen remains first-line therapy because of its cost, efficacy, and safety profiles. Cyclooxygenase-2-selective inhibitors (coxibs) have been included as an alternative to nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients at risk for upper gastrointestinal adverse events. Tramadol is an available alternative for patients who have a contraindication to coxibs or nonselective NSAIDs or for those who have not responded to previous oral therapy. Intra-articular injections or topical therapy may be used as monotherapy, or as an adjunct to oral analgesia. Surgical treatment of OA remains a last resort for patients who have failed to respond to nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment approaches, and have progressive limitation in their activities of daily living. Several therapies for the prevention or treatment of OA are currently under investigation, including nutritional supplements, such as glucosamine and chondroitin, disease-modifying OA drugs, and devices, such as acupuncture and electromagnetic therapy. It is anticipated that the guidelines for the management of OA will continue to evolve as new therapies become available.

### British association of sexual health and HIV national guideline on the management of sexually acquired reactive arthritis 2021 [^1118DVQd]. International Journal of STD & AIDS (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for reactive arthritis, more specifically with respect to NSAIDs, BASHH 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that COX-2 selective drugs have been linked with increased cardiovascular risk independent of baseline cardiovascular risk factors, and the greatest risk may be with high doses taken long-term and in patients with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. Recognize that naproxen appears to have the best cardiovascular safety profile.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: overused or underused in osteoarthritis? [^114jLUfe]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Arthritis and musculoskeletal disorders are common. Arthritis currently accounts for 2% to 3% of all cases of disability, and the numbers are rising. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used, with 75 million prescriptions annually in the United States and 25 million in the United Kingdom. The volume of side effects noted, most of which are gastrointestinal and can be serious, imply the overuse of these drugs, especially in relation to the estimated prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA), where pain relief may be considered more important than an anti-inflammatory effect. There are conflicting data about the efficacy of NSAIDs compared with analgesics alone for pain relief. However, the interpretation of data comparing the two drug classes is limited by shortcomings in research methodologies and by difficulties in incorporating the anti-inflammatory effect of NSAIDs into the outcomes. The efficacy of paracetamol for some patients has been underestimated; however, although those with mild disease may find paracetamol adequate, most patients with OA are likely to gain more benefit from NSAIDs.

### NSAIDs in the older patient: balancing benefits and harms [^111FMfWZ]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The older person is more likely to have pain since degenerative diseases and the effects of cancer are more common after 65 years of age. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently used due to perceived safety, relatively low cost and over-the-counter availability. This brief review describes the necessity for, but risks of, NSAIDs in the older patient.

Design

A literature search was undertaken using PubMed and search terms including pain, aging, treatment, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, arthritis, older patient, and guidelines.

Conclusions

Pain complaints are common in the older population. Low back pain and osteoarthritis affects over two thirds of this group. Patients and clinicians are increasingly wary about treatment since no medication appears to be safe. Older patients opting for no treatment may have worsening function including decreased sleep, mobility, socialization, and increased depression. Ninety percent of all prescription NSAIDs are taken by patients over 65. Guidelines for safe use are available but frequently not followed by the practitioner including the FDA recommended "lowest dose possible for your treatment… for the shortest time needed". NSAIDs can be an effective treatment option for many older persons but caution should be exercised in this often fragile population.

### Does paracetamol (acetaminophen) reduce the pain of osteoarthritis? A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113BDPMv]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the best available evidence for efficacy of paracetamol (acetaminophen) in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA).

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, Scientific Citation Index, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and conference abstracts in the past 2 years from the British Society for Rheumatology, the European League Against Rheumatism, the American College of Rheumatology, and the Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

Subjects

10 RCTs including 1712 patients with either symptomatic OA of the knee (6 trials) or hip/knee (3 trials) or multiple joints (1 trial).

Main Outcome Measures

(a). effect size (ES) for pain, stiffness, and functional scores from baseline to end point; (b). rate ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for clinical response rate and patient preference for treatment.

Results

Paracetamol was effective in relieving pain due to OA (ES = 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.41). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were better than paracetamol for pain relief (ES = 0.20, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.30). Clinical response rate was higher with NSAIDs than with paracetamol (RR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.41), and the number of patients who preferred NSAIDs was more than twice the number of those preferring paracetamol (RR = 2.46, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.12). NSAIDs were associated with more frequent gastrointestinal discomfort than paracetamol (RR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.75).

Conclusion

Paracetamol is an effective agent for pain relief due to OA. Although safer, it is less effective than NSAIDs. For safety reasons paracetamol should be the first line treatment, with NSAIDs reserved for those who do not respond.

### Influence of flare design on symptomatic efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in osteoarthritis: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^113efE5w]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs' (NSAIDs) symptomatic efficacy in osteoarthritis (OA) is often assessed in trials with a "flare design", i.e., including only patients with an increase in their pain after stopping their usual treatment (NSAIDs or analgesic).

Objective

To evaluate the influence of the "flare design" on NSAIDs apparent symptomatic efficacy in OA.

Search Strategy

a systematic literature research was performed in Medline, EMBASE and The Cochrane Register up to March 2009. All randomized controlled trials comparing NSAIDs vs placebo symptomatic efficacy in hip, knee, or digital OA were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

efficacy was evaluated on pain (visual analog scale), and on function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA index or Lequesne index). The magnitude of the treatment effect was evaluated by calculating Cohen's effect size (ES). Meta-analysis of ES according to flare design yes/no was performed.

Results

Among the 343 identified studies, 33 (20,915 patients) were included: 27 (18,667 patients) vs 6 (2248 patients) respectively in the group with vs without "flare design". Populations were comparable in each group. ESs were, for pain, -0.66 (95% confidence interval, -0.71 to -0.61), vs -0.45 (-0.54 to -0.36) in the flare design vs "no flare design" group, and for function, -0.50 (-0.55 to -0.44) vs -0.25 (-0.36 to -0.14) respectively.

Conclusion

Our study suggests that the flare design used in clinical trials evaluating NSAIDs results in a treatment effect of higher magnitude. These results should be considered when designing a trial and/or interpreting the results of a trial.

### Safe prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with osteoarthritis – an expert consensus addressing benefits as well as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks [^116QM2u7]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is a common reason for patients to visit their family physician and the numbers seeking treatment for pain is anticipated to rise as the population ages and chronic conditions, such as osteoarthritis (OA), increase. In the United Kingdom (UK), annually, more than 17 million prescriptions are written for anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs. In addition, over-the-counter analgesic (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol) use is substantial, with 44% of patients consuming more than the recommended dosage on the label. Musculoskeletal pain is common and disabling, especially in the elderly population, whose number and proportion is estimated to double by 2030, compared to the 2000 figure. Prescribing pain medications within this particular population requires the skill of a knowledgeable physician to navigate through the numerous variables (e.g. physiologic changes, co-morbidities, and co-therapies) that make the elderly a heterogeneous and complex population to treat.

### Efficacy, tolerability, and safety of an oral enzyme combination vs diclofenac in osteoarthritis of the knee: results of an individual patient-level pooled reanalysis of data from six randomized controlled trials [^114J2vUT]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is the most prevalent cause of pain and locomotor disability worldwide, and affects on average 25% of the general population in the Western world, with increasing prevalence with age. About 80% of OA patients suffer from arthritis-attributable limitations of activity, 25% cannot perform major activities of daily living, 14% of adults with knee OA require help with routine needs, and 11% require help with personal care.

Recommendations for the management of knee OA have been issued by different national, continental, and global scientific authorities, and differentiate pharmacologically between background (basic) and advanced treatment strategies.–While basic pharmacological approaches address predominantly chondroprotective and antinociceptive mechanisms, advanced interventions for OA patients in whom these background treatments have failed and who suffer from moderate-to-severe pain focus on anti-inflammatory interventions to relieve pain and to improve daily functioning and quality of life.

Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) – scientifically known to be highly efficacious for OA pain – are traditionally listed as first-line agents in combination with the recommendation to select the most appropriate nonselective or COX2-selective NSAIDs with respect to their safety profiles and patients' individual risk factors, concomitant diseases, and medical conditions to improve their safety and tolerability. While generally safe when used at low doses and in the short term,–NSAIDs – COX2-selective or not – are frequently associated with significant side effects and increase the risk of serious adverse events (AEs) involving the gastrointestinal (GI), cardiovascular, and renal systems, especially when used long term at higher doses in patients with concomitant diseases or in the elderly, which is often the case in patients with OA.–

In the past few decades, complementary medicines with COX-independent pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects – such as an oral enzyme combination (OEC) consisting of the natural compounds trypsin, bromelain, and rutoside trihydrate – has become increasingly popular among OA patients in Europe and North America. In contrast to its popularity and patient-reported beneficial effects under daily practice conditions, scientific evidence for its efficacy remains rather limited.

### Relative efficacy and safety of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^116qESXw]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major source of pain, disability and socioeconomic costs worldwideand commonly affects footballers, rugby players and other athletes. Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended for OA pain, but their safety concerns often outweigh their benefits. Concerns over the gastrointestinal (GI) risk of oral traditional NSAIDs are widely accepted, and selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors were developed as an alternative to reduce this risk. COX-2 inhibitors, however, are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events. It is therefore suggested that both oral NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors should be prescribed with a proton pump inhibitor in patients with a high risk of GI bleeding. However, the issues associated with polypharmacy and the additional costs of this combination therapy limit their use.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of osteoarthritis of the knee (nonarthroplasty), third edition [^117C2VM1]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

AAOS osteoarthritis of the knee (nonarthroplasty) — implementation and research considerations emphasize removing oral narcotics from prescriptions for knee osteoarthritis, noting the significance given the opioid epidemic in the United States. Cost effectiveness/resource utilization states that the most cost-effective systemic treatment is still to be determined. Acceptability notes that oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly utilized and that implementing this recommendation does not influence a major change in clinical practice. Feasibility indicates that this recommendation may be implemented immediately with a potential positive impact in clinical practice. Future research calls for high quality randomized trials or prospective cohort studies within specific subgroups and populations to tailor systemic medications toward increased efficacy and decreased adverse effects.

Results

Search results and characteristics of included trials

We screened 21 713 references of which 153 were found to be eligible (fig 1). Twenty eight additional trials were identified from the reference lists of relevant papers and in ClinicalTrials.gov. In total, we included data from 181 publications describing 192 trials. These trials involved 102 829 participants with a median sample size of 466 participants (interquartile range 309–718). Considering different drug preparations and doses, a total of 90 active intervention nodes (hereafter referred to as interventions) were examined for at least one of the outcomes of interest: 68 NSAIDs, 19 opioids, three paracetamol (table 1, table 2, table 3, and web-appendix 7 and 8). Additionally, three control interventions were included in the network: oral, topical, and oral plus topical placebo. Celecoxib 200 mg/day was the most frequently investigated intervention (44 trials). Only safety data were available for nine interventions (web-appendix 7). Web-appendix 9 shows the network of interventions included in the pain outcome analysis.

### Disease-modifying effects of COX-2 selective inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs in osteoarthritis: a systematic review [^114i8Qcz]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a potentially disabling disease whose progression is dependent on several risk factors. OA management usually involves the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are the primary pharmacological treatments of choice. However, NSAIDs have often been associated with unwanted side effects. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 specific inhibitors, such as celecoxib, have been successfully used as an alternative in the past for OA treatment and have demonstrated fewer side effects. While abundant data are available for the clinical efficacy of drugs used for OA treatment, little is known about the disease-modifying effects of these agents. A previous review published by Zweers et al. (2010) assessed the available literature between 1990 and 2010 on the disease-modifying effects of celecoxib. In the present review, we aimed to update the existing evidence and identify evolving concepts relating to the disease-modifying effects of not just celecoxib, but also other NSAIDs. We conducted a review of the literature published from 2010 to 2016 dealing with the effects, especially disease-modifying effects, of NSAIDs on cartilage, synovium, and bone in OA patients. Our results show that celecoxib was the most commonly used drug in papers that presented data on disease-modifying effects of NSAIDs. Further, these effects appeared to be mediated through the regulation of prostaglandins, cytokines, and direct changes to tissues. Additional studies should be carried out to assess the disease-modifying properties of NSAIDs in greater detail.

### Celecoxib for rheumatoid arthritis [^117BX8Hr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic auto-immune disorder that causes widespread and persistent inflammation of the synovial lining of joints and tendon sheaths. Presently, there is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis and treatment focuses on managing symptoms such as pain, stiffness and mobility, with the aim of achieving stable remission and improving mobility. Celecoxib is a selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for treatment of people with rheumatoid arthritis.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of celecoxib in people with rheumatoid arthritis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and clinical trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization trials portal) to May 18, 2017. We also searched the reference and citation lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral celecoxib (200 mg and 400 mg daily) versus no intervention, placebo or a traditional NSAID (tNSAID) in people with confirmed rheumatoid arthritis, of any age and either sex. We excluded studies with fewer than 50 participants in each arm or had durations of fewer than four weeks treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs with durations of 4 to 24 weeks, published between 1998 and 2014 that involved a total of 3988 adults (mean age = 54 years), most of whom were women (73%). Participants had rheumatoid arthritis for an average of 9.2 years. All studies were assessed at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Overall, evidence was assessed as moderate-to-low quality. Five studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Celecoxib versus placeboWe included two studies (N = 873) in which participants received 200 mg daily or 400 mg daily or placebo. Participants who received celecoxib showed significant clinical improvement compared with those receiving placebo (15% absolute improvement; 95% CI 7% to 25%; RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.86; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 7, 95% CI 5 to 13; 2 studies, 873 participants; moderate to low quality evidence). Participants who received celecoxib reported less pain than placebo-treated people (11% absolute improvement; 95% CI 8% to 14%; NNTB = 4, 95% CI 3 to 6; 1 study, 706 participants) but results were inconclusive for improvement in physical function (MD -0.10, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.10; 1 study, 706 participants). In the celecoxib group, 15/293 participants developed ulcers, compared with 4/99 in the placebo group (Peto OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.63; 1 study, 392 participants; low quality evidence). Nine (of 475) participants in the celecoxib group developed short-term serious adverse events, compared with five (of 231) in the placebo group (Peto OR 0.87 (0.28 to 2.69; 1 study, 706 participants; low quality evidence). There were fewer withdrawals among people who received celecoxib (163/475) compared with placebo (130/231) (22% absolute change; 95% CI 16% to 27%; RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.72; 1 study, 706 participants). Cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke) were not reported. However, regulatory agencies warn of increased cardiovascular event risk associated with celecoxib. Celecoxib versus tNSAIDsSeven studies (N = 2930) compared celecoxib and tNSAIDs (amtolmetin guacyl, diclofenac, ibuprofen, meloxicam, nabumetone, naproxen, pelubiprofen); one study included comparisons of both placebo and tNSAIDs (N = 1149). There was a small improvement, which may not be clinically significant, in numbers of participants achieving ACR20 criteria response in the celecoxib group compared to tNSAIDs (4% absolute improvement; 95% CI 0% less improvement to 8% more improvement; RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.23; 4 studies, 1981 participants). There was a lack of evidence of difference between participants in the celecoxib and tNSAID groups in terms of pain or physical function. Results were assessed at moderate-to-low quality evidence (downgraded due to risk of bias and inconsistency). People who received celecoxib had a lower incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers ≥ 3 mm (34/870) compared with those who received tNSAIDs (116/698). This corresponded to 12% absolute change (95% CI 11% to 13%; RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.32; 5 studies, 1568 participants; moderate quality evidence). There were 7% fewer withdrawals among people who received celecoxib (95% CI 4% to 9%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.86; 6 studies, 2639 participants). Results were inconclusive for short-term serious adverse events and cardiovascular events (low quality evidence). There were 17/918 serious adverse events in people taking celecoxib compared to 42/1236 among people who received placebo (Peto OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.39 to 1.28; 5 studies, 2154 participants). Cardiovascular events were reported in both celecoxib and placebo groups in one study (149 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Celecoxib may improve clinical symptoms, alleviate pain and contribute to little or no difference in physical function compared with placebo. Celecoxib was associated with fewer numbers of participant withdrawals. Results for incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers (≥ 3 mm) and short-term serious adverse events were uncertain; however, there were few reported events for either. Celecoxib may slightly improve clinical symptoms compared with tNSAIDs. Results for reduced pain and improved physical function were uncertain. Particpants taking celecoxib had lower incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers (≥ 3 mm) and there were fewer withdrawals from trials. Results for cardiovascular events and short-term serious adverse events were also uncertain. Uncertainty about the rate of cardiovascular events between celecoxib and tNSAIDs could be due to risk of bias; another factor is that these were small, short-term trials. It has been reported previously that both celecoxib and tNSAIDs increase cardiovascular event rates. Our confidence in results about harms is therefore low. Larger head-to-head clinical trials comparing celecoxib to other tNSAIDs is needed to better inform clinical practice.

### The role of anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of osteoarthritis: a United States viewpoint [^113eWBSU]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), first published in 1995 under the auspices of the American College of Rheumatology, were updated with publication of revised recommendations in September 2000 to take account of significant advances in OA management. These advances include increased understanding of the disease process and the introduction of new medications, including the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors and the intra-articular hyaluronans. In addition, studies demonstrating superior efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) vs acetaminophen in the treatment of OA led to a re-evaluation of indications for initial pharmacologic approaches, given the availability of safer NSAIDs. In contrast to the previous recommendation that acetaminophen was the drug of choice for the initial treatment of all patients with OA, the new recommendations support consideration of the use of NSAIDs as initial treatment — either COX-2 selective inhibitors or classical NSAIDs with gastroprotective agents — particularly in patients with moderate to severe pain and inflammation. The important role of non-pharmacologic approaches including weight loss, avoidance of joint overuse, appropriate exercises and orthotics was re-emphasized. It is anticipated that guideline revisions will take place at more frequent intervals in the future, given today's rapid advances in therapeutic approaches, not only for symptomatic therapy but also for therapy targeted to structural disease modification.

### Clinical trial data in support of changing guidelines in osteoarthritis treatment [^113c4vWc]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Countries in the European Union have been using topical NSAIDs for more than a decade, while the USA has only recently approved their use for the treatment of OA. As both the amount of data related to the increased risks associated with oral NSAIDs and the clinical experience with topical NSAIDs continue to increase, clinical management guidelines can quickly become out of date if not updated frequently. Attempting to understand the human condition of pain requires a pluralistic approach that incorporates data to create a true "world literature" that supports global remedies for pain. As medicine becomes increasingly globalized, international clinical guidelines for the management of OA that deliver consistent diagnostic and treatment approaches are becoming increasingly important to pain specialists in the European Union, the USA, and around the world.

### Patient benefit-risk in arthritis – a rheumatologist's perspective [^115AEdW4]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

There is a range of pharmacological options available to the rheumatologist for treating arthritis. Non-selective NSAIDs or Cox-2 selective inhibitors are widely prescribed to reduce inflammation and alleviate pain; however, they must be used with caution in individuals with an increased cardiovascular, renal or gastrointestinal (GI) risk. The potential cardiovascular risks of Cox-2 selective inhibitors came to light over a decade ago. The conflicting nature of the study data reflects some context dependency, but the evidence shows a varying degree of cardiovascular risk with both Cox-2 selective inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs. This risk appears to be dose dependent, which may have important ramifications for arthritis patients who require long-term treatment with high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs. The renal effects of non-selective NSAIDs have been well characterized. An increased risk of adverse renal events was found with rofecoxib but not celecoxib, suggesting that this is not a class effect of Cox-2 selective inhibitors. Upper GI effects of non-selective NSAID treatment, ranging from abdominal pain to ulceration and bleeding are extensively documented. Concomitant prescription of a proton pump inhibitor can help in the upper GI tract, but probably not in the lower. Evidence suggests that Cox-2 selective inhibitors are better tolerated in the entire GI tract. More evidence is required, and a composite end-point is being evaluated. Appropriate treatment strategies are needed depending on the level of upper and lower GI risk. Rheumatologists must be vigilant in assessing benefit–risk when prescribing a Cox-2 selective inhibitor or non-selective NSAID and should choose appropriate agents for each individual patient.

### The role of anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of osteoarthritis: a European viewpoint [^115rtCHt]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Despite the fact that there is no scope for an inflammatory process in a strict definition of osteoarthritis (OA), inflammation nevertheless seems to be of great relevance in understanding not only the occurrence of the disease but also its propensity and/or persistence. Longitudinal epidemiologic studies suggest that inflammation — defined by the presence of synovitis within the joint cavity — is a potent predisposing factor for cartilage breakdown. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have demonstrated their beneficial short term, rapid-acting effect. However, two questions remain: the choice of NSAIDs versus analysis as first line therapy for symptomatic treatment in OA, and the long-term structural effect of such therapy.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^113syhvX]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

As Scarpignato et al. note, and a recent FDA hearing concluded, the best evidence should come from a large randomized controlled trial in arthritis patients at high CV risk; such a study is now nearing completion. The Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety versus Ibuprofen Or Naproxen (PRECISION) trial, which was mandated by the FDA, has recruited more than 20,000 such patients. The last patient follow-up is scheduled for the end of 2015, so results can be anticipated during 2016. This study should give useful, real-world information to increase the evidence base for managing the high CV risk arthritis patient.

### Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of gastrointestinal symptoms [^114DKE35]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most commonly used medications. Although much is known about prescription NSAIDs and risk of GI side effects, little is known about over-the-counter (OTC) NSAIDs and their risk of GI side effects. The aim of this study was to estimate use of OTC NSAIDs, GI side effects, and professional and self-care for these side effects.

Methods

We conducted a telephone survey of an age-stratified U.S. random sample of 535 persons at least 40 yr old, who used an OTC NSAID for 4 of the previous 7 days, and a matched comparison population of 1068 persons who used no NSAID within the previous 30 days. We measured current use of OTC NSAIDs, GI symptoms, diagnoses and their treatment, and prescription and OTC GI medications.

Results

The most commonly used OTC NSAID was aspirin (alone or in combination compounds). Prevention of myocardial infarction or stroke was the most common reason for use (43.2%), followed by all forms of pain relief (44.2%) and relief of arthritis symptoms (24.5%). NSAID users were twice as likely as nonusers to report GI side effects (19.6% vs 9.5%, p = 0.0001), and more than twice as likely to use an OTC GI medication when they had GI symptoms (46.7% vs 20.8%, p = 0.001).

Conclusions

OTC NSAIDs are not a benign medication even at low dosages. Physicians may be unaware that patients self-medicate with OTC NSAIDs and for GI side effects with additional OTC GI medications. Therefore, physicians should routinely ask patients about all forms of self-treatment.

### Topical NSAIDs for chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults [^111zWfCP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Use of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat chronic musculoskeletal conditions has become widely accepted because they can provide pain relief without associated systemic adverse events. This review is an update of 'Topical NSAIDs for chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults', originally published in Issue 9, 2012.

Objectives

To review the evidence from randomised, double-blind, controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of topically applied NSAIDs for chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and our own in-house database; the date of the last search was February 2016. We also searched the references lists of included studies and reviews, and sought unpublished studies by asking personal contacts and searching online clinical trial registers and manufacturers' web sites.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, active or inert carrier (placebo) controlled trials in which treatments were administered to adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain of moderate or severe intensity. Studies had to meet stringent quality criteria and there had to be at least 10 participants in each treatment arm, with application of treatment at least once daily.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate risk ratio and numbers needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to carrier or other active treatment. We were particularly interested to compare different formulations (gel, cream, plaster) of individual NSAIDs. The primary outcome was 'clinical success', defined as at least a 50% reduction in pain, or an equivalent measure such as a 'very good' or 'excellent' global assessment of treatment, or 'none' or 'slight' pain on rest or movement, measured on a categorical scale.

Main Results

We identified five new studies for this update, which now has information from 10,631 participants in 39 studies, a 38% increase in participants from the earlier review; 33 studies compared a topical NSAID with carrier. All studies examined topical NSAIDs for treatment of osteoarthritis, and for pooled analyses studies were generally of moderate or high methodological quality, although we considered some at risk of bias from short duration and small size. In studies lasting 6 to 12 weeks, topical diclofenac and topical ketoprofen were significantly more effective than carrier for reducing pain; about 60% of participants had much reduced pain. With topical diclofenac, the NNT for clinical success in six trials (2343 participants) was 9.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.1 to 16) (moderate quality evidence). With topical ketoprofen, the NNT for clinical success in four trials (2573 participants) was 6.9 (5.4 to 9.3) (moderate quality evidence). There was too little information for analysis of other individual topical NSAIDs compared with carrier. Few trials compared a topical NSAID to an oral NSAID, but overall they showed similar efficacy (low quality evidence). These efficacy results were almost completely derived from people with knee osteoarthritis. There was an increase in local adverse events (mostly mild skin reactions) with topical diclofenac compared with carrier or oral NSAIDs, but no increase with topical ketoprofen (moderate quality evidence). Reporting of systemic adverse events (such as gastrointestinal upsets) was poor, but where reported there was no difference between topical NSAID and carrier (very low quality evidence). Serious adverse events were infrequent and not different between topical NSAID and carrier (very low quality evidence). Clinical success with carrier occurred commonly - in around half the participants in studies lasting 6 to 12 weeks. Both direct and indirect comparison of clinical success with oral placebo indicates that response rates with carrier (topical placebo) are about twice those seen with oral placebo. A substantial amount of data from completed, unpublished studies was unavailable (up to 6000 participants). To the best of our knowledge, much of this probably relates to formulations that have never been marketed.

Authors' Conclusions

Topical diclofenac and topical ketoprofen can provide good levels of pain relief beyond carrier in osteoarthritis for a minority of people, but there is no evidence for other chronic painful conditions. There is emerging evidence that at least some of the substantial placebo effects seen in longer duration studies derive from effects imparted by the NSAID carrier itself, and that NSAIDs add to that.

### Pharmaceutical treatment of osteoarthritis [^116JgF4S]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the current state of pharmaceutical treatment recommendations for the management of osteoarthritis.

Method

A narrative review was drafted to describe treatment guidelines, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity for nine classes of pharmaceuticals: 1) oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 2) topical NSAIDs, 3) COX-2 inhibitors, 4) duloxetine, 5) intra-articular corticosteroids, 6) intra-articular hyaluronic acid, 7) acetaminophen (paracetamol), 8) tramadol, and 9) capsaicin.

Results

In general, oral and topical NSAIDs, including COX-2 inhibitors, are strongly recommended first-line treatments for osteoarthritis due to their ability to improve pain and function but are associated with increased risks in patients with certain comorbidities (e.g., heightened cardiovascular risks). Intra-articular corticosteroid injections are generally recommended for osteoarthritis management and have relatively minor adverse effects. Other treatments, such as capsaicin, tramadol, and acetaminophen, are more controversial, and many updated guidelines offer differing recommendations.

Conclusion

The pharmaceutical management of osteoarthritis is a constantly evolving field. Promising treatments are emerging, and medicines that were once considered conventional (e.g., acetaminophen) are gradually becoming less acceptable based on concerns with efficacy and safety. Clinicians need to consider the latest evidence and recommendations to make an informed decision with their patients about how to optimize treatment plans for patients with knee, hip, polyarticular, or hand osteoarthritis.

### Analgesics for osteoarthritis… [^117V382s]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

This Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review examined the effectiveness and adverse effects of nonopioid oral and topical analgesics for osteoarthritic pain. 3 Selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors provide similar pain relief, as do topical NSAIDs. All oral NSAIDS increase the risk of myocardial infarction, with the exception of naproxen. 3 Cardiac risks are greater in older patients, persons with a history of cardiac events, and persons taking higher doses.
3. 3 Prescribing NSAIDs with H 2 antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, or misoprostol decreases the risk of endoscopically detected ulcers.

3 In the AHRQ review, three trials with a total of 1, 248 patients comparing topical diclofenac with oral diclofenac or ibuprofen found no difference between the groups in pain, stiffness, or physical function. The topical diclofenac group experienced significantly fewer GI adverse effects. 3 The AHRQ review also showed that, in two case-control trials and one retrospective study, topical NSAIDs were not associated with an increased risk of bleeding compared with placebo. 3 Three meta-analyses reviewed by the AHRQ concluded that acetaminophen is modestly inferior to NSAIDs for relieving osteoarthritic pain. 3 Although acetaminophen was associated with fewer GI adverse effects than were nonselective NSAIDs, the risk of any adverse GI event was similar between celecoxib and acetaminophen in two systematic reviews.

3 Large observational studies in the AHRQ review found that patients who reported heavy acetaminophen use had a risk of cardiovascular events similar to that of patients taking NSAIDs.
3. In summary, all oral and topical NSAIDs have similar effectiveness for osteoarthritic pain and, overall, provide better relief than acetaminophen. 3 Family physicians treating patients with osteoarthritis should begin with nonpharmacologic options and take into account drug risks and patient goals before prescribing medication. They should also prescribe the lowest dose and shortest duration of treatment whenever possible.

### Osteoarthritis management: the role of cyclooxygenase-2-selective inhibitors [^115pjtA3]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors are a new type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for the management of pain caused by osteoarthritis (OA). The most recent OA guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology were published in 2000 because new therapies such as the COX-2-selective inhibitors had been introduced for the management of OA.

Objective

Because more data are now available on efficacy and safety issues with COX-2-selective inhibitors, NSAIDs, and acetaminophen, this review focuses on how COX-2-selective inhibitors may change the pharmacologic management of patients with OA.

Methods

References were obtained from MEDLINE, BIOSIS, EMBASE, and Internet searches of the literature.

Conclusions

The safety and efficacy of two COX-2-selective inhibitors, rofecoxib and celecoxib, have been examined in a number of clinical trials, and these agents have been shown to offer efficacy similar to that of NSAIDs. Acetaminophen continues to be the initial drug of choice for the management of OA because of its efficacy, safety, cost, and availability. COX-2-selective inhibitors should be considered in patients with OA who do not respond to or cannot tolerate therapy with acetaminophen. COX-2-selective inhibitors have an improved gastrointestinal (GI) safety profile compared with traditional NSAIDs and should be chosen over NSAIDs if prescription plan access and/or expense is not a concern. COX-2-selective inhibitors are clinically indicated for patients at increased risk of developing NSAID-induced GI complications, a population in whom the use of COX-2-selective inhibitors may be cost-effective because the incidence and mortality associated with serious GI adverse events and use of expensive GI comedications would be reduced.

### Relative efficacy and safety of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^112UYGwu]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including salicylate, for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched from 1966 to January 2017. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical NSAIDs with placebo or each other in patients with OA and observational studies comparing topical NSAIDs with no treatment or each other irrespective of disease were included. Two investigators identified studies and independently extracted data. Bayesian network and conventional meta-analyses were conducted. The primary outcomes were pain relief for RCTs and risk of adverse effects (AEs) for observational studies.

Results

43 studies, comprising 36 RCTs (7 900 patients with OA) and seven observational studies (218 074 participants), were included. Overall, topical NSAIDs were superior to placebo for relieving pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) = −0.30, 95% CI −0.40 to –0.20) and improving function (SMD = −0.35, 95% CI −0.45 to –0.24) in OA. Of all topical NSAIDs, diclofenac patches were most effective for OA pain (SMD = −0.81, 95% CI −1.12 to –0.52) and piroxicam was most effective for functional improvement (SMD = −1.04, 95% CI −1.60 to –0.48) compared with placebo. Although salicylate gel was associated with higher withdrawal rates due to AEs, the remaining topical NSAIDs were not associated with any increased local or systemic AEs.

Conclusions

Topical NSAIDs were effective and safe for OA. Diclofenac patches may be the most effective topical NSAID for pain relief. No serious gastrointestinal and renal AEs were observed in trials or the general population. However, confirmation of the cardiovascular safety of topical NSAIDs still warrants further observational study.

### Clinical trial data in support of changing guidelines in osteoarthritis treatment [^115my6Me]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Goals for the management of osteoarthritis (OA) emphasize pain relief, reduction of inflammation, and improvement in functioning. Among pharmacological pain management interventions, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently recommended as the most effective treatment option for OA. However, the use of traditional oral NSAIDs is associated with risk of serious adverse events involving the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal systems. Topical NSAIDs are an alternative with well-established tolerability and efficacy in the treatment of OA of the knee or hand. While the management of OA pain is evolving toward the more widespread use of topical NSAIDs, some OA management guidelines have yet to incorporate these agents in their recommendations. This review examines the efficacy and tolerability of topical NSAIDs, their current placement in OA management guidelines, and their potential role in enabling pain specialists to provide individualized care for their patients with OA.

### COX-2 inhibitors vs. NSAIDs in treatment of arthritis… [^114PJh6g]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment of arthritis is well established, but the side effect of gastrointestinal bleeding causes significant morbidity and mortality. Up to 2, 500 deaths in Britain are attributed to NSAID-induced GI bleeding annually. The cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme-inhibiting drugs were developed to provide symptom relief without GI effects. Deeks and colleagues systematically reviewed all available evidence to compare the effectiveness and GI tolerability of a leading COX-2 drug, celecoxib, with NSAIDs in the treatment of arthritis. The authors sought all published and unpublished trials through electronic searches plus contacts with drug manufacturers and registries of trials. The analysis included all randomized, double-blind controlled trials using licensed dosages of celecoxib for at least 12 weeks to treat active rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.

Trials against placebo were included, as well as those comparing celecoxib with NSAIDs. Clinical improvement was significantly better in patients treated with celecoxib than in those treated with placebo. Compared with NSAIDs, celecoxib showed non-significantly better outcomes in ACR-20 and other clinical outcome measures in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In patients with osteoarthritis, there were no significant differences between those treated with NSAIDs and those treated with celecoxib; both were superior to placebo in relieving clinical symptoms. Ulcers occurred three times more often in patients treated with celecoxib than in those treated with placebo, but the incidence of ulcers in patients treated with celecoxib was 71 percent lower than in patients treated with NSAIDs. At three months, the number needed to treat for benefit was six.

This reduction also was evident in a study using endoscopy at six months. The rate of serious GI complications in patients taking celecoxib was nearly one half that of patients using NSAIDs, but this difference was not statistically significant. The authors conclude that celecoxib is as effective as NSAIDs in the symptomatic treatment of both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and is associated with significantly fewer GI-related adverse outcomes. editor's note: Although this study and a Canadian study of elderly patients (.

### Hip pain and mobility deficits – hip osteoarthritis: clinical practice guidelines linked to the international classification of functioning, disability, and health from the orthopaedic section of the American Physical Therapy Association [^1136fXcw]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis — anti-inflammatory agents and corticosteroid injections are described for symptom relief with noted risks. Both over-the-counter and prescribed anti-inflammatory agents including NSAIDs, Cox-2 inhibitors, and steroid injections are recommended as part of a multidisciplinary treatment approach to hip OA, and randomized clinical trials have shown NSAIDs can be effective for the temporary relief of symptoms and improvement in function in patients with hip OA; however, this class of drugs is not without risk for serious adverse events including increased gastrointestinal bleeding. There is evidence to support the use of corticosteroid injections in patients with hip OA to provide short-term pain relief, and a recent placebo-controlled trial confirmed corticosteroid injection can be an effective treatment of pain in hip OA, with benefits lasting up to 3 months. Some evidence does suggest some NSAIDs may increase the progression of hip OA by decreasing glycosaminoglycan synthesis; however, further studies are needed.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute gout [^113Cax1z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis resulting from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in and around joints. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to treat acute gout. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (including cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs)) for acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for studies to 28 August 2020. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing NSAIDs with placebo or another therapy for acute gout. Major outcomes were pain, inflammation, function, participant-reported global assessment, quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events, and total adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included in this update 28 trials (3406 participants), including 5 new trials. One trial (30 participants) compared NSAIDs to placebo, 6 (1244 participants) compared non-selective NSAIDs to selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs), 5 (712 participants) compared NSAIDs to glucocorticoids, 13 compared one NSAID to another NSAID (633 participants), and single trials compared NSAIDs to rilonacept (225 participants), acupuncture (163 participants), and colchicine (399 participants). Most trials were at risk of selection, performance, and detection biases. We report numerical data for the primary comparison NSAIDs versus placebo and brief results for the two comparisons - NSAIDs versus COX-2 inhibitors and NSAIDs versus glucocorticoids. Low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision) from 1 trial (30 participants) shows NSAIDs compared to placebo. More participants (11/15) may have a 50% reduction in pain at 24 hours with NSAIDs than with placebo (4/15) (risk ratio (RR) 2.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 6.7), with absolute improvement of 47% (3.5% more to 152.5% more). NSAIDs may have little to no effect on inflammation (swelling) after four days (13/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 12/15 participants taking placebo; RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.5), with absolute improvement of 6.4% (16.8% fewer to 39.2% more). There may be little to no difference in function (4-point scale; 1 = complete resolution) at 24 hours (4/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 1/15 participants taking placebo; RR 4.0, 95% CI 0.5 to 31.7), with absolute improvement of 20% (3.3% fewer to 204.9% more). NSAIDs may result in little to no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (0 events in both groups) or in total adverse events; two adverse events (nausea and polyuria) were reported in the placebo group (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.0, 3.8), with absolute difference of 10.7% more (13.2% fewer to 38% more). Treatment success and health-related quality of life were not measured. Moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) from 6 trials (1244 participants) shows non-selective NSAIDs compared to selective COX-2 inhibitors (COXIBs). Non-selective NSAIDs probably result in little to no difference in pain (mean difference (MD) 0.03, 95% CI 0.07 lower to 0.14 higher), swelling (MD 0.08, 95% CI 0.07 lower to 0.22 higher), treatment success (MD 0.08, 95% CI 0.04 lower to 0.2 higher), or quality of life (MD -0.2, 95% CI -6.7 to 6.3) compared to COXIBs. Low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision) suggests no difference in function (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.25) between groups. Non-selective NSAIDs probably increase withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.1) and total adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal) (RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.8). Moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) based on 5 trials (712 participants) shows NSAIDs compared to glucocorticoids. NSAIDs probably result in little to no difference in pain (MD 0.1, 95% CI -2.7 to 3.0), inflammation (MD 0.3, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.6), function (MD -0.2, 95% CI -2.2 to 1.8), or treatment success (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.2). There was no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events with NSAIDs compared to glucocorticoids (RR 2.8, 95% CI 0.5 to 14.2). There was a decrease in total adverse events with glucocorticoids compared to NSAIDs (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.5).

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence from 1 placebo-controlled trial suggests that NSAIDs may improve pain at 24 hours and may have little to no effect on function, inflammation, or adverse events for treatment of acute gout. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that COXIBs and non-selective NSAIDs are probably equally beneficial with regards to improvement in pain, function, inflammation, and treatment success, although non-selective NSAIDs probably increase withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that systemic glucocorticoids and NSAIDs probably are equally beneficial in terms of pain relief, improvement in function, and treatment success. Withdrawals due to adverse events were also similar between groups, but NSAIDs probably result in more total adverse events. Low-certainty evidence suggests no difference in inflammation between groups. Only low-certainty evidence was available for the comparisons NSAID versus rilonacept and NSAID versus acupuncture from single trials, or one NSAID versus another NSAID, which also included many NSAIDs that are no longer in clinical use. Although these data were insufficient to support firm conclusions, they do not conflict with clinical guideline recommendations based upon evidence from observational studies, findings for other inflammatory arthritis, and expert consensus, all of which support the use of NSAIDs for acute gout.

### Advice from professional societies: appropriate use of NSAIDs [^111sDVr2]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are some of the most commonly used medications due to their well-known analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic actions. Due to their known benefits and inherent risks, there have been multiple guidelines from national professional societies that suggest appropriate use to provide both maximum benefit and mitigate risk of adverse events, particularly in older individuals.

Design

A literature search was undertaken using PubMed and search terms including pain, aging, treatment, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, arthritis, older patient, and guidelines. Practice guideline reviews were conducted from the following sources: American Geriatric Society, American College of Rheumatology, and the European League Against Rheumatism suggesting the appropriate and safer use of NSAIDs, along with references to guidelines product by Osteoarthritis Research International, the American Gastroenterological Association.

Conclusions

Literature-based and professional society guidelines provides clinicians with means optimize efficacy and safety of NSAIDs in clinical practice. Summary recommendations are provided in this review.

### Osteoarthritis therapy – are there still unmet needs? [^115ANP6y]. Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are commonly used to control pain and inflammation in osteoarthritis. However, these agents have been associated with gastrointestinal, renal and cardiovascular adverse effects. Together, these complications indicate a clear unmet need in the safety of current treatment options for the management of osteoarthritis. NSAIDs are known to have adverse gastrointestinal effects, and more recently it has been suggested that some selective COX-2 inhibitors are also associated with serious gastrointestinal complications. Selective COX-2 inhibitors have a similar capacity to NSAIDs to delay ulcer healing, and may not significantly decrease the incidences of perforation, ulceration and bleeding (the most clinically relevant gastrointestinal endpoints) compared with NSAIDs. These effects may be due to overlapping roles of COX-1 and COX-2 in physiological and pathophysiological processes. Furthermore, as COX-2 is integrally involved in renal homeostasis, selective COX-2 inhibitors are associated with negative effects on kidney function similar to those seen with NSAIDs. Electrolyte disturbances, oedema and hypertension have been correlated with the use of both drug classes. Additionally, selective COX-2 inhibitors have the potential to increase cardiovascular events, although further research is required to clearly determine such a risk. With the current unmet needs in the treatment of osteoarthritis, the opportunity exists for the development of new therapies. Novel agents include the COX-inhibiting nitric oxide donors and the lipoxygenase (LOX)/COX inhibitor licofelone. Initial results suggest that these therapies may have tolerability advantages over the NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors.

Consensus Points for NSAIDs

NSAIDs are an effective treatment for mild-to-moderate pain secondary to osteoarthritis knee pain; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
Topical NSAIDs are recommended before oral treatments because of their lower systemic exposure/toxicity; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
Topical diclofenac 70–81 mg/day should be considered as first-line pharmacological treatment for knee OA - can be effective and generally safer than oral NSAIDs due to reduced systemic exposure and lower dose; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
NSAIDs should not be used for patients with comorbidities due to risk of adverse events; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
NSAIDs should not be used on a long-term basis (> 3 months) due to side effect profile (cardiovascular and gastrointestinal) and lack safety data; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
Celecoxib and non-selective NSAIDs are as effective as opioid for knee OA; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
Due to low effect on pain and physical function, regardless of dose, the potential clinical benefit of opioids does not outweigh the potential harm in patients with knee OA; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong

### Efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of osteoarthritis: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112vshZz]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of osteoarthritis.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, Scientific Citation Index, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and abstracts from conferences.

Review Methods

Inclusion criterion was randomised controlled trials comparing topical NSAIDs with placebo or oral NSAIDs in osteoarthritis. Effect size was calculated for pain, function, and stiffness. Rate ratio was calculated for dichotomous data such as clinical response rate and adverse event rate. Number needed to treat to obtain the clinical response was estimated. Quality of trial was assessed, and sensitivity analyses were undertaken.

Results

Topical NSAIDs were superior to placebo in relieving pain due to osteoarthritis only in the first two weeks of treatment. Effect sizes for weeks 1 and 2 were 0.41 (95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 0.66) and 0.40 (0.15 to 0.65), respectively. No benefit was observed over placebo in weeks 3 and 4. A similar pattern was observed for function, stiffness, and clinical response rate ratio and number needed to treat. Topical NSAIDs were inferior to oral NSAIDs in the first week of treatment and associated with more local side effects such as rash, itch, or burning (rate ratio 5.29, 1.14 to 24.51).

Conclusion

Randomised controlled trials of short duration only (less than four weeks) have assessed the efficacy of topical NSAIDs in osteoarthritis. After two weeks there was no evidence of efficacy superior to placebo. No trial data support the long term use of topical NSAIDs in osteoarthritis.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in chronic pain: implications of new data for clinical practice [^117CFcb5]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as "pain that persists beyond normal tissue healing time, which is assumed to be 3 months". Chronic pain is one of the most prominent causes of disability worldwide and represents a major challenge for public health. Patients with chronic pain report that this has a significant impact on their work and daily function. The presence of inflammation is a common underlying mechanism of chronic pain. Inflammation can occur in the affected organ and/or nerves. Low-grade inflammation, both local and systemic, is also the hallmark of many chronic, progressing, and painful conditions, such as osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Existing guidelines recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) as the first-line analgesic agent.–However, this is not an ideal choice for chronic inflammatory pain, because paracetamol lacks anti-inflammatory activity and has been shown to be less effective than alternative nonopioid options in chronic conditions involving connective tissue.–In addition, although traditionally seen as a better-tolerated analgesic option, there are safety concerns with the use of paracetamol, particularly at dosages > 3 g/day, for extended periods (eg, several years).–

### Which nonsurgical treatments Do patients believe are most effective for hip and knee arthritis? [^1129wU7z]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The pain associated with osteoarthritis can have a detrimental impact on a patient's function and quality of life. Total joint arthroplasty is an effective treatment option for end-stage osteoarthritis, but a trial of conservative management is prudent and should be tried before surgical intervention. There are many nonsurgical treatment options available to patients for the treatment of hip and knee osteoarthritis.

The American Academic of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) published the guidelines to assist in making evidence-based decisions in the conservative management of hip and knee osteoarthritis. Studies support the use of strengthening, low impact aerobic exercise, weight loss, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and tramadol in the management of knee osteoarthritis. Physical therapy (PT), NSAIDs, and intraarticular corticosteroids are recommended for conservative treatment of hip osteoarthritis. Inconclusive evidence exists regarding the use of acetaminophen, opioids, and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections, and hyaluronic acid injections. In addition, the literature largely consists of studies comparing the effectiveness of one or two treatment options and lacks a study of patients' attitudes toward which conservative treatments are most effective.

Despite AAOS recommendations, many patients undergo conservative treatment modalities that are either not endorsed or have inconclusive evidence. A recent study by Bedard et al.demonstrated that if only AAOS-recommended treatment modalities were used, the cost associated with treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee could be decreased by 45% in the year before arthroplasty. With the contemporary emphasis on minimizing healthcare costs, careful consideration should be given to the cost benefit ratio of conservative treatments for osteoarthritis of the hip and knee. The purpose of this study was to determine which nonsurgical treatments that patients reported are most effective for managing pain secondary to hip and knee arthritis and to determine the cost-effectiveness of each treatment modality.

### Acetaminophen for osteoarthritis [^111iD7PK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. Published guidelines and expert opinion are divided over the relative role of acetaminophen (also called paracetamol or Tylenol) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as first-line pharmacologic therapy. The comparative safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs is important to consider as NSAIDs have the potential for serious gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular toxicities, and acetaminophen in high dosages (greater than or equal to 2 grams per day), may also have the potential for serious upper gastrointestinal toxicity.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen versus placebo and versus NSAIDs (ibuprofen, arthrotec, celecoxib, naproxen, rofecoxib) for treating OA.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (up to July 2002), and Current Contents (up to March 2002). Reference lists of identified RCTs and pertinent review articles were also hand searched.

Selection Criteria

Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen alone in OA were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pain, physical function and global assessment outcomes were reported. Results for continuous outcome measures were expressed as standardized mean differences. Dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using relative risk and the number needed to treat was calculated.

Main Results

Six RCTs and 1689 participants were included in the review. One study compared acetaminophen to placebo, and five compared acetaminophen to NSAIDs. In the placebo-controlled RCT, acetaminophen was shown to be clearly superior to placebo with a similar safety profile. The number needed to treat to achieve an improvement in pain was three. In the comparator-controlled RCTs, acetaminophen was less effective overall than NSAIDs in terms of pain reduction and global assessments but both drugs had similar efficacy in terms of improvements in functional status. No significant difference was found between the safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs, although patients taking NSAIDS were more likely to withdraw due to GI events.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The evidence to date suggests that NSAIDs are superior to acetaminophen for improving knee and hip pain in people with OA but have not been shown to be superior in improving function. The size of the treatment effect was modest, and the mean trial duration was only six weeks, therefore, additional considerations need to be factored in when making the decision between using acetaminophen or NSAIDs. In OA subjects with moderate-to-severe levels of pain, NSAIDs appear to be more effective than acetaminophen.

### Osteoarthritis treatment guidelines from six professional societies: similarities and differences [^111oSURj]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the high prevalence and burden of osteoarthritis (OA) worldwide, management of OA continues to primarily focus on symptom management due to the lack of approved pharmacologic agents that halt disease progression. Recent recommendations from 6 professional societies support the importance of education, self-management approaches, weight loss, and physical modalities in managing OA. These recent guidelines also highlight the paucity of effective and safe treatment options, with recommendations against ineffective therapies outnumbering those for effective ones. NSAIDs, oral and topical, remain the primary recommended pharmacologic management option for OA.

Non-selective NSAIDs and Cox-2 selective inhibitors: their role in the management of arthritis

Both non-selective NSAIDs and the newer Cox-2 selective inhibitors are widely prescribed because of their proven ability to reduce inflammation and control pain, and thus optimize function. They are significantly more effective than acetaminophen in terms of managing pain and thus improving quality of life.

The EULAR guidelines of 2003 for OA in the knee recommend that NSAIDs are used if up to 4 × 1000 mg/day paracetamol (acetaminophen) is ineffective, moving to opioid analgesics (e.g. codeine and tramadol) with or without acetaminophen if NSAIDs prove ineffective. Guidelines for RA similarly recommend the use of non-selective NSAIDs/Cox-2 selective inhibitors, as do the 2008 guidelines for OA from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK.

Guidelines, of course, remind us that these treatments should be used with caution in individuals who may be at increased cardiovascular, renal and GI risk. This article reviews the evidence that rheumatologists may use in assessing GI risk in the context of the other risks in individuals with arthritis who are taking non-selective NSAID or Cox-2 selective treatments in order to maximize benefit for the patient.

Despite these risks, NSAIDs play a key role in the management of arthritis conditions. That they are more effective than placebo has been shown by several clinical trials. In one randomized control trial, which compared both celecoxib and diclofenac with placebo in 600 patients over a period of 6 weeks, it was shown that both the non-selective NSAID and the Cox-2 selective inhibitor were better than placebo in managing pain (Fig. 1).

### Clinical trial data in support of changing guidelines in osteoarthritis treatment [^115g1y5q]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Although highly effective for relieving pain, oral nonselective NSAIDs are associated with serious AEs;–however, this risk may be reduced with the use of topical NSAID formulations. It is important that pain specialists are aware of changes in recommendations for use of oral and topical NSAIDs, based on recent OA guidelines. Topical NSAIDs provide a well-tolerated alternative approach to achieving pain relief with minimal risk of serious AEs. In patients with OA, topical NSAIDs have been shown to have superior efficacy compared with placebo and equivalent efficacy compared with oral NSAIDs, with no increase in the risk of serious AEs. These data suggest that the reduced incidence of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal AEs observed with the use of topical NSAIDs may make them useful in patients who are at high risk.

Optimal management of the pain associated with OA requires awareness and selection of the pharmacologic treatments and non-pharmacologic interventions that best meet a given patient's needs. For patients with OA of the knee or hand, the elderly, or those with certain comorbidities, topical NSAIDs may be the most effective tool for pain management, particularly because of the lower risk of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular AEs. The recommendations included in the newly updated American College of Rheumatology treatment guidelines regarding the use of topical NSAIDs in the treatment of OA of the knee or hand and in the elderly will be helpful in guiding pain specialists around the world on best practices in OA treatment in this population.

### The role of acetaminophen in the management of patients with osteoarthritis [^111EM5ZE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Both the incidence and prevalence of osteoarthritis increase with advancing age. Management of osteoarthritis in older adults focuses on reducing pain and other symptoms, minimizing functional limitation and disability from the disease, and avoiding the side effects associated with pharmacologic therapy. This article first briefly reviews the clinical pharmacology of acetaminophen and then summarizes the evidence supporting the use of acetaminophen in the management of patients with osteoarthritis. We conclude that acetaminophen, when given at full doses of 4,000 mg/day, is more efficacious than placebo and has comparable efficacy to ibuprofen in the management of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee who have mild to moderate pain. Thus, acetaminophen merits a trial as initial therapy based on its cost-effectiveness and safety profile relative to NSAIDs.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^112rYuoU]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In a recently published article in BMC Medicine, Scarpignato and colleagues present the results of a consensus conference that addressed several aspects of the management of pain in patients with osteoarthritis. The main areas covered include the relative safety in regard to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse events of non-selective 'traditional' non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) versus cyclooxygenase-2 selective NSAIDs. The role of co-therapy with proton pump inhibitors in enhancing gastrointestinal safety is also reviewed. This commentary focuses on two areas that the consensus conference addressed, i) the whole length of gastrointestinal tract risk profile of the various NSAIDs (not just the ulcer risks in stomach and duodenum); ii) more recent information, but still some uncertainties, about the cardiovascular risks associated with the two classes of NSAID in general, and naproxen in particular.

### Patient benefit-risk in arthritis – a rheumatologist's perspective [^112e2Pi2]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients suffering from RA or OA require a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment modalities to manage their condition.

As physicians, our aim is to control pain, optimize function and modify the disease process as much as we are able to. In RA, we aim to stop disease progression as well as reducing pain and maintaining functionality. In OA, although there is, as yet, no treatment to halt the processes of degeneration and inflammation, we can aim to reduce joint pain and inflammation while improving and maintaining joint function. We have a range of options at our disposal to help us achieve these goals: ranging from exercise and weight loss to oral analgesics, IA therapies, DMARDs, including the biologicals and surgery.

When we meet an individual who is experiencing pain and loss of function due to arthritis, gastrointestinal (GI) care may not always be at the forefront of our minds. Yet, it is an important element to take into consideration in those patients to whom we prescribe treatment with NSAIDs including both non-selective NSAIDs and Cox-2 selective inhibitors.

As rheumatologists, we are constantly making decisions about which of these options represents the best treatment for an individual with arthritis. We have many factors to consider. To choose the most beneficial management option, we need to take into account comorbid disorders in the patient and constitutional factors such as obesity. The choice of treatment is affected by suitability, availability, practicality, safety and costs.

In this article, the benefit–risk associated with non-selective NSAIDs and Cox-2 selective inhibitors is reviewed and the balance between GI and other risks associated with these treatments is examined.

### Comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic interventions for knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112n9T65]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The relative efficacy of available treatments of knee osteoarthritis (OA) must be determined for rational treatment algorithms to be formulated.

Purpose

To examine the efficacy of treatments of primary knee OA using a network meta-analysis design, which estimates relative effects of all treatments against each other.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception through 15 August 2014, and unpublished data.

Study Selection

Randomized trials of adults with knee OA comparing 2 or more of the following: acetaminophen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib, intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids, IA hyaluronic acid, oral placebo, and IA placebo.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently abstracted study data and assessed study quality. Standardized mean differences were calculated for pain, function, and stiffness at 3-month follow-up.

Data Synthesis

Network meta-analysis was performed using a Bayesian random-effects model; 137 studies comprising 33,243 participants were identified. For pain, all interventions significantly outperformed oral placebo, with effect sizes from 0.63 (95% credible interval [CrI], 0.39 to 0.88) for the most efficacious treatment (hyaluronic acid) to 0.18 (CrI, 0.04 to 0.33) for the least efficacious treatment (acetaminophen). For function, all interventions except IA corticosteroids were significantly superior to oral placebo. For stiffness, most of the treatments did not significantly differ from one another.

Limitation

Lack of long-term data, inadequate reporting of safety data, possible publication bias, and few head-to-head comparisons.

Conclusion

This method allowed comparison of common treatments of knee OA according to their relative efficacy. Intra-articular treatments were superior to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, possibly because of the integrated IA placebo effect. Small but robust differences were observed between active treatments. All treatments except acetaminophen showed clinically significant improvement from baseline pain. This information, along with the safety profiles and relative costs of included treatments, will be helpful for individualized patient care decisions.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^113Aqgkz]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including COX-2 selective drugs, are often used for acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain, including osteoarthritis, trauma, overuse syndromes, and compression fractures. Although these medications are often well tolerated in the young and otherwise healthy patient, the chronic use of these medications can lead to multiple medical problems, most commonly related to the gastrointestinal tract. Recently, concerns about cardiovascular adverse effects have been raised, particularly in the COX-2 drugs. Dosing and duration of therapy should be adjusted for comorbidities. CBC and renal and hepatic function should be checked at intervals of 3 to 6 months, depending on the patient.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^116UjKWP]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

As life expectancy in many countries increases into the 80s and beyond, degenerative joint disease is creating an increasing burden for patients and healthcare systems. For osteoarthritis especially, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAID) remain the most effective option for pain relief, short of surgical alternatives such as joint replacement. However, gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers and their complications are well-known NSAID side effects that are more prevalent in the elderly and are, at times, life-threatening.

The recognition that NSAIDS damage the stomach and duodenum (at least partly) by blocking the mucosal production of protective prostaglandins catalyzed by cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 led to the development of COX-1-sparing NSAIDs. These selectively inhibit COX-2, which mediates synthesis of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. The strategy has been successful: highly selective COX-2 inhibitors do reduce (but do not eliminate) the risk of GI ulceration. However, an unanticipated risk that surfaced in several randomized studies was an increase in adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in patients taking COX-2 inhibitors for months or years. The European Medicines Agency responded promptly, stating, in 2005, that ' COX-2 inhibitors must not be used in patients with established ischaemic heart disease and/or cerebrovascular disease… '. On the other hand, the US Food and Drug Agency (FDA), in the same year, declined to make such a limiting statement – noting that it was unclear whether COX-2 inhibitors carried a greater vascular risk than the older non-selective NSAIDs (nsNSAIDs), that further research was required, and that in the meantime warnings about the possibility of increased CV risk with all NSAIDs should be included in drug labeling.

### Relative efficacy and safety of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^115yBWuL]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This systematic review identified 43 studies, comparing 36 RCTs (7900 patients with OA at any joint) and 7 observational studies (218 074 participants). Topical NSAIDs reduced pain and improved function in patients with OA. Diclofenac patches were the most effective topical NSAID for pain relief. No serious AEs were observed in randomised trials or observational studies in the general population. However, confirmation of the CV safety of topical NSAIDs still warrants further observational study.

What is already known on this topic?

Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended for the treatment of osteoarthritis by many guidelines.
There are a number of topical NSAIDs. However, their relative efficacy remains largely unknown because there are few head-to-head comparative trials.
The safety of topical NSAIDs remains unclear, especially its systemic side effects such as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events.

What are the new findings?

Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective to reduce pain and improve function in osteoarthritis.
Among all available topical NSAIDs, diclofenac patches were most effective for pain relief and piroxicam was the best option to improve function.
Other than salicylate gel, topical NSAIDs are safe. They are not associated with increased local or systemic adverse effects such as gastrointestinal and renal events; this can be concluded from both randomised trials and observational studies.

### Effectiveness and safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid treatment for knee and hip osteoarthritis: network meta-analysis [^113NGBBg]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis is a clinical syndrome that most commonly affects knee and hip joints in older people. Osteoarthritis is a painful condition and results in reduced physical function and quality of life, and increased risk of all cause mortality. Topical or oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) followed by paracetamol (acetaminophen) or opioids comprise first line pharmacotherapy. In the United States, 65% of patients with osteoarthritis are prescribed NSAIDs and 71% opioids for pain management, and opioid prescriptions for musculoskeletal pain increased by 70% between 2001 and 2010. In the UK, 84% of all patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis between 2000 and 2015 were prescribed opioids, with increasing numbers of prescriptions and prescribed doses in more recent years.

Clinicians are faced with a myriad of options when prescribing pharmacotherapy, posing a challenge to clinical decision making. Evidence suggests that improvements in pain and physical function could be similar for opioids and NSAIDs, but opioids cause considerably more adverse events. Seven of the 10 recommendations made in a recent guideline for opioid treatment in chronic non-cancer pain are focused on harm reductionbecause of a substantial risk associated with opioid use. In addition to the immediate reactions after opioid use, such as nausea, vomiting, and drowsiness, chronic use is associated with increased risk of fractures, cardiovascular events, opioid dependence, and mortality. Globally, opioid use disorder increased 23% between 2005 and 2015. Over half of all global overdose deaths in 2019 occurred in the US, with liberal prescribing of high dose opioids one of the main contributors. Between 2000 and 2017, opioid related mortality increased by 593% in Canada. Despite this evidence, and international concerns about the devastating potential for chemical dependency, opioids remain among the most prescribed drugs for osteoarthritis pain in the UK, the US, Canada, and Australia, even though safer treatments with stronger analgesic effects are available.

Previous systematic reviews have reported the effectiveness of NSAIDs and opioids to treat osteoarthritis pain. However, these reviews clustered drug doses or drug classes in their analyses. This clustering does not provide enough granular evidence to allow the implementation of current recommendations that physicians should prescribe the lowest while still effective dose of these interventions. To present granular evidence and enable a safer prescription of these interventions, we assessed the effectiveness and safety of different preparations and doses of NSAIDs, opioids, and paracetamol for knee and hip osteoarthritis pain and physical function. We integrated all available high quality evidence from randomised trials in a network meta-analysis.

### Clinical trial data in support of changing guidelines in osteoarthritis treatment [^115AiWkh]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common form of arthritis, conservatively affects 27 million adults in the USA based on 2005 population data. As many as one in two adults may develop symptomatic OA of the knee by age 85; however, among obese adults, the lifetime risk of developing OA increases to two in three.OA of the knee is one of the top five causes of disability, with 80% of patients with the condition experiencing some degree of movement limitation affecting activities of daily living. Treatment options for OA include both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic modalities. Non-pharmacologic modalities, such as exercise and weight-management programs, have been shown to be effective for overweight and obese patients experiencing OA in weight-bearing joints and should be utilized in conjunction with other therapies if possible.–Pharmacologic options, including orally administered acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are the most commonly utilized pharmacological options for OA. However, the risk of adverse events (AEs) with the administration of higher doses or prolonged treatment with these drugs can limit their use in some patients, particularly the elderly and those with existing hepatic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal conditions.

There are multiple approaches that can help in mitigating these risks while providing safe and effective treatment. One option is to combine analgesics with different mechanisms of action to allow for the utilization of lower doses of each active ingredient. For example, combining an NSAID (eg, etodolac or ibuprofen) with acetaminophen has been shown to effectively alleviate OA symptoms.–Yet, for some of the risks associated with systemically administered agents, such as risk of cardiovascular events, it is not clear if they are dose dependent in nature. Consequently, patients may be at risk of AEs even at low doses.

Another option to mitigate the risk of orally administered therapy is to provide the medication locally, thus bypassing the systemic system and limiting hepatic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal AEs. Topical NSAIDs have only recently become available in the USA, but they have historically been more commonly utilized in other parts of the world. These agents are applied directly to the affected area, which limits their systemic exposure compared with oral NSAIDs. This review will examine the efficacy and safety of topical NSAIDs and their evolving role in OA management guidelines, as well as their potential for assisting pain specialists in providing individualized care for patients with OA.

### Guidelines for management of osteoarthritis published by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism: why are they so different? [^116A5Ntj]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Because of different methodology the ACR and EULAR guidelines differ significantly in their recommendations despite an identical evidence base. Guidelines that use a strictly evidence-based approach are less likely to incur bias than those that rely more on expert consensus. Although expert consensus is useful in areas in which there are little trial data, clear delineation should be made between evidence-based statements and expert opinion. Following the dissemination of guidelines for the management of OA, emphasis should now be placed on discussion and implementation of the recommendations and subsequent revision of guidelines as new evidence comes to light.

### Paracetamol versus nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for rheumatoid arthritis [^113xKUVE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually preferred for simple analgesics such as paracetamol for rheumatoid arthritis. It is not clear, however, whether the trade-offs between benefits and harms of NSAIDs are preferable to those of paracetamol (paracetamol is also called acetaminophen).

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of paracetamol with NSAIDs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Search Strategy

Medline Silverplatter, Embase databases were searched up until Sept 2002. Reference lists of identified articles were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised double-blind studies comparing paracetamol with an NSAID.

Data Collection and Analysis

Decisions on inclusion of trials and data extraction were performed by the two authors independently.

Main Results

Four cross-over studies, published between 1968 and 1982, involving 121 patients, and four different NSAIDs were included. The generation of the allocation sequence and the use of methods to conceal the allocation were not described in any of the studies. The studies were double-blind but it was not clear whether the blinding was effective. Methods for collecting adverse effects were not described. The NSAIDs were preferred more often than paracetamol by the patients or the investigator. In the largest trial, 20 out of 54 patients (37%) preferred ibuprofen and 7 out of 54 (13%) paracetamol. Investigators preference (as established by joint tenderness, grip strength and joint circumference) was 17 out of 35 for diclofenac versus 5 out of 35 for paracetamol in another trial. However, because of the weaknessess in the trials, no firm conclusion can be drawn.

Reviewer's Conclusions

When considering the trade off between the benefits and harms of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and paracetamol/acetaminophen, it is not known whether one is better than the other for rheumatoid arthritis. But people with rheumatoid arthritis and the researchers in the study did prefer non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs more than acetaminophen/paracetamol. There is a need for a large trial, with appropriate randomisation, double-blinding, test of the success of the blinding, and with explicit methods to measure and analyse pain and adverse effects.

### Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or acetaminophen for osteoarthritis of the hip or knee? A systematic review of evidence and guidelines [^113FDzTe]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The interpretation of available evidence on the relative efficacy of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) and acetaminophen in osteoarthritis (OA) has recently been debated. This systematic review summarizes the available evidence on the efficacy of NSAID compared to acetaminophen, and compares the quality and content of clinical guidelines regarding the pharmacological treatment of OA.

Methods

Published reports of randomized controlled trials (RCT) and clinical guidelines were identified by a systematic search of bibliographic databases and relevant websites. The quality of RCT was assessed by 2 reviewers independently using a standardized checklist. Data from these RCT were used to calculate pooled differences between groups for pain and disability. The methodology of identified guidelines was appraised using the AGREE (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation) instrument.

Results

The search strategy resulted in the identification of 5 RCT. Statistical pooling of data from 3 trials with adequate methods and sufficient data presentation resulted in a pooled standardized mean difference for general pain of 0.33 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.51), indicating a small effect in favor of NSAID. Pooled estimates for other outcome measures were smaller. Three of the 9 identified guidelines satisfied more AGREE criteria than others, particularly regarding rigor of development. Stakeholder involvement, applicability, and editorial independence were poorly described in most guidelines. The content of recommendations regarding the use of NSAID or acetaminophen was fairly consistent.

Conclusion

Acetaminophen is often effective in OA and is associated with fewer adverse reactions than NSAID. Available evidence supports the recommendations of recent guidelines to use acetaminophen as initial therapy for OA in addition to nonpharmacological interventions. Further research is needed to establish the efficacy of NSAID or acetaminophen in relevant subgroups of patients. We agree with guidelines that it is important that treatment is tailored to individual patients taking into account the severity of symptoms, previous use of acetaminophen, and the patient's knowledge, expectations, and preferences.

### Comparative efficacy of exercise therapy and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and paracetamol for knee or hip osteoarthritis: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114PRhF6]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Exercise is effective for pain and function due to knee and hip OA. Its effect is similar to that of oral NSAIDs and paracetamol at short (4 weeks), median (8 weeks) and long-term (24 weeks) follow-up. However, this conclusion is based mainly on indirect comparisons. Further direct evidence for OA outcomes and the long-term benefits of exercise over oral NSAIDs and paracetamol for other outcomes such as comorbidities are still needed.

### Celecoxib vs. diclofenac in rheumatoid arthritis… [^111royqn]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and act by inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzymes. Limitations of NSAIDs include the risk of gastrointestinal mucosal injury. Cyclooxygenase enzymes are essential in producing GI-protective prostaglandins and are believed to occur in at least two forms. Pain and inflammation are predominately mediated by cyclooxygenase-2 enzymes. Conversely, cyclooxygenase-1 enzymes produce prostaglandins involved in cytoprotective function. Although all NSAIDs inhibit both forms of cyclooxygenase enzymes, agents such as celecoxib are highly selective for cyclooxygenase-2 enzymes and could provide anti-inflammatory and analgesic benefits without adverse GI effects.

Emery and colleagues compared the efficacy of gastrointestinal safety and the tolerability of long-term therapy using celecoxib with diclofenac therapy in the management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. At baseline, the 326 patients treated with celecoxib were similar to the 329 patients who received diclofenac in demographics, duration of rheumatoid arthritis, history of GI disease and NSAID intolerance. At baseline, patients assigned to the diclofenac group had a significantly higher mean pain score and a longer duration of morning stiffness, and were more likely to be taking corticosteroids than were patients assigned to the celecoxib group. During treatment, both groups improved in primary and secondary measures of pain and inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis. No significant differences in efficacy were found between the two treatment groups.

Lack of therapeutic efficacy resulted in a withdrawal rate of 8 percent of patients treated with celecoxib and 7 percent of patients treated with diclofenac. Mean hemoglobin levels decreased during diclofenac therapy but remained unchanged during treatment with celecoxib. Liver function enzyme levels also significantly increased during diclofenac treatment; however, these levels remained the same or decreased slightly during celecoxib treatment. The authors conclude that celecoxib exhibits anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity comparable to that of diclofenac, but results in significantly better GI tolerability and safety.

### Rheumatologic immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events [^1134gxyT]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Immune check point inhibitors (ICIs) are a unique class of cancer treatments that harness the body's innate antitumor response. Although these medications have transformed oncology care, they also lead to generalized immune activation that can result in toxicities across a spectrum of organ systems called immune-related adverse events. This article reviews the most common rheumatologic immune-related adverse events and their management.

Recent Findings

Inflammatory arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic, sicca symptoms, systemic sclerosis, myositis, and vasculitis have all been reported as ICI adverse events. Treatment includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, traditional DMARDs, and biologics.

Summary

Rheumatologists have an important role in the management of patients with rheumatologic immune-related adverse events. Working with our oncology colleagues, we can help manage rheumatologic immune-related adverse events while optimally preserving ICI's antitumor effects.

### Multinational evidence-based recommendations for pain management by pharmacotherapy in inflammatory arthritis: integrating systematic literature research and expert opinion of a broad panel of rheumatologists in the 3e initiative [^111nAcGX]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Recommendation 9

In the management of patients with IA, MTX can be used safely in combination with standard doses of paracetamol and/or NSAIDs (excluding anti-inflammatory doses of aspirin).

A systematic review of RCTs and non-randomized studies regarding the safety of using NSAIDs and/or paracetamol with MTX in IA identified 17 studies, all in patients with RA. Most of the included studies were of a low to moderate quality. No studies were identified for the combination of MTX and paracetamol, but the experts considered this combination to be generally safe. There was no effect of concurrent NSAID use on the incidence of MTX-related AEs or the rate of MTX withdrawal.

The use of MTX in addition to anti-inflammatory doses of aspirin has been reported to have an adverse effect on liver and renal function. The evidence regarding low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherothrombotic disease is less clear, although pharmacokinetic data suggest that aspirin at daily doses of ≥ 650 mg has different pharmacokinetic properties and is more likely to increase risk in combination with MTX.

Recommendation 10

In patients with gastrointestinal comorbidities, paracetamol should be considered first; non-selective NSAIDs in combination with PPI, or COX-2 selective inhibitors ± PPI, may be used with caution. In the presence of liver disease, standard precautions for use of NSAIDs and other analgesics should be applied.

Data regarding the safety and efficacy of analgesic drugs in patients with IA and existing or prior gastrointestinal (GI) or hepatic morbidity could be identified for NSAIDs only. In RA patients treated with NSAIDs there is an increased risk of GI events in individuals with prior uncomplicated GI events or a history of upper GI symptoms. A meta-analysis of five RCTs involving patients with RA or OA who were receiving NSAIDs also found an increased risk of upper GI events in those with a history of gastro-duodenal ulceration.

### WITHDRAWN: non-aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treating osteoarthritis of the knee [^113ufzHn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis(OA) is the most common rheumatic disease. Simple analgesics are now accepted as the appropriate first line pharmacological treatment of uncomplicated OA. Non-aspirin NSAIDs are licensed for the relief of pain and inflammation arising from rheumatic disease.

Objectives

To determine whether there is a difference in the relative efficacy of individual non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) when used in the management of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.

Search Strategy

We searched Medline (1966–1995) and Bids Embase (Jan-Dec, 1980–1995). The searches were limited to publications in the English language, and were last performed in November 1996. We used modified Cochrane Collaboration search strategy to identify all randomised controlled trials. The MeSH heading "osteoarthritis" was combined with the generic names of the 17 non-aspirin NSAIDs licensed in the UK for the management of OA in general practice. The search of Embase used the term "osteoarthritis" if present in the abstract, title or keywords, and was combined with the generic names of the 17 non-aspirin NSAIDs, only if they were mentioned in the title, abstract or keywords.

Selection Criteria

All double blind, randomised controlled trials, in the English language, comparing the efficacy of two non-aspirin NSAIDs in the management of osteoarthritis of the knee, were selected. Only trials with subjects aged 16 years and over, with clinical and/or radiological confirmation of the diagnosis of OA knee were included. Studies which compared one "trial" NSAID with one "reference" NSAID were included provided they were non-aspirin NSAIDs available in the UK and were licensed for the treatment of OA by general practitioners. Trials which were placebo-controlled and which also involved the comparison of two NSAIDs were also included.

Data Collection and Analysis

The methodological design of each study was scored according to a pre-determined system. The three main outcome measures of pain, physical function and patient global assessment were chosen based on the core set agreed upon by OMERACT (Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials). These were used to determine the power of each trial. The equivalency of NSAID doses was calculated using the percentage of the recommended maximum daily dose. Sample size estimates for the detection of clinically relevant changes in outcome measures used in the assessment of OA knee were used for power calculations. These calculations were performed to determine whether the trials were of a sufficient size to detect clinically relevant differences which were statistically significant. The calculations incorporate estimates of standard deviation, and minimum, median and maximum differences (delta) between drugs which are deemed to be clinically important. The number of "withdrawals due to lack of efficacy" was also selected as an outcome measure for this review. The Peto odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals were calculated where possible. The results of studies which compared the same trial and reference NSAIDs were combined where possible.

Main Results

Of the 1151 trials identified by the search strategy, 22 involved knee osteoarthritis only. Sixteen of these trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were entered in the review. Eight NSAIDs were represented in these trials. Etodolac was represented in 11 trials. The reference NSAID in these trials was piroxicam (n = 3), naproxen(n = 3), diclofenac (n = 3), indomethacin (n = 1), and, nabumetone (n = 1). The reported methodological design of the trials was poor, with a median score of 3 (out of a maximum of 8). The results of the trials comparing the same trial and reference NSAIDs were pooled for the outcome "withdrawal due to lack of efficacy". For the comparison, etodolac versus piroxicam, the odds ratio favoured etodolac i.e. patients receiving etodolac were less likely to withdraw due to lack of efficacy. The dose of etodolac used in each of these three studies, however, was greater than the corresponding dose of piroxicam (based on percentage maximum daily dose). The significance of these results is therefore questionable. For the comparisons etodolac versus diclofenac, and etodolac versus naproxen, there were no clear differences between treatments. In one study [Bellamy 1993], a statistically significant difference was detected between treatments with regard to withdrawals due to lack of efficacy. In this trial, which compared equivalent NSAID doses, diclofenac was the favoured NSAID compared to tenoxicam(p = 0.04). Two studies showed a statistical difference in patient global assessment of condition, which favoured the trial NSAID. In both cases the trial NSAID was etodolac, used in doses approximately 25–44% greater than the reference NSAID. Two studies showed a statistically significant difference in pain relief between NSAIDs. The trial NSAID in both cases was again etodolac but the doses exceeded those of the reference NSAIDs.

Authors' Conclusions

In spite of the large number of publications in this area, there are few randomized controlled trials. Furthermore, most trials comparing two or more NSAIDs suffer from substantial design errors. From the results of this review it is concluded that no substantial evidence is available related to efficacy, to distinguish between equivalent recommended doses of NSAIDs. Had studies employed appropriate doses of comparator drug, most would have been sufficiently powerful to detect clinically important differences in efficacy. As differences in efficacy between NSAIDs have not been recorded, the selection of an NSAID for prescription for OA knee should be based upon relative safety, patient acceptability and cost.

### Effectiveness of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of pain in knee and hip osteoarthritis: a network meta-analysis [^112zJNkq]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the backbone of osteoarthritis pain management. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of different preparations and doses of NSAIDs on osteoarthritis pain in a network meta-analysis.

Methods

For this network meta-analysis, we considered randomised trials comparing any of the following interventions: NSAIDs, paracetamol, or placebo, for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the reference lists of relevant articles for trials published between Jan 1, 1980, and Feb 24, 2015, with at least 100 patients per group. The prespecified primary and secondary outcomes were pain and physical function, and were extracted in duplicate for up to seven timepoints after the start of treatment. We used an extension of multivariable Bayesian random effects models for mixed multiple treatment comparisons with a random effect at the level of trials. For the primary analysis, a random walk of first order was used to account for multiple follow-up outcome data within a trial. Preparations that used different total daily dose were considered separately in the analysis. To assess a potential dose-response relation, we used preparation-specific covariates assuming linearity on log relative dose.

Findings

We identified 8973 manuscripts from our search, of which 76 randomised trials with a total of 58451 patients were included in this analysis. 23 nodes concerning seven different NSAIDs or paracetamol with specific daily dose of administration or placebo were considered. All preparations, irrespective of dose, improved point estimates of pain symptoms when compared with placebo. For six interventions (diclofenac 150 mg/day, etoricoxib 30 mg/day, 60 mg/day, and 90 mg/day, and rofecoxib 25 mg/day and 50 mg/day), the probability that the difference to placebo is at or below a prespecified minimum clinically important effect for pain reduction (effect size [ES] -0.37) was at least 95%. Among maximally approved daily doses, diclofenac 150 mg/day (ES -0.57, 95% credibility interval [CrI] -0.69 to -0.45) and etoricoxib 60 mg/day (ES -0.58, -0.74 to -0.43) had the highest probability to be the best intervention, both with 100% probability to reach the minimum clinically important difference. Treatment effects increased as drug dose increased, but corresponding tests for a linear dose effect were significant only for naproxen (p = 0.034). We found no evidence that treatment effects varied over the duration of treatment. Model fit was good, and between-trial heterogeneity and inconsistency were low in all analyses. All trials were deemed to have a low risk of bias for blinding of patients. Effect estimates did not change in sensitivity analyses with two additional statistical models and accounting for methodological quality criteria in meta-regression analysis.

Interpretation

On the basis of the available data, we see no role for single-agent paracetamol for the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis irrespective of dose. We provide sound evidence that diclofenac 150 mg/day is the most effective NSAID available at present, in terms of improving both pain and function. Nevertheless, in view of the safety profile of these drugs, physicians need to consider our results together with all known safety information when selecting the preparation and dose for individual patients.

### WITHDRAWN: analgesia and non-aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis of the hip [^111SikCq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely used as a pharmacologic treatment to relieve pain for patients with OA of the hip. However, these agents are associated with significant toxicity, particularly in the elderly population (age > 65 years).

Objectives

To review all randomized trials of analgesics and anti-inflammatory therapy in osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip. To determine which non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) is the most effective, and which NSAID is the most toxic.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group's trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and MEDLINE up to August 1994. Reference lists of all trials were also manually searched.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials comparing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or analgesics in patients with Osteoarthritis. The trials selected for inclusion were identified by one reviewer (TT) and rechecked by a second (MH).

Data Collection and Analysis

Qualitative assessments were performed using a quality scoring system designed for NSAID trials in rheumatoid arthritis. Both the design and analysis aspects of the trials were evaluated, each aspect being rated on a scale of 0 to 8. A quantitative method, which calculates the ratio of improvement produced by one NSAID to that produced by another, was used to rate the relative efficacy of different NSAIDs with respect to pain relief. Toxicity comparisons were made according to the reviewer findings. All quality assessments were carried out independently by two reviewers (TT, BS). All data abstraction was carried out by one reviewer (TT) and rechecked by two other reviewers (BS, GW). A consensus was reached on discrepancies.

Main Results

Forty-three trials were identified, and of these, 39 evaluated NSAIDs, while four evaluated only analgesics. The median design and analysis scores were two and four respectively. Six NSAIDs were included in at least five trials. Of these, indomethacin was rated more effective in five of its seven comparisons, but more toxic in seven of 12 comparisons. Only five of the 29 (17%) NSAID comparisons found statistically significant differences in efficacy. Of the 43 RCTs identified only 17 had statistical data available for future pooling for this meta-analysis. In the case where data was missing, authors of the trials will be contacted for inclusion of data in future reviews.

Authors' Conclusions

NSAID trials in patients with OA of the hip appear to be weakened by the lack of standardization of case definition of OA, and also by the lack of standardization of outcome assessments. No clear recommendations for the choice of specific NSAID therapy in hip OA can be offered at this time based on this analysis.

### Effectiveness and safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid treatment for knee and hip osteoarthritis: network meta-analysis [^116DqX4k]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to prepare this article (see web-appendix 1 for protocol; PROSPERO registration CRD42020213656).

Eligibility criteria

We considered large randomised trials of patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis that compared any of the following interventions for pharmacological treatment of osteoarthritis pain: NSAIDs, opioids, paracetamol (acetaminophen), or placebo. Trials that included patients with other types of arthritis or joints other than knee or hip were only included if ≥ 75% of the patients had confirmed knee or hip osteoarthritis. Additionally, trials were required to have at least one follow-up measurement of pain or another algofunctional outcome. To reduce small study bias, we only included trials with an average of ≥ 100 participants randomised per arm. No publication status or year restriction was applied, but we limited the publication language to English.

Identification of trials

To identify eligible trials, we conducted searches on the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), from inception to 30 June 2021, and Medline and Embase from inception to 28 June 2021 (web-appendix 2). We also manually searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and systematic reviews (web-appendix 3), and searched ClinicalTrials.gov. When data were incomplete, we searched for additional data on ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO approved trial registries, company specific trial registries, and documents available on the website of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Selection of studies and data extraction

Each trial was independently evaluated by two reviewers (BRdC, CAH, HDK, LG, MOA, MR, NSB, PB, PSC, PS, RH, SMI, TM, and TVP) for screening and data extraction. When disagreements occurred, a consensus was reached through discussion among reviewers or by consultation with a senior scholar. We screened trials for eligibility, extracted data, and developed consensus by using a standardised and piloted web based data management tool, accompanied by a codebook. We extracted trial characteristics, such as design, size and duration; intervention characteristics, such as dose and treatment duration; participant characteristics, such as mean age, sex, mean duration of symptoms, index joint; type of outcome (pain or function); and outcome data for each time point of interest. If necessary, we approximated summary statistics and measures of variability from graphs. When possible, results based on the intention-to-treat principle were extracted.

### Comparative efficacy of exercise therapy and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and paracetamol for knee or hip osteoarthritis: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116bs5Ao]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of joint disease and the leading cause of pain in older people. Pain symptoms associated with knee or hip OA result in increased physical and walking disability and an increased risk of all-cause mortality. The main management goal in OA is to relieve pain without increasing treatment-related adverse effects.

Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol (or acetaminophen) are the most frequently prescribed analgesics to control pain and improve physical function of OA, with 10% to 35% of the OA population reporting the use of oral NSAIDs or paracetamol. However, oral NSAIDs and paracetamol are associated with gastrointestinal or cardiovascular complications and even increased risk of death, especially in older people with comorbidities. Current National Institution for Health and Care Excellence and international guidelines strongly recommend exercise as a core therapy for management of knee or hip OA. However, implementation of exercise in clinical practice remains limited and suboptimal, in part due to the time commitment required by health practitioners, absence of agreed standard protocols, lack of confidence in capability to exercise and concerns about joint overloading among people with OA. Also, it is still unclear whether exercise has an analgesic effect equivalent to that from analgesics such as oral NSAIDs and paracetamol. The current evidence on the direct comparison between these treatments is sparse. The majority of exercise trials used usual care as a control whereas the majority of drug trials used placebo as a control; therefore, the effect size from exercise trials is not comparable to that from oral NSAIDs and paracetamol trials. This may further preclude the uptake of exercise as a core therapy in clinical practice. The comparative efficacy of exercise and oral NSAIDs and paracetamol will help to confirm the analgesic benefit of exercise. Such information may enhance public awareness of exercise as an effective treatment for OA rather than just a physical activity for general health. It will inform patient–practitioner discussion and shared decision-making and encourage patients to be more proactive about including exercise in their individualised OA management plan.

### Advances in rheumatology: coxibs and beyond [^1136kqYA]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2003). Low credibility.

Arthritis is a growing health concern in the US with approximately 70 million Americans currently affected. This figure will inevitably rise as the population ages. The pain and decreased mobility associated with arthritis have a significant impact on quality of life and because patients with arthritis are less active than the general population, they are at risk of additional conditions such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. There are currently no disease modifying osteoarthritis (OA) drugs available; therefore anti-inflammatory, and/or analgesic medications such as acetaminophen and NSAIDs and simple analgesics form the mainstay of treatment. Coxibs may be preferred to traditional NSAIDs because of their improved gastrointestinal (GI) safety and tolerability profile. The use of topical agents may also be beneficial in some patients. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where disease modifying drugs (DMARDs) are available, anti-inflammatory agents such as NSAIDs and coxibs are used as adjuncts to disease modifying therapy. However, patients with RA are at increased risk of NSAID-related GI injury, particularly if they are also on corticosteroid medication. Pharmacological treatment of both RA and OA should be combined with appropriate nonpharmacological modalities such as patient education, exercise programs, and joint motion and strengthening exercises. Such activities may delay joint degradation and help maintain physical function.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in total joint arthroplasty — FDA approvals and safety — are noted as follows: a COX-2 inhibitory agent available on the US market has FDA approval for the management of acute pain and for relief of symptoms associated with osteoarthritis, inflammatory arthritis, and primary dysmenorrhea. All NSAIDs carry the FDA's warning for an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events (including myocardial infarction and stroke) and serious gastrointestinal events (including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines). According to the FDA, it is the prescribing physician's responsibility to ascertain the FDA clearance status for all medications prior to use in a clinical setting.

### Cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs: additional insights after PRECISION and point of view [^114JVWCc]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Increasing numbers of patients with arthritis use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), some for long periods. The relative cardiovascular safety of NSAID use is of considerable concern, particularly among patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease. Until recently, the evidence base was limited to older trials with small sample sizes. The large-scale Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety vs Ibuprofen or Naproxen (PRECISION) trial and a recent Bayesian meta-analysis of individual patient data in nearly a half-million patients were undertaken to address some of the existing gaps in knowledge relative to the cardiovascular safety of NSAID use. We reviewed the results, strengths, and limitations of PRECISION. We believe that the results of the meta-analysis will further assist clinicians in decision-making for management of patients with osteoarthritis. The totality of evidence would support avoidance of NSAID use, if possible, in patients with or at high risk for cardiovascular disease. If used, the shortest-duration and lowest effective NSAID doses should be chosen, given the evidence that risk is duration- and dose-dependent. We also provide a brief discussion of the mechanism of action of NSAIDs, along with discussion of existing guidelines and the recent meta-analysis.

### Topical agents in the treatment of rheumatic pain [^113ozTYh]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

In rheumatic pain there is good evidence that topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are about as effective as oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but are probably safer and more tolerable because of much less systemic absorption and lower plasma concentrations. The best information is for topical diclofenac. For topical capsaicin, evidence of efficacy is trivial. For topical rubefacients there is no evidence of efficacy.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors, in osteoarthritic knee pain: meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled trials [^116n6BoE]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To estimate the analgesic efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors (coxibs), in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled trials.

Studies Reviewed

23 trials including 10 845 patients, median age of 62.5 years. 7807 patients received adequate doses of NSAIDs and 3038 received placebo. The mean weighted baseline pain score was 64.2 mm on 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), and average duration of symptoms was 8.2 years.

Main Outcome Measure

Change in overall intensity of pain.

Results

Methodological quality of trials was acceptable, but 13 trials excluded patients before randomisation if they did not respond to NSAIDs. One trial provided long term data for pain that showed no significant effect of NSAIDs compared with placebo at one to four years. The pooled difference for pain on visual analogue scale in all included trials was 10.1 mm (95% confidence interval 7.4 to 12.8) or 15.6% better than placebo after 2–13 weeks. The results were heterogeneous, and the effect size for pain reduction was 0.32 (0.24 to 0.39) in a random effects model. In 10 trials that did not exclude non-responders to NSAID treatment the results were homogeneous, with an effect size for pain reduction of 0.23 (0.15 to 0.31).

Conclusion

NSAIDs can reduce short term pain in osteoarthritis of the knee slightly better than placebo, but the current analysis does not support long term use of NSAIDs for this condition. As serious adverse effects are associated with oral NSAIDs, only limited use can be recommended.

### Duration of symptom relief and early trajectory of adverse events for oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Gjhim]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Despite an extensive body of research on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in osteoarthritis, the duration of their efficacy and timeline of adverse event (AE) onset have been understudied. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses from 2 to 26 weeks to characterize the efficacy and AE trajectories of oral NSAIDs in knee osteoarthritis.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Database from inception to May 2018. Randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy and/or safety of Federal Drug Administration-approved NSAIDs in knee osteoarthritis patients were included. Two independent reviewers assessed quality and extracted data. We calculated standardized mean differences (SMDs) and risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).

Results

We included 72 randomized controlled trials (26,424 participants). NSAIDs demonstrated moderate, statistically significant effects on pain that peaked at 2 weeks (SMD -0.43 [95% CI -0.48, -0.38]), but the magnitude of the effects decreased over time. The results for function were similar. The incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) AEs was significantly higher in NSAID users than placebo users as early as 4 weeks (RR 1.38 [95% CI 1.21, 1.57]). The incidence of cardiovascular (CV) AEs in NSAID users was not significantly different from placebo. Most GI and CV AEs were transient and of minor severity.

Conclusion

NSAIDs produced significant pain and function improvements that peaked at 2 weeks but decreased over time. The incidence of minor GI and CV AEs consistently rose, reaching significance as early as 4 weeks. Clinicians should weigh the durability of efficacy with the early onset of minor AEs along with patient tolerability and preferences when formulating an NSAID regimen.
