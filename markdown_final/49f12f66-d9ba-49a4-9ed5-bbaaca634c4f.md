## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risk factors for uterine (endometrial) cancer recurrence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline epidemiology and recurrence patterns to frame magnitude of risk. Then, I should verify the established clinicopathologic predictors such as stage, grade, histology, lymphovascular space invasion, and depth of myometrial invasion. Next, I will review nodal and extrauterine factors like cervical stromal invasion and peritoneal cytology. After that, I need to integrate molecular classification and specific biomarkers that modify recurrence risk. I should also consider treatment- and patient-level modifiers and how adjuvant therapy alters locoregional versus distant failure patterns. Finally, I will cross-check with high-quality guidelines and pivotal trials, and caution where evidence is weaker or emerging.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and recurrence timing. Most endometrial cancers are diagnosed early, but approximately 15–20% of apparently early-stage cases recur, with two-thirds of recurrences distant and one-third locoregional; many events occur within the first three years of follow-up, which is operationally important when thinking about surveillance and adjuvant decisions [^113veA9v] [^113ZyQ3z].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before pinning down the core anatomic and histologic drivers. Higher FIGO stage, high-grade histology, and non-endometrioid subtypes (serous, clear cell, undifferentiated) consistently associate with higher relapse rates; in stage III disease, deep invasion, high-grade histology, and positive peritoneal cytology stratify 5-year relapse from roughly 13% with none to 62% with two or more adverse features, underscoring cumulative risk burden [^113PMXj8] [^116uqhuW] [^113jjeWB].

> Wait, let me verify the impact of lymphovascular space invasion because it is often decisive in stage I. LVSI is one of the strongest independent predictors; in an external validation model restricted to untreated stage I endometrioid cancers, the combination of grade 2–3, LVSI, and stage IB separated 5-year recurrence from approximately 4% to 44%, illustrating how LVSI reclassifies ostensibly low-risk disease into high-intermediate or high-risk strata [^114UBkmT] [^113jjeWB].

> I need to check depth-related metrics carefully. Deep myometrial invasion (≥ 50%) remains an adverse factor across risk schemas, but tumor-free distance from the serosa under 1 cm may better predict recurrence than depth alone in some cohorts; moreover, even when accounting for TCGA molecular groups, deep invasion retains prognostic value for disease-free survival, particularly for both locoregional and distant recurrence components [^112A2Lgd] [^116CGSPr].

> Next, I should review cervix and nodal involvement. Cervical stromal invasion independently elevates recurrence risk in stage I–II models, while pelvic or para-aortic node positivity sharply worsens recurrence outcomes; importantly, while systematic lymphadenectomy does not improve oncologic endpoints in risk-adapted early-stage populations, node positivity per se is a marker of high relapse risk and guides adjuvant intensification [^1137RyBw] [^113jjeWB] [^113UPc6p].

> Let me consider extrauterine cytology and peritoneal spread. Positive peritoneal cytology is prognostically adverse in stage III cohorts and aligns with a higher propensity for peritoneal carcinomatosis at recurrence; unsurprisingly, advanced FIGO stage at diagnosis is a risk factor for peritoneal recurrence, and peritoneal relapse carries poor post-recurrence survival, especially with serous histology [^113PMXj8] [^114WtVMf].

> I should confirm the molecular risk framework because it increasingly refines recurrence estimates beyond histotype and stage. TCGA-defined classes stratify risk: POLE-ultramutated tumors have excellent outcomes with low recurrence, MSI/dMMR and NSMP show intermediate risk, while copy-number high/p53-abnormal tumors carry the highest recurrence risk and are enriched for serous biology; integrating molecular class with clinicopathologic factors improves prognostic resolution and is being operationalized in trials and guidelines [^1157jRXz] [^116uqhuW].

> Hold on, I should verify specific molecular nuances that depart from the broad classes. Early-stage tumors with MLH1 promoter hypermethylation recur more often than MMR-intact counterparts despite otherwise favorable presentation, indicating that not all dMMR is equivalent; emerging data also implicate FGFR2 mutations as enriched among unexpected recurrences in otherwise low-risk stage IA grade 1–2 endometrioid cancers, suggesting a potential molecular driver of relapse within the low-risk stratum [^116EHDQj] [^1111AG7f].

> Let me examine additional biomarkers I might be overlooking. Aberrant p53 expression, high Ki-67, L1CAM overexpression, and low ER/PR expression have each been associated with higher recurrence in multivariable models; gene expression–based scores can dichotomize intermediate-risk tumors into high- and low-recurrence subsets, though clinical implementation requires validation and integration with standardized molecular classification [^1137RyBw] [^113tjD3q] [^114METj5].

> I need to ensure I separate surgical and patient factors that truly drive recurrence from correlates. Larger uterine size or heavy specimen weight may correlate with intra-abdominal recurrence on univariate analysis in high-grade cohorts, but multivariable models often reduce these to proxies for stage; performance status and relapse within prior radiation fields are prognostic after recurrence and during systemic therapy, but they are not primary drivers of initial recurrence risk after upfront surgery, so I should not overweigh them when counseling on baseline recurrence risk [^notfound] [^114A9Rhc].

> Next, I should review how treatment choices shift recurrence patterns without conflating them with inherent risk. In stage I, pelvic external beam radiation reduces locoregional recurrence but does not reduce distant relapse or improve overall survival, whereas PORTEC-3 showed combined chemoradiation improves failure-free survival in high-risk disease with most failures still distant, underscoring that systemic therapy decisions modulate the site and probability of recurrence in high-risk groups [^111xv292] [^111gfZX9].

> Let me double-check risk modeling tools because clinicians often ask for numbers. Several nomograms incorporating FIGO stage, LVSI, nodal status, and biomarkers show good discrimination in internal and some external validations, and one stage I–II model with ER, PR, Ki-67, p53/WFDC2 and cervical stromal invasion achieved a C-index around 0.85; still, many models are retrospective and single-region, so I should emphasize calibration and generalizability limits before applying scores to individuals [^1137RyBw] [^113tjD3q] [^1134Qcnx].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost attributed recurrence risk to DNA aneuploidy alone based on older literature; I should correct that. A dedicated stage I series found aneuploidy associated with worse survival but not independently with recurrence risk after surgery without adjuvant therapy, so using aneuploidy as a stand-alone recurrence predictor would be misleading in early-stage counseling [^113tEro5]. Similarly, I initially considered venous thromboembolism as a recurrence risk factor, but let me reconsider: VTE is a surrogate of aggressive disease biology and worsens survival; it does not independently cause recurrence and should be viewed as a prognostic marker rather than a driver of relapse risk [^113JTp3j].

> I should confirm guideline alignment to ensure these factors are actioned appropriately. Contemporary ESMO and ESGO/ESTRO/ESP recommendations integrate stage, histology, LVSI, cervical stromal invasion, and increasingly molecular class to stratify adjuvant therapy and surveillance, with vaginal brachytherapy reducing vaginal relapse in selected early-stage endometrioid cases and systemic therapy considered for high-risk p53-abnormal or stage III serous-like disease where distant failure predominates [^1169vyvZ] [^112Fospx] [^113XRMD4].

> To synthesize, the strongest, consistently validated risk factors for recurrence are advanced FIGO stage, high-grade or non-endometrioid histology, LVSI, deep myometrial invasion, cervical stromal invasion, nodal involvement, positive peritoneal cytology, and high-risk molecular phenotype (p53-abnormal/copy-number high), with modifiers including ER/PR loss, high Ki-67, L1CAM, and selected genomic alterations such as FGFR2 in otherwise low-risk disease; recognizing that adjuvant therapies reduce locoregional failure but not always distant relapse, risk assessment should integrate both clinicopathologic and molecular features to tailor treatment and follow-up [^113PMXj8] [^111gfZX9] [^1157jRXz] [^1111AG7f].

Uterine cancer recurrence risk is primarily determined by **stage, grade, and histology** (especially serous or clear cell) [^116uqhuW] [^1137RyBw], **lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI)** [^113jjeWB], and **lymph node involvement** [^113jjeWB]. Additional independent predictors include **deep myometrial invasion** [^116CGSPr], **cervical stromal invasion** [^1137RyBw], and **positive peritoneal cytology** [^113PMXj8]. Molecular features such as **p53 abnormality** [^115xmXEN] and **L1CAM overexpression** [^113tjD3q] further increase risk, while POLE-mutated tumors have low recurrence risk [^117F5Qum]. Patient factors (age ≥ 60, obesity, diabetes, hypertension) and suboptimal surgery or omission of indicated adjuvant therapy also contribute to recurrence risk [^111gfZX9].

---

## Tumor-related factors

### Histological subtype and grade

**High-grade histology** — including serous, clear cell, carcinosarcoma, and grade 3 endometrioid tumors — confers significantly higher recurrence risk than low-grade endometrioid tumors [^115xmXEN] [^1144Vv1z]. **Non-endometrioid histology**, particularly serous and clear cell subtypes, is especially aggressive, with higher recurrence rates and poorer outcomes [^1144Vv1z] [^111gfZX9].

---

### FIGO stage

**Advanced FIGO stage** [^116uqhuW] at diagnosis strongly predicts recurrence; stage III disease has a 5-year relapse rate of 37% [^113PMXj8].

---

### Myometrial invasion

**Deep myometrial invasion** [^116CGSPr] (≥ 50% of myometrial thickness) independently increases recurrence risk [^113PMXj8].

---

### Lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI)

**Lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI)** [^113jjeWB] is a strong independent predictor of pelvic regional recurrence, distant metastasis, and reduced overall survival [^114UBkmT].

---

### Lymph node involvement

**Positive lymph nodes** [^113jjeWB] — defined by pelvic or para-aortic lymph node metastasis — significantly increase recurrence risk and reduce overall survival [^113GoVhZ].

---

### Cervical stromal invasion

**Cervical involvement** independently increases recurrence risk [^1137RyBw] [^113PMXj8].

---

### Peritoneal cytology

**Positive peritoneal cytology** [^113PMXj8] is associated with higher recurrence risk, particularly in advanced-stage disease [^114WtVMf].

---

## Molecular and genetic factors

- **P53 abnormality**: Associated with aggressive tumor behavior and increased recurrence risk [^115xmXEN].

- **L1CAM overexpression**: Linked to higher recurrence risk, especially in high-grade tumors [^113tjD3q].

- **POLE mutations**: Generally associated with low recurrence risk and favorable prognosis [^117F5Qum].

---

## Patient-related factors

- **Age**: Older age (≥ 60 years) independently increases recurrence risk [^1137RyBw].

- **Obesity**: Higher BMI is associated with increased recurrence risk.

- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes and hypertension are associated with higher recurrence risk.

---

## Treatment-related factors

**Surgical factors** — such as suboptimal surgery, positive margins, or inadequate lymphadenectomy — increase recurrence risk [^1163r1zq]. Omission or inadequacy of **adjuvant therapy** (radiation or chemotherapy) also increases recurrence risk, particularly in high-risk patients [^111xv292] [^111gfZX9] [^116mbd5q].

---

### Genetic predictors of unexpected recurrence in low-risk endometrial cancer: A comprehensive genomic analysis reveals FGFR2 as a risk factor and a rare fatal POLE-mutated recurrence [^1111AG7f]. Gynecologic Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy in high-income countries. While early-stage endometrial cancer generally has a favorable prognosis, a small proportion of low-risk patients experience unexpected recurrence. This study aimed to identify molecular factors contributing to recurrence in stage 1A grade 1–2 low-risk endometrioid endometrial cancer.

- **Methods**: We performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) on tumor samples from 19 patients who experienced recurrence despite favorable clinicopathological features and compared them with six control patients without recurrence. Results were also compared to a matched cohort of low-risk endometrial cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.

- **Results**: Mutations in PTEN, PIK3CA, ARID1A, and FGFR2 were the most frequent in the recurrence group. FGFR2 mutations were exclusive to the recurrence group (9/19, 47.4%) and absent in the non-recurrence group (0/6), a difference approaching statistical significance (p = 0.0571). FGFR2 mutations were also significantly more prevalent in the recurrence cohort compared to the TCGA low-risk cohort (p = 0.0039). Prominent FGFR2 missense mutations included S252W, K659E, and N549K, which may drive oncogenesis and tumor progression. Among the recurrence group, a rare POLE-mutated tumor recurred unexpectedly and proved fatal, highlighting the potential for poor outcomes even in typically favorable molecular subtypes.

- **Conclusion**: FGFR2 mutations may play a role in tumor recurrence in a subset of low-risk endometrial cancers, underscoring the importance of identifying molecular markers for better prognosis and targeted therapies.

### Quantifying the risk of recurrence and death in stage III (FIGO 2009) endometrial cancer [^113PMXj8]. Gynecologic Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Advanced endometrial cancer patients comprise a heterogeneous group. This study assessed the association of clinicopathological factors with relapse and death from endometrial cancer. Eligible patients were treated for stage III (FIGO 2009) endometrial adenocarcinoma, had peritoneal cytology performed, and had no gross residual disease post-operatively.

Of 192 patients, 59% were ≥ 60 years old, 48% had ≥ 50% myometrial invasion, 71% lymphovascular invasion, 25% cervical stromal invasion, 37% adnexal involvement, and 23% positive peritoneal cytology. High-grade histology (serous, clear cell, undifferentiated, or grade 3 endometrioid) was present in 45%. Pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in 93% and para-aortic lymphadenectomy in 73%. Adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy was administered to 93%.

At a median follow-up of 42 months, the 5-year rate of relapse was 37% and of death from endometrial cancer was 30%. On multivariate analysis, both outcomes were associated with high-grade histology, positive peritoneal cytology, and deep myometrial invasion (p ≤ 0.04). The cohort was divided into subgroups of patients with 0 (n = 46), 1 (n = 83), or ≥ 2 (n = 63) of these high-risk characteristics. The 5-year relapse rate for patients with 0 risk factors was 13%, 1 risk factor was 27%, and ≥ 2 risk factors was 62% (p < 0.001). The corresponding 5-year rates of death from endometrial cancer were 11%, 20%, and 56%, respectively (p < 0.001).

Stratification of stage III endometrial cancer according to high-grade histology, positive peritoneal cytology, and deep myometrial invasion is important for understanding prognosis and guiding treatment decisions.

### Endometrial cancer: Molecular classification and future treatments [^112pHUtg]. BMJ Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy in the US, with an estimated 66,000 new cases annually (2022 estimates). Globally, it is the sixth most common cancer, with 417,000 new cases and 97,000 deaths in 2020.

- **Evidence reporting**: Despite recent advances and novel treatments, survival for endometrial cancer has decreased in the past 10 years, representing one of the few cancers with impaired survival. Uterine cancer is among the few cancers with an increase in overall mortality, with a rise of 1.7% over the past 10 years. Common risk factors for endometrial cancer include obesity, states of unopposed estrogen (e.g. obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome), early menarche or late menopause, and hereditary cancer syndromes, including Lynch and Cowden's syndrome. Historically, treatment for endometrial cancer has been related to known histopathological risk factors of the tumor that might indicate better or worse recurrence risk. However, over the past decade, molecular analysis and molecular-driven treatments have become an important aspect of patient-directed care in endometrial cancer. This review summarizes the known molecular aberrations of endometrial cancer and associated treatment options. It highlights the clinical trial landscape and potential therapeutic shifts based on molecular analysis. This review is aimed at patients and healthcare providers.

- **Uterine histopathological status**: Uterine factors, histopathological features, and cancer stage continue to be important factors in the risk stratification of endometri.

### Multifactorial construction of low-grade and high-grade endometrial cancer recurrence prediction models [^113jjeWB]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

Compared with patients without LVSI, those with LVSI had a higher 5-year recurrence rate and the strongest independent prognostic factors for pelvic regional recurrence, distant metastasis, and overall survival. Our study found that LVSI is an independent risk factor for EC recurrence, consistent with previous research.

The external iliac lymph nodes are the most common site of pelvic lymph node metastasis in EC patients. Univariate analysis in some studies showed that age over 50 years, adnexal metastasis, and pelvic lymph node metastasis were associated with recurrence. Polterauer et al. reported that the proportion of positive pelvic lymph nodes was related to progression-free survival and overall survival. In a study by Tangjitgamol et al. involving 82 patients, positive pelvic lymph node ratio was one of the significant adverse prognostic factors for progression-free survival through univariate analysis. Pelvic lymph node positivity increases the risk of recurrence and reduces overall survival. For pathologic Stage III C EC confined to pelvic lymph nodes, postoperative pelvic radiotherapy is a feasible treatment option. In this study, RFS in the high-grade group was related to pelvic lymph node status, and postoperative radiotherapy may be considered for patients with lymph node positivity.

Using statistical principles, a column chart was constructed based on the results of a complex regression equation, and the chart was then used to visualize the results. Compared with traditional TNM staging, column charts are considered superior in many cancers.

### Selecting adjuvant treatment for endometrial carcinoma using molecular risk factors [^1157jRXz]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Low credibility.

The extensive molecular-genetic characterization of endometrial cancer by the Cancer Genome Atlas Group (TCGA) has been pivotal in understanding the molecular pathways involved in endometrial cancer development and their prognostic implications. By conducting a full genomic analysis of 373 endometrial cancer (EC) cases, four different molecular subclasses were identified based on mutation rates and somatic copy-number alterations (SCNA).

- **Ultramutated subclass**: Characterized by mutations in the exonuclease domain of DNA polymerase-epsilon (POLE); associated with a very favorable prognosis.
- **Hypermutated subclass**: Based on microsatellite instability (MSI), this subclass has been shown to have an intermediate prognosis.
- **Copy-number low subclass**: With low mutation frequency (also called subclass with no specific molecular profile or NSMP); associated with an intermediate prognosis.
- **Copy-number high subclass**: Characterized by TP53 mutations, mainly in serous-type EC; has a very high degree of SCNAs, a low mutation rate, and is associated with the most unfavorable prognosis.

Several research groups have reproduced and validated the four TCGA subclasses in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues in different EC cohorts by using their surrogate markers. These findings have led to a clinically available molecular classification tool for diagnosis and decision-making.

### Translating biological insights into improved management of endometrial cancer [^116uqhuW]. Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecological cancer among women in high-income countries, with both incidence and mortality continuing to increase. The complexity of managing patients with EC has evolved due to a greater understanding of the underlying biology and heterogeneity of this disease. With a growing number of novel therapeutic agents available, emerging treatment regimens seem to have the potential to address the concerning trends in EC-related mortality. This review describes the epidemiology, histopathology, and molecular classification of EC, as well as the role of the new (2023) International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) staging model. Furthermore, it provides an overview of disease management in first-line and recurrent settings. With the increasing use of molecular profiling and updates in treatment paradigms, new developments in this rapidly changing treatment landscape are also summarized.

### Artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and management of gynecologic cancer [^1166jAPo]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

- **The role of AI in risk prediction**: Traditional models for endometrial cancer risk, focusing on age, body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters), and genetics, often lack sensitivity. A 2021 meta-analysis identified obesity (BMI > 30) as the most significant risk factor, with a relative risk of 2.87 for developing endometrial cancer. The study also used a neural network model to predict cancer diagnoses with an accuracy over 98%, greatly improving traditional methods. In 2023, an ML model incorporating immune landscape data and traditional prognostic factors achieved an accuracy of 69%, significantly enhancing the prediction of recurrence and survival outcomes by including tumor mutational burden and immune cell populations.

- **AI-driven early intervention strategies**: AI has shown great potential in diagnosing endometrial cancer, especially in postmenopausal women with symptoms like vaginal bleeding and endometrial thickness (≥ 5 mm). A case–control study comparing diagnostic models found artificial neural networks to be the most accurate, with a sensitivity of 86.8%, specificity of 83.3%, and overall accuracy of 85.4%, outperforming other methods. These findings highlight AI's role as a non-invasive screening tool, supporting clinicians in primary care decisions by combining genetic, molecular, and clinical data for personalized prevention strategies.

### Prognostic factors in patients treated with taxane-based chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer: proposal for a new prognostic model [^114A9Rhc]. Gynecologic Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Taxane-based chemotherapy has been recently introduced as an effective therapeutic option in recurrent or metastatic endometrial carcinoma (RMEC). The aim of the study was to determine the prognostic factors in RMEC after taxane-based chemotherapy.

One hundred ten patients who received a paclitaxel-containing regimen for RMEC were retrospectively evaluated. Potential prognostic factors for overall survival were identified with the Kaplan-Meier method in univariate and the Cox regression model in multivariate analysis.

- **Results**: Performance status (PS) and relapse within the field of previous external radiation were independent prognostic factors for overall survival (p = 0.007 and p = 0.026, respectively). Non-endometrioid histology was associated with a shorter median survival compared to endometrioid adenocarcinoma (14.46 vs. 17.57 months, p = 0.093), but histology was not an independent prognostic factor (HR = 1.43, 95% CI: 0.82–2.48, p = 0.21). Stratification according to PS and relapse within the irradiation field identified three risk groups with distinctly different prognoses (median survival 27.36, 16.71, and 11.33 months for the groups of favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable prognosis, respectively, p < 0.001). Within the favorable prognosis group, 34% of patients had a probability of 5-year survival.

- **Conclusion**: PS at diagnosis and relapse within the irradiated area may constitute a valid prognostic model in RMEC patients who receive taxane-based chemotherapy and can identify long-term survivors.

### DNA aneuploidy is associated with increased mortality for stage I endometrial cancer [^113tEro5]. Gynecologic Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

The study was undertaken to determine if DNA ploidy is a useful prognostic variable for predicting recurrence in stage I endometrial cancer. For cancer of the endometrium, survival following recurrence may depend on a number of factors, including the pattern of recurrence and the response to second-line treatment. Previous studies have demonstrated worse survival for patients with DNA aneuploid tumors. However, it remains unclear whether this is necessarily due to a higher risk of recurrence. This study was undertaken to assess DNA ploidy and the risk of recurrence in patients with stage I endometrial cancer.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective study of surgically treated patients with stages IB and IC endometrial cancer treated from 1992 to 2000. All patients underwent definitive surgery, including staging lymphadenectomy. None of the patients received postoperative treatment. DNA ploidy was determined using flow cytometry and image analysis. Grade, lymph-vascular space invasion, stage (stage IB versus IC), and DNA ploidy were analyzed with regard to recurrence and survival.

- **Results**: There were 100 patients with stages IB and IC endometrial cancer in this analysis. There were 17 recurrences (17%) and 10 patients that died of cancer (10%). Grade 3 and the presence of lymph-vascular space invasion were associated with increased risk of recurrence; DNA aneuploidy and stage were not. Grade, lymph-vascular space invasion, and DNA ploidy were associated with survival. These findings indicate that DNA aneuploidy does not increase the risk of disease recurrence.

### Selecting adjuvant treatment for endometrial carcinoma using molecular risk factors [^117F5Qum]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Low credibility.

The molecular discoveries by TCGA have provided new insights into the carcinogenesis and clinical behavior of endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer (EC) within the subclass with POLE mutation has shown an excellent prognosis, even without further adjuvant therapy, while EC with unfavorable molecular alterations have shown an increased risk of locoregional recurrence and distant spread of the disease. These molecular risk factors have not yet been included in clinical guidelines. Combining molecular features and clinicopathological risk factors into a stratification model holds promise to guide surgery, adjuvant treatment, and disease surveillance. This results in more individualized adjuvant treatment and reduction of both under and overtreatment. Furthermore, a combined assessment can lead to a more objective approach to EC classification compared to the histology-based classification, which has limitations such as inter-observer variability. Apart from this, other strategies, such as the molecular assessment of endometrial biopsies, which has shown high concordance with the final hysterectomy specimen, could guide both pre-surgical and surgical treatment decisions, such as the extent of surgical staging.

### Predictive modeling: A new paradigm for managing endometrial cancer [^114WyF8i]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

With the abundance of new options in diagnostic and treatment modalities, a shift in the medical decision process for endometrial cancer (EC) has been observed. The emergence of individualized medicine and the increasing complexity of available medical data have led to the development of several prediction models. In EC, these clinical models — algorithms, nomograms, and risk scoring systems — have been reported, especially for stratifying and subgrouping patients, with various unanswered questions regarding issues such as optimal surgical staging for lymph node metastasis and the assessment of recurrence and survival outcomes.

In this review, we highlight existing prognostic and predictive models in EC, with a specific focus on their clinical applicability. We also discuss the methodological aspects of the development of such predictive models and the steps required to integrate these tools into clinical decision-making. In the future, the emerging field of molecular or biochemical markers research may substantially improve predictive and treatment approaches.

### Multifactorial construction of low-grade and high-grade endometrial cancer recurrence prediction models [^114w7LAN]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

**Evaluation and validation**: To reflect the predictive performance of the model, the overall predictive ability of the model was assessed using the AUC. For the low-grade group, the AUC was 0.881 for 1-year RFS, 0.888 for 3-year RFS, and 0.807 for 5-year RFS. In the high-grade group, the AUC was 0.825 for 1-year RFS, 0.853 for 3-year RFS, and 0.832 for 5-year RFS. The calibration accuracy of the prediction model was demonstrated using the calibration curve. Bootstrap resampling was performed 1,000 times, and the essence of this curve lies in comparing the actual risk with the predicted risk for 1, 3, and 5 years. The calibration curves are presented in Figure 4, and the decision curve analysis curves are shown in Figure 5.

### Endometrial cancer: ESMO clinical practice guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^1169vyvZ]. Annals of Oncology (2022). High credibility.

For follow-up and surveillance of endometrial cancer, particularly in the management of recurrent disease, the ESMO 2022 guidelines recommend offering radiotherapy with vaginal brachytherapy as the preferred primary therapy for patients with locoregional recurrence after primary surgery. It is advisable to consider adding systemic therapy to salvage radiotherapy.

### Selecting adjuvant treatment for endometrial carcinoma using molecular risk factors [^116i1Aoy]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Molecular alterations are frequently found in endometrial cancer, and increasing knowledge of their prognostic significance and possible therapeutic options has been gained. Trials investigating adjuvant treatment based on molecular alterations are ongoing for women with high-intermediate risk, high risk, and recurrent or metastatic endometrial carcinoma. More evidence on selecting adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies based on molecular alterations in endometrial carcinoma is needed. Results of ongoing and future trials investigating adjuvant and targeted therapies for endometrial carcinoma are eagerly awaited.

Most recurrences are diagnosed in the first three years of follow-up in high-risk and advanced endometrial cancer patients. There is no role for routine imaging to detect recurrence in asymptomatic patients. Symptom inquiry and physical examination are effective screening tools that define the need for and type of imaging required. Speculum examination detects 30% of vaginal recurrences that are asymptomatic and can be salvaged by irradiation or surgery. Since the literature has not identified a clinical benefit, vaginal cytology is not recommended in this setting.

Endometrial cancer generally has a good prognosis, with 75% of unselected patients surviving their diagnosis for five years or more. Despite being cured of their endometrial cancer, these patients remain at higher risk of death than age-matched women from the general population. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients who survive endometrial cancer. Nearly 90% of endometrial cancer survivors have at least one undiagnosed or undertreated cardiovascular risk factor, including obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Routine follow-up is an ideal opportunity to screen for and treat modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, with the overall aim of reducing avoidable mortality in women with a history of endometrial cancer. Intentional weight loss and regular physical activity improve the general health and quality of life of endometrial cancer survivors living with obesity. Referral to specialist obesity services may be required to support sustainable changes.

### Multifactorial construction of low-grade and high-grade endometrial cancer recurrence prediction models [^114jSNcb]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

**Clinical decision curve analysis**: The clinical decision curve analysis is used to evaluate the clinical usability of predictive models. It consists of two parts: (a) the low‐grade group and (b) the high‐grade group. When all individuals are considered patients and have not received clinical intervention, the net benefit is shown by the None line. Conversely, when all patients have received clinical intervention, the net benefit is represented by the All line. An important indicator of the predictive model's value is when the curves are located in the upper right corner relative to the All and None lines, suggesting that the model holds good clinical value. RFS stands for recurrence‐free survival.

### Endometrial cancer: molecular classification and future treatments [^115xmXEN]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The future treatments for endometrial cancer are very promising. The development of molecular analysis, combined with novel agents and new drug classes, has revolutionized precision medicine for patients with endometrial cancer. For decades, uterine risk factors have been used to stratify risk and recommend treatments. Whether molecular analysis will replace or supplement this risk stratification model is unknown. However, our ability to treat patients with more options is clearly improving based on this knowledge.

- **Questions for future research**: Should molecular analysis be performed on all patients with endometrial cancer in the upfront or reSetting, or both? Should all future trials on endometrial cancer incorporate biomarker-driven molecular evaluation? Is molecular classification of endometrial cancer into the four known subclassifications an adequate evaluation?

- **Patient involvement**: Patients and the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination plans of this research.

### Analysis of prognostic factors and patterns of recurrence in patients with pathologic stage III endometrial cancer [^113GoVhZ]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2007). Low credibility.

To retrospectively assess prognostic factors and patterns of recurrence in patients with pathologic Stage III endometrial cancer, a study was conducted.

Between 1989 and 2003, 107 patients with pathologic International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Stage III endometrial adenocarcinoma confined to the pelvis were treated at our institution. Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) was delivered to 68 patients (64%). The influence of multiple patient- and treatment-related factors on pelvic and distant control and overall survival (OS) was evaluated.

Median follow-up for patients at risk was 41 months. Five-year actuarial OS was significantly improved in patients treated with adjuvant RT (68%) compared to those with resection alone (50%; p = 0.029). Age, histology, grade, uterine serosal invasion, adnexal involvement, number of extrauterine sites, and treatment with adjuvant RT predicted improved survival in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed that grade, uterine serosal invasion, and treatment with adjuvant RT were independent predictors of survival. Five-year actuarial pelvic control was improved significantly with the delivery of adjuvant RT (74% vs. 49%; p = 0.011). Depth of myometrial invasion and treatment with adjuvant RT were identified as independent predictors of pelvic control in multivariate analysis.

Multiple prognostic factors predicting the outcome of pathologic Stage III endometrial cancer patients were identified in this analysis. In particular, the delivery of adjuvant RT appears to be a significant independent predictor.

### Factors associated with an increased risk of recurrence in patients diagnosed with high-grade endometrial cancer undergoing minimally invasive surgery: A study of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology of Canada (GOC) Community of Practice (CoP) [^111TymXj]. Gynecologic Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is a standard approach for comprehensive surgical staging in women with endometrial cancer. As the rates and complexity of MIS steadily increase, it becomes important to identify potential risk factors associated with this approach. This study evaluates the impact of local factors on the risk of disease recurrence.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted with patients diagnosed with high-grade endometrial cancer (HGEC) who underwent MIS between 2012 and 2016 at eight Canadian centers. Data were collected from medical records. The 75th percentile was calculated for estimated uterine volume and weight. All recurrences were categorized into two groups: intra-abdominal vs. extra-abdominal. A Cox proportional hazard model was performed to search for significant covariates associated with recurrence-free survival.

- **Results**: A total of 758 patients were included in the study. An intra-uterine manipulator was used in 497 (35.8%) patients, and vaginal lacerations were documented in 9.1%. The median follow-up was 30.5 months (interquartile range 20–47). There were 157 patients who had disease recurrence (20.71%), including 92 (12.14%) intra-abdominal and 60 (7.92%) extra-abdominal only recurrences. In univariate analysis, myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space invasion (LVI), stage, uterine volume and weight greater than the 75th percentile, and chemotherapy were associated with an increased risk of intra-abdominal recurrence. In multivariable analysis, only stage and specimen weight greater than the 75th percentile (OR 2.207, CI 1.123–4.337) remained significant. Uterine volume and weight were not independently significant.

### Risk prediction models for endometrial cancer: Development and validation in an international consortium [^114iMr4R]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). High credibility.

AUCs for the 10-year risk of endometrial cancer based on the epidemiologic models were 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.63 to 0.67) for NHS, 0.69 (95% CI = 0.66 to 0.72) for NHS II, and 0.64 (95% CI = 0.62 to 0.67) for PLCO. Among participants for whom genetic data were available, the addition of genetic factors did not change the AUC in NHS (AUC = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.57 to 0.66) but improved the AUC from 0.64 (95% CI = 0.61 to 0.67) to 0.66 (95% CI = 0.63 to 0.69) in PLCO.

Age-specific AUCs (within 10-year age bands) were similar to overall AUCs. The epidemiologic model underpredicted the number of events in the NHS cohort (E/O = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.51 to 0.59) but more accurately predicted the overall number of events in NHS II (E/O = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.22) and PLCO (E/O = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.95 to 1.13). The epidemiologic plus genetic model was well-calibrated in the PLCO cohort (E/O = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.85 to 1.03).

In sensitivity analyses, calibration of the models in which individuals were censored upon development of a competing event were similar to our main findings.

### Prognostic value of the cutoffs for HALP in endometrial cancer [^115sbwXA]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

It is worth mentioning that we found that the HALP score not only has a predictive value for recurrence and death in endometrial cancer patients but also has some significance for predicting lymph node metastasis (LNM), with the optimal threshold concentrated around 33.8. It is well known that nodal status is an important factor affecting patient prognosis. According to our findings, patients with a HALP score of 33.8 have less risk of LNM and may be a beneficial group to be exempted from lymph node dissection. Of course, the HALP score alone is not accurate enough to predict LNM. A recent study reported that sentinel node mapping and pathologic ultrastaging can improve the detection rate of low-volume disease (micro-metastases and isolated tumor cells), which can help diagnose and tailor appropriate adjuvant treatments for patients with endometrial cancer. Our proposed HALP score can be used as an adjuvant indicator for the initial preoperative prediction of LNM, thus better guiding the preoperative and postoperative management of patients.

### No. 291-epidemiology and investigations for suspected endometrial cancer [^114uGbMr]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2018). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for endometrial cancer, specifically concerning genetic counseling, the SOGC 2018 guidelines recommend offering genetic counseling and testing to tailor risk-management interventions. These interventions include screening strategies and treatment options for patients with an increased risk of inherited Lynch syndrome. This increased risk may be indicated by a strong family history of endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancers, which elevates the lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancer.

### Endometrial cancer: A Society of Gynecologic Oncology evidence-based review and recommendations [^1163r1zq]. Gynecologic Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

In 2014, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology's Clinical Practice Committee published a clinical update reviewing the treatment of women with endometrial cancer. At that time, there had been significant advances in the diagnosis, work-up, surgical management, and available treatment options, allowing for more optimal care of affected women. Despite these advances, the incidence of endometrial cancer, as well as the deaths attributable to the disease, have continued to rise. From 1987 to 2014, there has been a 75% increase in cases and almost a 300% increase in endometrial cancer deaths. Fortunately, since then, there has been progress in the treatment of patients with endometrial cancer, with increased utilization of molecular pathology, greater understanding of genetic predisposition, enhanced methods for lymph node assessment, a broader understanding of the efficacy of radiation and chemotherapy, and a more efficient approach to survivorship and surveillance. The purpose of this document is to present a comprehensive review of this progress.

- **Manuscript development process**: The authors reviewed the available evidence, contributed to the development of this manuscript, provided a critical review of the guidelines, and finalized the manuscript recommendations. The review was also presented to and approved by the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Clinical Practice Committee, SGO Publications Committee, and the SGO board members prior to submission for publication. The recommendations for this manuscript were developed by a panel of gynecologic oncologists who were members of these committees.

### Predictive model of venous thromboembolism in endometrial cancer [^113JTp3j]. Gynecologic Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to profile characteristics and survival of endometrial cancer patients who develop venous thromboembolism (VTE) and to establish a predictive model of VTE in endometrial cancer.

- **Methods**: Cases were identified using an institutional database between 2000 and 2011. VTE was correlated to clinico-pathological information and survival outcomes. Frequency and odds ratio (OR) of VTE were examined in a predictive model based on combination patterns of independent risk factors for VTE.

- **Results**: VTE was observed in 42 (8.1%, 95% CI 5.8–10.5) out of 516 cases subsequent to the diagnosis of endometrial cancer. Multivariate analysis identified four independent risk factors for VTE: elevated CA-125 (hazard ratio [HR] 5.38, p < 0.001), extrauterine disease (HR 2.87, p = 0.019), thrombocytosis (HR 2.11, p = 0.04), and high-risk histology (serous and clear cell, HR 2.09, p = 0.049). VTE was the strongest variable for decreased progression-free survival (HR 4.28) and the second strongest variable for decreased overall survival (HR 5.65) in multivariate analysis. In the predictive model of VTE, the presence of multiple risk factors was associated with a significantly increased risk of VTE: frequency of VTE was 1.4% if no risk factors were present, 0–9.3% (OR 1.0–4.2) if a single risk factor was present, 11.1–25.0% (OR 9.0–24.0) if two risk factors were present, and 42.9–46.2% (OR 54.0–61.7) if three or more risk factors were present.

- **Conclusion**: VTE represents a surrogate for aggressive disease in endometrial cancer. Multiple risk factors of VTE in our predictive model demonstrated an exceedingly high risk of VTE, suggesting that there may be a certain population…

### Is there a prognostic difference between depth of myometrial invasion and the tumor-free distance from the uterine serosa in endometrial cancer [^112A2Lgd]. Gynecologic Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

The objective was to determine whether tumor-free distance from the uterine serosa is more predictive of patient outcome than the depth of endometrial cancer invasion into the myometrium.

- **Methods**: Patients with surgically staged endometrial adenocarcinoma between 1997 and 2000 were identified. Depth of myometrial invasion (DOI) was defined as the distance between the endometrial-myometrial junction and the deepest myometrial invasion. Tumor-free distance from the uterine serosa (TFD) was defined as the distance between the serosa and the deepest myometrial invasion. DOI and TFD were expressed as continuous variables and compared with traditional surgicopathologic variables, recurrence, and survival to determine their predictive and prognostic significance.

- **Results**: We identified 153 patients who met the study criteria. The median DOI was 0.5 cm, and the median TFD was 1.4 cm. The most common stage was IB, and 23 patients had positive nodes. With a median follow-up of 29 months, 10 patients have recurred. When DOI and TFD were compared in a univariate model, TFD was an equal or more significant predictor of traditional surgicopathologic variables. TFD, but not DOI, was predictive of recurrence. Likewise, TFD was a more significant predictor of dying from disease than DOI. In a multivariate model, TFD correlated with surgicopathologic variables, recurrence risk, and survival. DOI, however, was not predictive unless myometrial thickness was included in the model. A TFD of 1 cm maximized the balance of sensitivity and specificity in predicting recurrence.

### Practice bulletin no. 149: Endometrial cancer [^116u5QAD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of endometrial cancer, especially concerning the management of local or locoregional disease, the ACOG/SGO 2015 guidelines recommend assessing the risk of extrauterine disease and the potential for disease recurrence. This assessment should be based on the patient's age, histologic cell type, and uterine tumor features in those who are found to have endometrial cancer incidentally after hysterectomy. It is crucial to consider individualizing treatment plans based on these findings.

### ESGO/ESTRO/ESP guidelines for the management of patients with endometrial carcinoma [^112rgCgq]. International Journal of Gynecological Cancer (2021). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for endometrial cancer, specifically in the management of recurrent disease, the ESGO/ESP/ESTRO 2021 guidelines recommend considering radical re-irradiation. This can include SBRT targeting the recurrence, permanent seed implants, or proton therapy if surgery is not feasible. Limited volume re-irradiation, especially if there is a longer interval from the first irradiation, with EBRT and a brachytherapy boost should be considered in selected cases. For patients who have only had previous brachytherapy, offer EBRT with a brachytherapy boost. Image-guided interstitial brachytherapy should be offered only if re-irradiation with EBRT is not an option.

### Lymph node dissection in endometrial cancer and clinical outcome: A population-based study in 5546 patients [^113UPc6p]. Gynecologic Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

According to treatment guidelines, comprehensive surgical staging procedures in endometrial cancer confined to the uterus depend on uterine risk factors: a systematic lymph node dissection (LND) is recommended in high-risk patients and should be omitted in low-risk patients. Its role in intermediate and high intermediate risk patients is inconclusive. The aim of this analysis was to review the implementation of this risk-adopted strategy.

- **Materials and methods**: Data were provided by the population-based Munich Cancer Registry. Patients with endometrial cancer diagnosed between 1998 and 2016 were included.

- **Results**: Of 5446 eligible patients, 58.5%, 30.1% and 11.4% belonged to the low risk, intermediate/high-intermediate, and high risk group, respectively. Lymph node dissection was performed in 20.2%, 53.0%, and 63.7% within these groups. Lymph node involvement was diagnosed in 1.7%, 9.6%, and 19.3%, respectively. Within these risk groups, there was no significant difference in the time to local recurrence, lymph node recurrence, or distant metastases between patients with and without LND. After adjusting for age and comorbidity-status, no significant difference in overall survival was found.

- **Conclusions**: The application of a risk-adopted management of LND in early endometrial cancer in real life is associated with a high rate of surgical under- and overtreatment. Corresponding survival data do not show a significant benefit of a systematic lymph node dissection. In order to improve the management and outcome of early endometrial cancer in the future, prospective studies are needed.

In 2014, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology's Clinical Practice Committee published a clinical update reviewing the treatment of women with endometrial cancer. Significant advances in diagnosis, work-up, surgical management, and available treatment options at that time allowed for more optimal care of affected women.

This manuscript, Part II of a two-part series, includes specific recommendations on the treatment of recurrent disease, post-treatment surveillance, and survivorship. It provides considerations for younger women and examines special situations. Part I covered histopathology and molecular pathology, risk factors, presentation and diagnostic approach, surgical approach, and adjuvant therapy.

### Prognostic value of the cutoffs for HALP in endometrial cancer [^114xgVMJ]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

- **Identifying the optimal cutoff for HALP**: The results of univariate and multivariate analyses indicate that HALP is an independent protective factor for endometrial cancer recurrence and death. Based on the ROC curve and the calculated Youden index (Fig. 1), the optimal cutoff values of HALP for predicting LNM, recurrence, and death in patients were 33.72 (specificity 0.690, sensitivity 0.549, and area under the curve 0.604), 33.74 (specificity 0.697, sensitivity 0.630, and area under the curve 0.664), and 33.84 (specificity 0.689, sensitivity 0.683, and area under the curve 0.666). These three results were similar; thus, we determined that 33.8 was the optimal cutoff value of HALP for predicting the prognosis (LNM, recurrence, and death) of endometrial cancer.

- **Figure 1**:

### Risk prediction models for endometrial cancer: development and validation in an international consortium [^111dx2oX]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). High credibility.

Our study has many strengths. First, we used the largest, most heterogeneous population at the time of writing to develop an endometrial cancer risk prediction model, with data spanning 19 studies across different continents. The consortium provided individual-level data to standardize risk factor definitions. Second, we externally validated our model in three large cohorts. Specifically, we evaluated calibration by deciles of risk, which is relevant for risk-based prevention and screening of highest-risk individuals. Third, we developed the model using population-based estimates for the marginal incidence rates for endometrial cancer and for competing risks, as well as the underlying risk factor distributions. As such, our model was well-calibrated to both NHS II and PLCO — two studies with very different source populations — and is likely generalizable to the general US population of White women. Last, our study evaluated the contributions of genetic data to the performance of these prediction models.

In conclusion, we developed and validated absolute risk models for endometrial cancer among postmenopausal women aged at least 45 years in the largest, most heterogeneous study population at the time of writing. Our model including epidemiologic factors alone was sufficient to identify women with risks comparable with that in Lynch patients, who are recommended annual screening; this may provide a basis for the eventual development of a risk prediction tool for clinical or public health practice. Future work is necessary to evaluate the accuracy of our models in multiethnic populations and specific histological subtypes.

### Endometrial cancer characteristics and risk of recurrence [^116EHDQj]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

To describe the clinicopathologic characteristics and survival outcomes of endometrial adenocarcinomas stratified by mismatch repair (MMR) status, this study was conducted.

- **Methods**: This is a single-institution, retrospective study of all women with endometrioid adenocarcinomas treated from January 2012 through December 2017. Patients were categorized into one of three groups based on MMR testing: intact MMR expression (MMR+), probable MMR mutation (MMR-), or MLH1 hypermethylation (hMLH1+). Demographics, pathologic characteristics, recurrence rates, and survival differences were analyzed.

- **Results**: In total, 316 women were included in the analysis: 235 (74.4%) patients in the MMR+ group, 10 (3.1%) in the MMR- group, and 71 (22.5%) in the hMLH1+ group. Patients with hMLH1+ were significantly older, exhibited higher-grade histology and presence of lymphovascular space invasion, and were more likely to have received adjuvant treatment. The early-stage hMLH1+ patients were more likely to recur (15.3% hMLH1+ vs. 2.3% MMR+ vs. 12.5% MMR-, p < 0.001). Hypermethylation remained a significant predictor of recurrence in multivariable analysis (odds ratio, 5.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.54–16.86; p = 0.008). Recurrence-free survival was significantly reduced in early-stage hMLH1+ (hazard ratio, 7.40; 95% CI, 2.80–21.62; p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Women with hMLH1+ endometrial cancer have worse prognostic features and recur more frequently, even in patients traditionally considered low risk for recurrence.

### What is the best preoperative imaging for endometrial cancer [^113veA9v]. Current Oncology Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in high-income countries, and the incidence is increasing. Most patients are diagnosed at an early stage, with tumors still confined to the uterine corpus in around 75%. However, after primary surgery, approximately 15–20% of these tumors recur in the vagina/pelvis (around one-third of recurrences) or at distant sites (around two-thirds of recurrences). The overall 5-year survival rate for endometrial cancer across all stages is approximately 80%; however, in the metastatic setting, the prognosis is poor, with a reported median survival of only 7–12 months.

Since 1988, adjuvant treatment and follow-up after primary surgery for endometrial cancer have been guided by the surgical International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging systems, which were last revised in 2009. In addition to risk classification based on investigation of preoperative uterine biopsies, conventional imaging methods, such as transvaginal ultrasound (TVU), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT), have long been employed at many centers. This is to improve the optimization of risk classification for tailoring primary surgical procedures and systemic therapeutic strategies. Although these imaging methods may provide information about likely tumor stage based on conventional imaging findings (e.g. signs of deep myometrial invasion, cervical stromal invasion, and pelvic and/or paraaortic lymph node metastases), the reported accuracies for preoperative staging of endometrial cancer are variable.

### A simplified risk stratification method for women with stage I endometrial carcinoma [^114UBkmT]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

Available risk stratification methods for women with endometrial carcinoma are controversially defined. We sought to develop a simplified and individualized prognostic index for cancer recurrence in women with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I endometrial carcinoma, solely of endometrioid histology.

- **Materials and methods**: We identified 976 women who underwent a hysterectomy and did not receive any adjuvant therapy. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent predictors of recurrence. Prognostic groups were created based on the number of independent predictors of recurrence (0, 1, or 2 or 3 risk factors). These groups were then validated using a separate cohort of 611 women treated at another academic institution. The model's performance for predicting cancer recurrence was measured by the concordance probability estimate along with a 95% confidence interval.

- **Results**: Median follow-up was 65 months. The final recurrence model included three risk groups based on three independent predictors of recurrence: tumor grade 2 or 3, the presence of lymphovascular space invasion, and stage IB. Five-year recurrence rates were 4%, 16%, and 44% for groups 0, 1, and 2 or 3, respectively. The performance of the model was very good with a concordance probability estimate of 0.72 and 0.80 for the development and validation cohorts, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: On the basis of three well-known prognostic factors, we have developed and externally validated a simplified prognostic model that accurately predicts cancer recurrence in women.

### Prognostic value of myometrial invasion and TCGA groups of endometrial carcinoma [^116CGSPr]. Gynecologic Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

The 2021 ESGO/ESTRO/ESP guidelines for the management of patients with endometrial carcinoma (EC) encourage molecular classification and propose a new prognostic risk stratification based on both pathologic and molecular features. Although deep myometrial invasion (DMI) has been considered a crucial risk factor in EC, it is unclear if its prognostic value is independent from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) groups.

- **Aim**: To assess if the prognostic value of DMI is independent from the TCGA groups in EC patients.

- **Materials and methods**: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed by searching through five electronic databases, from their inception to March 2021, for all studies that assessed DMI as a prognostic factor independent of the TCGA groups in EC patients. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) of DMI for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was calculated using multivariable analyses, including TCGA groups as a variable. Superficial myometrial invasion (< 50% of myometrial thickness) was used as a reference. In DFS analyses, locoregional and distant recurrence were considered separately for one study.

- **Results**: Five studies with 2,469 patients were included in the systematic review, and three studies with 1,549 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled HR of DMI was 1.082 (CI 95% 0.85–1.377; p = 0.524) for OS, 1.709 (CI 95% 1.173–2.491; p = 0.005) for DFS, 1.585 (CI 95% 1.154–2.178; p = 0.004) for DFS considering locoregional recurrence, and 1.701 (CI 95% 1.235–2.344; p = 0.001) for DFS considering distant recurrence.

### Risk prediction models for endometrial cancer: Development and validation in an international consortium [^111oCVoL]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). Low credibility.

There are several limitations of our study to consider. First, the availability of measured risk factors was of concern, especially in the reference dataset (NHANES). For example, we could not include family history of endometrial cancer in our model because these data were not collected in NHANES. Second, recall bias may differentially affect the measurement of risk factors in our case-control studies. However, previous analyses of E2C2 data have reported similar estimates for endometrial cancer risk factors between cohort and case-control studies, which mitigates some of this concern. Third, we had limited genetic data available for NHS participants. In the NHS, genetic data were pooled from 12 different case-control genome-wide association studies of various disease outcomes. As such, participants with available genetic data may not be representative of the broader NHS cohort, and matching on certain factors (e.g. HT use) between cases and controls may explain the lower AUC observed in the genetic vs. full cohort. Fourth, although our relative risk estimates could be adapted in future prediction tools, our proposed models will likely need to be recalibrated to obtain accurate absolute risks for endometrial cancer risk in new geographic, temporal, or population settings. Last, most endometrial cancer cases in our study were of the endometrioid subtype, which precluded us from conducting histologic subtype-specific analyses for rarer subtypes. In addition, the lack of racial diversity among participants in our training data (93% White) and validation cohorts (93%-95% White) presents a limitation.

### Prevention strategies in endometrial carcinoma [^1134Q1VN]. Current Oncology Reports (2018). Low credibility.

The main focus of our research is the prevention and early detection of endometrial cancer. These themes ranked as the most important endometrial cancer research priorities for patients, carers, and healthcare professionals in our award-winning James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership. We found a high prevalence of occult endometrial abnormality in obese women undergoing bariatric surgery, and witnessed their reversal to healthy endometrium after bariatric surgery-induced weight loss in some cases. Based on these findings, we have made local arrangements to facilitate the provision of bariatric surgery to obese women diagnosed with an obesity-related precancerous endometrial lesion and have ongoing work exploring non-surgical treatments for low-grade early-stage endometrial cancers in selected patients.

Our aim is to identify a high-risk endometrial tissue signature that predicts those women at greatest risk of developing endometrial cancer to target for prevention measures (such as weight loss, LNG-IUS ± chemoprevention agents). Our theoretical risk prediction model will facilitate the identification of women for stratified prevention interventions, and ongoing work seeks to validate our model in large UK populations. Such interventions may also be useful in the post-treatment setting to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence, although there is currently no evidence to support this. Achieving and maintaining weight loss is likely to have health benefits beyond the endometrium in obese postmenopausal women, for example by reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes.

### Postoperative radiation therapy for endometrial cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline endorsement of the American Society for Radiation Oncology evidence-based guideline [^116mbd5q]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). High credibility.

To provide guidance on the role of adjuvant radiation therapy in the treatment of endometrial cancer, "The Role of Postoperative Radiation Therapy for Endometrial Cancer: An ASTRO Evidence-Based Guideline" by Klopp et al, published in 2014 in Practical Radiation Oncology, was reviewed for developmental rigor by methodologists. The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) guideline content and recommendations were further reviewed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Endorsement Panel.

The ASCO Endorsement Panel determined that the recommendations from the ASTRO guideline are clear, thorough, and based on the most relevant scientific evidence. ASCO endorsed the ASTRO guideline with several qualifying statements.

- **Recommendations**: Surveillance without adjuvant radiation therapy is a reasonable option for women without residual disease in the hysterectomy specimen and for women with grade 1 or 2 cancer and less than 50% myometrial invasion, especially when no other high-risk features are present. For women with grade 1 or 2 cancer and 50% or more myometrial invasion, or grade 3 cancer and less than 50% myometrial invasion, vaginal brachytherapy is as effective as pelvic radiation therapy at preventing vaginal recurrence and is preferred. Patients with grade 3 cancer and 50% or more myometrial invasion, or cervical stroma invasion, may benefit from pelvic radiation to prevent pelvic recurrence. For women with high-risk early-stage disease and advanced disease, the ASCO Endorsement Panel added qualifying statements to the ASTRO recommendations.

### Association between genetic polymorphisms and endometrial cancer risk: A systematic review [^1144Vv1z]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

Endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecological malignancy in the developed world. Its incidence has risen over the last two decades as a consequence of the ageing population, fewer hysterectomies for benign disease, and the obesity epidemic. In the United States, it is estimated that women have a 1 in 35 lifetime risk of endometrial cancer. In contrast to cancers of most other sites, cancer-specific mortality has risen by approximately 2% every year since 2008, related to the rapidly rising incidence.

Endometrial cancer has traditionally been classified into type I and type II based on morphology. The more common subtype, type I, is mostly comprised of endometrioid tumours and is oestrogen-driven, arises from a hyperplastic endometrium, presents at an early stage, and has an excellent 5-year survival rate. By contrast, type II includes non-endometrioid tumours, specifically serous, carcinosarcoma, and clear cell subtypes, which are biologically aggressive tumours with a poor prognosis that are often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Recent efforts have focused on a molecular classification system for more accurate categorisation of endometrial tumours into four groups with distinct prognostic profiles.

The majority of endometrial cancers arise through the interplay of familial, genetic, and lifestyle factors. Two inherited cancer predisposition syndromes, Lynch syndrome and the much rarer Cowden syndrome, substantially increase the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer, but these only account for around 3–5% of cases. Having first- or second-degree relatives with endometrial cancer further influences risk.

### Impact of adenomyosis on the prognosis of patients with endometrial cancer [^116L7igb]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Low credibility.

The study followed a protocol that a priori defined each review step and was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Each step was completed by two authors, and disagreements were resolved through discussion with the supervising authors.

Several searches were performed in six electronic databases: MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Library. These databases were searched from their inception to December 2020 using various combinations of the following keywords: "endometr", "cancer", "carcinoma", "neoplas", "malignancy", "tumour", "tumor", "adenomyosis", and "myometr". Additionally, the reference list from each eligible article was screened.

All peer-reviewed articles reporting data about the prognosis of endometrial cancer patients with and without coexistent adenomyosis were included. Exclusion criteria, defined a priori, comprised literature reviews, case reports, and studies with patient selection based on prognostic factors.

The Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) was used to assess the risk of bias within studies. Each included study was evaluated in six applicable domains related to risk of bias:

- **Aim**: If the study aim was clearly stated.
- **Patient selection**: If all consecutive patients were included.
- **Data collection**: If a study protocol was a priori defined and followed for data collection.
- **Study endpoints**: If clear endpoints were adopted.
- **Endpoint assessment**: If endpoints were assessed thoroughly.

### A prediction model based on clinical and histological features for predicting recurrence in patients with stage I-II endometrial cancer after surgical treatment [^1137RyBw]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2022). High credibility.

The study aimed to develop a prediction model combining clinical and histological features to predict recurrence in patients with stage I-II endometrial cancer (EC) after surgical treatment.

A total of 746 stage I-II EC patients who had received primary surgical treatment at Taizhou People's Hospital between 2014 and 2018 were included and randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 520) and a validation cohort (n = 226) at a 7:3 ratio. Clinical features such as age, body mass index, comorbidities, lymphadenectomy, and adjuvant treatment, and histological features such as histologic type, myometrial invasion, cervical stromal invasion, and expression levels of Ki67, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), whey acidic protein 4-disulfide core domain 2 (WFDC2), and p53 were used to develop a prediction model for EC recurrence in the training cohort using a multivariable Cox regression model. Model discrimination and calibration were further evaluated in the validation cohort.

EC recurrence was observed in 60 (11.54%) patients in the training cohort with a median length of follow-up of 39 months. Factors such as age, adjuvant treatment, histologic type, cervical stromal invasion, and expression levels of Ki67, ER, PR, and WFDC2 were significantly associated with EC recurrence based on univariable Cox regression analysis. After model selection by AIC in a stepwise algorithm, the final model, incorporating the above predictors, showed a C-index of 0.85 and fair calibration in the training cohort. In the validation cohort, the model still showed strong performance, although details are truncated.

### Multifactorial construction of low-grade and high-grade endometrial cancer recurrence prediction models [^116Un3MC]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

**Statistical analysis**: The software applications utilized included R software (version 3.6.1) and SPSS 25.0. Measurement data were presented as mean ± standard deviation and analyzed for intergroup differences using independent sample t-tests. Enumeration data were presented as number (%) and analyzed for intergroup differences using the χ² test. Abnormally distributed continuous variables were presented as the median (interquartile range). A p-value of 0.05 or less indicated a statistically significant difference. Variables with a p-value less than 0.05 in the univariate analysis were included in multivariate Cox analysis. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the prediction model, and the areas under curves (AUC) of the ROC were calculated to measure the model's discriminatory ability.

### Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in women with high-risk endometrial cancer (PORTEC-3): Patterns of recurrence and post-hoc survival analysis of a randomised phase 3 trial [^111gfZX9]. The Lancet. Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Better selection of women for adjuvant treatment might be achieved by integration of molecular characteristics. For intermediate-risk endometrial cancer, an improved risk assessment was reported with an integrated profile of clinicopathological and molecular risk factors. This approach is currently being tested in the randomised PORTEC-4a trial. A pilot study of the TransPORTEC Consortium showed that determination of the molecular subgroups, as described by the Cancer Genome Atlas Group, also improved risk assessment in high-risk endometrial cancer. Translational research is being conducted on tumour tissue samples donated by PORTEC-3 participants as part of an international collaboration. The molecular subgroups and additional molecular characteristics will be ascertained, and the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in relation to these factors will be explored.

In conclusion, this updated analysis of the PORTEC-3 trial shows improved 5-year overall and failure-free survival with chemoradiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone for women with high-risk endometrial cancer. The greatest absolute benefit for chemotherapy was observed in women with stage III disease, serous cancers, or both. Most recurrences were at distant sites, suggesting that new systemic treatment approaches are needed to improve survival outcomes. Molecular analysis has the potential to improve risk stratification and should be used to identify subgroups that can derive the greatest benefit from chemotherapy and to select patients for targeted therapies.

### Stratification of intermediate-risk endometrial cancer patients into groups at high risk or low risk for recurrence based on tumor gene expression profiles [^114METj5]. Clinical Cancer Research (2005). High credibility.

Endometrial cancers classified as "intermediate risk" based on clinical and/or pathologic features are associated with a 15% to 20% risk of recurrence. Here, we test whether global gene expression profiling can distinguish intermediate-risk tumors into high-risk and low-risk subgroups.

- **Experimental design**: Tumor specimens were obtained from 75 intermediate-risk endometrial cancer patients, 13 who had recurred and 62 who had not recurred, with a median follow-up of 24 months. Gene expression profiles were obtained using the Affymetrix U133A GeneChip oligonucleotide microarray. The genes most associated with the risk of recurrence were used to create a risk score using a leave-one-out cross-validation method and the univariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. Time-to-recurrence curves for the high-risk and low-risk subgroups were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the difference in time to recurrence between these two subgroups was tested using the log-rank test.

- **Results**: There was a significant difference in time to recurrence between high-risk and low-risk patients using risk scores as defined above (P = 0.04). The estimated hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) was 3.07 (1.00–9.43).

- **Conclusions**: Patients with intermediate-risk endometrial cancers identified as high risk for recurrence according to a gene expression-based risk score have a significantly increased risk for recurrence compared with those classified as low risk. These findings suggest that gene expression profiling can potentially contribute to the clinical classification and management of these patients.

### An update on post-treatment surveillance and diagnosis of recurrence in women with gynecologic malignancies: Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) recommendations [^111mzLs7]. Gynecologic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Gynecologic cancers account for approximately 12% of all new cancer cases in women and about 15% of all female cancer survivors. Continued advances within the field have resulted in improved long-term outcomes and a high rate of survivors. Therefore, determining the most cost-effective clinical surveillance for the detection of recurrence is critical. Unfortunately, there has been a paucity of research on the most effective strategies for surveillance after patients have achieved a complete response. Currently, most recommendations are based on retrospective studies and expert opinion.

Taking a thorough history, performing a detailed examination, and educating cancer survivors about concerning symptoms are the most effective methods for detecting most gynecologic cancer recurrences. There is very little evidence that routine cytology or imaging improves the ability to detect gynecologic cancer recurrence in a manner that will impact cure or response rates to salvage therapy. This article provides an update on surveillance for gynecologic cancer recurrence in women who have had a complete response to primary cancer therapy.

### Adjuvant radiotherapy for stage I endometrial cancer: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111xv292]. Annals of Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in stage I endometrial cancer following surgery remains unclear. The management for these patients varies widely, particularly in stage I patients with different risk factors. Using the methodology of the Cochrane Collaboration, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all known randomized controlled trials comparing adjuvant radiotherapy versus no radiotherapy following surgery for patients with stage I endometrial cancer.

The meta-analysis included four trials (three published and one unpublished) with a total of 1,770 patients. The addition of pelvic external beam radiotherapy to surgery reduced locoregional recurrence, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.28 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17–0.44, P < 0.00001], representing a 72% reduction in the risk of pelvic relapse (95% CI 56% to 83%) and an absolute risk reduction of 6% (95% CI 4% to 8%). However, this reduction in the risk of locoregional recurrence did not translate into a reduction in the risks of death from all causes, endometrial cancer death, or distant recurrence.

A subgroup analysis indicated a trend towards a reduction in the risks of death from all causes and endometrial cancer in patients with multiple high-risk factors (including stage 1c and grade 3). While external beam pelvic radiotherapy should be considered for patients with multiple high-risk features, it poses an inherent risk of damage and toxicity and should be avoided in stage I endometrial cancer patients with no high-risk factors.

### Multifactorial construction of low-grade and high-grade endometrial cancer recurrence prediction models [^112nGopY]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

The variables selected through single-factor Cox regression analysis in both groups were subjected to LASSO regression analysis. The non-zero coefficient variables obtained from this analysis were considered potential risk factors. For the low-grade group, the selected variables were FIGO stage, PR, LVSI, tumor size, and pelvic lymph node involvement. For the high-grade group, the selected variables were FIGO stage, L1CAM, LVSI, muscle infiltration, and pelvic lymph node involvement. The results of the LASSO regression cross-validation are shown in Figure 1.

- **LASSO regression analysis**. The variables from single-factor Cox regression analysis were analyzed, and the non-zero coefficient variables were identified as potential risk factors.

- **Construction of nomogram**. Using the "rms" package in R software, the variables selected from the regression analysis were considered as independent influencing factors to construct a nomogram for predicting the risk of EC recurrence. Each independent line segment represents different influencing factors, and the length represents the score. The sum of these scores calculates the predictive probability of endometrial cancer recurrence.

### Prognostic value and risk factors of peritoneal carcinomatosis recurrence for patients with endometrial cancer: A multicenter study from the FRANCOGYN group [^114WtVMf]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

The prognosis for patients with endometrial cancer (EC) and peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) recurrence has been understudied. This study aimed to determine specific risk factors and the prognosis of EC with PC recurrence (PCR) versus no PC recurrence (NPCR).

- **Methods**: Data from all patients with EC who received primary surgical treatment between January 2000 and February 2017 were abstracted from the French FRANCOGYN Research Group database. Clinical and pathological variables were compared between the two groups (PCR vs. NPCR). Multivariate analysis was performed to define prognostic factors for peritoneal recurrence. Overall survival (OS) of patients after recurrence was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method.

- **Results**: The study analyzed 1466 patients, and 257 of these patients (17.5%) experienced recurrence. At presentation, 63 of these patients had PC. International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages 3 and 4 were significantly associated with PCR compared to NPCR (odds ratio 2.24; 95% confidence interval 1.23–4.07; p = 0.008). The death rate for patients with PC was 47.6%, with a median survival of 12 months after diagnosis of recurrence. According to the histologic subtype, OS was 29 months (Q1-Q3, 13-NA) for endometrioid carcinomas, 7.5 months (Q1-Q3, 4–15) for serous carcinomas, and 10 months (Q1-Q3, 5–15) for clear cell carcinomas. Chemotherapy for the treatment of PCR was associated with improved overall survival after recurrence (OSAR; p = 0.0025).

- **Conclusion**: An initial advanced stage of EC is a risk factor for PCR. For women with PCR, a diagnosis of type 1 EC is particularly critical.

### Multifactorial construction of low-grade and high-grade endometrial cancer recurrence prediction models [^1134Qcnx]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). High credibility.

- **Area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC)**: To reflect the predictive performance of the model, the overall predictive ability was evaluated using AUC. AUC = 0.5 represents complete inconsistency, indicating no predictive function. AUC = 1 represents complete consistency with reality. AUC between 0.5 and 0.7 is considered low discrimination, AUC between 0.71 and 0.9 is considered moderate discrimination, and AUC above 0.9 is considered high discrimination. In this study, all AUC values in the two groups were close to 0.9, indicating strong predictive performance. RFS, recurrence-free survival.

- **Calibration plot**: The calibration degree of the prediction model is demonstrated by a calibration curve. The standard curve is a straight line with a slope of 1 passing through the origin. The closer the calibration curve is to the standard curve, the better the predictive ability of the column chart. This curve shows that the predicted risk of endometrial cancer recurrence by the model is consistent with the actual risk, indicating high accuracy. If the predicted value equals the actual value, the curve completely overlaps with the diagonal. If the predicted value is higher than the actual value, the curve is above the diagonal, indicating an overestimation of the risk.

### A predictive model for endometrial cancer recurrence based on molecular markers and clinicopathologic parameters: A double-center retrospective study [^117VDU7q]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to establish a predictive model for endometrial cancer (EC) recurrence based on commonly used molecular markers and clinicopathologic parameters.

This was a double-center retrospective study. The data of patients were retrospectively collected from two tertiary hospitals in Chongqing, China. The patients were divided into training and validation cohorts according to the ratio of 7:3. In the training cohort, the factors related to the recurrence were screened through uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis, and a nomogram was constructed based on this. Internal and external validation of the model was performed in two cohorts, respectively. In the training cohort, the optimal risk threshold of the model was determined by using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the maximum value of the Youden index.

A total of 1,348 patients were included, with 944 in the training cohort and 404 in the validation cohort. Multivariate analysis suggested that ER expression, P53 expression, and other clinicopathologic parameters were significantly related to recurrence. On this basis, a nomogram was constructed to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates. The model had good predictive accuracy in both cohorts through the validation. The ROC curve and Youden index suggested that the optimal risk threshold of the 3-year RFS rate predicted by the model was 0.83, and there was a significant survival difference between the high- and low-risk groups.

Compared to traditional predictive models, this model offers enhanced reliability and accuracy in forecasting endometrial cancer recurrence.

### Multifactorial construction of low-grade and high-grade endometrial cancer recurrence prediction models [^113eVK4Y]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

Despite the generally favorable prognosis of endometrial cancer (EC) under appropriate treatment, about one-third of these patients experience distant metastasis. Women with EC in the present study comprised two patient groups with distinct risk factors and long-term prognoses.

Research indicates that acquired factors such as obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome are closely associated with histologic grading, not only promoting the pathogenesis of the disease but also correlating with adverse outcomes. Estrogen, a known endometrial growth factor, is synthesized and released by the ovaries before menopause, whereas postmenopause, the adipose tissue becomes the primary source of estrogen. Hence, obesity is considered closely related to EC. Obesity-related insulin resistance is also a key factor associated with EC, and insulin resistance can lead to diabetes. Obesity and hypertension contribute to the development of insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes and promote the occurrence and progression of malignant tumors through mechanisms such as hyperinsulinemia and activation of the insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling pathway.

In this study, body mass index (BMI) and hypertension showed differences between the low-grade and high-grade groups, but the multifactorial analysis did not reveal a correlation between obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and EC recurrence. However, these three factors are still recognized as the triad of EC, requiring patient education to actively control weight, blood pressure, and blood sugar.

High expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) is directly related to less myometrial invasion and a more favorable prognosis in EC patients.
