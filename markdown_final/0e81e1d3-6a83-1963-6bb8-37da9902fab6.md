## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between atrial septal defect (ASD) and electrocardiogram (EKG/ECG) findings, including what ECG changes are expected, how sensitive or specific they are, how age modifies findings, and how to apply this clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of ASD and how it translates to ECG changes. Then, I should verify which ECG findings are most consistent and which are unreliable. Next, I will examine neonatal versus older pediatric/adult data to avoid overgeneralizing. After that, I need to check the diagnostic performance of specific ECG patterns. Finally, I will integrate guideline-based recommendations and outline a practical, risk-stratified approach to testing and follow-up, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology linking ASD to ECG changes. A left-to-right atrial shunt increases right atrial and right ventricular volume load, which over time can lead to right atrial enlargement, right ventricular hypertrophy, and conduction delays; these structural and electrical changes manifest on ECG as right axis deviation, right atrial enlargement (tall P waves), right ventricular hypertrophy patterns, and sometimes bundle branch block or prolonged PR, with arrhythmias becoming more likely as atrial stretch and fibrosis accrue [^335cf9de] [^88f0b728].

> Wait, let me verify which ECG findings are most consistently reported. In a large neonatal cohort with secundum ASDs, P-wave duration and PR interval were longer than matched controls even in the first week of life, and the QRS axis was more rightward during the first month, suggesting early electrical remodeling precedes overt structural change; these differences were statistically significant but small and within neonatal reference ranges, so I should be cautious not to overcall them as pathologic in isolation [^cee04e9e] [^0e2f4777] [^642a392d]. In older children and adults, right axis deviation, right ventricular hypertrophy patterns (such as rSR' in V1 or tall R in V1 with deep S in V6), and prolonged PR are commonly described, though sensitivity varies with age and shunt magnitude [^88f0b728] [^8dbd4fe2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any single ECG pattern. I initially thought an rSR' in V1 might be a reliable marker for ASD, but I should double-check that. A pediatric study found RSR' in V1 had only 36% sensitivity and 80% specificity for ASD, with a positive predictive value around 15%, so it performs poorly as a screening test and should not dictate whether to obtain an echocardiogram; absence of RSR' makes ASD less likely, but presence is not diagnostic [^51517dd5]. Similarly, in neonates, the observed P-wave and PR prolongation and rightward axis are subtle and not diagnostic on their own, reinforcing that ECG cannot reliably exclude or confirm ASD without imaging [^0e2f4777].

> I need to ensure I distinguish neonatal from post-neonatal patterns. In neonates, a rightward QRS axis is normal due to fetal circulation, and the normal postnatal leftward shift happens more slowly in ASD, which can make the axis appear "relatively rightward" compared with controls; this relative difference emerges by weeks 2–4 and should be interpreted in that developmental context rather than as standalone right-axis deviation [^8d66f096]. In older children and adults, true right-axis deviation and RVH patterns become more specific for right-sided volume overload, though even then, ECG sensitivity for RVH remains limited and must be integrated with clinical and echocardiographic data [^8dbd4fe2].

> Next, I should review how ECG fits into diagnostic pathways. Guidelines consistently position echocardiography as the definitive modality for ASD diagnosis and surveillance, with ECG serving as an adjunct to document rhythm, conduction, and ventricular load rather than to establish the diagnosis; this is reflected in pediatric and adult congenital heart disease guidance and in ASD-specific imaging recommendations [^0f113bde] [^94d149a5] [^1b23a7ba]. Practically, ECG is useful to screen for arrhythmias, assess PR interval, and look for RVH patterns, but a normal ECG does not exclude hemodynamically significant ASD, and an abnormal ECG should prompt, not replace, echocardiography [^0f113bde] [^94d149a5].

> Let me consider special contexts and follow-up. In adults with unrepaired or repaired ASD, periodic ECG surveillance is recommended to detect atrial arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or flutter, which are more common with longstanding right-sided volume overload; device closure reduces markers of atrial arrhythmia vulnerability over time, but ECG monitoring remains part of longitudinal care in higher-risk patients [^0f113bde] [^bcb2af58]. In pediatric patients with suspected ASD, reliance on classic physical and ECG findings risks underdiagnosis, so a low threshold for echocardiography is prudent when clinical suspicion exists despite subtle or normal ECGs [^3de4ae4e].

> I should double-check the bottom line and make sure I'm not overstating ECG's role. ECG in ASD typically shows rightward axis, right atrial enlargement, right ventricular hypertrophy patterns, and sometimes conduction delays, but these findings are neither sensitive nor specific enough to diagnose or exclude ASD reliably; neonates can show subtle P-wave and PR prolongation and a blunted leftward axis shift, yet these are not diagnostic, and ECG should be interpreted alongside clinical context and echocardiography rather than used as a standalone screening test [^cee04e9e] [^51517dd5] [^0f113bde] [^94d149a5].

---

In atrial septal defect (ASD), the ECG typically shows **right axis deviation** and **incomplete right bundle branch block** (rSR' in V1) due to right ventricular volume overload [^8dbd4fe2]. Additional findings may include **prolonged PR interval**, **right atrial enlargement** (tall P waves in II), and **right ventricular hypertrophy** (tall R in V1, deep S in V6) in larger shunts [^88f0b728]. These changes reflect right-sided volume overload and are less pronounced in infancy, becoming more evident with age and larger shunts [^8d66f096]. ECG is not diagnostic for ASD but helps screen for right-sided overload and arrhythmias; **echocardiography is required** for definitive diagnosis and management [^94d149a5].

## Typical ECG findings in ASD

| **Ecg finding** | **Description** | **Pathophysiology** |
|-|-|-|
| Right axis deviation | QRS axis > 90° | Right ventricular volume overload from left-to-right shunt [^335cf9de] |
| Incomplete right bundle branch block (IRBBB) | rSR' pattern in V1, QRS < 120 ms | Delayed right ventricular conduction due to volume overload [^notfound] |
| Prolonged PR interval | PR > 200 ms | Atrial conduction delay from right atrial enlargement [^88f0b728] |
| Right atrial enlargement (P pulmonale) | Tall, peaked P waves in II, III, aVF | Right atrial enlargement from volume overload [^notfound] |
| Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) | Tall R in V1, deep S in V6, R/S ratio > 1 in V1 | Chronic right ventricular volume overload [^8dbd4fe2] |
| Atrial arrhythmias | Atrial fibrillation, flutter, or tachycardia | Atrial enlargement and fibrosis from chronic overload [^335cf9de] |

---

## ECG findings by ASD subtype

- **Secundum ASD**: Most common; IRBBB, right axis deviation, and prolonged PR are typical [^notfound].
- **Primum ASD**: Often shows left axis deviation and prolonged PR due to atrioventricular conduction delay [^notfound].
- **Sinus venosus ASD**: May show right axis deviation and RVH, often with arrhythmias [^notfound].

---

## Age-related differences in ECG findings

In neonates and infants, ECG changes are often **subtle or absent** because pulmonary vascular resistance remains high, limiting shunt flow [^8d66f096]. As pulmonary resistance falls, right-sided volume overload increases, making ECG changes more apparent with age [^8d66f096].

---

## Clinical significance of ECG findings

ECG findings in ASD reflect **hemodynamic consequences** of the shunt and help identify patients who may benefit from further evaluation. However, ECG alone cannot diagnose ASD or quantify shunt size; echocardiography is essential for definitive diagnosis and management planning [^94d149a5].

---

## Limitations of ECG in ASD

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: ECG has limited sensitivity and specificity for ASD; normal ECG does not exclude ASD [^51517dd5].
- **Non-specific findings**: Many ECG changes are non-specific and can occur in other cardiac conditions [^8dbd4fe2].
- **Age dependence**: ECG findings are less pronounced in infants and young children [^8d66f096].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Screening tool**: ECG is useful for screening and identifying patients with possible ASD, especially when combined with clinical findings [^notfound].
- **Follow-up**: ECG is valuable for monitoring disease progression and detecting arrhythmias in patients with known ASD [^0f113bde].
- **Definitive diagnosis**: Echocardiography is required for definitive diagnosis, assessment of shunt size, and management planning [^94d149a5].

---

ECG in ASD typically shows right axis deviation, IRBBB, prolonged PR, right atrial enlargement, and RVH, reflecting right-sided volume overload. These findings vary with age and shunt size, and **echocardiography is required** for definitive diagnosis and management [^94d149a5].

### Electrocardiographic characteristics in 438 neonates with atrial septal defects [^cee04e9e]. Pediatric Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmias and electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities are common among patients with atrial septal defects (ASDs). We studied a large cohort of neonates with ASDs to investigate whether ECG abnormalities are present at this early stage or develop later, secondary to hemodynamic changes. We analyzed the echocardiograms and ECGs from the Copenhagen Baby Heart Study, a population-based cohort study. We compared ECG characteristics of 438 neonates with secundum ASDs to 1314 matched controls. In subgroup analyses, we investigated whether electrocardiographic characteristics were associated with age at examination. Neonates with ASDs (median age, 11 days; males, 51%) had longer P-wave durations (58 vs. 56 ms, p<0.001), PR intervals (100 vs. 96 ms, p<0.001), and a more rightward-shifted QRS axis (116 vs. 114 degrees, p=0.032) compared to controls (median age, 10 days; males, 51%). There were no differences between cases and controls in the P-wave area, amplitude, or axis. Subgroup analyses showed that the differences in P-wave duration and PR interval were present in neonates examined in the first week after birth. The difference in the QRS axis was not found in neonates examined this early but was found in neonates examined at age two to four weeks. In conclusion, ASDs are associated with ECG changes from the neonatal phase. The P-wave duration and PR interval are longer in neonates with ASDs when compared to controls as early as the first week after birth, indicating that these changes are not purely secondary, but that neonates with an ASD have altered cardiac electrical activity.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02753348 (April 27, 2016).

### Electrocardiographic characteristics in 438 neonates with atrial septal defects [^0e2f4777]. Pediatric Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The differences in electrocardiographic parameters between newborns with ASD and controls found in this study are relatively small in absolute numbers. Electrocardiographic values for neonates with ASD in our study cohort are still within age-specific reference values. Hence, we are careful not to describe the PR interval and P -wave duration as prolonged, but solely conclude that these parameters are longer in neonates with ASD than in matched controls. Likewise, the QRS axis is not pathologically rightwards shifted in our cohort but is still significantly more rightward shifted in neonates with ASD than in the control group and remains so during the first month. Even if the differences found in this study are relatively small, they do reach convincing statistical significance due to the large sample size. A strength of our study is that we present data on the largest population-based cohort to date systematically assessed for ASD and thus are aware of the diagnosis of ASD this early after birth. The findings cannot be applied directly to a clinical context, but our results contribute with new knowledge on the electroanatomic understanding of ASDs.

Conclusion

Neonates with an ASD had a longer duration of the P -wave and a longer PR interval than controls; the difference was found as early as in the first week after birth. The QRS axis of neonates with an ASD remained more rightward shifted during the first four weeks of life than the QRS axis of controls. Our findings suggest that the electrical cardiac system in patients with ASDs is abnormal even before the shunt leads to significant structural alterations. This raises the question, of whether the ECG changes can be described as secondary to hemodynamic changes in patients with ASD, or if the altered electrical activity is an independent disease pattern in ASD. Arrhythmias contribute significantly to the morbidity in patients with ASD, and even though we miss the link between these early electrocardiographic abnormalities and late arrhythmias, our results emphasize the hypothesis that arrhythmias in patients with ASD have a multifactorial etiology.

Discussion

We investigated a large population-based cohort of neonates who have all undergone echocardiography and electrocardiography during the first month after birth and where echocardiograms have been systematically assessed for ASDs using a validated algorithm. Our results show that neonates with ASDs had a longer P -wave duration and a longer PR interval than controls. These differences were already seen during the first week of life. Also, neonates with ASD had a QRS axis that was more rightward shifted than in controls, but this was not present until the second to fourth week after birth.

P -wave variables in patients with atrial septal defects differ from healthy controls, with longer P -wave duration being a common finding. However, most studies include only adult patients or patients who have undergone either surgical or percutaneous closure of the ASD. In 47 pediatric patients with ASDs (mean age, 5.3 years; range, 1 month–17 years), right ventricular conduction delay was seen in 78% and right-axis deviation in 58% of the children. The P -wave reflects atrial conduction; and prolongation of the P -wave has been shown to be associated with arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation. The pathophysiology behind the alterations in atrial conduction seen in ASD patients has been subject to debate. Altered atrial conduction due to atrial dilatation caused by left-to-right shunting has been the predominant hypothesis but emerging evidence points toward abnormal electrical conduction as an independent primary disease mechanism in ASD patients. Thilén et al. found prolonged P -wave duration in adult patients with ASD compared to controls without differences in right or left atrial size, suggesting a conduction delay in ASD patients irrespective of atrial morphological changes. O’Neill et al. found a greater burden of atrial fibrosis in patients with a secundum ASD and found especially right atrial fibrosis to be associated with the presence of arrhythmias in these patients.

### Atrial septal defect: spectrum of care [^9bcf17c5]. Pediatric Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a common congenital heart defect. Variability in management of this lesion exists among clinicians. A review of the literature reveals that there is lack of standard guidelines for the evaluation and management of patients with different types of ASDs. This survey-based study was conducted to test the uniformity of diagnostic and therapeutic approach to management of children with secundum, sinus venosus, and primum ASDs. Survey questionnaires were prepared to include questions regarding follow-up, diagnosis, and therapeutic intervention of different types and sizes of ASDs. Questions addressed follow-up visitations, type and frequency of investigative studies, pharmacological therapy, and choice of repair method. Surveys were sent out to all pediatric cardiology academic programs in the United States (n=48) and randomly selected international programs from Europe, Asia, and Australia (n=19). A total of 23 programs (34%) responded to the survey (15 from the United States and 8 internationally). A separate questionnaire was prepared for secundum, primum, and sinus venosus ASD. In each questionnaire, lesion types were subdivided into small, moderate, and large defect sizes to address differences of management approaches to each defect type and size. Results indicate that in secundum ASD, most participants use size of the defect and/or evidence of right-sided volume overload as criteria for defining small, moderate, and large defects. Frequency of follow-up does not vary with the type of lesion but is more frequent with larger defects. Most participants see patients with small defects at intervals of 6 months to 1 year and those with large defects at 3- to 6-month intervals. Age of patient and presence of symptoms determined the frequency of follow-up across all defects. Echocardiography was the most frequently used investigative modality in all defect sizes and types during follow-up visits (used by >80% for follow-up), followed by electrocardiography (ECG). There is a striking preference for the use of pharmacological therapy in primum ASD compared with secundum and sinus venosus ASD. The timing of repair was mainly dependent on patient age and symptomatology in different defects, with the presence of associated anomalies contributing to that in primum and sinus venosus ASD. Most participants use percutaneous approach to close secundum ASD (either as a first choice or as one of two choices depending on the presence of certain features). Before repair, participants use MRI or cardiac catheterization to fully evaluate a secundum ASD if it is large. These investigative modalities are not commonly used in primum and sinus venosus ASD. There is agreement on postoperative follow-up in different types of defects, with most participants continuing follow-up indefinitely, especially in larger defects.

### Electrocardiographic characteristics in 438 neonates with atrial septal defects [^8d66f096]. Pediatric Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our results show that the P -wave duration and the PR interval are longer than in matched controls as early as the first week of life. His bundle electrograms have documented prolonged PR intervals in children with ASD, which is also in accordance with our findings.

The QRS axis on the ECG is reflecting the average direction of the ventricular depolarization and right-axis deviation is one of the typical findings on the ECG in patients with ASD. In neonates, however, a rightward-shifted QRS axis is normal. During the fetal state, the pulmonary vascular resistance is high, and the right ventricle is the dominant ventricle. After birth, the systemic vascular resistance rises while the pulmonary vascular resistance falls, making the left ventricle gradually more dominant. A substudy from the CBHS showed the gradual leftward shift of the QRS axis in neonates during this transition. Interestingly, we found that the QRS axis in neonates with ASD changed less toward the left compared to controls during the first four weeks after birth. This could indicate that the shunt across the atrial septum in neonates with ASD has implications on either the electrical activity or the structure of the ventricles at this early stage.

In the subgroup of neonates examined at age two to four weeks, we found a higher maximum amplitude of the S -wave in V6 in the ASD group compared to controls. Also, the maximum amplitude of the R wave in V1 in the ASD group was higher than in controls, though not statistically significant. Both these ECG findings are known to be associated with right ventricular hypertrophy. We also found a longer QRS duration in the ASD group at age two to four weeks. Thus, taken together, our findings indicate that the ASD has implications on the right ventricle after only a few weeks of postnatal circulation. In the subgroup examined at age two to four weeks, the heart rate is higher in the ASD group compared to controls. This could physiologically support the assumption that the ASD has implications on cardiac function this early: increased chronotropy maintains cardiac output despite a left-to-right shunt across the ASD.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Atrial septal defect (ASD) follow-up after device closure—follow-up requires clinical assessment of symptoms and echocardiographic surveillance for device position, residual shunting, and complications; the frequency of echocardiographic follow-up is usually at 24 hours, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year and at regular intervals thereafter. Pericardial effusions and cardiac tamponade may occur up to several weeks after surgical repair and should be evaluated before hospital discharge and at early postoperative visits. Patients and their primary care physicians should be instructed to report fever or unusual symptoms in the first weeks after surgery. Assessment of pulmonary pressure, RV function, and residual atrial shunting should also be made, and clinical and electrocardiogram (ECG) surveillance for recurrent or new-onset arrhythmias is an important feature. Periodic long-term clinical follow-up is required in adults with prior repair and specified comorbidities, whereas patients closed in childhood are generally free of late complications.

Limitations and Future Directions

We acknowledge several limitations of this work. First, while the model performs well across multiple clinical settings internally, true external validation is warranted. Second, only two example thresholds were used to detect disease. Further consideration is required to weigh the impact of resultant false positives (which may lead to unnecessary referrals to echocardiogram) and false negatives (which may lead to clinical consequences of missed ASD2). Third, our database does not facilitate investigation into model performance by ASD2 size. Finally, while saliency mapping provides insight into model behavior, its limitations must be noted.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the promise of AI-pECG to inexpensively screen and diagnose ASD2 in pediatric patients, which may serve as a potential cost saving tool to avoid unnecessary echocardiograms. This tool may facilitate prioritization of patients for future interventions/studies and provide meaningful insight into novel ECG waveforms suggestive of ASD2. Future multicenter validation and prospective trials to inform clinical decision making are warranted.

Ebstein’s anomaly—clinical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and chest x-ray features: Patients with mild disease may show minimal findings other than a murmur; the jugular venous pressure is often normal even with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) due to a large compliant right atrium, central cyanosis may occur from a right-to-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or atrial septal defect (ASD), the first sound is loud with 1 or more systolic clicks, and the murmur of TR is holosystolic at the lower left sternal border and increases on inspiration. Characteristic ECG findings include very tall and peaked P waves (“Himalayan P waves”), a QR pattern often seen in lead V1 that may extend to V4, and QRS duration that is usually prolonged with a right bundle-branch block pattern that is often “splintered,” followed by inverted T waves. Chest x-ray may be nearly normal in mild cases but in more severe cases shows severe enlargement, with right atrial enlargement prominent with a “globular” cardiac contour and clear lung fields, and the great arteries are usually small with an aortic root that is inconspicuous or absent.

Statistical Analyses

Categorical data are presented as absolute numbers (percentages) and continuous data are presented as median values and interquartile ranges (IQR). Comparisons between groups (neonates with ASDs and matched controls) were performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous ECG variables and by chi-square test for categorical variables. Subgroup analyses were performed according to age at examination; 0–7 days old (week 0–1) and 8–30 days old (week 2–4). R statistical software v. 1.2.1335 (Boston, MA, USA) was used for statistical analyses and for matching cases with controls. A p -value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Presentation of atrial septal defect in the pediatric population [^3de4ae4e]. Pediatric Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Our recent experience indicates that patients with a hemodynamically significant atrial septal defect secundum (ASD2) do not necessarily present with classic physical and electrocardiographic (ECG) findings. The purpose of the study was to review the records of patients either receiving a catheter device or undergoing surgical repair for the closure of ASD2 to determine their initial physical and ECG findings. Therefore, we did a retrospective review of 47 consecutive patients who had echocardiographic evidence of a hemodynamically significant isolated ASD2 and who underwent ASD2 closure. Of these 47 patients, the presenting complaints were murmur (n = 36), chest pain (n = 6), seizure (n = 1), stroke (n = 1), syncope (n = 1), Kawasaki's disease (n = 1), and cardiomegaly (n = 1). Charts were reviewed for the evaluation of four abnormal physical findings: hyperactive right ventricular impulse, split fixed second heart sound, systolic and diastolic flow murmurs; and three ECG abnormalities: right axis deviation, right atrial enlargement, and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. In all, 30% of patients had either one or no typical physical findings, 18% had normal ECG findings, and 7% had no physical or ECG findings. On physical examination and ECG, the abnormalities due to ASD2 may be too subtle to detect. Although it is well known that variations can occur in the clinical signs and symptoms typical of ASD2, dependence on classical physical and or ECG findings may result in the underdiagnosis of a significant number of patients.

### The poor performance of RSR' pattern on electrocardiogram lead V1 for detection of secundum atrial septal defects in children [^51517dd5]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the accuracy of RSR' patterns in lead V1 (RSR'-V1) in diagnosing atrial septal defects (ASDs) in children.

Study Design

Children who underwent an electrocardiogram (ECG) during 2010 were divided into 2 ECG groups: RSR'-V1 and normal (no RSR'-V1). Children who underwent an echocardiogram during 2010 were also divided into an ASD group and a normal echocardiogram group. The 4 groups were matched in a 2 × 2 table format where the RSR'-V1 was the "test" and ASD was the "disease." Sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values, and pre/post-test probabilities were calculated.

Results

There were 4658 ECG studies included in the analysis: 836 had RSR'-V1 and 3822 were normal without RSR'-V1. Of 4935 echocardiographic studies analyzed, 329 had an ASD and 4606 were normal; 1363 patients had both studies done during the study period. The ECG sensitivity for diagnosing an ASD was 36.1%, specificity was 80%, positive predictive value was 14.7%, and negative predictive value was 92.9% with an overall accuracy of 76.2%. Patients with ASD and RSR'-V1 were significantly older than patients with ASD and no RSR'-V1 pattern.

Conclusion

RSR'-V1 is a poor screening test for the detection of ASD. It should not change the clinical suspicion or the decision to obtain an echocardiogram. Older children without RSR'-V1 on ECG are unlikely to have an ASD.

Atrial septal defect (ASD)—genetic transmission and family evaluation indicate that the risk of transmission of congenital heart disease (CHD) to offspring of women with sporadic ASD is estimated at 8% to 10%, and both secundum and primum ASDs are associated with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome); because of the possibility of familial occurrence, a careful family history should be taken in patients with ASD, and parents and offspring should be evaluated clinically for possible septal defect, conduction disturbances, and skeletal anomalies. Genetic syndromes with skeletal abnormalities associated with ASD include a variety of heart-hand syndromes, of which Holt-Oram syndrome is best known.

With regards to the cardiological features of the syndrome (Table 5), pulmonary stenosis was the most frequent abnormality since it was identified in 11 children (34%). Signs of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) were found in 3 patients (9%): one of them presented an obstructive form with a RAF1 mutation, which is known for being associated with this feature. Atrial septal defect (ASD) and ventricular septal defect (VSD) were found in 5 patients each (16%), as well as mitral regurgitation. As for the EKG characteristics, right axis deviation was identified in 13 patients (41%) and left axis deviation in 2 (6%). Right branch block was present in 6 patients (19%), first-degree atrioventricular block in 5 (16%) and repolarization abnormalities in 5 (16%). The association between pulmonary stenosis at the echocardiogram and right axial deviation was statistically significant (p 0.02). Overall, we found no statistically significant associations between the cardiological features of the patients and the underlying genetic mutations.

Previously unreported clinical findings.

In addition to the previously described features, which are already known as part of the Noonan spectrum, we identified various clinical manifestation that were not associated with this genetic condition before (Table 6). The most frequent of them were winged shoulder blades, hypotonia and feet abnormalities, which were identified in 3 subjects each (9%).

Angiomas, single atrioventricular valve, clinodactyly and Arnold Chiari malformation were identified in 2 individuals (6%). Finally, high arched palate, corpus callosum agenesis, epilepsy, erythromelalgia, Raynaud’s phenomenon, choledochal cysts, laryngomalacia, microcephaly, umbilical hernia, ischemic heart disease and osteopenia have been found in one patient (3%) each.

### The findings of preoperative cardiac screening studies in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis [^172c6856]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

We sought to evaluate findings of screening cardiac studies in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients by reviewing the echocardiograms and electrocardiograms (EKGs) performed at their preoperative evaluation for spinal fusion.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of all surgical AIS patients from 2000 to 2007 was completed (n=212). Patients with neuromuscular scoliosis, known connective tissue disease, or known/suspected cardiac disease were excluded. In presurgical screening, 12 lead EKG, 2dimensional-Doppler, and M-mode echocardiograms were analyzed.

Results

A total of 154 (73%) female and 58 (27%) male patients (aged 12 to 18 y, avg: 14.8 y) were analyzed. EKG findings, 180/212 (85%), were within normal limits. Twenty-eight of 212 (13%) patients were found to have normal variant readings. Four of 212 (2%) patients met criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy on EKG, but were subsequently found to have normal echocardiograms. Significant echocardiogram findings revealed 2 (0.94%) subjects with atrial septal defects (ASDs) (that delayed surgery) and 7 (3.3%) subjects with aortic root/valve abnormalities.

Conclusions

In our cohort of preoperative AIS patients, cardiac abnormalities ranged from mild to severe, and in 2 cases, affected the surgical timing. Novel findings of aortic abnormalities were identified in 3.3% of patients. In a study which examined the prevalence of heart disease in randomly selected healthy adolescents with previously unknown cardiac disease (Steinberger), there was a rate of 3.6% (13/357) of cardiac anomalies. Of note, only 0.6% had aortic root/valve findings. The results of our retrospective review indicate that EKG does not provide significant information compared with echocardiogram as part of the preoperative evaluation of asymptomatic and otherwise healthy patients with AIS who are undergoing spinal deformity surgery. However, use of the echocardiogram may be appropriate for the diagnosis of previously unknown cardiac abnormalities in this population, as aortic root/valve abnormalities seem to be unique findings in these patients.

### Guidelines for the echocardiographic assessment of atrial septal defect and patent foramen ovale: from the American Society of Echocardiography and society for cardiac angiography and interventions [^598651dd]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Atrial septal defect (ASD) and patent foramen ovale (PFO)—epidemiology and burden—Atrial septal communications account for approximately 6%–10% of congenital heart defects, with an incidence of 1 in 1,500 live births. The atrial septal defect (ASD) is among the most common acyanotic congenital cardiac lesions, occurring in 0.1% of births and accounting for 30%–40% of clinically important intracardiac shunts in adults. The patent foramen ovale (PFO) is more common and is present in greater than 20%–25% of adults. The clinical syndromes associated with ASD and PFO are extremely variable and represent a significant health burden that spans pediatric and adult medicine, neurology, and surgery.

Atrial septal defect (ASD)—clinical course of unrepaired lesions explains that left‑to‑right shunt produces right ventricular (RV) volume overload and pulmonary overcirculation; large shunts can cause frequent pulmonary infections, fatigue, exercise intolerance, palpitations, and right‑sided heart failure; atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and sick sinus syndrome commonly result from longstanding right‑sided volume and pressure overload; large shunts are accompanied by flow‑related pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and pulmonary vascular obstructive disease may develop later than in high‑pressure shunts such as ventricular septal defect (VSD) or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA); paradoxical embolism is a risk for all defect sizes; adults most commonly present with dyspnea and palpitations, or with findings such as cardiomegaly on chest x‑ray, a louder murmur during pregnancy, new atrial flutter/fibrillation, or a paradoxical embolic event.

### Impact of transcatheter device closure of atrial septal defect on atrial arrhythmias propensity in young adults [^bcb2af58]. Pediatric Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a condition that requires early intervention because of the consequences over the right-side heart. Chronic atrial stretching promotes atrial conduction delay and the imbalance of the conduction homogeneity, which lead to the propensity to atrial arrhythmias (AA). We aim to evaluate the impact of transcatheter closure of ASD on atrial vulnerability markers leading to late AA in young adults. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal study in one hundred patients (mean age 25.2±5.4 years) who underwent transcatheter closure of ASD at Cardiocentro Pediátrico William Soler. P-wave maximum (P max ) and P-wave dispersion (P d ) were analyzed from 12-lead electrocardiogram. Left-side and right-side intraatrial and interatrial electromechanical delay (EMD) were measured with tissue Doppler imaging. Both electrocardiographic and echocardiographic analyses were performed during the study period. Compared to baseline, there was a significant reduction in P max (p≤0.001) and P d (p≤0.001) after 3 months of procedure. All atrial electromechanical coupling parameters significantly reduced at 6 months of ASD closure and tend to remain at lower values till the last evaluation. Over 9.2±1.6 years of follow-up, 15 subjects (15%) developed AA, of which intraatrial reentrant tachycardia (66.6%) became the main rhythm disturbance. Intra-right atrial EMD≥16 ms (HR 4.08, 95% CI 1.15-14.56; p=0.03) and P d 45 ms (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.06-2.59; p=0.02) were identified as predictors of late AA. Transcatheter device closure of ASD in young adults promotes a significant reduction of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic markers of AA vulnerability, which persist during the long-term follow-up. Nevertheless, P d and interatrial EMD were identified as independent risk factors of AA.

### Characteristics of secundum atrial septal defects not percutaneously closed [^7f183fc8]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to review our single center experience with secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) device closure, evaluating the incidence and morphological characteristics where percutaneous closure was thought inappropriate.

Material and Methods

All children assessed as unsuitable for transcatheter device closure were reviewed. Data collected included: demographics, defect morphology by echocardiography or at cardiac catheterization and defect size focusing on the reasons for procedural deferral.

Results

Between January 2002 and December 2010, 639 children underwent closure of an isolated secundum ASD: 82 children (13%) where referred directly to surgery, 43 (6%) were thought unsuitable for device closure at the time of catheterization and underwent subsequent surgery and the remaining 514 (81%) underwent successful device closure including 2 on a second attempt. The reasons for pursuing a surgical closure (n = 124, mean age = 5.7 years; range: 0.6-17.4 years; defect diameter/body weight = 1.39) included: the need for a device thought too large for implantation versus the child's size (n = 51), defects with deficient rim(s) (n = 48), multiple defects (n = 7), defects sized >36 mm (n = 2), malposition (n = 2), ECG changes (n = 3), aneurysmal IAS (n = 2), sinus venosus (n = 2), or others (n = 7).

Conclusion

The reasons for deferring transcatheter device closure of a secundum ASD are diverse, not only isolated rim deficiencies but the requirements of large implants, malposition, arrhythmias, and lack of hemodynamic need are influential components in clinical decision making.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) anatomy and imaging—lesion spectrum and optimal views are outlined: “Atrioventricular septal defect, also called AV canal defect, results from incomplete development of the endocardial cushions, leading to defects in atrial and ventricular septa as well as the AV valves,” and “There can be morphologic variability at many levels, therefore this lesion comprises an anatomic spectrum that can range from partial to complete forms.” Variability includes “a) size or extent of deficiency in the primum atrial septum; b) size or extent of deficiency in the ventricular septum, here called the ‘ventricular component’; c) degree of commonality or anatomic separation of the left- and right-sided AV valves; d) AV valve morphology and function; and e) degree of commitment of the AV valves to the ventricles.” Imaging guidance states “The primum ASD, which is present in almost all AVSDs, is best outlined when the atrial septum is perpendicular to the transducer and can be accomplished from the ME 4-Ch view with slight clockwise rotation,” and “The ventricular component is best viewed from the ME 4-Ch view in systole.” Additional anatomic relations note “When the common AV valve junction is shared between both ventricles, the aorta is unwedged and positioned more anterosuperiorly instead of between the normal mitral and tricuspid valves.” Partial forms are characterized as “Partial AVSD, where there is a defect in the primum atrial septum but no discernible ventricular component, will have a lack of AV valve offset and a cleft in the anterior leaflet of the left AV valve, which can be visualized in the TG BAS SAX view,” and LVOT evaluation uses “The ME LAX and DTG 5-Ch views are used to demonstrate the LVOT and confirm the separation between the left AV valve inlet and the aortic outlet,” with a caveat that “Accessory tissue from the superior bridging leaflet may cause LVOT obstruction.”

### Long-term outcome after surgical closure of atrial septal defect in childhood with extensive assessment including MRI measurement of the ventricles [^228141d6]. Pediatric Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Surgical closure of the secundum type of atrial septal defect (ASD) in childhood leads to excellent survival. However, relevant morbidity has been reported. Transcatheter closure of these defects has now become an alternative approach. To compare the results of the two different interventions, reliable data are needed on the long-term morbidity after defect closure with both methods. Patients were evaluated after a minimum of 10 years after surgical closure of an ASD in childhood. Assessment included analysis of perioperative data, interview, clinical examination, electrocardiogram, (ECG), 24-hour ECG, ergometry, chest radiograph, echocardiography, and MRI. A total of 66 patients underwent operation between 1971 and 1986 at our institution. Forty-eight of them (73%) were interviewed and 38 (58%) participated fully in the study program. Eighteen (27%) either refused to participate or were lost to follow-up. There were no substantial residual disorders, such as arrhythmias, right-sided heart dilatation, pulmonary hypertension, or reduced work capacity. Surgical closure of an ASD in childhood has an excellent long-term outcome. Surgical closure is thus the standard against which transcatheter closure needs to be measured.

Recommended reported findings for structural abnormalities include lipomatous hypertrophy, aneurysmal septum, bowing, patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect. For interatrial septal communications, report presence or absence and description, and for devices, describe atrial septal device type and size (if known) with any pathologic findings including device malposition, peri-device leak, or thrombus if adequately visualized. For shunts, report presence or absence, direction, location (intracardiac vs intrapulmonary), and quantify if feasible including Qp:Qs, and specify the detection technique such as Color flow Doppler or agitated saline.

Atrial septal defect (ASD)—key forms and anatomic variants include that ostium secundum ASD occurs as a deficiency in septum primum and is the most common form of ASD and is often amenable to percutaneous transcatheter closure, with defects that can vary in shape and can be elliptical or round and can contain multiple fenestrations. Ostium primum ASDs occur as a result of a failure of fusion of the endocardial cushions and are within the spectrum of AV septal defects. Sinus venosus defects are not true ASDs and result from the absence of sinus venosus septum between right upper pulmonary veins and SVC (SVC type) or right middle and lower pulmonary veins and RA (IVC type). Coronary sinus defects for unroofed coronary sinus are not true ASDs and permit a left-to-right shunt from the LA to coronary sinus to the RA.

### Key communication concepts (...) [^c3c1bb2f]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Don't order annual electrocardiograms or any other cardiac screening for low-risk patients without symptoms. Sources: US Preventive Services Task Force Recent guidelines from the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Cardiology Foundation, and the American Heart Association advise against exercise electrography in asymptomatic, low-risk individuals. The AHA compiled data, including information from the Framingham Heart Study, to determine appropriate use of cardiac screening tests by looking at prognostic considerations. Those risk factors include gender and age with one or more risk factors. The greater the number of risk factors a patient has, the more likely it is that the patient will benefit from screening.

If a patient’s risk is less than 10 percent, screening is not recommended. The USPSTF reviewed new evidence regarding the reduction of risk for coronary heart disease events in asymptomatic adults by screening with electrocardiography compared with not screening and issued the following recommendations: The USPSTF recommends against screening with resting or exercise ECG for the prediction of CHD events in asymptomatic adults at low risk for CHD events. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening with resting or exercise ECG for the prediction of CHD events in asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk for CHD events. This recommendation is provided solely for informational purposes and is not intended as a substitute for consultation with a medical professional.

Patients with any specific questions about this recommendation or their individual situation should consult their physician. .

Ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD)—amenability to closure and anatomic variants are described: an ostium secundum ASD is often amenable to percutaneous transcatheter closure, but a rare form occurs when the superior limbic band of the septum secundum is absent, creating a communication that is “high” in the septum near the superior vena cava (SVC); these defects should not be confused with the sinus venosus defect of the SVC type and the high ostium secundum ASD is not associated with anomalous pulmonary venous return. An absence of the septum secundum can also occur with left-sided juxtaposition of the atrial appendages, a condition in which both atrial appendages lie beside each other and to one side of the great arterial vessels, commonly associated with significant congenital heart disease including transposition of the great vessels; although these defects do not involve the vena cavae, atrioventricular (AV) valves, pulmonary veins, or coronary sinus, it is important to recognize proximity to surrounding structures when considering catheter-based device closure.

### Immediate effect of physical activity on the autonomic nervous system in individuals with autism spectrum disorders of different age groups: a randomised trial [^3558ec60]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

These results might be attributed to the majority of children with ASD who have congenital heart diseases (CHD) in the form of atrial or ventricular septal defect.This atrial or ventricular septal defect decreases cardiac output which causes the heart to work less efficiently. Therefore, the HR response to physical activity may be affected to compensate for the weak response of the heart. Consequently, the usual recovery after stopping physical activity would be affected to return the heart to a normal state in the shortest possible time.The abnormal response in HR leads to abnormal responses in SpO 2, RR and etCO 2.

This is matched with the study by Fioriello et al.They found that HR was more elevated and less modulated in children with ASD, especially with young children with a mean age of 3–4 years. At follow-up (after 15 min of rest), the mean in group 1 was significantly higher than other groups for all outcome measurements (HR, SpO 2, RR, etCO 2), while there were non-significant differences between the other three groups. This finding is close to the study by Sigmon et al who investigated the association between CHD and ASD in cases with an average age of 7 years.They found that a high percentage of children with CHD had ASD with an average age of 7. Another recent meta-analysis reached close findings as it investigated the link between CHD and ASD in children.They screened 250 611 subjects (3984 CHD, 9829 ASD and 236 798 controls). They found that CHD increases the risk of developing ASD.

Ostium primum atrial septal defect (ASD)—anatomic features and closure implications are outlined: an ostium primum ASD is a congenital anomaly within the spectrum of an atrioventricular (AV) canal defect that arises when endocardial cushions fail to fuse because of abnormal migration of mesenchymal cells, and with endocardial cushion defects the canal portion of the AV septum and the AV valves can all be variably affected; the defect is characterized by an atrial communication from absence of the AV canal portion of the atrial septum with a common AV valve annulus and two AV valve orifices and AV valve tissue adherent to the crest of the ventricular septum such that no ventricular level shunt is present. The leaflets of the two AV valves are abnormal with two bridging leaflets that straddle from the right ventricle (RV) to the left ventricle (LV); it is more accurate to use the left and right AV valves when describing an ostium primum ASD because both valves will always be abnormal, AV valve regurgitation through the so-called cleft is extremely common, the borders include the septum primum superiorly and posteriorly and the common AV valve annulus anteriorly, and because these communications have the AV valve orifice as one of the margins, percutaneous transcatheter device closure is not possible.

Hemizygous males

Males with an NAA10- related syndrome present at different ages; those with arrhythmias may present prenatally; while others are apparent at birth with cardiac concerns, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features; and others come to attention later with relatively nonspecific developmental/intellectual and growth impairments. There are a number of findings in a variety of body systems that have been reported in two or more individuals with this disorder. It is noted that there is a wide spectrum among individuals with this disorder with regard to number of findings and severity of phenotype (see Tables 1, 2, 3).

Prenatal presentation. There may be fetal arrhythmias detected (see 'Cardiac manifestations' below). Prenatal growth is in the normal to low normal range.

Cardiac manifestations include cardiac arrhythmias and/or congenital heart defects.
Cardiac arrhythmias can present in many forms, including premature atrial contractions, premature ventricular contractions, supra-ventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, bradycardia, intraventricular conduction impairments, and torsade de Points. Other electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities may include PR prolongation, repolarization delay, QT prolongation, and nonspecific T-wave abnormalities. The age of onset for these symptoms can vary from prenatal course to adulthood. Cardiac arrhythmias can occur in the absence of structural defects.
Congenital heart defects can include patent ductus arteriosus, patent foramen ovale, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, pulmonary artery stenosis, and bicuspid aortic valve.

### The unnatural history of an atrial septal defect: longitudinal 35 year follow up after surgical closure at young age [^f78ba443]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the very long-term outcome after surgical closure of an atrial septal defect (ASD).

Design

Longitudinal cohort study of 135 consecutive patients who underwent surgical ASD repair at age <15 years between 1968 and 1980. The study protocol included ECG, echocardiography, exercise testing, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic hormone, Holter monitoring and cardiac MRI.

Main Outcome Measures

Survival, major events (cardiac reinterventions, stroke, symptomatic arrhythmia or heart failure) and ventricular function.

Results

After 35 years (range 30-41), survival status was obtained in 131 of 135 patients (97%): five died (4%), including two sudden deaths in the last decade. Fourteen patients (16%) had symptomatic supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and six (6%) had a pacemaker implanted which was predicted by early postoperative arrhythmias. Two reoperations were performed. One ischaemic stroke occurred. Left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) ejection fractions (EF) were 58 ± 7% and 51 ± 6%, respectively. RVEF was diminished in 17 patients (31%) and in 11 (20%) the RV was dilated. Exercise capacity and quality of life were comparable to the normal population. No clear differences were found between ASD-II or sinus venosus type ASD.

Conclusions

Very long-term outcome after surgical ASD closure in childhood shows good survival and low morbidity. Early surgical closure prevents pulmonary hypertension and reduces the occurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias. Early postoperative arrhythmias are predictive for the need for pacemaker implantation during early follow-up, but the rate of late pacemaker implantation remains low. Although RVEF was unexpectedly found to be decreased in one-third of patients, the functional status remains excellent.

### Inclusion of a lipid panel in the standard precatheterization laboratory blood draw (...) [^d28b3adb]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Coronary angiography is the most commonly used test to definitively establish the diagnosis and extent of atherosclerotic heart disease. For patients with confirmed ASHD, regardless of whether subsequent revascularization is performed, the diagnostic angiogram alone can serve as an impetus to implement or escalate preventive measures to arrest plaque progression and stabilize fibroatheroma caps, ultimately preventing future adverse cardiovascular events. One of the most impactful therapeutic modifications that can occur in the management of patients after the diagnosis of ASHD is intensification of lipid-lowing therapy. Yet in many cardiac catheterization laboratories around the world, both clinicians and patients are so lesion focused that they fail to leverage the moment when a patient is diagnosed with plaque, which is a critical opportunity to optimize lipid-lowering therapy.

Cause‐Specific Mortality

Ischemic heart disease (20%, n=251), congenital malformations (15.2%, n=193), and neoplasms (12.4%, n=158) were the most common causes of death in patients with ASD. Congenital malformations are defined as any ICD code for congenital malformation that could have been logically implicated as the root cause of death. The defect itself was the cause of death in 7.5% (n=95) of patients with ASD.

Compared with the controls, patients with ASD experienced significantly more deaths due to any kind of congenital malformation (MRR, 54.61 [95% CI, 34.03–87.64]), other diseases of the circulatory system (MRR, 2.90 [95% CI, 2.42–3.49]), stroke (MRR, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.52–2.33]), diseases of the endocrine (MRR, 1.88 [95% CI, 1.10–3.22]) and respiratory systems (MRR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.19–2.45]), ischemic heart disease (MRR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.41–1.86]), and accidents (MRR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.05–1.89]) (Figure 5).

Figure 5 
Cause‐specific mortality risk ratios of patients with ASD compared with the control population.

Mortality risk ratios are calculated using Poisson regression and adjusted to sex, age, year at the start of follow‐up, and age at the beginning of follow‐up. ASD indicates atrial septal defect; CNS, central nervous system; and MRR, mortality risk ratio.

Risk of death from other heart diseases was most pronounced in valvular diseases (MRR, 5.65 [95% CI, 3.89–8.21]), cardiomyopathies (MRR, 3.77 [95% CI, 2.286.23]), and rhythm disturbances (MRR, 3.19 [95% CI, 1.43–7.11]). The adjusted MRR for having heart failure as the immediate cause of death was 4.99 (95% CI, 3.90–6.40). Total cardiovascular mortality is shown in Figure 3.

Recommendation-specific supportive text—diagnostic use and criteria: A 12-lead ECG during tachycardia is the first diagnostic test that should be done in any patient found to be in a stable wide QRS complex tachycardia on a monitor, and criteria that support a diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia (VT) include AV dissociation, a QRS complex >0.14 s, and an RS interval >100 ms in at least 1 precordial lead with other listed morphologic findings; for exertion-related arrhythmic symptoms, exercise in a monitored setting may reproduce the symptoms and/or the related arrhythmia and is particularly important when catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a possibility, though findings may not be reliably reproducible and long-term electrocardiographic monitoring with external or implantable recorders may be necessary; a 12-lead ECG may indicate structural heart disease or provide evidence of inherited arrhythmia disorders, and data on microvolt T wave alternans and the signal averaged ECG are inconclusive and not routinely used in clinical practice except for potential use of signal averaged ECG in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular hypertrophy—interpretation and performance note that RVH causes “a displacement of the QRS vector toward the right and anteriorly” and “often causes a delay in the R-wave peak in right precordial leads,” so “the ability of the ECG to detect RVH may be expected to be low.” Sensitivity is “generally low,” though some criteria have “high specificity,” with accuracy greatest “in congenital heart disease,” intermediate “in acquired heart disease and primary pulmonary hypertension in adults,” and lowest “in chronic lung disease.” ECG patterns include one similar to incomplete RBBB and another with predominantly tall R waves in right precordial leads; both are “associated with right axis deviation,” and are frequently associated with ST depression and T-wave inversion in right precordial leads, better termed “secondary ST-T abnormality” than “strain.” In chronic nonobstructive lung disease there is often “right axis deviation and deep S waves in the precordial leads;” chronic obstructive pulmonary disease produces a characteristic pattern with “low voltage in the limb leads,” a frontal plane QRS axis that is “rightward, superior, or indeterminate,” a rightward P-wave axis “greater than 60 degrees,” “persistent S waves in all precordial leads,” and “low R-wave amplitude in V6,” and “RVH is suggested … only if R-wave amplitude in V1 is relatively increased.” For diagnosis, “Right axis deviation and prominent anterior forces in the right precordial leads should be required … in nearly all cases,” but “such features occur for various reasons other than RVH,” so “The use of ancillary clinical information, therefore, plays a greater role.”

### Canadian cannabis consumption and patterns of congenital anomalies: an ecological geospatial analysis [^91312f5e]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

These elegant findings have far-reaching implications in many respects. As noted the present report describes statistical associations only. Cannabinoids however have been linked to multiple cellular pathways and pathophysiological mechanisms. This data suggests that molecular and cellular pathways described experimentally may impact the neonatal and pediatric epidemiological disease profile of a country and become prominent at the national level. Some of these mechanisms and pathways are described below.

Moreover the fact that a similar spectrum of congenital defects was recently found in a detailed review of the teratological experience in Colorado during and after the process of cannabis legalization there and has also been reported from Hawaii and USA means that generally similar findings have now been replicated in several jurisdictions.

The finding that all cardiovascular anomalies rise in parallel with cannabis use is novel and original and may well be important epidemiologically. Cardiovascular anomalies are the leading cause of congenital anomalies which themselves are the leading cause of death in the first 5 years of life in developed nations. Both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association have previously issued a position statement which notes increased rates of ventricular septal defect and Ebstein's anomaly in association with cannabis use. Colorado has recently reported a tripling of the rate of atrial septal defect in that state (;), and indeed atrial septal defect is noted to be more common in cannabis liberal states across USA based on the National Birth Defects Prevention Network publicly available dataset (;). A large Hawaiian study of over 300,000 births found that hypoplastic left heart, tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary valve atresia and or stenosis, ventricular septal defect and atrial septal defect were all increased after prenatal cannabis exposure. Transposition of the great arteries has previously been linked with paternal cannabis use. The present finding may have arisen either because most of the cardiac defects are higher in high cannabis using areas, or because some of the commoner defects are elevated and these suffice to increase the whole group significantly. This latter was the pattern recently observed in Colorado where atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) were all found to be dramatically increased in a temporal pattern closely tracking the increased availability of cannabis in that state (;). Moreover, in the most recent Colorado dataset all cardiovascular anomalies have also risen both against time and against cannabis use (;). It may be that the larger numbers afforded by the present national level study confers higher statistical power to observe a difference overall. Now that the commonest class of congenital defects, all cardiovascular defects, have been linked with cannabis use in Hawaii, Colorado and Canada the implications are likely to be very far reaching indeed. The large subject of epigenomics was shown in a recent review to be a particularly important factor in cardiovascular morphogenesis and presumably teratogenesis (;) and was recently shown to widely implicated in cannabinoid molecular and cellular pathways (;;).

### ECG manifestations: noncoronary heart disease [^1c40b03b]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The electrocardiogram reflects changes to the heart beyond those seen in acute myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndromes. Diseases of the pericardium and heart muscle such as pericarditis,myocarditis, and pericardial effusion have characteristic manifestations. Hypertensive heart disease is associated with a variety of changes on the electrocardiogram, as is valvular heart disease. Cardiac rhythm disturbances have been associated with the Brugada syndrome and the long QT syndrome, both of which have telltale findings on the electrocardiogram. The manifestations of dextrocardia, although rare, should be familiar to those who interpret electro-cardiograms. Transplanted hearts also feature classic changes, both in health and in stages of rejection. The various electrocardiographic manifestations of these noncoronary heart diseases are reviewed here.

### Electrocardiographic screening in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^f46bd54e]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Some investigators have suggested that children receiving stimulant medications to manage attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder should undergo screening electrocardiography to identify asymptomatic cardiac disease. However, no study to date has examined the efficacy and costs of this strategy. In the present study we sought to determine the utility of electrocardiographic screening in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. We reviewed the clinical experience of electrocardiographic screening of subjects with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder <21 years of age from April to September 2008. Additional cardiac care and testing that resulted from an abnormal initial electrocardiogram were recorded. Screening electrocardiograms were obtained in 1,470 children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and were interpreted as abnormal in 119 subjects (8.1%). Further evaluation of these 119 subjects included 63 transthoracic echocardiograms, 5 stress tests, and 9 Holter monitor studies. Cardiac disease was identified in 5 subjects (0.3% of entire cohort), yielding a positive predictive value of 4.2%. Cardiac diagnoses included ventricular pre-excitation syndrome (n = 2), bicuspid aortic valve (n = 2), and moderate secundum atrial septal defect (n = 1). The mean cost of electrocardiographic screening including further testing for subjects with abnormal initial screen results was $58 per child. The mean cost to identify a true-positive result was $17,162. In conclusion, electrocardiographic screening for children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder can successfully identify cardiac disease in otherwise asymptomatic subjects, although the positive predictive value is low. Ongoing studies are needed to know what role electrocardiographic screening should play in the management of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.

### Left circumflex coronary artery from the pulmonary artery in scimitar syndrome [^c2f141cb]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

CT, used to assess gross cardiovascular anatomy in complex congenital heart disease, is increasingly performed as non-electrocardiogram-gated, high-pitch spiral or volumetric acquisitions. Our finding of associated coronary anomalies implies it may be worth utilizing a specific electrocardiogram-gated protocol when assessing patients with scimitar syndrome to maximize the chances of adequate coronary visualization regardless of the presence of absence of evidence of ischaemia on electrocardiography (Fig. 5).

### Patient driven EKG device performance in adults with fontan palliation [^68873096]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the KardiaMobile (KM) device in adults with a Fontan palliation, and to assess the KM function as a screening tool for atrial arrhythmias. While patient driven electrocardiogram (EKG) devices are becoming a validated way to evaluate cardiac arrhythmias, their role for patients with congenital heart disease is less clear. Patients with single ventricle Fontan palliation have a high prevalence of atrial arrhythmias and represent a unique cohort that could benefit from early detection of atrial arrhythmias. This single center prospective study enrolled adult patients with Fontan palliation to use the KM heart rhythm monitoring device for both symptomatic episodes and asymptomatic weekly screening over a 1-year period. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the automatic KM interpretation (KM-auto) to an electrophysiologist overread (KM-EP) and traditional EKG. Fifty patients were enrolled and 510 follow-up transmissions were received. The sensitivity and specificity of enrollment KM-auto compared to EKG was 65% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of enrollment KM-auto compared to the KM-EP was 75% and 96%, respectively. In the adult Fontan palliation, the accuracy of the KM device to detect a normal rhythm was reliable and best with a physician overread. Abnormal or uninterpretable KM-auto device interpretations, symptomatic transmissions, and any transmissions with a high heart rate compared to a patient's normal baseline should warrant further review.

### Evolution of the American college of cardiology and American Heart Association cardiology clinical practice guidelines: a 10-year assessment [^ece9b45c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Over the past 10 years, ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines have been significantly streamlined and increasingly emphasize high‐quality evidence and de‐emphasize expert opinion and other lower levels of evidence. This focus on condensing recommendations has the potential to increase the clinical utility of guidelines for practicing clinicians.

### AHA / ACCF / HRS recommendations for the standardization and interpretation of the electrocardiogram: part IV: the ST segment, T and U waves, and the QT interval: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association electrocardiography and arrhythmias committee, council on clinical cardiology ; the American college of cardiology foundation ; and the Heart Rhythm Society: endorsed by the international society for computerized electrocardiology [^c2d89f29]. Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

AHA/ACCF/HRS ST-segment depression and etiologies of ST-segment elevation: ST-segment elevation can most often be attributed to 3 specific causes—early repolarization, injury currents associated with acute ischemia or ventricular dyskinesis, and injury currents usually associated with pericarditis—and criteria exist to differentiate these causes and should be incorporated into the descriptive diagnostic algorithms of the various computer-ECG algorithms; ST depression may be caused by various physiological, pathological, and pharmacological interventions including ischemia, hypokalemia, and a variety of cardiac and noncardiac drugs and may occur concurrently with T-wave changes such as those associated with hypertrophy and ventricular conduction disturbances; for thresholds, part VI gives −0.05 as the recommended threshold value for abnormal J-point depression in leads V2 and V3 in men and women and −0.1 mV in all other leads.

### Significance of deep T-wave inversions in asymptomatic athletes with normal cardiovascular examinations: practical solutions for managing the diagnostic conundrum [^442bbf30]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Anterior T-wave inversion

Based on a study of 1700 highly trained athletes aged between 14 and 18 years, T-wave inversion in the anterior leads (V1–V3) are observed in 2.5% of male and female caucasian athletes aged <16 years and are considered to represent the juvenile ECG pattern (figure 2 A) in the absence of symptoms, a previous history of an intracardiac shunt, a cardiac murmur consistent with an atrial septal defect or a family history of ARVC or premature SCD.T-wave inversion beyond lead V2 is exceptionally rare in caucasian athletes aged >16 years (0.1%) and are an indication for further investigation. In contrast, T-wave inversion in the anterior leads (V1–V4) is common in adult black athletes (figure 2 B). A recent study examining 904 black athletes and 1819 white athletes aged 14–35 years participating in 22 different sporting disciplines revealed that T-wave inversions were present in up to 25% of athletes and half of these individuals exhibit deep (−0.2 mV) T-wave inversions.T-wave inversions in leads V1–V4 were usually asymmetric or biphasic and frequently proceeded by convex ST-segment elevation. In black athletes, T-wave inversion was only preceded by ST-segment elevation or isoelectric ST-segments but never ST-segment depression. Detailed evaluation of these athletes with echocardiography, exercise stress tests, cardiac MRI and 24 h Holter failed to demonstrate any of the broad phenotypic features of HCM or ARVC, and following an almost 7-year follow-up episode there were no adverse events in black athletes with T-wave inversions in leads V1–V4. The same study also revealed that black controls of similar age had a T-wave inversion prevalence of 10% mainly distributed in the anterior leads indicating the T-wave inversion in leads V1–V4 in black athletes may represent ethnic variation which is exaggerated by exercise. Support for this hypothesis was evidenced by the fact that detraining among several athletes resulted in resolution of T-wave inversions within a few weeks.

### Cardiac evaluation of young athletes: time for a risk-based approach? [^bb4cd2dd]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The ESC's uniform approach in favor of ECG screening for all young athletes raises numerous practical limitations, which warrant careful review. The ECG will not detect all conditions, which predispose athletes to SCA/SCD. The ECG may be normal in up to 10% of athletes with HCM, 70% who are genotype positive for long QT syndrome, and 90% with premature coronary artery disease. Furthermore, the resting ECG is normal in almost all individuals with anomalous coronary arteries, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and aortopathies. These false‐negatives may result in false reassurance for a small proportion of athletes that harbor CV conditions associated with SCA/SCD, but the rate of false‐negative screens is substantially lower than if using the less sensitive evaluation of history and physical examination alone.

False‐positive ECG findings are another important limitation to consider. Regular exercise leads to a constellation of electrical and structural cardiac alterations which collectively form the phenotype of the “athlete's heart.” These physiological changes manifest as electrical changes on the athlete's ECG and, in some cases, mimic those observed in patients with cardiomyopathy. A notable example of this is the relatively high prevalence of anterior T‐wave inversion in black male athletes and some adult endurance athletes. Misinterpretation of physiological ECG findings leads to unnecessary downstream investigations and, in some cases, inappropriate restriction from competitive sports. The financial implications of false‐positive findings provide the central argument against national legislation for ECG screening in most countries.

### Electrocardiographic findings in patients > 100 years of age without clinical evidence of cardiac disease [^1cd86b93]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Centenarians have a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation, left-axis deviation, premature beats, first-degree atrioventricular block, and nonspecific ST-T changes. Fewer men live long enough to reach 100 years of age, and they tend to have more significant conduction defects and old myocardial infarcts than women.

### The ischemic electrocardiogram [^b0099639]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The electrocardiogram (EKG) is a useful diagnostic tool that allows clinicians to rapidly evaluate patients for acute coronary syndrome. With the high prevalence of heart disease in society, the EKG is crucial in the evaluation of chest pain and diagnosis of ischemia. Various guidelines provide criteria to aid in recognizing ischemia and help dictate patient management. Not all ischemic patterns requiring emergent management present within the classic definition of an STEMI. It is critical for clinicians to be able to accurately recognize these ischemic patterns to allow timely and appropriate cardiovascular care.
