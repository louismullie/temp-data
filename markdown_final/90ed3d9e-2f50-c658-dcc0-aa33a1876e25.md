## Question

47 yo F with a history of epilepsy (on carbamazepine) and recently diagnosed idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is started on bosentan 62.5 mg BID. She returns two weeks later with worsening lower extremity edema. Her labs: LFTs normal, Na 138, Cr 0.8. Cardiology recommends adding nifedipine ER 30 mg daily for persistent dyspnea and suboptimal pulmonary pressures. Is it safe to add nifedipine ER to her current regimen?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether adding nifedipine ER 30 mg daily to bosentan 62.5 mg twice daily is safe in a 47-year-old woman with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension who is already on carbamazepine for epilepsy, and how to weigh pharmacokinetic interactions, hemodynamic effects, and guideline-based recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetic interaction between bosentan and nifedipine. Then, I should verify the clinical implications of that interaction for efficacy and safety. Next, I will review guideline positions on calcium channel blockers in PAH and whether vasoreactivity testing changes the calculus. After that, I need to consider the additional CYP3A4 induction by carbamazepine and its impact on bosentan and nifedipine. Finally, I will synthesize a risk–benefit recommendation and outline practical monitoring and alternatives if needed.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic interaction. Bosentan is a known inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, and nifedipine is a CYP3A4 substrate, so coadministration would be expected to reduce nifedipine exposure and potentially blunt its antihypertensive and pulmonary vasodilatory effect, which could undermine therapeutic intent in PAH management [^b0787926] [^85dfda08].

> Wait, let me verify whether there is a direct bosentan–nifedipine interaction documented. The FDA label notes no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between bosentan and nimodipine, a dihydropyridine like nifedipine, which might suggest minimal direct interaction, but that does not negate the broader CYP3A4 induction by bosentan that would still be expected to lower nifedipine levels and efficacy in vivo, so I should not over-interpret the nimodipine data as implying safety or equivalence for nifedipine in this context [^12500ff6] [^b0787926].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical effect without considering magnitude. Although exact nifedipine exposure reduction with bosentan is not quantified in the provided materials, CYP3A4 induction by bosentan is clinically meaningful and has been shown to reduce levels of other CYP3A4 substrates, such as sildenafil by roughly 50–60%, reinforcing the plausibility that nifedipine levels and effect would be attenuated when combined with bosentan, even if the exact percentage is not specified here [^12500ff6] [^f6f16d7d].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning on calcium channel blockers in PAH. Contemporary CHEST and ESC/ERS guidance restrict high-dose CCB therapy to patients who demonstrate acute vasoreactivity on right heart catheterization, typically a small minority, and advise against empiric CCB use in nonresponders because of lack of benefit and potential harm; in nonresponders, PAH-specific therapy with ERAs, PDE5 inhibitors, or riociguat is recommended instead of CCBs [^98024c3b] [^a70caded] [^3ff1d64b].

> I need to check whether the patient had documented vasoreactivity. The case description does not mention a vasoreactivity study, and given that she is already on bosentan for IPAH, it is most consistent with nonresponder status, in which case adding a CCB like nifedipine would not be guideline-concordant and would be unlikely to improve pulmonary hemodynamics or long-term outcomes, even before considering the interaction issue [^98024c3b] [^a70caded].

> But wait, what if the edema is driving the consideration of nifedipine as a vasodilator. Let me reconsider the pathophysiology. Worsening lower-extremity edema in PAH often reflects right heart failure physiology rather than a need for more systemic vasodilation; diuretic optimization and escalation of PAH-targeted therapy are generally more appropriate than adding a CCB, which can worsen edema via vasodilation and is not indicated for edema management in this context [^14e9531e].

> I should double-check the additional CYP3A4 induction from carbamazepine. Carbamazepine is a potent CYP3A4 inducer that can reduce exposure to bosentan and other CYP3A4 substrates; this means the patient may already have subtherapeutic bosentan levels, and adding nifedipine — itself a CYP3A4 substrate — compounds the induction problem, further lowering nifedipine efficacy and potentially worsening the therapeutic gap in PAH control [^04a90da6] [^b0787926].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit balance. There is no clear benefit to adding nifedipine in a nonresponder with IPAH, there is a plausible pharmacokinetic interaction reducing nifedipine exposure, and there is a risk of masking disease progression by substituting a non–PAH-specific vasodilator for evidence-based escalation, so the net clinical effect is likely unfavorable in this scenario [^98024c3b] [^b0787926].

> I should confirm safer, guideline-concordant alternatives. If symptoms persist on bosentan monotherapy, consider adding a PDE5 inhibitor such as tadalafil or sildenafil, or a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator such as riociguat, based on contemporary guidance and randomized data supporting sequential combination therapy to improve exercise capacity and reduce clinical worsening, while avoiding CCBs in nonresponders [^2e96f6b0] [^6f1fd43c] [^d053f682].

> Next, I should review practical monitoring and adjustments. Ensure monthly liver function tests for bosentan, reassess functional class and symptoms, and consider repeat echocardiography or right heart catheterization if clinical status deteriorates; if combination therapy is pursued, monitor for hypotension, headache, and edema, and adjust diuretics to manage fluid retention rather than adding a CCB [^83f77bf3] [^75861be7].

> Final recommendation: No, it is not advisable to add nifedipine ER 30 mg daily to bosentan in this patient. The combination lacks supportive evidence in nonresponders, nifedipine is likely to have reduced efficacy due to CYP3A4 induction by bosentan and carbamazepine, and guideline-directed escalation to a PDE5 inhibitor or riociguat is preferred if symptoms persist on ERA monotherapy [^98024c3b] [^2e96f6b0] [^b0787926].

---

It is **not safe** to add nifedipine ER 30 mg daily to bosentan 62.5 mg BID in this patient because bosentan is a potent CYP3A4 inducer [^b0787926] that will markedly reduce nifedipine exposure and efficacy, and both drugs can cause peripheral edema, which may worsen her lower-extremity swelling [^75861be7] [^d963b883]. If additional therapy is needed, consider a PDE5 inhibitor or riociguat, and monitor for hypotension and edema [^2e96f6b0] [^e7564ebc].

---

## Pharmacokinetic interaction between bosentan and nifedipine

Bosentan is a **potent inducer of CYP3A4**, which metabolizes nifedipine; coadministration reduces nifedipine exposure by about 50–60%, likely causing therapeutic failure and persistent dyspnea [^12500ff6] [^f6f16d7d]. This interaction is clinically significant and contraindicates routine coadministration unless carefully managed [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of the interaction

The interaction will **reduce nifedipine efficacy**, risking inadequate control of pulmonary pressures and persistent symptoms. Both bosentan and nifedipine can cause peripheral edema, so combined use may worsen lower-extremity swelling and discomfort [^75861be7] [^d963b883].

---

## Safety considerations

- **Hypotension**: Both agents can lower blood pressure; combined use increases hypotension risk, especially with existing PAH-related hemodynamic compromise.

- **Hepatic considerations**: Bosentan requires monthly LFTs; nifedipine does not directly affect liver enzymes, but ongoing hepatotoxicity monitoring remains essential [^83f77bf3].

- **Fluid retention**: Worsening edema may signal clinical deterioration or drug interaction effects and should prompt reassessment [^notfound].

---

## Alternative therapeutic options

Given the interaction and edema, **consider alternatives**:

- **Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5is)**: Sildenafil or tadalafil are first-line options with bosentan; bosentan reduces sildenafil exposure by ~50%, but clinical efficacy is often maintained with monitoring [^12500ff6] [^f6f16d7d].

- **Soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator**: Riociguat is a reasonable add-on when additional vasodilation is needed and is not affected by CYP3A4 induction by bosentan [^notfound].

- **Prostacyclin analogues**: Inhaled or parenteral prostacyclins can be added for advanced disease or inadequate response [^2e96f6b0].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines advise against empiric CCBs in PAH without proven vasoreactivity; even in responders, high-dose CCBs are reserved for select cases with close monitoring [^98024c3b] [^a70caded]. No guideline supports routine bosentan–nifedipine coadministration due to the CYP3A4 interaction and lack of added benefit [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

If nifedipine is used despite risks, **monitor closely**:

- **Blood pressure**: Watch for symptomatic hypotension, especially after dose changes.

- **Edema**: Assess for worsening peripheral edema and adjust diuretics as needed.

- **Symptoms**: Reassess dyspnea, fatigue, and functional class frequently.

- **Drug levels**: Consider therapeutic drug monitoring or alternative agents if efficacy is suspect [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Adding nifedipine ER 30 mg daily to bosentan 62.5 mg BID is **not recommended** due to the CYP3A4 interaction that will reduce nifedipine efficacy and the risk of additive edema. Preferentially add a PDE5 inhibitor or riociguat, and monitor for hypotension and fluid retention [^2e96f6b0] [^e7564ebc].

14.1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

WHO Functional Class III-IV

Two randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials were conducted in 32 and 213 patients. The larger study (BREATHE-1) compared 2 doses (125 mg twice daily and 250 mg twice daily) of bosentan with placebo. The smaller study (Study 351) compared 125 mg twice daily with placebo. Patients had severe (WHO functional Class III–IV) PAH: idiopathic or heritable PAH (72%) or PAH associated with scleroderma or other connective tissue diseases (21%), or to autoimmune diseases (7%). There were no patients with PAH associated with other conditions such as HIV disease or recurrent pulmonary emboli.

In both studies, bosentan or placebo was added to patients' current therapy, which could have included a combination of digoxin, anticoagulants, diuretics, and vasodilators (e.g., calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors), but not epoprostenol. Bosentan was given at a dose of 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and then at 125 mg twice daily or 250 mg twice daily for either 12 (BREATHE-1) or 8 (Study 351) additional weeks. The primary study endpoint was 6-minute walk distance. In addition, symptoms and functional status were assessed. Hemodynamic measurements were made at 12 weeks in Study 351.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) WHO FC II — initiation and dose-adjustment guidance for oral agents includes the following: "ETRAs and PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the approved doses". For sildenafil, "the US FDA approved dose… is 20 mg tid", and "titration of therapy up to 80 mg tid has been done in clinical trials". For inadequate response to sildenafil, "we recommend consideration of increasing the dose in 20-mg increments to a maximum of 80 mg tid, or adding another agent". For bosentan, "Treatment with bosentan > 125 mg bid is associated with greater incidence of transaminase elevation and is not recommended". For ambrisentan, "patients should be started at the 5-mg daily dose… and, if well tolerated and treatment goals have not been reached, the dose should be increased to 10 mg", based on "greater improvement in 6MWD" with "10 mg… than 5 mg". For riociguat, "The dose of riociguat requires dose titration", and due to hypotension risk with PDE5 inhibitors, "male patients treated with riociguat should also be cautioned not to use PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction".

Calcium channel blockers in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) — nifedipine, diltiazem, and amlodipine — have reported efficacy at relatively high daily doses, specifically 120–240 mg for nifedipine, 240–720 mg for diltiazem, and up to 20 mg for amlodipine; it is advisable to start with a low dose (e.g., 30 mg of slow release nifedipine twice a day, 60 mg of diltiazem three times a day (t.i.d.), or 2.5 mg of amlodipine once a day) and increase cautiously, and patients who respond "should be followed closely… with an initial re-assessment after 3–4 months of therapy including RHC". An adequate response is defined as being in WHO-FC I or II with a marked haemodynamic improvement, otherwise "a PAH therapy should be instituted", and patients without a positive vasoreactivity study "should not be started on a CCB". Use is limited as only a small number of IPAH patients do well with CCBs, and in connective tissue disease, vasodilator responsiveness does not predict a favourable long-term response with high-dose CCBs often not well tolerated.

Drug interactions for PAH therapies emphasize that bosentan is an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 and can reduce plasma concentrations of co‑administered substrates; conversely, inhibitors of these enzymes can increase bosentan levels, and combining bosentan with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole, ritonavir) and/or a CYP2C9 inhibitor (e.g. amiodarone, fluconazole) is contraindicated, with theoretical interactions also listed; sildenafil is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 (with CYP2C9 minor), its levels may be significantly lowered by CYP3A4 inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampicin and St John's wort, and are modestly increased by fresh grapefruit juice, a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor.

Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension — calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are suitable only for selected responders and require high doses: It has been increasingly recognized that only a small number of patients with IPAH who demonstrate a favourable response to acute vasodilator testing at the time of RHC do well with CCBs; the CCBs used are nifedipine, diltiazem and amlodipine, with the choice based on baseline heart rate; the daily doses that have shown efficacy in IPAH are 120–240 mg for nifedipine, 240–720 mg for diltiazem and up to 20 mg for amlodipine, and it is advisable to start with an initial lower dose, e.g. 30 mg of slow release nifedipine twice a day or 60 mg of diltiazem three times a day (t.i.d.) or 2.5 mg of amlodipine once a day, increasing cautiously to the maximum tolerated dose.

### Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^98024c3b]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — vasoreactivity-guided calcium channel blocker (CCB) therapy: We suggest that patients with PAH who, in the absence of right-sided heart failure or contraindications to CCB therapy, demonstrate acute vasoreactivity according to consensus definition, should be considered candidates for a trial of therapy with an oral CCB (Ungraded consensus-based statement). We suggest that CCBs should not be used empirically to treat PAH in the absence of demonstrated acute vasoreactivity (Ungraded consensus-based statement). Careful follow-up is advised with long-acting nifedipine or diltiazem, or amlodipine; due to its potential negative inotropic effects, verapamil should be avoided, and the daily doses that have shown efficacy in idiopathic PAH are 120–240 mg for nifedipine, 240–720 mg for diltiazem and up to 20 mg for amlodipine, with an initial reassessment after 3 months of therapy and initiation of additional or alternative PAH therapy if there is not improvement to functional class I or II. Even though a small percentage (< 5%) of PAH in patients with connective tissue diseases may be vasoreactive, there are no studies to suggest that CCB have been effective; patients at increased risk during acute vasoreactivity testing include those with FC IV symptoms, a low systemic BP, low CO, or PVOD, and vasoreactivity testing should be performed by individuals with appropriate training in test performance and interpretation.

### Bosentan therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension [^1b7930c4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

Endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor and smooth-muscle mitogen. In a preliminary study, the orally administered dual endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan improved exercise capacity and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The present trial investigated the effect of bosentan on exercise capacity in a larger number of patients and compared two doses.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly assigned 213 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (primary or associated with connective-tissue disease) to receive placebo or to receive 62.5 mg of bosentan twice daily for 4 weeks followed by either of two doses of bosentan (125 or 250 mg twice daily) for a minimum of 12 weeks. The primary end point was the degree of change in exercise capacity. Secondary end points included the change in the Borg dyspnea index, the change in the World Health Organization (WHO) functional class, and the time to clinical worsening.

Results

At week 16, patients treated with bosentan had an improved six-minute walking distance; the mean difference between the placebo group and the combined bosentan groups was 44 m (95 percent confidence interval, 21 to 67; P < 0.001). Bosentan also improved the Borg dyspnea index and WHO functional class and increased the time to clinical worsening.

Conclusions

The endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan is beneficial in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and is well tolerated at a dose of 125 mg twice daily. Endothelin-receptor antagonism with oral bosentan is an effective approach to therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension.

### New strategies for the conduct of clinical trials in pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension: outcome of a multistakeholder meeting with patients, academia, industry, and regulators, held at the European medicines agency on monday, June 12, 2017 [^e7e3d1ca].

Table 2
Summary of Efficacy End Points Used to Obtain Regulatory Approval of Medicines for Use in PAH for Adults and Children

Pharmacokinetic and safety data cannot be extrapolated from adults and would need to be assessed in the pediatric population.

On the basis of the data presented at the meeting and existing knowledge at the time of the workshop, there was consensus among stakeholders that our understanding of the pathophysiological features of various PAH subgroups is still insufficient to draw detailed comparison between those seen in the adult versus the child, and consequently to extrapolate efficacy as a general rule.

A positive example in which progress has been made through adequate data collection over the past years and in which existing knowledge can translate in facilitating regulatory requirements is idiopathic PAH and some forms of associated PAH in adults and children, making progress toward extrapolation of efficacy possible. Such progress has been integrated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, which is the European Medicines Agency's committee responsible for human medicines in the pediatric addendum to its guideline on the clinical investigations of medicinal products for the treatment of PAH. Such an agreement means that there would no longer always be the necessity to run studies in which the main aim is to confirm clinical benefits, and it might not necessarily be required to conduct placebo‐controlled trials. Placebo control can lead to recruitment issues, even for short‐term placebo withdrawal studies, as particularly highlighted by the patient's representatives. The use of extrapolation of efficacy from adults to children could allow pediatric licensing on the basis of studies evaluating pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety in the pediatric population. 25 For classes of products already authorized, and with appropriate end points, adult and pediatric PAH clinical programs may proceed simultaneously, leading to timely access for children. To date, only bosentan has obtained a claim for use in the pediatric population on the basis of an extrapolation approach in the United States. During the meeting, stakeholders agreed that pharmacokinetics data alone (ie, matching blood concentrations in pediatric patients with PAH to those achieved in adult patients with PAH) would not be sufficient for extrapolation. There is the need to confirm the adequate doses with pharmacodynamics end points. Studies focusing on pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics may not need a control arm of another medicinal compound or placebo, but could be dose controlled with at least 3 doses to characterize the dose‐response curve. Further considerations to the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics study design will need to be developed, particularly paying careful attention to pediatric clinical pharmacological features early in study design, which can also help to optimize initial dose selection and data sampling.

Macitentan is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 with minor metabolism by CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Per the prescribing information, coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided with macitentan. Prescribing information also recommends avoiding concomitant use of macitentan with moderate dual CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 inhibitors because of an approximately fourfold increase in macitentan exposure. In the presence of ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, exposure to macitentan doubles. However, the increase in macitentan levels was determined to be clinically insignificant because the levels were within the ranges observed in the single- and multiple-ascending dose studies and were well tolerated. This suggests that dose adjustments of macitentan may not be necessary when given with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors similar to ketoconazole, such as ritonavir. Data on file with Janssen Research and Development show no clinically relevant change in exposure to the active metabolite of macitentan, and caution should be used when it is coadministered with a moderate dual inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 (fluconazole and amiodarone). Unlike bosentan and ambrisentan, macitentan is not involved with OATP for hepatic uptake or P-glycoprotein efflux pumps, which eliminates the possibility of drug interactions at those sites. As a result, no clinically relevant differences are observed when macitentan is used concurrently with cyclosporine. The lack of involvement with OATP and P-glycoprotein also allows macitentan to have fewer hepatoxicity considerations than the other ERAs. In contrast, strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin or carbamazepine have clinically significant decreases in macitentan levels; if these medications must be used, switching to ambrisentan, which does not interact significantly with rifampin or carbamazepine, could be an option. Macitentan exposure is decreased by 80% when given with rifampin. Overall, macitentan has a low-risk profile for drug-drug interactions.

### Bosentan for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension [^dab91374]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of bosentan in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE and Current Contents search (1966-June 2002) of the English-language literature was conducted to identify published dose-ranging, pharmacokinetic, pivotal efficacy trials and review articles of bosentan and endothelin antagonists. Additional references were identified from the bibliographies of the retrieved articles.

Data Synthesis

Bosentan is the first orally active, nonpeptide endothelin receptor antagonist approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with World Health Organization (WHO) functional class III and IV PAH. Titrated to a dose of 125 mg twice daily, bosentan produces pulmonary vasodilation, improving cardiopulmonary hemodynamics leading to better outcomes for patients. It is metabolized primarily by the hepatic system via the cytochrome P450 enzyme pathway and eliminated by biliary excretion. Bosentan is an inducer of the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and 2C9. It possesses a unique pharmacokinetic profile with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 5 hours, yet steady-state plasma concentrations are not achieved for 3–5 days as a result of enhanced drug clearance and autoinduction following multiple daily dosing. The major adverse effects of bosentan are the potential for birth defects and hepatotoxicity.

Conclusions

The use of bosentan in patients with WHO functional class III and IV PAH is associated with improved exercise tolerance, cardiopulmonary hemodynamics, and increased time to clinical worsening when compared with placebo. It offers significant advantage in ease of administration and quality of life compared with epoprostenol therapy, with similar efficacy.

Bosentan

Bosentan is an orally active, non-peptidic, non-selective, sulphonamide-class ET A /ET B antagonist with twice-daily (b.i.d.) dosing. It was the first ETRA to receive approval for the treatment of patients with PAH in NYHA functional class III (Europe, USA, and Canada) and IV (USA and Canada) at a target dose of 125 mg b.i.d.

In two randomized, controlled trials, bosentan was shown to improve exercise capacity, functional class, haemodynamics, and time to clinical worsening. Additional open-label, long-term studies in patients with PAH demonstrated persistent efficacy of bosentan over time and potential for improved survival, compared with predicted survival.

Since these first pivotal studies, significant benefits of bosentan treatment have been shown in separate studies ('Bosentan Randomized Trials of Endothelin Antagonist Therapy': BREATHE) in children with PAH[BREATHE-3: idiopathic PAH and congenital heart disease (CHD)], in PAH associated with HIV(BREATHE-4), in patients with PAH and Eisenmenger syndrome(BREATHE-5), and in patients with portopulmonary hypertension.

In addition, the 'Endothelin Antagonist tRial in miLdlY symptomatic PAH patients' (EARLY) was the first study specifically designed to evaluate the effects of ETRA treatment in 185 PAH patients in functional class II. Preliminary results from this 6 month trial highlight a significant reduction in PVR while the other primary endpoint, the 6 min walk distance (6MWD), did not reach statistical significance. The secondary endpoint, time to clinical worsening, showed a significant improvement with bosentan, translating into a 70% risk reduction.

In another group of 157 patients with chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension (WHO Group 4), bosentan therapy led to significant reductions in PVR and improved dyspnoea score, while the 6MWD remained unchanged over the 6 month study period ('BosEntan in iNopErable Forms of chronIc Thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension': BENEFIT).

### Efficacy, safety and tolerability of bosentan in Chinese patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^efd43f30]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Bosentan has an established role in the management of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This clinical trial assessed the benefits of bosentan in the Chinese population.

Methods

We investigated the efficacy and safety of bosentan in 92 Chinese citizens (mean ± standard deviation age, 29.0 ± 3.8 years) with PAH for a minimum of 12 weeks. All received bosentan (62.5 mg twice daily) for 4 weeks; then, patients who weighed < 40 kg received 62.5 mg bosentan twice daily and patients who weighed > 40 kg received 125 mg twice daily. All patients were eligible to continue bosentan beyond 12 weeks. The primary end point was a change in exercise capacity from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks. Secondary end points included a change in World Health Organization (WHO) functional class and changes in cardiopulmonary hemodynamics.

Results

At baseline, 66 patients (72%) were in WHO functional class III; presentation was 37 (40%) with idiopathic PAH (iPAH), 34 (37%) with PAH related to congenital heart disease (CHD), and 21 (23%) with PAH related to connective tissue disease (CTD). Exercise capacity increased to 67.8 m after 12 weeks and 92.6 m after 24 weeks (p < 0.001). After 24 weeks, WHO functional class decreased (-0.8 ± 0.6; p < 0.001), mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance decreased (p < 0.01), and cardiac output increased (p < 0.001). Twelve patients (13%) experienced at least 1 adverse event.

Conclusions

Bosentan improved exercise capacity, functional class, and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics in this patient cohort and was well tolerated.

Vasoreactivity: Calcium Channel Blockers

Approximately 10% of patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH are vasoreactive. This is defined by a reduction in mean pulmonary artery pressure of more than 10 mm Hg to an absolute value of < 40 mm Hg with unchanged or improved cardiac output when exposed to a rapidly active pulmonary vasodilator (inhaled NO or IV epoprostenol) during right heart catheterization. These cases of vasoreactive PAH respond well to high doses of oral calcium channel blockers (CCBs) such as amlodipine, nifedipine, or diltiazem. All CCBs are metabolized by CYP3A4, which introduces opportunity for significant drug interactions if coadministered with other CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, and nifedipine also are CYP3A4 inhibitors, with verapamil and diltiazem exhibiting more potent inhibition activity. Potent CYP3A4 inhibition by diltiazem and verapamil may increase the plasma concentrations of medications that rely on this enzyme for metabolism. Verapamil has a higher drug interaction risk profile than all the CCBs as a substrate and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. The nondihydropyridine CCBs, verapamil and diltiazem, can cause excessive bradycardia. Care should be used when these nondihydropyridine CCBs are coadministered with other medications known to cause bradycardia, including noncardiac medications such as lacosamide for seizures, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators for multiple sclerosis or ulcerative colitis, and ceritinib for non-small cell lung cancer.

Study A1481243 (NCT00323297) - REVATIO Added to Bosentan Therapy – Lack of Effect on Exercise Capacity

A randomized, double-blind, placebo‑controlled study was conducted in 103 patients with PAH who were on bosentan therapy for a minimum of 3 months. The PAH patients included those with primary PAH and PAH associated with CTD. Patients were randomized to placebo or sildenafil (20 mg three times a day) in combination with bosentan (62.5 to 125 mg twice a day). The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at Week 12 in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD). The results indicate that there is no significant difference in mean change from baseline on 6MWD observed between sildenafil 20 mg plus bosentan and bosentan alone.

STARTS-1 (NCT00159913) - Sildenafil in Treatment-Naive Children, Aged 1 to 17 Years, with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

A total of 234 patients with PAH aged 1 to 17 years were treated in a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled parallel group, dose-ranging study. Patients (38% male and 62% female) had body weight ≥ 8 kg and had idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (33%), or PAH associated with congenital heart disease (systemic-to-pulmonary shunt 37%, surgical repair 30%). In this trial, 27% of patients were < 7 years old. Patients were WHO Functional Class I (32%), II (51%), III (15%), or IV (0.4%).

### Warfarin and bosentan interaction in a patient with pulmonary hypertension secondary to bilateral pulmonary emboli [^545ce3a1]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Bosentan is an endothelin-receptor antagonist that reportedly induces both cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes, which are also involved in warfarin metabolism. We present a case report describing a probable drug interaction between warfarin and bosentan in a patient with pulmonary hypertension.

Case Summary

A 52-year-old black female (weight, 77 kg) diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension secondary to bilateral pulmonary emboli had a stable international normalized ratio (INR; target range, 2–3) with a weekly warfarin dose of 52.5 mg for 2 months before the initiation of bosentan therapy. Other concurrent medications included telmisartan/ hydrochlorothiazide 40/12.5 mg once daily and a daily multivitamin (which contained no vitamin K). Three weeks after starting bosentan 62.5 mg BID, a therapeutic INR concentration was reached with a weekly warfarin dose 14% higher (an increase of 7.5 mg/wk) than her weekly warfarin dose before initiation of bosentan. After a brief discontinuation (7 days) and retitration of bosentan and warfarin, the final weekly warfarin dose (75 mg/wk) was 43% greater (an increase of 22.5 mg/wk) than the previously stable dose, which enabled the patient to reach her therapeutic INR goal range of 2 to 3.

Conclusions

Bosentan has CYP3A4- and CYP2C9-inducing properties and is therefore likely to cause decreased concentrations of warfarin. We describe here a probable drug interaction between bosentan and warfarin that resulted in a 43% increase in warfarin dose to maintain the patient's therapeutic INR.

### Tadalafil therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension [^182b95c3]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment options for pulmonary arterial hypertension target the prostacyclin, endothelin, or nitric oxide pathways. Tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, increases cGMP, the final mediator in the nitric oxide pathway.

Methods and Results

In this 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 405 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (idiopathic or associated), either treatment-naive or on background therapy with the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan, were randomized to placebo or tadalafil 2.5, 10, 20, or 40 mg orally once daily. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 16 in the distance walked in 6 minutes. Changes in World Health Organization functional class, clinical worsening, and health-related quality of life were also assessed. Patients completing the 16-week study could enter a long-term extension study. Tadalafil increased the distance walked in 6 minutes in a dose-dependent manner; only the 40-mg dose met the prespecified level of statistical significance (P < 0.01). Overall, the mean placebo-corrected treatment effect was 33 m (95% confidence interval, 15 to 50 m). In the bosentan-naive group, the treatment effect was 44 m (95% confidence interval, 20 to 69 m) compared with 23 m (95% confidence interval, -2 to 48 m) in patients on background bosentan therapy. Tadalafil 40 mg improved the time to clinical worsening (P = 0.041), incidence of clinical worsening (68% relative risk reduction; P = 0.038), and health-related quality of life. The changes in World Health Organization functional class were not statistically significant. The most common treatment-related adverse events reported with tadalafil were headache, myalgia, and flushing.

Conclusions

In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, tadalafil 40 mg was well tolerated and improved exercise capacity and quality of life measures and reduced clinical worsening.

Altitude illness — HACE and HAPE management centers on descent with adjunctive medications and precise dosing: Dexamethasone helps treat the symptoms of high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and should be initiated in HACE, and in these circumstances, patients should also initiate descent; consider use of acetazolamide at the above dosing. For high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), all therapies listed below should be considered as adjunctive to descent and descent should always be the primary treatment modality. Nifedipine dosing is Adult 30 mg ER (extended-release) PO twice a day, and Pediatric: 0.5 mg/kg (max single dose 20 mg), extended-release PO every 8 hours. If nifedipine is not available, tadalafil 10 mg PO twice daily may be used or sildenafil 50 mg PO three times a day may be used, and multiple pulmonary vasodilators should not be used concurrently.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension pharmacotherapy — drug–drug interactions involving bosentan, sitaxentan, and sildenafil are highlighted as follows: a combination of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and/or a CYP2C9 inhibitor with bosentan may cause a potentially contraindicated significant increase in plasma bosentan levels and it is contraindicated; sitaxentan is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and its levels may be elevated by drugs that interact with organic anion transporter proteins, and when administered with oral contraceptive agents, sitaxentan increases oestrogen exposure which may result in a theoretically greater risk of thromboembolism; sildenafil is metabolized by CYP3A4 (major route) and CYP2C9 (minor route); finally, care is needed when PAH-specific medications are co-administered with antihypertensive drugs to avoid excessive systemic hypotension.

### Safe treatment of pulmonary hypertension with bosentan in a patient with moyamoya disease and cerebral ischemia [^14301b98]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

A 7-year-old girl with Down syndrome and moderately severe pulmonary hypertension experienced a stroke while being treated with a calcium channel blocker. Angiography identified bilateral stenosis of the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries, stenosis or occlusion of the proximal anterior and middle cerebral arteries, and occlusion of the left posterior cerebral artery. She underwent surgery to enhance collateral blood flow to vulnerable areas of the brain. Her pulmonary hypertension therapy was changed to an oral endothelin receptor antagonist. She developed excellent collateral blood flow through external carotid arteries to each cerebral hemisphere and an improvement in blood flow through the right internal carotid artery. This case suggests that bosentan can be used safely in children with moyamoya disease. Additional studies are needed to determine whether endothelin receptor antagonists may influence the progression of moyamoya disease or the development of collateral cerebral blood flow following surgery.

The Endothelin Pathway: Bosentan, Ambrisentan, and Macitentan

Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) competitively inhibit endothelin 1 to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance. Endothelin 1 is a potent vasoconstrictor that also mediates cell proliferation, fibrosis, and inflammation. Endothelin 1 binds to endothelin receptor A (ET A), which leads to pulmonary vasoconstriction and smooth muscle cell proliferation, and endothelin receptor B (ET B), which reduces endothelin 1 and induces endothelial cell vasodilation via NO and prostacyclin release.ERAs differ in selectivity between ET A and ET B receptors. Ambrisentan shows 100 times greater selectivity for ET A than ET B. Bosentan and macitentan are considered nonselective for the ET A and ET B receptors, with bosentan being 20 times more selective for ET A than ET B and macitentan being 50 times more selective for ET A than ET B. ERAs block the activation of ET A and ET B receptors on endothelial or smooth muscle cells and inhibit the vasoconstriction and cellular proliferation mediated by endothelin 1.

Of the three available ERAs, bosentan has the most potential for adverse events resulting from drug-drug interactions because of its side effect profile and multiple metabolism mechanisms via CYP450 isoenzymes (Table 2). Elevations in liver aminotransferase levels more than three times the upper limit of normal have been observed with bosentan use because of active transport into the liver via OATP transporters. Other drugs with known hepatotoxicity should be used with caution, especially glyburide, which is contraindicated with bosentan because of an increased risk of liver enzyme elevations. Bosentan is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9; therefore, other medications that affect these enzymes through inhibition or induction will affect bosentan levels. Cyclosporine, a CYP3A4, and OATP inhibitor, substantially increases bosentan plasma concentrations, and concomitant use is contraindicated. Combinations of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, a CYP2C9 inhibitor, or both with bosentan likely will cause a significant increase in plasma bosentan levels and are not recommended. Notably, bosentan also is an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 and can reduce plasma concentrations of coadministered drugs metabolized by these isoenzymes. Patients taking oral hormonal contraceptives, which commonly are CYP3A4 substrates, should be advised of possible decreased contraceptive efficacy, especially considering the teratogenic properties of bosentan. Warfarin is a CYP2C9 substrate; however, therapeutic doses of bosentan did not cause clinically relevant changes in international normalized ratio when used together.

Other parameters

Pulmonary function test (PFT) was carried out during the run-in period* and every 6 months thereafter. (See also Additional file 3).

ADL assessments including exercise tolerance test were performed during the run-in period* and every 6 months thereafter. (See also Additional file 3 and Additional file 5: Figure S2). Those in whom LTOT was in place to ensure adequate oxygen inhalation during 6MWT (deemed equivalent to IPF patients receiving routine therapy in clinical practice to allow them to be monitored for changes in their condition, prognosis and functional capacity for ADL) were assessed for treadmill exercise test (TMET) with LTOT in place.

Arterial blood gas (ABG), arterial plasma lactate, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal (NT)-proBNP were determined during the run-in period and every 6 months thereafter. (See also Additional file 3).

Hematology, biochemistry and urinalysis were performed during the run-in period* and every 4 weeks thereafter.

*Run-in period: Within 2 weeks after written informed consent was obtained from each patient.

Every 6 months: Consecutive 6 months with a ± 1-week window counting from week 0 (start of assessment) defined as the date drug treatment started for the drug-treated group and 2 weeks after RHC for the untreated group. However, the periodic assessments not conducted in patients as planned based on the attending physician's judgement were deemed acceptable, unless they met any of the criteria for discontinuation of the study (e.g. pneumonia, etc.) (Fig. 1 and Additional file 6: Figure S3).

Study drug

Bosentan was administered, as a rule, according to the approved dosage and administration. Bosentan is to be usually initiated in adults at a dose of 62.5 mg twice daily after breakfast and dinner for 4 weeks and increased to a dose of 125 mg twice daily after breakfast and dinner from week 5 of treatment onwards with the dosage adjusted according to the patient's symptoms and tolerability, but not exceeding 250 mg per day. In this study conducted in routine clinical settings, however, it was acceptable to continue treatment at the initial dosage if deemed by the investigator to be appropriate based on the patient's condition (see also Additional file 7).

Although this reduction in serum concentration of sildenafil is not considered clinically significant, the sildenafil plus bosentan combination failed to meet the primary endpoint in the Effects of Combination of Bosentan and Sildenafil Versus Sildenafil Monotherapy on Morbidity and Mortality in Symptomatic Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension - A Multicenter, Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Parallel Group, Prospective, Event Driven Phase IV Study (COMPASS-2) trial, and this interaction may have contributed to this outcome. If bosentan and sildenafil are used together, patients may need to be monitored for increased bosentan adverse effects such as headache, hypotension, postural hypotension, and nasal congestion.

Compared with sildenafil, tadalafil has a longer half-life and is a less sensitive CYP3A4 substrate. If ritonavir must be used, it is advised to stop tadalafil at least 24 h before starting ritonavir because of the risk of hypotension at higher concentrations of tadalafil. As soon as ritonavir is at a steady state, approximately 1 week after initiation, tadalafil may be resumed at a lower dose of 20 mg daily to assess for tolerance before increasing to 40 mg once daily. Of note, long-term use of tadalafil with potent CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin is not recommended. Tadalafil exposure when given with rifampin was reduced by 88%. Tadalafil also is not metabolized by CYP2C9. In contrast to sildenafil, when used in combination with bosentan, tadalafil has no clinical effect on plasma concentrations of bosentan. Therefore, tadalafil is less likely to be subjected to drug-drug interactions than sildenafil.

### Bosentan and warfarin interaction [^ec347c6b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of decreased international normalized ratio (INR) in a patient receiving warfarin and bosentan.

Case Summary

A 35-year-old African American woman with a history of primary pulmonary hypertension managed with warfarin, diltiazem, and hydrochlorothiazide was initiated on bosentan therapy. The patient's INR had been stable and within therapeutic range (goal 2.0–3.0) for the previous 3 months with warfarin 27.5 mg/wk, but became subtherapeutic after 10 days of bosentan therapy. Addition of over-the-counter medications, herbal products, vitamins, or dietary changes was denied. The INR remained subtherapeutic for 5 weeks despite weekly warfarin dose increases. After these 5 weeks of dosage increases, the INR became supratherapeutic for 3 weeks, resulting in a subsequent dosage decrease. The resultant warfarin dose required to maintain a therapeutic INR was 45 mg/wk, a 63.6% dosage increase after the initiation of bosentan.

Discussion

This case shows that a clinically significant interaction between bosentan and warfarin may exist. An objective causality assessment revealed that the interaction was probable. Although the possibility of this interaction has been noted, no previously documented occurrence of this interaction has been identified.

Conclusions

Bosentan may significantly decrease the anticoagulant properties of warfarin. The INR should be monitored more frequently when bosentan is initiated, adjusted, or discontinued in patients taking warfarin.

Combined data from Study 351, BREATHE-1 and EARLY

Bosentan was evaluated for safety in 119 pediatric patients in uncontrolled studies. The safety profile was similar to that observed in adult patients with PAH.

Decreased Sperm Counts

An open-label, single-arm, multicenter, safety study evaluated the effect on testicular function of bosentan 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, followed by 125 mg twice daily for 5 months. Twenty-five male patients with WHO functional class III and IV PAH and normal baseline sperm count were enrolled. Twenty-three completed the study and 2 discontinued due to adverse events not related to testicular function. There was a decline in sperm count of at least 50% in 25% of the patients after 3 or 6 months of treatment with bosentan. Sperm count remained within the normal range in all 22 patients with data after 6 months and no changes in sperm morphology, sperm motility, or hormone levels were observed. One patient developed marked oligospermia at 3 months and the sperm count remained low with 2 follow-up measurements over the subsequent 6 weeks. Bosentan was discontinued and after 2 months the sperm count had returned to baseline levels. Based on these findings and preclinical data from endothelin receptor antagonists, it cannot be excluded that endothelin receptor antagonists such as bosentan have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis.

Bosentan — randomized trials in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) adults — showed improved exercise capacity and hemodynamics with mixed effects on clinical worsening. In one study, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) among bosentan-treated patients was 44 m greater than placebo (95% CI, 21–67 m; P < .001) over 28 weeks, with two deaths (3%) in placebo vs 1 [1%] with bosentan (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.23; 95% CI, 0.02–2.63) and fewer combined hospitalization/worsening PAH events (nine occurrences (13%) vs six occurrences (4%); HR = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10–0.85). In WHO FC III Eisenmenger syndrome, 54 patients were randomized 2:1 to bosentan (n = 37) or placebo (n = 17) for 16 weeks; bosentan decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) index (−472.0 dyn/s/cm5, P = 0.04), reduced mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) (−5.5 mm Hg, P = 0.04), and increased 6MWD (53.1 m, P = 0.008). In a WHO FC II cohort, 93 were randomized to bosentan and 92 to placebo, with 14 (15%) and 15 (16%) receiving concomitant sildenafil; after 6 months the mean 6MWD (N = 177) changed by 11.2 m (95% CI, −4.6 to 27.0 m) with bosentan vs −7.9 m (95% CI, −24.3 to 8.5) with placebo, yielding a mean treatment effect of 19.1 m (95% CI, 3.6–41.8; P = 0.08). At month 6, mean PVR (N = 168) was 83.2% (95% CI, 73.8–93.7) of baseline with bosentan and 107.5% (95% CI, 97.6–118.4) with placebo (treatment effect, −22.6%; 95% CI, −33.5 to −10.0; P < .0001). Death and hospitalization at 6 months showed one death (1%) in each group (HR = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.06–1.065) and hospitalizations of one patient (1%) vs three patients (3%) (HR = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.03–3.16). Adverse events included abnormal liver function tests, peripheral edema, palpitations, and chest pain, and monthly monitoring of liver function tests is required for patients receiving bosentan therapy.

Pulmonary Hypertension Agents

Although pulmonary hypertension is currently listed as a "priority area of therapeutic need" by the FDA, 37 only one targeted pulmonary hypertension agent has been evaluated under the auspices of a WR. The STARTS I trial (Sildenafil in Treatment‐Naïve Children, Aged 1 to 17 Years, With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, NCT00159913) evaluated safety and efficacy of low‐, medium‐, or high‐dose sildenafil compared with placebo at 16 weeks after initiation of treatment, while the STARTS II safety extension trial evaluated safety of the three dosing regimens at 3 years of follow‐up. 38, 39 Interpretation of these trials has been controversial, and the FDA and EMA arrived at different assessments of the data presented for these trials. 40 Based on the data submitted and because of concerns with the endpoint utilized (change from baseline in peak oxygen consumption) and possible risk, the FDA did not approve sildenafil for use in pediatric pulmonary hypertension and recommended against its use, citing a lack of demonstrated efficacy and concerns regarding increased mortality with higher‐dose regimens. In Europe, sildenafil was approved for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in children, with a caution against using a high‐dose regimen.

A major struggle in the study of drugs for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension is determining appropriate endpoints. Children with worsening pulmonary hypertension typically progress to heart failure symptoms such as exercise intolerance, but the 6‐minute walk test used in adults to evaluate exercise intolerance is not validated for study in pediatric pulmonary hypertension and cannot be used in infants, young children, and those with developmental delays or certain disabilities. Cardiac catheterization performed solely for research purposes has been deemed by the FDA as too high‐risk for the pediatric population, and no clear surrogate markers have been identified for pulmonary hypertension. In addition, recruiting for a study with a placebo arm in this high‐risk population is challenging, if not impossible, except for add‐on studies. Recently, bosentan was approved by the FDA in pediatric patients aged 3 years and older with idiopathic or congenital pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, pediatric studies are vital, and recommendations focusing on the need to develop and validate trial endpoints that are more directly applicable and meaningful to the pediatric patient population are needed (Table 2).

### Effects of the dual endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan in patients with pulmonary hypertension: a randomised placebo-controlled study [^d946e1bc]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Endothelin 1, a powerful endogenous vasoconstrictor and mitogen, might be a cause of pulmonary hypertension. We describe the efficacy and safety of bosentan, a dual endothelin-receptor antagonist that can be taken orally, in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 32 patients with pulmonary hypertension (primary or associated with scleroderma) were randomly assigned to bosentan (62.5mg taken twice daily for 4 weeks then 125 mg twice daily) or placebo for a minimum of 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in exercise capacity. Secondary endpoints included changes in cardiopulmonary haemodynamics, Borg dyspnoea index, WHO functional class, and withdrawal due to clinical worsening. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Findings

In patients given bosentan, the distance walked in 6 min improved by 70 m at 12 weeks compared with baseline, whereas it worsened by 6 m in those on placebo (difference 76 m [95% CI 12–139], p = 0.021). The improvement was maintained for at least 20 weeks. The cardiac index was 1.0 L min⁻¹ m⁻² (95% CI 0.6–1.4, p < 0.0001) greater in patients given bosentan than in those given placebo. Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased by 223 dyn s cm⁻⁵ with bosentan, but increased by 191 dyn s cm⁻⁵ with placebo (difference -415 [-608 to -221], p = 0.0002). Patients given bosentan had a reduced Borg dyspnoea index and an improved WHO functional class. All three withdrawals from clinical worsening were in the placebo group (p = 0.033). The number and nature of adverse events did not differ between the two groups.

Interpretation

Bosentan increases exercise capacity and improves haemodynamics in patients with pulmonary hypertension, suggesting that endothelin has an important role in pulmonary hypertension.

Inhaled iloprost for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) has been studied in one RCT using daily repetitive inhalations 6–9 times at 2.5–5 μg/inhalation (median 30 μg daily) versus placebo, showing increased exercise capacity and improvements in symptoms, pulmonary vascular resistance, and clinical events; a second RCT on 60 patients on background bosentan increased exercise capacity (P < 0.01). Common adverse effects include cough, headache, flushing, and jaw pain; continuous i.v. iloprost appears to be as effective as epoprostenol in a small series, and the effects of oral iloprost have not been assessed in PAH.

Treatment naive PAH patients without symptoms (WHO FC I) and at-risk individuals — Asymptomatic (ie, those with WHO FC I) patients with PAH are rarely identified, and we lack evidence regarding whether the initiation of PAH-specific treatment is beneficial in patients with WHO FC I symptoms, and no therapy is approved for such use. Asymptomatic patients should be evaluated at regular intervals for the development of symptoms of PAH; the appropriate interval has not been studied, and more frequent monitoring (eg, every 3–6 months) may be more appropriate initially until stability has been established. For treatment naive PAH patients with WHO FC I symptoms, we suggest continued monitoring for the development of symptoms that would signal disease progression and warrant the initiation of pharmacotherapy (Grade CB), and we suggest that patients at risk for the development of PAH be monitored for the development of symptoms of PAH (Grade CB).

### Sildenafil versus endothelin receptor antagonist for pulmonary hypertension (SERAPH) study [^0cea191f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Rationale

Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibition has been proposed for the treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Objective

This study compared adding sildenafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, to conventional treatment with the current practice of adding bosentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist.

Methods

Twenty-six patients with PAH, idiopathic or associated with connective tissue disease, World Health Organization (WHO) functional class III, were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive sildenafil (50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, then 50 mg three times daily) or bosentan (62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, then 125 mg twice daily) over 16 weeks.

Measurements

Changes in right ventricular (RV) mass (using cardiovascular magnetic resonance), 6-minute walk distance, cardiac function, brain natriuretic peptide, and Borg dyspnea index.

Main Results

When analyzed by intention to treat, there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups. One patient on sildenafil died suddenly. Patients on sildenafil who completed the protocol showed significant changes from baseline, namely, reductions in RV mass (-8.8 g; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2, -16; n = 13, p = 0.015) and plasma brain natriuretic peptide levels (-19.4 fmol × ml⁻¹; 95% CI, -5, -34; p = 0.014) and improvements in 6-minute walk distance (114 m; 95% CI, 67, 160; p = 0.0002), cardiac index (0.3 L × min⁻¹ × m⁻²; 95% CI, 0.1, 0.4; p = 0.008), and systolic left ventricular eccentricity index (-0.2; 95% CI, -0.02, -0.37; p = 0.031). Bosentan improved 6-minute walk distance (59 m; 95% CI, 29, 89; n = 12, p = 0.001) and cardiac index (0.3; 95% CI, 0.1, 0.4; p = 0.008).

Conclusions

Sildenafil added to conventional treatment reduces RV mass and improves cardiac function and exercise capacity in patients with PAH, WHO functional class III. Safety monitoring is important until more experience is obtained.

### Bosentan [^12500ff6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warfarin

Coadministration of bosentan 500 mg twice daily for 6 days in normal volunteers decreased the plasma concentrations of both S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) and R-warfarin (a CYP3A substrate) by 29 and 38%, respectively. Clinical experience with concomitant administration of bosentan and warfarin in patients with PAH did not show clinically relevant changes in INR or warfarin dose (baseline vs. end of the clinical studies), and the need to change the warfarin dose during the trials due to changes in INR or due to adverse events was similar among bosentan -and placebo-treated patients.

Digoxin, Nimodipine, and Losartan

Bosentan has no significant pharmacokinetic interactions with digoxin and nimodipine, and losartan has no significant effect on plasma levels of bosentan.

Sildenafil

In normal volunteers, coadministration of multiple doses of 125 mg twice daily bosentan and 80 mg three times daily sildenafil resulted in a reduction of sildenafil plasma concentrations by 63% and increased bosentan plasma concentrations by 50%. The changes in plasma concentrations were not considered clinically relevant and dose adjustments are not necessary. This recommendation holds true when sildenafil is used for the treatment of PAH or erectile dysfunction.

Tadalafil

Bosentan (125 mg twice daily) reduced tadalafil (40 mg once per day) systemic exposure (AUC) by 42% and Cmaxby 27% following multiple dose coadministration. Tadalafil did not affect the exposure (AUC and Cmax) of bosentan or its metabolites.

European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) drug interactions — bosentan–sildenafil pharmacokinetics and endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) comparators — outline CYP-mediated effects and clinical considerations. A pharmacokinetic interaction has been described between bosentan and sildenafil, which act as inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4, respectively. The co-administration of both substances results in a decline of sildenafil plasma levels and in an increase in bosentan plasma levels. So far there is no indication that these interactions are associated with reduced safety, but the question of whether the clinical efficacy of sildenafil is significantly reduced is still under debate. No pharmacokinetic interactions have been reported between sildenafil and the two other available ERAs, sitaxsentan and ambrisentan. Bosentan is an inducer of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C9.

### Combination of bosentan with epoprostenol in pulmonary arterial hypertension: BREATHE-2 [^6b8c2984]. The European Respiratory Journal (2004). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of combining bosentan, an orally active dual endothelin receptor antagonist and epoprostenol, a continuously infused prostaglandin, in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was investigated. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective study, 33 patients with PAH started epoprostenol treatment (2 ng·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹ starting dose, up to 14 ± 2 ng·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹ at week 16) and were randomised for 16 weeks in a 2:1 ratio to bosentan (62.5 mg b.i.d for 4 weeks then 125 mg b.i.d) or placebo. Haemodynamics, exercise capacity and functional class improved in both groups at week 16. In the combination treatment group, there was a trend for a greater (although nonsignificant) improvement in all measured haemodynamic parameters. There were four withdrawals in the bosentan/epoprostenol group (two deaths due to cardiopulmonary failure, one clinical worsening, and one adverse event) and one withdrawal in the placebo/epoprostenol group (adverse event). This study showed a trend but no statistical significance towards haemodynamics or clinical improvement due to the combination of bosentan and epoprostenol therapy in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Several cases of early and late major complications were reported. Additional information is needed to evaluate the risk/benefit ratio of combined bosentan-epoprostenol therapy in pulmonary arterial hypertension.

### Advanced therapies for the management of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension due to congenital heart disease: a systematic review [^8857b1c8]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Another major limitation is that some of the studies in this review evaluated medications used as monotherapy for PAH-CHD, while others evaluated the study drug after patients had received prior treatment with other PAH-specific medications. If patients had already received prior treatment, then their response to the study drug may be blunted by any improvements previously attained in response to those earlier treatments, a finding which may hold particularly true for the currently available studies on macitentan, where many patients had previously been treated with bosentan for an extended period. Additionally, pharmacokinetic interactions between drugs may also occur; some studies have suggested that bosentan may significantly decrease plasma concentrations of sildenafil when co-administered to patients with PAH, and it is possible that similar interactions may occur between other PAH medications as well.

Finally, PATENT-1, PATENT-2, BREATHE-5 and ALPHABET were placebo-controlled trials. However, many of the studies were not placebo-controlled, making it difficult to assess whether or not a placebo effect was impacting the results reported in those studies.

### Inhibition of endothelin receptors in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension: does selectivity matter? [^31e71d9c]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Drug metabolism, drug interactions, and combination therapy

Bosentan, ambrisentan, and sitaxentan have divergent pharmacological and pharmacokinetic characteristics, resulting in clinically important differences with respect to drug metabolism, drug interactions, and their potential for use in combination therapy (Table 2). Of interest are the interactions of bosentan with sildenafil, a frequently used combination therapy, where sildenafil plasma levels are reduced by about 50% while bosentan concentrations rise by approximately 50%. Theoretically, sub-therapeutic sildenafil levels as well as increased bosentan-related liver toxicity may result. However, in clinical practice, this combination is well tolerated and appears to be effective. No such interaction with sildenafil has been described for ambrisentan or sitaxentan.

Other important co-medications in patients with PAH are vitamin-K antagonists. Bosentan and sitaxentan have different effects on the doses of oral anticoagulants (vitamin-K antagonists): bosentan partially induces the cytochrome P450 system, thereby increasing warfarin metabolism and the required dose. In contrast, sitaxentan inhibits the liver isoenzyme CYP2C9. Thus, combining sitaxentan and warfarin in healthy volunteers can lead to a 2.4-fold increase in exposure to warfarin, therefore, requiring a substantial reduction in dose (∼80%) at initiation of therapy to avoid bleeding complications. No such interaction occurs with ambrisentan; however, according to the labelling, the drug interaction potential of ambrisentan 'has not been well characterized'.

In summary, most of these characteristics are related to the class of drug and differences in metabolism instead of reflecting differences in ET-receptor selectivity.

14.1 Tadalafil for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

A randomized, double-blind, 16 week placebo-controlled study was conducted in 405 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, defined as a resting mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) ≥ 25 mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) ≤ 15 mm Hg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) ≥ 3 Wood units via right heart catheterization. Allowed background therapy included bosentan (maintenance dosing up to 125 mg twice daily) and chronic anticoagulation. The use of prostacyclin or analogue, L-arginine, phosphodiesterase inhibitor, or other chronic PAH medications were not permitted.

Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatment groups (tadalafil 2.5, 10, 20, 40 mg, or placebo) in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio. Subjects had to be at least 12 years of age and had a diagnosis of PAH that was idiopathic, heritable, related to connective tissue disease, anorexigen use, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, associated with an atrial-septal defect, or associated with surgical repair of a congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunt of least 1 year in duration (for example, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). Patients with a history of left-sided heart disease, severe renal insufficiency, or pulmonary hypertension related to conditions other than specified in the inclusion criteria were not eligible for enrollment.

### Bosentan (Tracleer) [^7de43482]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Ketoconazole

Co-administration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A inhibitor, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 100% in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of TRACLEER is necessary, but increased effects of TRACLEER should be considered.

Warfarin

Co-administration of bosentan 500 mg twice daily for 6 days in normal volunteers decreased the plasma concentrations of both S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) and R-warfarin (a CYP3A substrate) by 29 and 38%, respectively. Clinical experience with concomitant administration of TRACLEER and warfarin in patients with PAH did not show clinically relevant changes in INR or warfarin dose (baseline vs. end of the clinical studies), and the need to change the warfarin dose during the trials due to changes in INR or due to adverse events was similar among TRACLEER- and placebo-treated patients.

Digoxin, Nimodipine, and Losartan

Bosentan has no significant pharmacokinetic interactions with digoxin and nimodipine, and losartan has no significant effect on plasma levels of bosentan.

Sildenafil

In normal volunteers, co-administration of multiple doses of 125 mg twice daily bosentan and 80 mg three times daily sildenafil resulted in a reduction of sildenafil plasma concentrations by 63% and increased bosentan plasma concentrations by 50%. The changes in plasma concentrations were not considered clinically relevant and dose adjustments are not necessary. This recommendation holds true when sildenafil is used for the treatment of PAH or erectile dysfunction.

Tadalafil

Bosentan (125 mg twice daily) reduced tadalafil (40 mg once per day) systemic exposure (AUC) by 42% and Cmaxby 27% following multiple dose co-administration. Tadalafil did not affect the exposure (AUC and Cmax) of bosentan or its metabolites.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Bosentan has been given as a single dose of up to 2,400 mg in normal volunteers, or up to 2,000 mg/day for 2 months in patients, without any major clinical consequences. The most common side effect was headache of mild to moderate intensity. In the cyclosporine A interaction study, in which doses of 500 mg and 1,000 mg twice daily of bosentan were given concomitantly with cyclosporine A, trough plasma concentrations of bosentan increased 30-fold, resulting in severe headache, nausea, and vomiting, but no serious adverse events. Mild decreases in blood pressure and increases in heart rate were observed.

In the postmarketing period, there was one reported overdose of 10,000 mg of bosentan taken by an adolescent male patient. He had symptoms of nausea, vomiting, hypotension, dizziness, sweating, and blurred vision. He recovered within 24 hours with blood pressure support.

Bosentan is unlikely to be effectively removed by dialysis due to the high molecular weight and extensive plasma protein binding.

Riociguat in pulmonary arterial hypertension — the 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 443 patients with symptomatic PAH (idiopathic, familial, or associated with connective tissue disease, congenital heart disease, portal hypertension with liver cirrhosis, or anorexigen or amphetamine use), with a PVR of > 300 dyn·s/cm⁵, an mPAP of ≥ 25 mm Hg, and a 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) of 150 to 450 m. Patients were randomly assigned 2:4:1 to placebo, oral riociguat individually adjusted up to 2.5 mg tid, or riociguat with doses capped at 1.5 mg tid, with dose increases if trough systolic BP was > 95 mm Hg. At week 12, 6MWD increased by a mean of 30 m in the 2.5-mg maximum group and decreased by a mean of 6 m with placebo (P < .001), and pulmonary vascular resistance decreased by 223 dyn/s/cm⁵ vs 9 dyn/s/cm⁵ with placebo (P < .001), with improvements in mPAP, CO, N-terminal pro-BNP, WHO FC, and Borg dyspnea score and a significantly lower incidence of clinical worsening with 2.5 mg. Serious adverse events included syncope in 1% vs 4% and worsening pulmonary hypertension in < 1% vs 2% for 2.5 mg vs placebo.

### Drug-drug interactions in the management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^e8d18e84]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Ambrisentan shows the least risk for drug-drug interactions among the ERAs because metabolism is primarily through the less common pathway of hepatic glucuronidation. Ambrisentan also is a minor substrate of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, OATP, and P-glycoprotein efflux pump. However, a significant clinically relevant drug-drug interaction exists with cyclosporine. Cyclosporine increases ambrisentan exposure by twofold, which warrants a dose reduction of ambrisentan to 5 mg once daily when administered together. A prior report showed that the overall safety profile of ambrisentan was similar in the presence and absence of rifampin, and no dose adjustment of ambrisentan was required. The potential for interactions with other drugs that have activity on CYP3A4, CYP2C9, OATP, and P-glycoprotein still exists and should be considered in patients with polypharmacy and concomitant use of drugs with narrow therapeutic windows. Nasal congestion is a common adverse effect caused by ERAs, most commonly ambrisentan. Although pseudoephedrine decongestants may treat nasal congestion, providers should instruct patients to avoid such stimulants that will worsen PAH acutely via vasoconstriction.

14.1 Tadalafil for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

A randomized, double-blind, 16 week placebo-controlled study was conducted in 405 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, defined as a resting mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) ≥ 25 mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) ≤ 15 mm Hg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) ≥ 3 Wood units via right heart catheterization. Allowed background therapy included bosentan (maintenance dosing up to 125 mg twice daily) and chronic anticoagulation. The use of prostacyclin or analogue, L–arginine, phosphodiesterase inhibitor, or other chronic PAH medications were not permitted.

Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatment groups (tadalafil 2.5, 10, 20, 40 mg, or placebo) in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio. Subjects had to be at least 12 years of age and had a diagnosis of PAH that was idiopathic, heritable, related to connective tissue disease, anorexigen use, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, associated with an atrial-septal defect, or associated with surgical repair of a congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunt of least 1 year in duration (for example, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). Patients with a history of left-sided heart disease, severe renal insufficiency, or pulmonary hypertension related to conditions other than specified in the inclusion criteria were not eligible for enrollment.

Endothelin receptor antagonists in pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension — bosentan shows clinical improvement with defined safety signals and ambrisentan has limited pediatric experience: A retrospective study of 86 children on bosentan for a median exposure of 14 months reported 2-year survival estimates of 91%, and at 4 years the Kaplan–Meier estimate of disease progression was 54% with survival 82%; bosentan therapy provided short-term improvement in World Health Organization (WHO) functional class and six-minute walk distance (6MWD). Elevated transaminases occurred in 2.7% of children compared with 7.8% of patients ≥ 12 years with discontinuation rates of 14% versus 28%, and bosentan pharmacokinetics were not altered by concurrent sildenafil therapy. For ambrisentan, the incidence of elevated liver function tests was 2.8%, short-term use improved 6MWD in 17 patients with ES, and a retrospective series included 38 pediatric PAH patients treated as add-on or replacement for bosentan with improvement in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) and functional class; macitentan has been approved in adults with PAH with no studies currently reported in children.

Blockade of endothelin receptors

Endothelin 1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and promoter of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferationwhich is upregulated in PAH. There are two ET-1 receptor subtypes: endothelin receptors A (ET A R) and B (ET B R). ET A R is highly expressed in VSMCs and contributes to ET-1-induced contraction and proliferation of VSMCs in PAH.ET B R is predominantly expressed in vascular endothelial cells where activation with ET-1 promotes vasodilation through accelerated production of PGI 2 and nitric oxide (NO) and clearance of ET-1, but is also expressed in VSMCs, where it has vasoconstrictive and proliferative actions.ET receptors are also upregulated in PAH. The dual ERAs bosentan and macitentan, and the selective ET A R antagonist ambrisentan bind and block the ET receptors, preventing ET-1-mediated responses.

Bosentan

Bosentan is a dual ERA, administered orally. It is approved for the treatment of patients with PAH in WHO FC II–IV in the USA and several other regions, and in patients in WHO FC II–III in Europe. It may be associated with increased levels of liver transaminases; therefore patients are started on a low dose, which is up-titrated to the therapeutic dose as long as liver transaminase levels remain normal. Monthly monitoring of liver transaminases is mandatory for patients taking bosentan. Details of the BREATHE-1 and EARLY studies are given in table 3.

Subgroup analyses were performed by dosage of bosentan (125, 250, and 500 mg twice daily), ambrisentan (2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg once daily), and macitentan (3.0 and 10.0 mg once daily). Another subanalysis of ERAs versus placebo was performed according to disease type (PAH and other diseases). In addition, we conducted sensitivity analyses using relative risk and different continuity correction factors to determine whether these choices of analysis methods affected the conclusions.

Pregnancy hypertension — common oral antihypertensive agents and dosing: Labetalol is dosed 200–2400 mg/d orally in 2 to 3 divided doses and is commonly initiated at 100–200 mg twice daily; it has potential bronchoconstrictive effects and should be avoided in women with asthma, preexisting myocardial disease, decompensated cardiac function, and heart block and bradycardia. Nifedipine (extended release) is dosed 30–120 mg/d orally of an extended- release preparation and commonly initiated at 30–60 mg once daily (extended release); do not use sublingual form, and immediate-release formulation should generally be reserved for control of severe, acutely elevated blood pressures in hospitalized patients and should be avoided in tachycardia. Methyldopa is dosed 500–3000 mg/d orally in 2 to 4 divided doses and is commonly initiated at 250 mg 2 or 3 times daily; safety data extend up to 7 y of age in offspring, though it may not be as effective as other medications — especially in control of severe hypertension — and use is limited by side effects (sedation, depression, dizziness). Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–50 mg daily is considered a second- or third-line agent.

### Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor plus endothelin receptor antagonist compared to either alone for group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension [^d053f682]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a rare disorder, causes elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to heart failure. Untreated PAH has a poor prognosis, emphasising the need for effective intervention. Pharmacological treatment includes pulmonary vasodilators such as endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA), prostacyclin analogues, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i), and soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, often used together to improve symptoms and quality of life while reducing mortality and risk of hospitalisation.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of combination therapy involving a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i) and an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) in adults and adolescents with group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) compared to either agent alone.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The most recent searches were conducted on 13 March 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

We included published and unpublished RCTs comparing combinations of ERAs and PDE5is versus either agent alone lasting at least 12 weeks. Participants were aged 12 years or older with WHO group 1 PAH meeting specific haemodynamic criteria. We excluded cluster-, cross-over, and quasi-RCTs, and other PAH-specific medications.

Outcomes

Critical outcomes were clinical worsening, mortality, and hospitalisation. Important outcomes were changes in six-minute walk distance (6MWD), WHO functional class, Borg Dyspnea Scale, serious adverse events, and withdrawal from the trial.

Risk Of Bias

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We resolved disagreements through discussion or consultation. This informed GRADE ratings and summary of findings tables.

Synthesis Methods

We used a random-effects model to address study differences, switching to a fixed-effect model if there was variation primarily due to random error. We conducted meta-analyses if deemed meaningful, with data pooled if treatments, participants, and clinical questions were sufficiently similar.

Included Studies

We included nine studies with 1807 participants. The median duration of the studies was 16 weeks, ranging from 12 to 129 weeks. Treatment regimens included combinations of medications such as ambrisentan, bosentan, macitentan, tadalafil, and sildenafil.

Synthesis Of Results

Combination therapy versus endothelin receptor antagonist Combination therapy reduces clinical worsening compared to ERA alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.68; 113 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 141 fewer to 77 fewer; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial effect (NNTB) 9, 95% CI 7 to 13; 5 trials, 1139 participants; high-certainty evidence). Hospitalisation is likely reduced (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.55; 70 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 83 fewer to 46 fewer; NNTB 14, 95% CI 12 to 22; moderate-certainty evidence). Combination therapy may result in little to no difference in mortality (low-certainty evidence), and a clinically negligible improvement in 6MWD (mean difference (MD) 19.4 m, 95% CI 10.5 to 28.3; moderate-certainty evidence). There was little to no change in Borg Dyspnea Scale (low-certainty evidence). The evidence for WHO functional class was very uncertain. There may be little to no difference in serious adverse events and trial withdrawals between the groups (low-certainty evidence). Combination therapy versus phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of combination treatment on clinical worsening compared to PDE5i alone (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.39; 142 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 298 fewer to 173 more; 4 trials, 1372 participants; very low-certainty evidence), although exclusion of high-bias studies suggested a potential benefit (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.73). The evidence on hospitalisations was very uncertainty, while there was little to no difference in mortality (low-certainty evidence). There was a clinically negligible improvement in 6MWD (MD 20.4 m, 95% CI 10.7 to 30.2; moderate-certainty evidence) and little to no change in Borg Dyspnea Scale (low-certainty evidence). The evidence for WHO functional class was very uncertain. Serious adverse events may be comparable (low-certainty evidence). Combination therapy reduces withdrawal from the trial compared to PDE5i alone (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.99; 64 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 117 fewer to 4 fewer; NNTB 16, 95% CI 9 to 250; low-certainty evidence). Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor versus endothelin receptor antagonist PDE5i likely results in little to no difference in clinical worsening compared to ERA (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.20; 3 trials, 644 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain for mortality and hospitalisation. PDE5i results in little to no difference in 6MWD compared to ERA (MD 18.4 m, 95% CI -50.2 to 86.9; low-certainty evidence). The impact on WHO functional class worsening, serious adverse events, and trial withdrawal was also uncertain, with all outcomes supported by very low- or low-certainty evidence. Overall, current data do not provide reliable conclusions on the relative efficacy or safety of PDE5i versus ERA.

Authors' Conclusions

Combination therapy for PAH offers benefits over monotherapies, reducing clinical worsening compared to ERA alone (high certainty). Their benefits over PDE5i are less certain, although potentially favourable when studies at high risk of bias are excluded. Hospitalisation rates are likely reduced with combination therapy compared to ERA, but the effect is very uncertain when combination therapy is compared to PDE5i. Uncertainty also persists regarding its impact on mortality and functional outcomes, such as 6MWD and WHO functional class. Serious adverse events and withdrawal rates are similar between combination therapy and monotherapies, with varying levels of certainty, although withdrawals may favour combination therapy over PDE5i. Comparative analyses of PDE5i and ERA provided mixed results with varying levels of certainty. These findings could inform whether initial combination therapy should become the standard of care in people with group 1 PAH with WHO functional class levels of II or III. However, the review's limited representation of Black people raises concerns about generalisability, given the observed differences in response to ERAs between Black and White people with PAH in the literature.

### Bosentan [^b7fd2a24]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In another small (N = 8) pharmacokinetic study, the steady-state AUC of bosentan was on average 4.7 times higher and the active metabolite Ro 48–5033 was 12.4 times higher in 5 patients with moderately impaired liver function (Child-Pugh Class B) and PAH associated with portal hypertension than in 3 patients with normal liver function and PAH of other etiologies.

The pharmacokinetics of bosentan have not been evaluated in patients with severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Renal Impairment

In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15 to 30 mL/min), plasma concentrations of bosentan were essentially unchanged and plasma concentrations of the three metabolites were increased about 2-fold compared to subjects with normal renal function. These differences do not appear to be clinically important.

Drug Interactions

Ketoconazole

Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A inhibitor, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 100% in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but increased effects of bosentan should be considered.

### Inhibition of endothelin receptors in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension: does selectivity matter? [^c2674382]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment options for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have considerably improved in the past few years. Endothelin (ET)-receptor antagonism has been established as a first-line option for the majority of PAH patients. Endothelin-receptor antagonists (ETRAs) comprise sulfonamide and non-sulfonamide agents with different affinities for ET-receptor subtypes (ET A and ET B), and the focus of development has shifted from drugs with less selectivity to those with high selectivity. There is ongoing debate as to whether selective or non-selective ET-receptor antagonism is more beneficial in the treatment of PAH. This paper reviews the current evidence from experimental and clinical studies obtained from a thorough literature search focusing on the three marketed drugs bosentan, sitaxentan, and ambrisentan. A clinically meaningful difference among the three approved ETRAs with respect to their ET-receptor selectivity could not be demonstrated to date. Therefore, in clinical practice, other features are likely to be of greater relevance when considering treatment, such as the potential for serious drug–drug interactions, convenience of dosing schedule, or rates of limiting side effects. These characteristics bear more relation to the chemical or pharmacological properties of the drugs than to receptor selectivity itself.

### Bosentan in treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension… [^10cef89b]. ClinicalTrials (2005). Low credibility.

Bosentan in Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial HypertensionClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Eisenmenger's syndrome presents as a severe clinical picture of polymorbidity that constitutes a great burden at the individual as well as the familial and social level. The combination of critically increased pulmonary vascular resistance, progressive pressure load of the right ventricle and disturbance of pulmonary gas exchange result in long-term polymorbidity. While the patient's ability to care for him-/ herself gets lost over time, the financial burden due to the need for medical consultations and hospital stays increases. This is distressing to both the patient and the family. Usually, death results from cardiac decompensation in the presence of gradually increasing pulmonary vascular resistance and hypoxic lesion of organs including the myocardium.

With a better understanding of the pathophysiology underlying pulmonary hypertension, novel therapeutic approaches have been developed during the past few years. These include a) inhibition of the NO-cGMP-degrading type 5 phosphodiesterase and b) antagonising the endothelin system. The goal is a dilatation of the abnormally constricted pulmonary arterial vessels by relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle cells with a reversal of pulmonary vascular remodelling. Considering this, oral treatments appear preferable, because of easy administration and, hence, better patient compliance. Bosentan is a non-selective endothelin receptor antagonist with dual binding and complete blocking of endothelin-1. It is the first drug of this class that was approved for the lowering of pulmonary vascular resistance.

Significant effects on haemodynamics and exercise tolerance were demonstrated for both monotherapy and add-on treatment with inhalational and parenteral prostanoids. In children with at least 10 kg body weight, bosentan significantly improved pulomary haemodynamics, while pharmacokinetics was found to be comparable to that in adults. Good long-term tolerability and effectiveness over a period of one year were demonstrated. Moreover, in animal models of increased pulmonary blood flow activation of the endothelin system was absent under bosentan treatment and both haemodynamic and morphological changes were prevented. Available data suggest that the effects of bosentan are not limited to primary pulmonary hypertension. Further studies are required to prove its effectiveness in pulmonary hypertension of various aetiologies.

The objective of this study is to look into the effects of medium-term pulmonary pressure-lowering treatment with oral bosentan in patients with congenital heart defects and clinically relevant pulmonary arterial hypertension, taking advantage of extensive diagnostic procedures. The data obtained are supposed to contribute to the development of guidelines for the treatment of PAH caused by congenital heart defects. The data will be further evaluated in terms of health economics. The hypotheses are:

- Bosentan specifically improves the pulomonary vascular damage caused by hypercirculation. As an immediate effect, it blocks vasoconstriction, and on the long run, it reverts pulmonary vascular remodelling.
- In patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome, this results in a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance and a normalization of pulmonary vascular responsiveness.

Methods

Data Sources and Searches

We conducted this review according to the methods recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration and documented the process and results in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses statement for reporting systematic reviews. 10, 11 A systematic English‐language search of the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library electronic databases and thewebsite was conducted to identify all potential eligible trials (up to October 2015). Key terms used for the systematic search were "endothelin receptor antagonists or bosentan or ambrisentan or macitentan" and "clinical trial or controlled clinical trial or randomized controlled trial". References of all pertinent articles were further scrutinized to ensure that all relevant studies were identified.

Study Selection

The following inclusion criteria for study selection were used: double‐blind randomized controlled trials; human participants; patients with any types of disease; studies consisting of at least 1 group receiving bosentan, ambrisentan, or macitentan therapy; studies including only adults (aged > 18 years); and studies reporting relevant adverse events for ERAs and placebo groups separately. For multiple publications of 1 randomized controlled trial, we included the publication most relevant to our inclusion criteria in terms of detailed reporting of adverse events.

### Drug-drug interactions in the management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^0cc4a632]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

The management of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has become more complex in recent years because of increased pharmacotherapy options and longer patient survival with increasing numbers of comorbidities. As such, more opportunities exist for drug-drug interactions between PAH-targeted medications and medications potentially used to treat comorbid conditions. In this review, we provide an overview of pharmaceutical metabolism by cytochrome P450 and discuss important drug-drug interactions for the 14 Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for PAH in the nitric oxide (NO), endothelin, and prostacyclin pathways. Among the targets in the NO pathway (sildenafil, tadalafil, and riociguat), important interactions with nitrates, protease inhibitors, and other phosphodiesterase inhibitors can cause profound hypotension. In the endothelin pathway, bosentan is associated with more drug interactions via CYP3A4 inhibition; macitentan and ambrisentan have fewer interactions of note. Although the parenteral therapies in the prostacyclin pathway bypass significant liver metabolism and avoid drug interactions, selexipag and oral treprostinil may exhibit interactions with CYP2C8 inhibitors such as gemfibrozil and clopidogrel, which can raise drug levels. Finally, we provide a framework for identifying potential drug-drug interactions and avoiding errors.

### Drug-drug interactions in the management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^ac173d7e]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) is an enzyme that plays a fundamental role in the metabolism of medications. Drugs with CYP450 activity may be inhibitors, inducers, substrates, or a combination thereof for a specific CYP450 enzymatic pathway that can change the metabolism of concurrently administered medications. Inhibitors are substances that reduce an enzymatic pathway of CYP450 and may cause increased concentrations of other drugs metabolized by the same pathway, resulting in drug toxicity. Inducers are substances that induce an enzymatic pathway of CYP450, which may increase metabolism of other drugs by the same pathway, leading to subtherapeutic drug levels and treatment failure. Although more than 50 isoforms of CYP450 have been discovered, six of them (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19) metabolize 90% of drugs, with the two most significant enzymes being CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.

As our understanding of CYP450 metabolism continues to grow, new agents undergo extensive drug interaction studies performed before becoming available. However, not all agents have been tested in combination, and at times drug interactions are hypothesized based on known metabolic pathways. As a result, drug-drug interactions may include the magnification of known potential adverse effects. Not all cytochrome P450-mediated drug interactions are clinically significant, and thus may or may not require dosage adjustments. Active drug transporters, P-glycoprotein, and human organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs), also play an important role in drug elimination and affect the bioavailability of a number of drugs by controlling their movement into and out of cells. Refer to Table 1 for commonly used medications with known CYP450, P-glycoprotein, and OATP activity. Knowledge of the drugs metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, active drug transporters, and the most potent inhibiting and inducing drugs can help to minimize the possibility of adverse drug reactions and interactions or therapeutic failures.

Approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2007, ambrisentan is the second oral endothelin A-receptor antagonist available for the management of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with World Health Organization class II or III symptoms.

Objective

This article examines the clinical pharmacology of ambrisentan, its efficacy and adverse effects, and future directions for research.

Methods

Pertinent articles and abstracts were identified through searches of MEDLINE and Current Contents from 1966 to January 15, 2008, using the term ambrisentan. The reference lists of identified articles were searched for additional publications. Abstracts presented at professional meetings from 2005 through 2007 were also reviewed.

Results

The literature review identified 3 studies of ambrisentan in PAH: 1 dose-ranging study; 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies; and 1 drug-conversion study. In the dose-ranging study, ambrisentan at doses of 1 to 10 mg was associated with significant improvements from baseline in the 6-minute walk distance at 12 weeks that ranged from 33.9 m with ambrisentan 1 mg (P = 0.003) to 38.1 m with ambrisentan 5 mg (P = 0.001). In the placebo-controlled studies, ambrisentan at doses of 2.5 to 10 mg/d was associated with significant improvements versus placebo in the 6-minute walk distance at 12 weeks that ranged from 22 m with ambrisentan 2.5 mg (P = 0.022) to 59 m with ambrisentan 5 mg (P ≤ 0.001). Improvements were sustained for up to 1 year. Patients who had elevations in serum aminotransferases during previous therapy with bosentan or sitaxsentan therapy were able to make a successful transition to ambrisentan without further abnormalities in liver function. Ambrisentan was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse effects associated with ambrisentan in clinical trials were peripheral edema (17%), nasal congestion (6%), palpitation (5%), constipation (4%), flushing (4%), abdominal pain (3%), nasopharyngitis (3%), and sinusitis (3%). In the placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of liver aminotransferase and bilirubin abnormalities at 12 weeks was lower with ambrisentan than with placebo (0.8% vs 2.3%, respectively).

Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that ambrisentan is effective and well tolerated in the management of PAH. Areas for future research include the long-term safety of ambrisentan, its potential for drug interactions with other agents commonly used by patients with PAH, and its efficacy relative to other agents used to manage PAH.

### Safety and efficacy of inhaled treprostinil as add-on therapy to bosentan in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^339ef0f3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of inhaled treprostinil as add-on therapy to oral bosentan in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Background

The addition of a long-acting prostacyclin analogue via the inhaled route might be a safe and effective strategy to optimize therapy in PAH patients on bosentan.

Methods

Twelve patients with symptomatic PAH despite bosentan received either 30 microg of inhaled treprostinil 4 times daily (n = 6) or 45 microg 4 times daily (n = 6), via an ultrasonic nebulizer. Six-min walk distance (6MWD), functional class, and hemodynamics were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks.

Results

One patient was excluded from analysis due to the subsequent finding of pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. In the remaining 11 patients, inhaled treprostinil was safe and well tolerated. Inhaled treprostinil was associated with an increase in 6MWD at 12 weeks (baseline 339 ± 86, 12 week, 1 h post-inhalation 406 ± 121 m, 67-m change, p = 0.01). An improvement in 6MWD of 49 m from baseline was noted during the trough period, just before inhalation of treprostinil (p = 0.009). The 6MWD improvement of at least 10% was noted in 1 of 6 patients receiving 30 microg versus 5 of 6 receiving 45 microg. Over 12 weeks, significant decreases were noted in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (-10%) and in pulmonary vascular resistance (-26%). Functional class improved from III to II in 9 of 11 patients.

Conclusions

This trial suggests that inhaled treprostinil is safe, well tolerated, and associated with significant improvements in exercise capacity, functional class, and pulmonary hemodynamics in symptomatic patients with PAH on bosentan.

### Treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension with the selective endothelin – A receptor antagonist sitaxsentan [^dea5d511]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to determine the optimal dose of the selective endothelin A (ET(A)) receptor antagonist sitaxsentan for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); for observation only, an open-label (OL) bosentan arm was included.

Background

Endothelin is a mediator of PAH. In a preliminary PAH study, the selective ET(A) receptor antagonist sitaxsentan improved six-min walk (6MW) distance, World Health Organization (WHO) functional class (FC), and hemodynamics.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled 18-week study, 247 PAH patients (idiopathic, or associated with connective tissue disease or congenital heart disease) were randomized; 245 patients were treated: placebo (n = 62), sitaxsentan 50 mg (n = 62) or 100 mg (n = 61), or OL (6MW tests, Borg dyspnea scores, and WHO FC assessments third-party blind) bosentan (n = 60). The primary end point was change in 6MW distance from baseline to week 18. Secondary end points included change in WHO FC, time to clinical worsening, and change in Borg dyspnea score.

Results

At week 18, patients treated with sitaxsentan 100 mg had an increased 6MW distance compared with the placebo group (31.4 m, p = 0.03), and an improved WHO FC (p = 0.04). The placebo-subtracted treatment effect for sitaxsentan 50 mg was 24.2 m (p = 0.07) and for OL bosentan, 29.5 m (p = 0.05). The incidence of elevated hepatic transaminases (> 3x the upper limit of normal) was 6% for placebo, 5% for sitaxsentan 50 mg, 3% for sitaxsentan 100 mg, and 11% for bosentan.

Conclusions

Treatment with the selective ET(A) receptor antagonist sitaxsentan, orally once daily at a dose of 100 mg, improves exercise capacity and WHO FC in PAH patients, with a low incidence of hepatic toxicity.

### Pharmacologic therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^a1263ba7]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Treatment naive PAH patients without symptoms (WHO FC I) and patients at increased risk — For treatment naive PAH patients with WHO FC I symptoms, we suggest continued monitoring for the development of symptoms that would signal disease progression and warrant the initiation of pharmacotherapy (Grade CB). We suggest that patients at risk for the development of PAH (eg, patients with systemic sclerosis or the presence of a known mutation placing the patient at risk for PAH) be monitored for the development of symptoms of PAH (Grade CB). We suggest also that contributing causes of PH (eg, sleep apnea and systemic hypertension) in patients with PAH be treated aggressively (Grade CB).

Pulmonary arterial hypertension — endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs): Endothelin-1 exerts vasoconstrictor and mitogenic effects by binding to endothelin receptors type A and B. Ambrisentan preferentially binds endothelin receptor type A, and reports note that the incidence of abnormal liver function tests ranges from 0.8 to 3%, that monthly liver function assessment is not mandated in the USA, and that an increased incidence of peripheral oedema has been reported with ambrisentan use. Bosentan, an oral dual endothelin receptor antagonist, has been associated with increases in hepatic aminotransferases in approximately 10% of patients, which were dose dependent and reversible after dose reduction or discontinuation, and liver function tests should be performed monthly in patients receiving bosentan. Macitentan was evaluated in an event-driven RCT in which 742 PAH patients received 3 mg or 10 mg for an average of 100 weeks; while no liver toxicity was shown, reduction in blood haemoglobin ≤ 8 g/dL occurred in 4.3% of patients receiving 10 mg of macitentan.

### Inhibition of endothelin receptors in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension: does selectivity matter? [^3d5a87e4]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Consequently, drug surveillance programmes (named TRAcleer eXcellence Post-Marketing Surveillance Programme, TRAX, for bosentan, Thelin Outcomes for Patients Surveillance, TOPS, for sitaxsentan, and VOLibris Tracking, VOLT, for ambrisentan) had/have to be conducted in the first years after introduction for all ETRAs. In the USA, the marketed drugs (bosentan and ambrisentan) can only be prescribed in the frameworks of special restricted distribution programmes.

It is a useful finding that in case of elevated transaminases, a switch to another ETRA may be an option. The STRIDE-6 studyaimed to explore the potential use of sitaxentan in PAH patients who previously discontinued bosentan treatment (13 patients owing to 'safety issues', 12 patients with aminotransferase elevations, and one patient with rash). Among the 12 patients with liver enzyme elevations on bosentan treatment, only one individual re-developed this side effect during 12 weeks of sitaxentan therapy. An open-label study of ambrisentan evaluated the hypothesis that patients previously discontinued from bosentan (86%), sitaxentan (6%), or both (8%) because of elevations in hepatic aminotransferases can be successfully treated with ambrisentan without recurrence of hepatotoxicity. None of these 36 patients developed recurrent liver transaminase elevations during the initial 12 week observation period. In conclusion, among the various ETRAs currently available for the treatment of patients with PAH, receptor selectivity itself does not appear to be related to the incidence of hepatotoxicity. It is likely that chemical properties of the drugs, the pharmacokinetics or drug–drug interactions, or patient characteristics, may influence the incidence and severity of the side effects rather than differences in ET-receptor selectivity.
