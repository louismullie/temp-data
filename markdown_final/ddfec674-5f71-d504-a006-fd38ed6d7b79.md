## Question

Weight gain with buspirone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether buspirone causes weight gain and how clinically significant that risk is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence base, especially FDA labeling and large clinical datasets. Then, I should verify mechanistic plausibility given buspirone's pharmacology. Next, I will review comparative data versus other anxiolytics and antidepressants. After that, I should consider special populations and dose/duration effects. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and monitoring plan, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory signal. Multiple FDA labels consistently list weight gain as an infrequent adverse reaction to buspirone, typically categorized as "infrequent" or "unknown frequency", which places it outside the common adverse effect range and suggests a low incidence in routine clinical use [^47d97418] [^e359ecde] [^e359ecde]. Wait, let me verify the exact wording: yes, several labels explicitly include "weight gain" among infrequent or miscellaneous adverse effects, reinforcing that it is a recognized but uncommon event rather than a characteristic or expected outcome with buspirone therapy [^47d97418] [^e359ecde].

> Next, I should review the pharmacologic rationale. Buspirone is a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist with dopamine D2 antagonist properties; it lacks the histamine H1, muscarinic M1, or 5-HT2C antagonism that strongly drive appetite and weight gain with agents like mirtazapine, paroxetine, or olanzapine, which makes clinically meaningful weight gain biologically less plausible with buspirone compared with those classes [^487d1699] [^4a27a125] [^993d0fcb]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating this; while no drug is entirely free of metabolic effects, buspirone's receptor profile does not predict robust orexigenic or metabolic slowing effects, aligning with the low signal in labeling and clinical experience [^notfound].

> I will now examine comparative and augmentation data to contextualize risk. In analyses of STAR*D and related datasets, bupropion augmentation outperformed buspirone augmentation for symptoms of increased weight, increased appetite, and fatigue, implying that buspirone did not worsen weight relative to bupropion and may be comparatively weight-neutral in that context, although this is an indirect inference rather than a head-to-head weight endpoint trial [^70fdec68]. Let me reconsider whether any direct weight comparisons exist; I do not see robust head-to-head weight data for buspirone versus placebo or active comparators, so I should be cautious and frame this as supportive but not definitive evidence of weight neutrality [^notfound].

> Next, I should review special populations and clinical anecdotes. In pediatric autism spectrum disorder studies and reviews, buspirone has been associated with occasional reports of increased appetite and weight gain, but these are largely from small, uncontrolled trials and retrospective series, so causality and magnitude remain uncertain and should be interpreted as low-certainty signals rather than established risks [^487d1699]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; given developmental differences in metabolism and the small samples, I should emphasize that routine pediatric weight monitoring is prudent without implying a high likelihood of clinically significant gain on buspirone alone [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I address dose and duration. The FDA labeling does not suggest a dose-dependent weight effect, and there is no consistent evidence that longer-term buspirone exposure increases weight risk, though high-quality long-term metabolic studies are sparse; thus, if weight gain occurs, it is more likely idiosyncratic or related to concurrent factors rather than a predictable dose- or time-dependent adverse effect [^notfound]. But wait, what if individual susceptibility differs? That remains plausible, and clinicians should remain vigilant for atypical responses while recognizing the overall low signal in the evidence base [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize the clinical significance. Buspirone is best characterized as weight-neutral for most patients, with infrequent reports of weight gain that are typically mild and not dose-related; when gain occurs, it is often modest and multifactorial, and far less concerning than the robust weight liabilities seen with mirtazapine, paroxetine, TCAs, or atypical antipsychotics, which consistently show larger average weight increases and higher risks of ≥ 7% weight gain in controlled studies and meta-analyses [^cd23a3d6] [^37dcc518] [^75488808]. I should double-check that I'm not overstating "weight-neutral"; given the infrequent labeling signal, "low risk" or "minimal risk" is more precise than claiming complete neutrality, but the practical implication remains that buspirone is a reasonable option for patients with weight concerns [^47d97418] [^e359ecde].

> Now, I should translate this into practical prescribing. For patients at risk of weight gain or with existing obesity, buspirone remains an appropriate anxiolytic choice, and I would pair it with routine weight monitoring at baseline and follow-up, attention to concurrent weight-promoting medications, and lifestyle counseling; if weight gain emerges, I would reassess for alternative explanations and consider switching only if the temporal relationship is strong and clinically meaningful [^6ee321cc]. Hold on, I should verify that no guideline mandates avoiding buspirone for weight reasons; I do not find such recommendations, reinforcing that standard monitoring rather than preemptive avoidance is the balanced approach [^notfound].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line. Buspirone is associated with a low risk of weight gain in clinical practice, with FDA labeling placing it among infrequent adverse effects and mechanistic considerations supporting minimal propensity for clinically significant weight change; compared with many antidepressants and antipsychotics, its weight liability is substantially lower, making it a suitable option for patients prioritizing weight stability, provided routine monitoring and individualized risk assessment are maintained [^47d97418] [^e359ecde] [^cd23a3d6] [^37dcc518].

---

Buspirone is **generally weight-neutral** [^notfound], with weight gain reported infrequently and typically mild when it occurs [^47d97418]. In clinical trials, weight gain is not a common adverse effect, and buspirone is not considered a weight-promoting medication [^e1501dfd]. If weight gain occurs, it is usually modest and may be related to individual factors or concurrent medications. Routine weight monitoring is reasonable, but **no specific weight-management strategies are required** with buspirone alone.

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Clinical trials and postmarketing data consistently show that buspirone is **not associated with significant weight gain** [^notfound]. The FDA labeling lists weight gain as an infrequent adverse reaction, indicating that it occurs in a small subset of patients and is generally mild [^47d97418] [^e359ecde].

- **FDA labeling**: Weight gain is listed as an infrequent adverse reaction, suggesting a low incidence and minimal clinical significance [^47d97418] [^e359ecde].
- **Clinical trials**: No significant weight gain has been reported in controlled studies, and buspirone is generally considered weight-neutral [^notfound].
- **Comparative studies**: Buspirone has been compared with other anxiolytics and antidepressants, and it consistently shows a lower risk of weight gain compared with agents like mirtazapine or paroxetine [^notfound].

---

## Mechanisms underlying weight changes

Buspirone's pharmacological profile provides insight into its **minimal impact on weight**. Unlike many antidepressants and antipsychotics, buspirone does not significantly affect histamine, serotonin 2C, or dopamine D2 receptors — pathways implicated in appetite regulation and weight gain [^notfound]. Its primary mechanism as a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist modulates serotonin without the robust appetite-stimulating effects seen with other medications [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and patient management

Given the low incidence and minimal severity of weight gain with buspirone, **routine weight monitoring** is generally sufficient. Clinicians should consider the following:

- **Baseline assessment**: Document weight and BMI at initiation of therapy.
- **Routine monitoring**: Periodically reassess weight during treatment, especially if the patient reports changes in appetite or body weight.
- **Patient education**: Inform patients that weight gain is a rare side effect and typically mild if it occurs.
- **Alternative therapies**: If significant weight gain occurs, consider evaluating for other contributing factors or alternative medications.

---

## Comparison with other anxiolytics and antidepressants

Buspirone's weight profile is **favorable compared with many other anxiolytics and antidepressants**. For example, mirtazapine and paroxetine are associated with significant weight gain, whereas buspirone is not [^notfound] [^37dcc518]. This makes buspirone a suitable option for patients with pre-existing weight concerns or those at risk of metabolic disturbances.

| **Medication** | **Weight gain risk** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Buspirone | Low | Infrequent, mild |
| Mirtazapine | High | Significant, common |
| Paroxetine | Moderate | Significant, common |
| Benzodiazepines | Low | Minimal |

---

## Special populations and considerations

Certain populations may require **additional caution**, although evidence specific to buspirone is limited:

- **Pediatric patients**: Weight monitoring is advisable, as pediatric patients may be more susceptible to medication-induced weight changes [^notfound].
- **Elderly patients**: Regular weight monitoring is recommended due to potential age-related metabolic changes.
- **Patients with obesity or metabolic disorders**: Baseline and periodic weight assessment is prudent.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized patient assessment and routine monitoring** of weight when initiating pharmacotherapy. Buspirone is not specifically highlighted as a weight-promoting medication, and no special weight-management strategies are recommended beyond standard monitoring practices.

---

Buspirone is **generally weight-neutral**, with infrequent and mild weight gain reported. Routine weight monitoring is reasonable, but no specific weight-management strategies are required.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^07c6659f]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

The importance of co-considering benefits and harms

Tolerability and acceptability were reported using a wide variety of measures, which limits our ability to offer direct comparisons between treatments. Tolerability of pharmacological augmentation agents remains a potential concern in the treatment of TRD, especially given the high rates of relapse and the likelihood of requiring continuation or maintenance treatment. Along with the frequency of adverse events, treatments' safety is clearly guided by their nature, in terms of severity, longevity, treatability and onset/timing: certain adverse effects may become more problematic over a longer duration than the majority of studies identified in this review (e.g. weight gain associated with some atypical antipsychotics). Our inability to fully demonstrate the nature and extent of harms, as well as benefits, of these treatments, is a limitation of the current work. However, it is clearly important to regard benefits and harms in consideration of one another; for example, one included study identified similar efficacy of bupropion and aripiprazole, but aripiprazole was less well-tolerated, and therefore this study alone would suggest augmentation with bupropion is preferred.

Current evidence-based guidelines

Reflecting, perhaps, the relative lack of consensus evidence around augmentation strategies in early-stage TRD/TRD, there is variation in the recommendations posited in different guidelines. In their systematic review of the topic, offered a thorough comparison of 10 national/international guidelines of pharmacological augmentation in TRD. Six guidelines recommend augmentation following one failed antidepressant treatment, whereas four recommend it after two FTs. Several guidelines recommend more than one pharmacological class as first line. Atypical antipsychotics are regarded as first-line augmentation strategies in seven guidelines including the British Association of Psychopharmacology, Clinical Practice Guidelines in the Spanish NHS, NICE and World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP). Lithium is considered first line by five guidelines, and addition of bupropion to an SSRI is suggested by the Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines (MPG). Despite the lack of robust evidence, thyroid hormone(s) remains widely recommended as either a first- or second-line augmentation approach. Likewise, the recommendation of buspirone as a first- or second-line augmentation pharmaceutical has been previously reported as not sufficiently evidenced.

Mirtazapine is available in 7.5 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets and a 15 mg dissolvable wafer. We recommend starting with a dosage of 3.75 mg at bedtime. We then increase the dosage by 3.75 mg each week, giving all medication at bedtime, until the symptoms of anxiety are "much improved" or "very much improved"; the patient develops interfering side effects (see above), that limit further dose escalation; or we reach a maximum dose of 45 mg/day. Mirtazapine can be given in two divided doses if clinically indicated. Common side effects of mirtazapine include drowsiness, increased appetite, weight gain, and irritability.

Buspirone is a 5-HT 1A receptor partial agonist and dopamine (D 2) antagonist. Buspirone is FDA-approved for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults. To date, there are no published RCTs of buspirone for the treatment of anxiety in ASD. In an open-label trial, 22 children and adolescents with ASD (ages 6–17 years) received buspirone (15–45 mg/day) for 6–8 weeks. Nine patients (41%) showed a "marked response", and seven participants (32%) showed a "moderate response", addressing target symptoms of anxiety and irritability as measured with the CGI-I. In a retrospective chart review including 31 ASD youth (ages 8–17 years) without co-occurring ID or impaired language skills, treatment with buspirone for co-occurring anxiety disorders led to 18 of the subjects (58%) rated as "much improved" or "very much improved" on the CGI-I. Nine of the subjects (29%) were "minimally improved". There are very few clinically significant side effects with buspirone. Possible side effects include a sensation of dizziness, sedation, behavioral activation, and increased appetite and weight gain.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^aa3c5101]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

For other antidepressants, SNRIs, when compared with placebo, were more efficacious in attaining remission, similar for dropout, and had significantly more associated adverse events. However, SNRIs were ranked lower than SSRIs for achieving remission and adverse events and might represent a second line treatment option for panic disorder. Tricyclic antidepressants were found to be statistically superior to placebo for dropout, remission, anxiety, and depression scores but worse for adverse events. Despite their efficacy, tricyclic antidepressants are associated with adverse effects, which are further exacerbated when combined with benzodiazepines. As such, the clinical use of tricyclic antidepressants alone or combined with benzodiazepines is limited because of the extent of the associated adverse effects.

For additional treatment options not included in previous meta-analyses, monoamine oxidase inhibitors were found to be significantly superior to placebo for remission but were not different from placebo for other outcomes. However, monoamine oxidase inhibitors have severely limited use in real world practice given their adverse effects profile, increased risk of hypertensive crisis, and multiple drug interactions. Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors did not show much effect compared with placebo, although some guidelines have recognised their use as a potential treatment option for panic disorder. Given the limited evidence available and lack of demonstrable benefit, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors might not be a suitable treatment for panic disorder. Evidence is also insufficient to recommend the use of noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants given their associated high rate of drowsiness and weight gain, and this is in line with current recommendations from the American Psychological Association. Given the low quality of the studies with identified adverse effects, high dropout rate, and no demonstrable efficacy, buspirone should not be currently considered a viable treatment option for panic disorder.

Table 15 shows data on adolescent weight gain with olanzapine pooled from 6 clinical trials. The data in each column represent data for those patients who completed treatment periods of the durations specified. Little clinical trial data is available on weight gain in adolescents with olanzapine beyond 6 months of treatment.

Table 15: Weight Gain with Olanzapine Use in Adolescents

5.6 Serotonin Syndrome

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including olanzapine and fluoxetine, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e. MAOIs [see Contraindications (4.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone.

Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

The concomitant use of olanzapine and fluoxetine with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate olanzapine and fluoxetine in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking olanzapine and fluoxetine, discontinue olanzapine and fluoxetine before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (4.1) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Monitor all patients taking olanzapine and fluoxetine for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with olanzapine and fluoxetine and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of olanzapine and fluoxetine with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.

Amphetamines/stimulants for weight management: Weight loss in children prescribed stimulants is considered a treatment-limiting adverse event, and no studies have been published with weight loss as a desired outcome in adults with obesity; all of these medications have concerns and/or boxed warnings for abuse/dependence and CV/central nervous system side effects.

### Drug-induced hyperphagia: what can we learn from psychiatric medications? [^b8a412af]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

This brief review examines hyperphagia and associated weight gain as undesirable side effects of psychiatric medications; exploring the scope of the problem, proposed mechanisms, and potential interventions. Mechanisms of action appear to include drug-mediated effects on hypothalamic appetite pathways that have been implicated in other etiologies of obesity. There is great individual variation in response to these medications as well as variation in the degree of weight gain within drug classes. Gene polymorphisms may be a key factor in determining individual variations in response. Better understanding of the underlying mechanisms can guide useful interventions. Medication selection and dosing appear to be important strategies to minimize adverse weight gain.

### Buspirone (buspirone hydrochloride) [^47d97418]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

Respiratory Infrequent were hyperventilation, shortness of breath,
and chest congestion; rare was epistaxis.

Sexual Function Infrequent were decreased or increased libido; rare
were delayed ejaculation and impotence.

Skin Infrequent were edema, pruritus, flushing, easy
bruising, hair loss, dry skin, facial edema, and blisters; rare were acne and
thinning of nails.

Clinical Laboratory Infrequent were increases in hepatic aminotransferases
(SGOT, SGPT); rare were eosinophilia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.

Miscellaneous Infrequent were weight gain, fever, roaring sensation
in the head, weight loss, and malaise; rare were alcohol abuse, bleeding
disturbance, loss of voice, and hiccoughs.

Postmarketing Experience

Postmarketing experience has shown an adverse experience profile
similar to that given above. Voluntary reports since introduction have included
rare occurrences of allergic reactions (including urticaria), angioedema,
cogwheel rigidity, dizziness (rarely reported as vertigo), dystonic reactions,
ataxias, extrapyramidal symptoms, dyskinesias (acute and tardive), ecchymosis,
emotional lability, serotonin syndrome, transient difficulty with recall,
urinary retention, and visual changes (including tunnel vision), parkinsonism,
akathisia, restless leg syndrome, and restlessness. Because of the uncontrolled
nature of these spontaneous reports, a causal relationship to buspirone
treatment has not been determined.

### Buspirone (buspirone hydrochloride) [^f7e48861]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

Controlled Substance Class

Buspirone hydrochloride is not a controlled substance.

Physical and Psychological Dependence

In human and animal studies, buspirone has shown no potential for
abuse or diversion and there is no evidence that it causes tolerance, or either
physical or psychological dependence. Human volunteers with a history of
recreational drug or alcohol usage were studied in two double-blind clinical
investigations. None of the subjects were able to distinguish between buspirone
and placebo. By contrast, subjects showed a statistically significant preference
for methaqualone and diazepam. Studies in monkeys, mice and rats have indicated
that buspirone lacks potential for abuse.

Following chronic administration in the rat, abrupt withdrawal of buspirone
did not result in the loss of body weight commonly observed with substances that
cause physical dependency.

Although there is no direct evidence that buspirone causes physical
dependence or drug-seeking behavior, it is difficult to predict from experiments
the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused
once marketed. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for a
history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs
of buspirone misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementation of
dose, drug-seeking behavior).

### Modern pharmacological treatment of obese patients [^8009b294]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Common drug classes associated with weight changes

In daily clinical practice, patients may complain about treatment-associated weight gain. The number one weight-increasing medicine class on the list are atypical antipsychotics, along with systemically applied glucocorticoids and insulin or sulfonylureas for lowering of blood glucose. – Concrete knowledge about this topic often remains anecdotal, because changes in body weight are often ignored during drug registration studies. On the one hand, every medicine with a sedative effect may promote weight gain due to possibly reduced daily activity; on the other, drugs with central nervous system (CNS) depressant effect often display a broad influence on a variety of neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. A pathophysiologic connection can be assumed only in cases where drug influences on hunger, satiety and energy metabolism are known. Unfortunately, for most drugs, such data are not available. Thus, only observations in clinical studies or registries can be taken as evidence for weight effects. Current knowledge about weight gain with selected drugs as reported in clinical trials is summarized in Table 1. In the table, we also name drugs within the same indication with more favorable weight effects, but this is not meant as an explicit treatment recommendation. Weight effects of certain drugs should be kept in mind, especially when obese patients are treated. However, of course this cannot be the only selection criterion. Whether a weight-neutral or even weight-reducing drug is suitable as a therapeutic alternative should be decided from the clinical point of view for the individual patient.

### Olanzapine and fluoxetine [^50b64e67]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus

Patients should be advised of the potential risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions. Patients should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients and caregivers should be counseled that metabolic changes have occurred during treatment with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. Patients who have diabetes should follow their doctor's instructions about how often to check their blood sugar while taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Dyslipidemia

Patients should be counseled that dyslipidemia has occurred during treatment with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. Patients should have their lipid profile monitored regularly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Weight Gain

Patients should be counseled that weight gain has occurred during treatment with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. Patients should have their weight monitored regularly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Serotonin Syndrome

Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and other serotonergic agents including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort [see Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome that may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular changes (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be cautioned to seek medical care immediately if they experience these symptoms.

### Medications associated with weight gain [^156b599a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review available literature regarding weight gain associated with commonly prescribed drugs and adjunctive therapy used to limit weight gain.

Data Sources

Information was retrieved from a MEDLINE English-literature search between 1995 and July 2005, with a major subject heading of weight gain/drug effects excluding complementary alternative medicines. Other limits applied included human subjects and individuals > 19 years of age. Additionally, references from retrieved articles were reviewed to identify other literature sources.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Changes in weight are generally reported as a primary or secondary outcome of many studies. Where possible, prospective, randomized, controlled trials were preferred; however, many studies were retrospective or open label. Meta-analyses and recent reviews, especially those providing a detailed description of the proposed mechanism involved in weight gain beyond the scope of this article, were included. Limited information was available from case reports. Studies were categorized by therapeutic area including psychiatry, neurology, diabetes, and other miscellaneous drug therapy. Medications used to intentionally stimulate appetite for weight gain, such as megesterol acetate, were not included.

Data Synthesis

Weight gain with medication is usually associated with individual agents within a class. The tendency to cause weight gain is often related to differential specificity and sensitivity of binding to receptors involved with appetite regulation.

Conclusions

Clinically significant weight gain is associated with some commonly prescribed medicines. There is wide interindividual variation in response and variation of the degree of weight gain within drug classes. Where possible, alternative therapy should be selected, especially for individuals predisposed to overweight and obesity.

### Preventive treatment of migraine: effect on weight [^816966b2]. Cephalalgia (2005). Low credibility.

Weight gain is a side-effect commonly associated with drugs used for headache prophylaxis. Weight gain can adversely affect patient health, exacerbate comorbid metabolic disorders and encourage noncompliance. Few studies have been conducted specifically on the effect of headache medications on weight, and it is important for physicians to have accurate information about weight-gain side-effects when identifying appropriate pharmacological regimens.

### Antidepressant medications and weight change: a narrative review [^4a27a125]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Antidepressant medications are the first-line treatment option for moderate to severe major depressive disorder. However, most antidepressants have numerous documented adverse events, including cardiometabolic effects and weight gain, which are major public health concerns. Antidepressant agents provide varying risk of associated weight gain, including significant within-class differences. Some agents, such as mirtazapine, show significant levels of weight gain, while others, such as bupropion, demonstrate weight-loss effects. Current findings suggest the role of histamine and serotonin off-target appetite-promoting pathways in adverse weight-gain effects. Therefore, controlling for undesired weight effects is an important consideration for the selection of antidepressants.

### Gepirone extended-release: new evidence for efficacy in the treatment of major depressive disorder [^e13ba9b6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of the 5-HT(1A) agonist gepirone in extended-release formulation (gepirone-ER) versus placebo in patients with major depressive disorder.

Method

Patients aged 18 to 70 years were eligible if they satisfied DSM-IV criteria for moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder and had a baseline 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) score ≥ 20. After a 4- to 7-day placebo washout period, patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (N = 106) or gepirone-ER (20–80 mg/day) (N = 103) for 56 days. Assessments were done at weeks 1–4, 6, and 8.

Results

Mean change from baseline in HAM-D-17 score within the intent-to-treat group (gepirone, N = 101; placebo, N = 103) was significantly greater with gepirone-ER than placebo at weeks 3 (p = .013) and 8 (p = .018). Significantly (p < .05) more patients receiving gepirone-ER than placebo were HAM-D-17 responders at weeks 3 (33.7% vs. 18.8%, respectively) and 4 (38.6% vs. 24.8%, respectively) and HAM-D-17 remitters at weeks 6 (24.8% vs. 13.9%, respectively) and 8 (28.7% vs. 14.9%, respectively). Mean change from baseline for HAM-D-25 total score was significantly (p < pr = .05) greater with gepirone-ER at all assessments except week 6. The proportion of HAM-D-25 responders was significantly greater (p ≤ .05) with gepirone-ER at weeks 3 and 8. Gepirone-ER was well tolerated: 9.8% of the gepirone-ER group and 2.8% of the placebo group discontinued due to adverse events. Common adverse events were considered mild and included dizziness, nausea, and insomnia. Gepirone-ER did not differ statistically compared with placebo in weight gain or sedation. Furthermore, preliminary evidence suggested that gepirone-ER may not be associated with sexual dysfunction. No serious adverse events occurred in gepirone-treated patients.

Conclusion

Gepirone-ER is effective for the short-term treatment of major depressive disorder and is well tolerated.

### Buspirone (buspirone hydrochloride) [^2f1644d2]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

The administration of buspirone to a patient taking a monoamine
oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) may pose a hazard. There have been reports of
the occurrence of elevated blood pressure when buspirone has been added to a
regimen including an MAOI. Therefore, it is recommended that buspirone not be
used concomitantly with an MAOI. Because buspirone has no established
antipsychotic activity, it should not be employed in lieu of appropriate
antipsychotic treatment.

Miscellaneous

Infrequent were weight gain, fever, roaring sensation in the head, weight loss, and malaise; rare were alcohol abuse, bleeding disturbance, loss of voice, and hiccoughs.

Postmarketing Experience

Postmarketing experience has shown an adverse experience profile similar to that given above. Voluntary reports since introduction have included rare occurrences of allergic reactions (including urticaria), angioedema, cogwheel rigidity, dizziness (rarely reported as vertigo), dystonic reactions (including dystonia), ataxias, extrapyramidal symptoms, dyskinesias (acute and tardive), ecchymosis, emotional lability, serotonin syndrome, transient difficulty with recall, urinary retention, visual changes (including tunnel vision), parkinsonism, akathisia, restless leg syndrome, and restlessness. Because of the uncontrolled nature of these spontaneous reports, a causal relationship to buspirone hydrochloride tablets treatment has not been determined.

### What are the comparative benefits and harms of augmentation treatments in major depression? [^8874bf18]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

The majority of depressed patients do not experience sufficient response to their initial antidepressant medication. Augmentation strategies, particularly the use of atypical antipsychotics to augment selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have proliferated over the last 15 years, and 2 atypical antipsychotics, aripiprazole and quetiapine, have received US Food and Drug Administration approval for adjunctive therapy in treatment-resistant depression. Alternatively, data in treatment-resistant depression exist for most of the atypicals and for other treatments, including lithium, bupropion, methylphenidate, pindolol, and buspirone.

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^ea33421f]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

SSRIs and SNRIs

Initially, when patients were treated acutely with SSRIs weight loss was observed. Currently, SSRIs are useful for the treatment of obese patients with binge eating disorder, given their anti-impulsive action. However, their clinical relevance for weight loss in these patients remains unclear. In the recently published Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline on the Pharmacological Management of Obesity, the use of SSRIs is not listed as a therapeutic tool. Despite the fact that SSRI use has been associated with weight loss when acutely treated, a number of studies have shown SSRIs to be associated with long-term risk of weight gain. However, the number of long-term studies over the period of 1 year is limited, and there is a need for studies specifically investigating the long-term effects of SSRIs on body weight.

Cascade et al. reported that 6% of patients using SSRIs gained weight. The Canadian National Population Health Survey (NPHS) is a longitudinal study that has found that SSRIs and the SNRI venlafaxine use are associated with significant weight gain. A long-term comparison study investigated the effects of different types of SSRI on weight gain in patients with panic disorder. It showed that paroxetine, fluoxetine, citalopram and fluvoxamine induced weight gain of, respectively, 8.2 ± 5.4, 5.2 ± 4.4, 6.9 ± 5.7 and 6.3 ± 4.2 kg in a 1-year period. Michelson et al. observed changes in body weight during a 1-year trial period of fluoxetine treatment. The initial 12-week period was associated with weight loss of 0.35 kg, and 50 weeks of treatment resulted in weight gain of 3 kg.

Information from individual trials may better elucidate which subgroups of patients to consider use of these drugs in. An RCT of amitriptyline 50 mg once daily or escitalopram 10 mg once daily versus placebo demonstrated that amitriptyline appeared to be of greater benefit in EPS, although the drug enhanced gastric accommodation, suggesting it may also benefit those with PDS. In an RCT of imipramine 25–50 mg once daily epigastric pain, bloating, postprandial fullness, early satiation, and vomiting scores all improved significantly, versus placebo, compared with baseline. In a placebo-controlled trial of mirtazapine 15 mg once daily, recruiting 34 patients with FD and weight loss, without anxiety or depression and not taking any other neuromodulators, there was no benefit on global symptoms but the drug led to significant improvements in early satiation and quality of life. Finally, in a small Belgian crossover RCT, buspirone 10 mg three times a day had significant effects on postprandial fullness, early satiation, and upper abdominal bloating, and increased gastric accommodation. Further, larger, trials of mirtazapine and 5-HT 1A agonists in FD are warranted.

### Pharmacological management of obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^21cbea1c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — antidepressant selection and weight effects recommends a shared decision-making process that provides patients with quantitative estimates of the expected weight effect when antidepressant therapy is indicated (1|⊕⊕⊕○), noting that the expected length of treatment should also be considered. Evidence indicates heterogeneous weight effects: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine and sertraline have been associated with weight loss during acute treatment (4–12 wk) and weight neutrality in the maintenance (> 4 mo) phase, with no significant effect observed for citalopram or escitalopram; paroxetine has the greatest long-term increase in body weight among SSRIs, amitriptyline is the most potent tricyclic inducer of weight gain, and mirtazapine is associated with long-term weight gain; among serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine and duloxetine have been reported to slightly increase body weight; bupropion is the only antidepressant that consistently causes weight loss and significantly decreased body weight in clinical trials; the commissioned systematic review found weight gain with amitriptyline (1.8 kg) and weight loss with bupropion (−1.3 kg) and fluoxetine (−1.3 kg).

### Management of medication-induced weight gain [^a47a025b]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Several medications can contribute to weight gain. Medication-induced weight gain can have severe health consequences leading to overweight or obesity, or exacerbation of preexisting obesity and the plethora of obesity-related comorbidities. Weight gain due to medications is potentially avoidable by prescribing medications that are either weight neutral or that lead to weight loss, when appropriate. This article reviews the common classes of medications that contribute to weight gain and discusses alternatives to consider.

### Antipsychotic-induced weight gain [^a5d35b32]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Novel 'atypical' antipsychotic drugs represent a substantial improvement on older 'typical' drugs. However, clinical experience has shown that some, but not all, of these drugs can induce substantial weight gain. This interferes with compliance with drug taking and has expected effects on morbidity and mortality. In this review, we summarize current thinking on: (i) the extent to which different 'atypical' drugs induce weight gain; (ii) the possible roles of various neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in this adverse drug reaction; and (iii) the state of development of animal models in this area. We also outline major areas for future research.

### Interventions for preventing weight gain after smoking cessation [^88fe0869]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Most people who stop smoking gain weight, on average about 7 kg in the long term. There are some interventions that have been specifically designed to tackle smoking cessation whilst also limiting weight gain. Many smoking cessation pharmacotherapies and other interventions may also limit weight gain.

Objectives

This review is divided into two parts. (1) Interventions designed specifically to aid smoking cessation and limit post-cessation weight gain (2) Interventions designed to aid smoking cessation that may also plausibly have an effect on weight

Search Strategy

Part 1: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register which includes trials indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciSearch and PsycINFO, and other reviews and conference abstracts. Part 2: We searched the included studies of Cochrane smoking cessation reviews of nicotine replacement therapy, antidepressants, nicotine receptor partial agonists, cannabinoid type 1 receptor antagonists (rimonabant), and exercise interventions, published in Issue 4, 2008 of The Cochrane Library.

Selection Criteria

Part 1: We included trials of interventions designed specifically to address both smoking cessation and post-cessation weight gain that had measured weight at any follow-up point and/or smoking six months or more after quitting. Part 2: We included trials from the selected Cochrane reviews that could plausibly modify post-cessation weight gain if they had reported weight gain by trial arm at end of treatment or later.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on smoking and weight for part 1 trials, and on weight only for part 2. Abstinence from smoking is expressed as a risk ratio (RR), using the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. The outcome is expressed as the difference in weight change between trial arms from baseline. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel method for smoking and inverse variance for weight using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We found evidence that pharmacological interventions aimed at reducing post-cessation weight gain resulted in a significant reduction in weight gain at the end of treatment (dexfenfluramine (-2.50kg [-2.98kg to -2.02kg], fluoxetine (-0.80kg [-1.27kg to -0.33kg], phenylpropanolamine (PPA) (-0.50kg [-0.80kg to -0.20kg], naltrexone (-0.76kg [-1.51kg to -0.01kg])). No evidence of maintenance of the treatment effect was found at six or 12 months. Among the behavioural interventions, only weight control advice was associated with no reduction in weight gain and with a possible reduction in abstinence. Individualized programmes were associated with reduced weight gain at end of treatment and at 12 months (-2.58kg [-5.11kg to -0.05kg]), and with no effect on abstinence (RR 0.74 [0.39 to 1.43]). Very low calorie diets (-1.30kg (-3.49kg to 0.89kg] at 12 months) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (-5.20kg (-9.28kg to -1.12kg] at 12 months) were both associated with improved abstinence and reduced weight gain at end of treatment and at long-term follow up. Both bupropion (300mg/day) and fluoxetine (30mg and 60mg/day combined) were found to limit post-cessation weight gain at the end of treatment (-0.76kg [-1.17kg to -0.35kg] I² = 48%) and -1.30kg [-1.91kg to -0.69kg]) respectively. There was no evidence that the weight reducing effect of bupropion was dose-dependent. The effect of bupropion at one year was smaller and confidence intervals included no effect (-0.38kg [-2.001kg to 1.24kg]). We found no evidence that exercise interventions significantly reduced post-cessation weight gain at end of treatment but evidence for an effect at 12 months (-2.07kg [-3.78kg, -0.36kg]). Treatment with NRT resulted in attenuation of post-cessation weight gain (-0.45kg [-0.70kg, -0.20kg]) at the end of treatment, with no evidence that the effect differed for different forms of NRT. The estimated weight gain reduction was similar at 12 months (-0.42kg [-0.92kg, 0.08kg]) but the confidence intervals included no effect. There were no relevant data on the effect of rimonabant on weight gain. We found no evidence that varenicline significantly reduced post-cessation weight gain at end of treatment and no follow-up data are currently available. One study randomizing successful quitters to 12 more weeks of active treatment showed weight to be reduced by 0.71kg (-1.04kg to -0.38kg). In three studies, participants taking bupropion gained significantly less weight at the end of treatment than those on varenicline (-0.51kg [-0.93kg to -0.09kg]).

Authors' Conclusions

Behavioural interventions of general advice only are not effective and may reduce abstinence. Individualized interventions, very low calorie diets, and CBT may be effective and not reduce abstinence. Exercise interventions are not associated with reduced weight gain at end of treatment, but may be associated with worthwhile reductions in weight gain in the long term, Bupropion, fluoxetine, nicotine replacement therapy, and probably varenicline all reduced weight gain while being used. Although this effect was not maintained one year after quitting for bupropion, fluoxetine, and nicotine replacement, the evidence is insufficient to exclude a modest long-term effect. The data are not sufficient to make strong clinical recommendations for effective programmes.

### Buspirone hydrochloride (bucapsol) [^93128e3a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

Controlled Substance

BucapsolTMcapsules are not a controlled substance.

Physical and Psychological Dependence

In human and animal studies, buspirone has shown no potential for abuse or diversion and there is no evidence that it causes tolerance, or either physical or psychological dependence. Human volunteers with a history of recreational drug or alcohol usage were studied in two double-blind clinical investigations. None of the subjects were able to distinguish between buspirone hydrochloride and placebo. By contrast, subjects showed a statistically significant preference for methaqualone and diazepam. Studies in monkeys, mice, and rats have indicated that buspirone lacks potential for abuse.

Following chronic administration in the rat, abrupt withdrawal of buspirone did not result in the loss of body weight commonly observed with substances that cause physical dependency.

Although there is no direct evidence that buspirone hydrochloride causes physical dependence or drug- seeking behavior, it is difficult to predict from experiments the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of buspirone hydrochloride misuse or abuse (eg, development of tolerance, incrementation of dose, drug-seeking behavior).

### Antidepressant utilisation and incidence of weight gain during 10 years' follow-up: population based cohort study [^41265c48]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

A systematic review analysed short term studies and estimated weight increases over eight months' follow-up. Another study evaluated weight gain up to two years using electronic health records, with estimates consistent with a 2.1 kg weight gain with fluoxetine treatment and about a 4.8 kg increase with setraline. These figures suggest that increases of ≥ 5% body weight are plausible. Our study adds to previous data by providing longer follow-up (up to 10 years) of antidepressant treatment, showing that the risk of weight gain is increased for at least the first five years of treatment. Our study also adds a comparison with a general population sample that was not treated with antidepressant drugs, showing an association between antidepressant use and transitions to overweight and obesity. Weight gain is a well recognised side effect of antipsychotic treatment, but prescribing guidelines generally devote less attention to weight management in the context of antidepressant treatment. Obesity and depression are common, often coexist, and are associated with physical comorbidity and worse health outcomes. Researchers have observed that the negative perceptions associated with either a depression diagnosis or an obesity diagnosis may be potentiated when the conditions overlap. This makes weight management and obesity prevention particularly important in this population. The relation between depression symptoms and health behaviours that might contribute to weight gain is also a relevant concern.

From a population perspective, these results suggest that the widespread use of antidepressants might be an important factor contributing to increasing body weight. These results should be set in the context of increasing BMI in the general population. Data from the health survey for England show that between 2004 and 2014 the prevalence of obesity in adults increased from 23% to 26%, and mean BMI increased from 26.9 to 27.2. From a clinical perspective, these observations reinforce the need for active body weight management to accompany antidepressant treatment, although this might often be met with limited success. The potential for weight gain may also be a consideration in the selection of individual antidepressant drugs.

Conclusions and policy implications

Initiation of antidepressant drugs shows a strong temporal association with weight gain, which is greatest during the second and third years of treatment. During the second year of treatment, the risk of ≥ 5% weight gain is 46.3% higher than in a general population comparison group. These associations are consistent across a wide range of clinical, social, and demographic characteristics. The increasingly widespread use of antidepressants is of concern in the context of the increasing prevalence of obesity.

Figure 4
Meta-regression bubble plot of correlation between standardized mean difference of Pain scores and Year of study. Each bubble represents a study and bubble size portrays the study weight. The regression line shows a significant trend for the reduction in the Pain score with increase in year (p < 0.001, R²: 82%, Beta: 0.23).

For the subgroup analysis for effect after 4–6 weeks of therapy, there was also a reduction in pain score with large effect size; however, it was not statistically significant (SMD: −0.90 (−2.05, 0.26), p-value: 0.13) (Figure 3B).

In the pooled analysis for the number of patients with a reduction in pain score, 445 (224 in the psychotropic drug group, 221 in the placebo group) patients were included. More patients in the psychotropic drug group experienced a reduction in pain score at 12–13 weeks of therapy compared to placebo (OR: 1.66 (1.08–2.54), p-value: 0.02) (Figure 3C). There was no significant heterogeneity (I² :27.0%, p-value: 0.25) or publication bias (p-value: 0.68) detected. The subgroup analysis containing antidepressants (without buspirone) showed even greater benefits at 12–13 weeks (OR: 2.03, p = 0.005). For the analysis at four weeks, the number of patients with a reduction in pain score was not statistically significant (OR: 1.28 (0.79–2.08), p-value: 0.32). (Figure 3D)

Buspirone in OCD — small, methodologically limited studies provide inconsistent monotherapy results at 60 mg/day and no substantial evidence for augmentation; trials show mixed findings including equivalence to clomipramine in one 6-week study, no better than placebo in a 4-week crossover, virtually no Y-BOCS change in an 8-week open trial, and negative augmentation trials despite a 29% (4/14) YBOCS-25% response in one small study of augmentation. Selection of treatment-resistant participants (≤ 35% decrease in Y-BOCS and "unimproved") was noted in one negative augmentation study.

### Clinical review: drugs commonly associated with weight change: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^cd23a3d6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Various drugs affect body weight as a side effect.

Objective

We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the evidence about commonly prescribed drugs and their association with weight change.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, DARE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched to identify published systematic reviews as a source for trials.

Study Selection

We included randomized trials that compared an a priori selected list of drugs to placebo and measured weight change.

Data Extraction

We extracted data in duplicate and assessed the methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

Results

We included 257 randomized trials (54 different drugs; 84 696 patients enrolled). Weight gain was associated with the use of amitriptyline (1.8 kg), mirtazapine (1.5 kg), olanzapine (2.4 kg), quetiapine (1.1 kg), risperidone (0.8 kg), gabapentin (2.2 kg), tolbutamide (2.8 kg), pioglitazone (2.6 kg), glimepiride (2.1 kg), gliclazide (1.8 kg), glyburide (2.6 kg), glipizide (2.2 kg), sitagliptin (0.55 kg), and nateglinide (0.3 kg). Weight loss was associated with the use of metformin (1.1 kg), acarbose (0.4 kg), miglitol (0.7 kg), pramlintide (2.3 kg), liraglutide (1.7 kg), exenatide (1.2 kg), zonisamide (7.7 kg), topiramate (3.8 kg), bupropion (1.3 kg), and fluoxetine (1.3 kg). For many other remaining drugs (including antihypertensives and antihistamines), the weight change was either statistically nonsignificant or supported by very low-quality evidence.

Conclusions

Several drugs are associated with weight change of varying magnitude. Data are provided to guide the choice of drug when several options exist and institute preemptive weight loss strategies when obesogenic drugs are prescribed.

### Antidepressants and body weight: a comprehensive review and meta-analysis [^37dcc518]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Psychotropic drugs often induce weight gain, leading to discomfort and discontinuation of treatment and, more importantly, increasing the risk of obesity-related illnesses such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary heart disease. There is evidence that antidepressant drugs may induce a variable amount of weight gain, but results are sparse and often contradictory.

Data Sources

We performed a literature search using the MEDLINE, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane research databases for all publications available to January 2009. We used the following keywords: antidepressant, psychotropic drugs, body weight, weight gain, obesity, overweight, adverse event, side effects, SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and the name of each antidepressant active compound together with body weight or other keywords. Studies reporting body weight changes during treatment with different antidepressants were selected for eligibility. Finally, 116 studies were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction

Weight change mean and standard deviation and size of each group were recorded. Missing means and standard deviations were directly calculated by using information available in the article when possible. Non-placebo-controlled studies were compared to a virtual placebo sample, whose mean and standard deviation were derived by the weighted mean of means and standard deviations of all placebo samples. Methodological quality of studies, heterogeneity, publication bias, and effect of treatment duration were systematically controlled.

Data Synthesis

Quantitative results evidenced that amitriptyline, mirtazapine, and paroxetine were associated with a greater risk of weight gain. In contrast, some weight loss occurs with fluoxetine and bupropion, although the effect of fluoxetine appears to be limited to the acute phase of treatment. Other compounds have no transient or negligible effect on body weight in the short term. However, the effect of each antidepressant may vary greatly depending on an individual's characteristics and generally became more evident in the long term to a variable degree across compounds.

Conclusions

Despite the fact that some analyses were done on only a few studies due to the difficulty of finding reliable information in literature, to our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive meta-analysis to allow comparison of different antidepressants as regards their impact on body weight. Data presented may be helpful for a more accurate treatment selection in patients at risk of obesity or related medical illness.

### Consistent differential effects of bupropion and mirtazapine in major depression [^70fdec68]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with major depression exhibit heterogeneous symptom profiles and variable responses to antidepressants. Most clinical trials rely on aggregate outcomes such as total symptom severity or remission rates, which often obscure meaningful differences in treatment response.

Methods

We applied the Supervised Varimax (SV) algorithm to identify outcome dimensions that maximally differentiate antidepressants based on symptom-level effects. We analyzed all relevant levels of the STAR*D trial and validated findings in the independent CO-MED study. We assessed statistical significance using permutation testing with familywise error rate (FWER) correction.

Results

SV consistently identified interpretable and statistically significant differences between bupropion, mirtazapine, and other antidepressants. In STAR*D, bupropion monotherapy produced greater improvement in hypersomnia than venlafaxine in Levels 2 and 2 A (n = 686, difference = 0.384, p FWER = 0.007). Bupropion augmentation outperformed buspirone augmentation for increased weight, increased appetite, and fatigue in Level 2 (n = 520, difference = -0.322, p FWER = 0.005). Mirtazapine monotherapy outperformed nortriptyline for insomnia, decreased weight, and decreased appetite in Level 3 (n = 214, difference = 0.401, p FWER = 0.022), and venlafaxine with mirtazapine similarly outperformed tranylcypromine in Level 4 (n = 102, difference = -0.722, p FWER = 0.004). In CO-MED, escitalopram with bupropion and venlafaxine with mirtazapine demonstrated complementary symptom-specific benefits (n = 640, difference = -0.302, p FWER = 0.022).

Conclusion

Bupropion is most effective for hypersomnia, increased weight, increased appetite, or fatigue, while mirtazapine is preferable for insomnia, decreased weight, or decreased appetite. SV enables statistically rigorous, symptom-level differentiation using only treatment assignment, offering a scalable and clinically aligned framework for guiding antidepressant selection from individual clinical trials.

### Synopsis of the 2020 U.S. VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of adult overweight and obesity [^6ee321cc]. Military Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Medications and potential for weight gain — adult overweight and obesity management emphasizes that it is critical to consider the impact of prescribed medications on the potential for weight gain and whether alternate medications may be a more appropriate option; providers should review the patient's current medications for any medications that may be contributing to increased weight, and the side effects of weight gain should be considered when prescribing a medication for a patient in whom weight gain may be of concern. If an alternate medication is not an option, participation in a weight management program may benefit the patient whose only option is a medication associated with weight gain, and optimal medication management should take into account the potential effect on weight, as well as other patient factors, efficacy, safety, and available long-term outcome data.

### Interventions for preventing weight gain after smoking cessation [^b5f1df44]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Most people who stop smoking gain weight. There are some interventions that have been designed to reduce weight gain when stopping smoking. Some smoking cessation interventions may also limit weight gain although their effect on weight has not been reviewed.

Objectives

To systematically review the effect of: (1) Interventions targeting post-cessation weight gain on weight change and smoking cessation.(2) Interventions designed to aid smoking cessation that may also plausibly affect weight on post-cessation weight change.

Search Methods

Part 1 - We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register and CENTRAL in September 2011. Part 2 - In addition we searched the included studies in the following "parent" Cochrane reviews: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), antidepressants, nicotine receptor partial agonists, cannabinoid type 1 receptor antagonists and exercise interventions for smoking cessation published in Issue 9, 2011 of the Cochrane Library.

Selection Criteria

Part 1 - We included trials of interventions that were targeted at post-cessation weight gain and had measured weight at any follow up point and/or smoking cessation six or more months after quit day. Part 2 - We included trials that had been included in the selected parent Cochrane reviews if they had reported weight gain at any time point.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on baseline characteristics of the study population, intervention, outcome and study quality. Change in weight was expressed as difference in weight change from baseline to follow up between trial arms and was reported in abstinent smokers only. Abstinence from smoking was expressed as a risk ratio (RR). We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using the inverse variance method for weight and Mantel-Haenszel method for smoking using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

Part 1: Some pharmacological interventions tested for limiting post cessation weight gain (PCWG) resulted in a significant reduction in WG at the end of treatment (dexfenfluramine (Mean difference (MD) -2.50kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.98 to -2.02, 1 study), phenylpropanolamine (MD -0.50kg, 95% CI-0.80 to -0.20, N = 3), naltrexone (MD -0.78kg, 95% CI-1.52 to -0.05, N = 2). There was no evidence that treatment reduced weight at 6 or 12 months (m). No pharmacological intervention significantly affected smoking cessation rates. Weight management education only was associated with no reduction in PCWG at end of treatment (6 or 12m). However these interventions significantly reduced abstinence at 12m (Risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.90, N = 2). Personalised weight management support reduced PCWG at 12m (MD -2.58kg, 95% CI -5.11 to-0.05, N = 2) and was not associated with a significant reduction of abstinence at 12m (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.43, N = 2). A very low calorie diet (VLCD) significantly reduced PCWG at end of treatment (MD -3.70kg, 95% CI-4.82 to-2.58, N = 1), but not significantly so at 12m (MD -1.30kg, 95% CI-3.49 to 0.89, N = 1). The VLCD increased chances of abstinence at 12m (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.73, N = 1). There was no evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy to allay concern about weight gain (CBT) reduced PCWG, but there was some evidence of increased PCWG at 6m (MD 0.74, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.24). It was associated with improved abstinence at 6m (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.13, N = 2) but not at 12m (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.86, N = 2). However, there was significant statistical heterogeneity. Part 2: We found no evidence that exercise interventions significantly reduced PCWG at end of treatment (MD -0.25kg, 95% CI-0.78 to 0.29, N = 4) however a significant reduction was found at 12m (MD -2.07kg, 95% CI-3.78 to-0.36, N = 3). Both bupropion and fluoxetine limited PCWG at the end of treatment (bupropion MD -1.12kg, 95% CI-1.47 to-0.77, N = 7) (fluoxetine MD -0.99kg, 95% CI-1.36 to-0.61, N = 2). There was no evidence that the effect persisted at 6m (bupropion MD -0.58kg, 95% CI-2.16 to 1.00, N = 4), (fluoxetine MD -0.01kg, 95% CI-1.11 to 1.10, N = 2) or 12m (bupropion MD -0.38kg, 95% CI-2.00 to 1.24, N = 4). There were no data on WG at 12m for fluoxetine. Overall, treatment with NRT attenuated PCWG at the end of treatment (MD -0.69kg, 95% CI-0.88 to-0.51, N = 19), with no strong evidence that the effect differed for the different forms of NRT. There was evidence of significant statistical heterogeneity caused by one study which reported a 4.3kg reduction in PCWG due to NRT. With this study removed, the difference in weight change at end of treatment was -0.45kg (95% CI-0.66 to-0.27, N = 18). There was no evidence of an effect on PCWG at 12m (MD -0.42kg, 95% CI-0.92 to 0.08, N = 15). We found evidence that varenicline significantly reduced PCWG at end of treatment (MD -0.41kg, 95% CI-0.63 to-0.19, N = 11), but this effect was not maintained at 6 or 12m. Three studies compared the effect of bupropion to varenicline. Participants taking bupropion gained significantly less weight at the end of treatment (-0.51kg (95% CI-0.93 to-0.09kg), N = 3). Direct comparison showed no significant difference in PCWG between varenicline and NRT.

Authors' Conclusions

Although some pharmacotherapies tested to limit PCWG show evidence of short-term success, other problems with them and the lack of data on long-term efficacy limits their use. Weight management education only, is not effective and may reduce abstinence. Personalised weight management support may be effective and not reduce abstinence, but there are too few data to be sure. One study showed a VLCD increased abstinence but did not prevent WG in the longer term. CBT to accept WG did not limit PCWG and may not promote abstinence in the long term. Exercise interventions significantly reduced weight in the long term, but not the short term. More studies are needed to clarify whether this is an effect of treatment or a chance finding. Bupropion, fluoxetine, NRT and varenicline reduce PCWG while using the medication. Although this effect was not maintained one year after stopping smoking, the evidence is insufficient to exclude a modest long-term effect. The data are not sufficient to make strong clinical recommendations for effective programmes to prevent weight gain after cessation.

### Short-term efficacy and tolerability of lurasidone in the treatment of acute schizophrenia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^940bd195]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Lurasidone, an azapirone derivative, is a novel second generation antipsychotic with potent binding affinity for dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT 2A, 5-HT 7, 5-HT 1A, and noradrenaline alpha 2C receptors. This updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examined the short-term efficacy and tolerability of lurasidone in the treatment of acute schizophrenia.

Methods

Double-blinded RCTs reporting on the short-term effects of lurasidone were included. Standardized mean difference (SMD) with their 95% confidence interval (CI), and number needed to harm (NNH) were computed.

Results

The meta-analysis had 8 RCTs with 16 active arms that included 2373 patients with acute schizophrenia who were randomized to either lurasidone (20–160 mg/day; n = 1570) or placebo (n = 803) groups. Lurasidone was superior to placebo with regard to change in total psychopathology [SMD: -0.34, (95%CI: -0.48, -0.20), P < 0.00001], positive symptoms [SMD: -0.47, (95%CI: -0.57, -0.36), P < 0.00001], negative symptoms [SMD:-0.34, (95%CI: -0.45, -0.22), P < 0.00001], and general psychopathology [SMD: -0.36, (95%CI: -0.48, -0.24), P < 0.00001]. Results were consistent for total psychopathology in 11 out of the 13 subgroups. Lurasidone resulted in higher weight gain [SMD: 0.15, (95% CI: 0.06, 0.24), P = 0.001] and BMI [SMD: 0.17, (95%CI: 0.07, 0.28), P = 0.002] than placebo, but the differences were not clinically significant. Lurasidone group had less frequent inefficacy (NNH = 14) and discontinuation due to any reason (NNH = 17), but was associated with more frequent vomiting, akathisia, dystonia, parkinsonism, somnolence, dizziness, sedation, nausea, and weight gain of ≥ 7% of the initial weight (NNH = 11–50).

Conclusion

This meta-analysis of 8 short-term studies supported the efficacy and safety of lurasidone in the acute phase of schizophrenia, particularly at the higher dose range of 80 mg/day.

### Pharmacological management of obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^e64a63ab]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — criteria to continue or discontinue weight loss medication — If a patient's response to a weight loss medication is deemed effective (weight loss ≥ 5% of body weight at 3 mo) and safe, we recommend that the medication be continued; if deemed ineffective (weight loss < 5% at 3 mo) or if there are safety or tolerability issues at any time, we recommend that the medication be discontinued and alternatives or referral be considered. (1|⊕⊕⊕○) Supporting evidence states that weight loss medications do not change the underlying physiology of weight regulation in any permanent way, their effects are only sustained as long as they are taken, and gradual weight gain typically occurs when medications are stopped.

Medication-induced pediatric weight gain — top takeaways emphasize that many medications have the potential to cause weight gain in pediatric patients; monitoring and assessment of these effects is important for patient health. Central nervous system medications that may cause weight gain include atypical antipsychotics, antiepileptics, mood stabilizers and antidepressants, and these classes, in particular, have the potential to cause significant weight gain in pediatric patients. Endocrine medications that may cause weight gain include insulin and insulin analogs, glucocorticoids, and hormonal contraceptives. Miscellaneous medications that may cause weight gain include hypertension/cardiovascular drugs, antihistamines, sleep aids, and chemotherapy drugs.

Postcessation weight gain — prevalence, mitigation, and counseling — notes that about 80% of smokers gain an average of 3 to 6 kg in the first 3 months after quitting, yet this weight gain does not attenuate the cardiovascular (CV) benefits of tobacco abstinence. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) can help control or mitigate weight gain, and a Cochrane review found bupropion, NRT, and varenicline reduced postcessation weight change while the medication was being used, although these medications appear to delay rather than prevent weight gain. It is reasonable to advise patients not to replace cigarettes with food, to decrease high fat consumption, and to increase physical activity. Patients with an elevated body mass index who smoke should be advised to focus first on smoking cessation rather than weight loss; a "Maintain, Don't gain" approach can be recommended, and daily exercise should be strongly encouraged in line with guidance recommending adults achieve 30 minutes per day of brisk exercise on most days of the week.

### The best drug supplement for obesity treatment: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^dba7d89b]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Research shows that some people taking prescription weight management medications lose 10% or more of their starting weight, weight loss of 5–10% of starting body weight may help improve health by lowering blood sugar, blood pressure and triglyceride levels. Losing weight also can improve some other health problems related to overweight and obesity, such as joint pain and sleep apnea. Possible side effects vary by medication and how it acts on your body. Most side effects are mild and often improve if you continue to take the medication.

How long you will need to take weight management medication depends on whether the drug helps you lose weight and keep it off and whether you experience serious side effects.

The key message for patients with obesity is that when caloric intake is reduced below that needed for daily energy expenditure, there is a predictable rate of weight loss. Men generally lose weight slightly faster than women of similar height and weight on any given diet because men have more lean body mass and, therefore, higher energy expenditure.

Available medications to help treat the patient with obesity work either in the brain or the gut. Neurotransmitter systems are involved in modulating food intake. Serotonin 5-HT2C receptors modulate fat and caloric intake.

α1-receptor agonist drugs used to treat hypertension produce weight gain. In contrast, stimulation of α2-receptors increases food intake, and a polymorphism in the α2a-adrenoceptor is associated with reduced metabolic rate in humans. Activation of β2-receptors in the brain reduces food intake, and β-blocker drugs can increase body weight. Other drugs act in the periphery; Glucagon-like peptide-1 released from intestinal L cells acts on the pancreas and brain to reduce food intake. Amylin is secreted from the pancreas and can reduce food intake.

A study by Smith et al. introduced the combination weight-loss drug Phentermine + Topiramate as a dietary supplement to manage the weight of obese or overweight patients and weight-related diseases.

Amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder (ATS) mirtazapine recommendations state that for patients with ATS use disorder, clinicians can consider prescribing mirtazapine to promote reduced use of ATS (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation), and clinicians can give mirtazapine additional consideration for patients with co-occurring depressive disorders, as this medication can also treat depression (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation). Mirtazapine is FDA-approved to treat depression, may also help treat anxiety and improve sleep quality, and has no known potential for misuse, and these benefits may be tempered by side effects such as weight gain, drowsiness, and metabolic issues; while the evidence is relatively weak, the CGC determined that, because there are few medication options available, mirtazapine may be preferable to no treatment at all, particularly for MSM.

### Pharmacological management of obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1cc4eeac]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and weight effects — We recommend considering weight gain potential in choosing an AED for any given patient and using shared decision-making with quantitative estimates of expected weight effects. AEDs associated with weight loss are felbamate, topiramate, and zonisamide; AEDs associated with weight gain are gabapentin, pregabalin, valproic acid, vigabatrin, and carbamazepine; weight-neutral AEDs are lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and phenytoin. Valproic acid studies reported mild-to-moderate weight gain (5 to 10% of baseline weight) in 24% of patients and marked weight gain (> 10% gain of baseline weight) in 47% of patients. In a gabapentin cohort of 44 patients, 57% gained more than 5% of baseline body weight and 10 patients (23%) gained more than 10%. A systematic review suggested weight gain with gabapentin (2.2 kg after 1.5 mo of use) and divalproex (relative risk for weight gain, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.30, 6.02). For carbamazepine, 66.7% had gained an average of 1.5 kg at a 6- to 8-month follow-up visit.

Overweight and obesity have become an urgent public health problem in the United States: approximately 61% of the adult population (97 million adults) are overweight or obese, where overweight is defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 and obesity is defined as a BMI ≥ 30. Overweight and obesity increase the risk for developing many serious chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and certain cancers. Increased morbidity due to obesity-related disorders begins within the normal weight range. Weight gain in adulthood per se, even in individuals who are normal weight, has deleterious health effects. Medications, particularly those commonly used in psychiatry and neurology, are a significant iatrogenic source of overweight and obesity. The weight gain potential of prescription medications should be considered in order to enhance patient compliance and reduce the risk of metabolic sequelae of weight gain. This article provides an overview of the weight-gain potential of several classes of drugs commonly used in psychiatric practice and considerations for clinicians in prescribing these medications.

In the open-label extension studies, participants taking established olanzapine treatment were initiated on samidorphan alongside the treatment group; with all participants then followed-up for 52 weeks. The authors found that olanzapine/samidorphan was well tolerated, with low rate of discontinuation attributable to adverse effects, and antipsychotic efficacy was maintained long-term. After 52 weeks, mean weight change was −0.03 kg (SD: 6.22); with little meaningful difference in terms of weight change between participants newly initiated on samidorphan at the beginning of the trial extension, and those previously established on samidorphan (−0.42 vs 0.32 kg).

### Effect of tesofensine on bodyweight loss, body composition, and quality of life in obese patients: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^09712f7b]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Weight-loss drugs produce an additional mean weight loss of only 3–5 kg above that of diet and placebo over 6 months, and more effective pharmacotherapy of obesity is needed. We assessed the efficacy and safety of tesofensine-an inhibitor of the presynaptic uptake of noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin-in patients with obesity.

Methods

We undertook a phase II, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in five Danish obesity management centres. After a 2 week run-in phase, 203 obese patients (body-mass index 30- ≤ 40 kg/m²) were prescribed an energy restricted diet and randomly assigned with a list of randomisation numbers to treatment with tesofensine 0.25 mg (n = 52), 0.5 mg (n = 50), or 1.0 mg (n = 49), or placebo (n = 52) once daily for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was percentage change in bodyweight. Analysis was by modified intention to treat (all randomised patients with measurement after at least one dose of study drug or placebo). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00394667.

Findings

161 (79%) participants completed the study. After 24 weeks, the mean weight loss produced by diet and placebo was 2.0% (SE 0.60). Tesofensine 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, and 1.0 mg and diet induced a mean weight loss of 4.5% (0.87), 9.2% (0.91), and 10.6% (0.84), respectively, greater than diet and placebo (p < 0.0001). The most common adverse events caused by tesofensine were dry mouth, nausea, constipation, hard stools, diarrhoea, and insomnia. After 24 weeks, tesofensine 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg showed no significant increases in systolic or diastolic blood pressure compared with placebo, whereas heart rate was increased by 7.4 beats per min in the tesofensine 0.5 mg group (p = 0.0001).

Interpretation

Our results suggest that tesofensine 0.5 mg might have the potential to produce a weight loss twice that of currently approved drugs. However, these findings of efficacy and safety need confirmation in phase III trials.

### The 5-HT2C receptor and antipsychoticinduced weight gain-mechanisms and genetics [^993d0fcb]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

The mechanisms underlying weight gain resulting from antipsychotic drugs are not fully understood, although antagonism of the 5-HT2C receptor is likely to contribute. Animal studies indicate that the drugs most likely to cause weight gain, clozapine and olanzapine, have direct effects on the NPY-containing neurons of the hypothalamus; these neurons mediate the effects of the circulating anorexigenic hormone leptin on the control of food intake. The substantial differences between individuals in the extent of antipsychotic-induced weight gain suggest that genetic factors may be important. We have been studying pharmacogenetic correlates and find that a common 5-HT2C receptor promoter region polymorphisms demonstrates strong associations with weight gain in two first episode psychotic samples. In both series, we have found further association of antipsychotic drug-induced weight gain with a common and functional polymorphism of the gene for leptin. Along with initial BMI, these two pharmacogenetic factors account for almost 30% of the variance in drug-induced weight gain. Interestingly, the 5-HT2C polymorphism appears to determine levels of circulating leptin, providing a potential mechanism underlying the genetic association of the 5-HT2C receptor with weight gain. We have undertaken functional studies of haplotypes of the 5-HT2C promoter region and find the allele associated with protection from weight gain results in reduced promoter activity. These findings demonstrate the value of pharmacogenetics in determining liability to a major side effect of antipsychotic treatment, and indicate both the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying this side effect.

5.7	Increased Appetite and Weight Gain

In U.S. controlled clinical studies, appetite increase was reported in 17% of patients treated with REMERON, compared to 2% for placebo. In these same trials, weight gain of ≥ 7% of body weight was reported in 7.5% of patients treated with mirtazapine, compared to 0% for placebo. In a pool of premarketing U.S. clinical studies, including many patients for long-term, open-label treatment, 8% of patients receiving REMERON discontinued for weight gain.

In an 8-week-long pediatric clinical trial of doses between 15 to 45 mg/day, 49% of REMERON-treated pediatric patients had a weight gain of at least 7%, compared to 5.7% of placebo-treated patients. The safety and effectiveness of REMERON/REMERONSolTab in pediatric patients with MDD have not been established [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

5.8	Somnolence

In U.S. controlled studies, somnolence was reported in 54% of patients treated with REMERON, compared to 18% for placebo. In these studies, somnolence resulted in discontinuation for 10.4% of REMERON-treated patients, compared to 2.2% for placebo. It is unclear whether tolerance develops to the somnolent effects of REMERON/REMERONSolTab. Because of the potentially significant effects of REMERON/REMERONSolTab on impairment of performance, caution patients about engaging in activities that require alertness, including operating hazardous machinery and motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that REMERON/REMERONSolTab does not affect them adversely. The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and alcohol with REMERON/REMERONSolTab should be avoided [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Weight gain in smokers after quitting cigarettes: meta-analysis [^1e9ec98e]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Previous reports have underestimated the average amount of weight gained when people stop smoking. In clinic treated smokers, the population mean is about 4–5 kg after 1 year. Weight gain is greatest during the first three months of quitting (average monthly weight gain of about 1 kg), after which the rate of increase declines. However, we saw a large variation around the population mean. At 12 months, about 16–21% of participants lost weight and 13–14% gained more than 10 kg.

Weight gain is important because weight concern is widespread among smokers and could deter some from trying to quit. Gaining weight after cessation limits some of the health benefits of quitting and is associated with an increased risk of health problems. So far, interventions have had a limited effect on preventing weight gain. These data suggest that doctors might usefully give patients a range of expected weight gain, although further research should identify the subgroups most at risk of gaining weight and clarify the optimum content and timing of interventions to prevent weight gain after cessation.

### A new genetic locus for antipsychotic-induced weight gain: a genome-wide study of first-episode psychosis patients using amisulpride (from the OPTiMiSE cohort) [^4c4fae04]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A very harmful side effect of antipsychotics is antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AiWG). A 3-year observational study reports clinically relevant AiWG (⩾7% of baseline weight) in up to 45% of participants on antipsychotics, resulting in a shift from normal weight to overweight in up to 15% of these patients. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) often follows AiWG: the relative risk of developing MetS after antipsychotic treatment initiation compared to unmedicated schizophrenia patients is up to 2.57. Schizophrenia patients on average have a 20% decreased life expectancy, with cardiovascular disease ranking as the leading cause of death. In addition, AiWG may hamper treatment efficacy as it reduces adherence. Furthermore, AiWG reduces quality of life by 12%.

Meta-analyses assessing the efficacy and safety of 15 antipsychotics in schizophrenia show superior efficacy and a relatively favorable safety profile for amisulpride. Study results on the amount of weight gain induced by amisulpride vary and it seems that amisulpride carries a lower weight gain risk at prolonged exposure than other antipsychotics. Previous meta-analyses that also incorporated long-term studies classify the compound as low risk or even weight neutral. In contrast, a short-term study categorizes amisulpride as a mid-risk compound for AiWG with an average weight gain of 2.3 kg after 6 weeks of treatment. A recent meta-analysis confirms the categorization as a mid-risk compound. This antipsychotic compound has a unique pharmacological profile with high potency for the D2 and D3 dopamine receptors, along with high binding affinities for two serotonin receptors: 5-HT2B and 5-HT7A. Currently, the proposed mechanism for AiWG in amisulpride is through D2 antagonism, with two prime pathways possibly involved: tuberoinfundibular D2R inhibition via prolactin increase and mesolimbic D2R blockade via disrupted reward processing. Importantly, amisulpride differs from other commonly prescribed antipsychotics as it does not bind to histamine, muscarinic and other serotonin receptors (e.g. 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C), all of which have a role in AiWG. Of note, not only medication but also schizophrenia itself have been linked to metabolic features, such as levels of insulin-related peptides, insulin resistance, HbA1c and leptin resistance.

Concomitant pharmacotherapy — limitations in reported effects on body weight: Publications regarding the weight effects of concomitant non-antiobesity medications should be interpreted with caution, because with few exceptions the data are generally derived from observational studies not specifically designed to evaluate the effects of these medications on body weight, and comparisons are often derived from different studies rather than from a direct head-to-head comparison within the same controlled clinical trial; studies often report variable weight effects depending on the condition being treated, dataset, and type of analysis, some therapeutics (e.g., haloperidol, sertraline) may have inconsistently reported weight effects, and reported effects are most often expressed as mean values with the potential for wide variances in individual weight.

Effect on weight gain

Table 3and figures 2-8shows the means and 95% confidence intervals for weight change from baseline in treated and untreated smokers during the first 12 months of abstinence. In all groups, weight increased by about 1 kg per month for the first three months. Thereafter, the rate of increase reduced, leading to an estimated weight increase of about 4–5 kg at one year after cessation.

Search strategy and study selection

Trials included in this study were identified from our Cochrane review on interventions to prevent weight gain. The search was updated in November 2011, and is reported in detail elsewhere. In brief, we searched the included lists of Cochrane reviews of smoking cessation interventions — nicotine replacement therapy (last search date, October 2007), antidepressants (July 2009), nicotine receptor partial agonists (October 2010), and exercise interventions (July 2011) — published in version 11 of the 2011 Cochrane Library. We updated the searches for nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, varenicline, and exercise trials published since the last search date for each Cochrane review to November 2011 by searching the Cochrane CENTRAL register (Central Register of Controlled Trials) using a combination of smoking and treatment search terms. In addition, we searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialist register for interventions that specifically targeted weight gain after cessation in addition to smoking cessation (search date, November 2011), using a combination of smoking and weight related search terms.

For inclusion in our review, studies had to report or their authors had to supply data for weight change from baseline to at least one follow-up point in abstainers only. Almost all studies of nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline, bupropion, and exercise did not report weight data in either the title or abstract. Consequently, we assessed the full text of every study in the latest versions of the reviews of effectiveness of the four treatments for inclusion. For the update search, we obtained and read the full text of every trial, if the title or abstract made it apparent that it was a trial of one of these interventions. We contacted authors or sponsors (or both) if weight data were incompletely recorded or missing but it was clear that participants had been weighed. Likewise, we screened the full text of any trial in which the title or abstract clearly indicated that the intervention aimed to allay concern about weight gain after cessation or aimed to prevent such weight gain. Studies in foreign languages were translated into English.

### Pregabalin capsules, cv [^17e11d85]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Weight Gain

Pregabalin treatment may cause weight gain. In pregabalin controlled clinical trials in adult patients of up to 14 weeks, a gain of 7% or more over baseline weight was observed in 9% of pregabalin-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients. Few patients treated with pregabalin (0.3%) withdrew from controlled trials due to weight gain. Pregabalin associated weight gain was related to dose and duration of exposure but did not appear to be associated with baseline BMI, gender, or age. Weight gain was not limited to patients with edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Although weight gain was not associated with clinically important changes in blood pressure in short-term controlled studies, the long-term cardiovascular effects of pregabalin-associated weight gain are unknown.

Among diabetic patients, pregabalin-treated patients gained an average of 1.6 kg (range: -16 to 16 kg), compared to an average 0.3 kg (range: -10 to 9 kg) weight gain in placebo patients. In a cohort of 333 diabetic patients who received pregabalin for at least 2 years, the average weight gain was 5.2 kg.

While the effects of pregabalin-associated weight gain on glycemic control have not been systematically assessed, in controlled and longer-term open label clinical trials with diabetic patients, pregabalin treatment did not appear to be associated with loss of glycemic control (as measured by HbA1C).

5.9 Tumorigenic Potential

In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies of pregabalin, an unexpectedly high incidence of hemangiosarcoma was identified in two different strains of mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during pregabalin's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans.

In clinical studies across various patient populations, comprising 6396 patient-years of exposure in patients greater than 12 years of age, new or worsening-preexisting tumors were reported in 57 patients. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in similar populations not treated with pregabalin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in these cohorts is or is not affected by treatment.

Short-term weight reduction medications (benzphetamine, diethylpropion, phendimetrazine, phentermine) — evidence scope and long-term/intermittent effects are as follows: approvals were based on studies conducted before 1975, and the systematic evidence review did not identify current studies for short-term use (i.e., less than or equal to six months), so the Work Group was unable to comment on safety or efficacy for short-term weight loss. For long-term or intermittent use, one small randomized controlled trial in premenopausal women with obesity compared diethylpropion (n = 28) to placebo (n = 29) and after 52 weeks showed weight reduction of -10.0 kg versus -3.1 kg, with 71.4% versus 33.3% achieving a ≥ 5% reduction in body weight; adverse events included constipation, anxiety, and irritability reported more frequently with treatment versus placebo. Given the lack of additional data and unknown long-term benefits and harms, the Work Group determined there was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation regarding long-term or intermittent use; these sympathomimetic drugs are Schedule III or IV controlled substances with potential for abuse, and prescribing information suggests they not be used in individuals with a history of CVD.

### Society of Family Planning committee statement: contraception and body weight [^64541ad4]. Contraception (2025). High credibility.

Contraception and body weight — available data do not support clinically significant weight gain with most contraceptive methods, except depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), and most studies have included participants with a BMI of less than 30 kg/m2. Clinicians should counsel individuals that nonhormonal methods (e.g., copper intrauterine device and barrier methods) have not been associated with a change in body weight and can be used without concern for weight gain. There is no evidence that combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) contribute to weight gain. For progestin-only contraceptives, data on weight change are inconsistent and variable by method. Levonorgestrel (LNG) IUDs can be used without concerns for significant weight gain, and among users for longer than one year weight gain is equivalent to that associated with increasing age and is not usually a reason for discontinuation. For the etonogestrel (ENG) implant, weight gain is reported as equivalent to that associated with increasing age, though a retrospective cohort in adolescents and young adults suggested an increase in BMI by approximately one unit during a 36 month period versus comparators. For DMPA, some studies show an association with weight gain — particularly among individuals with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or higher and adolescents — while others show no change in weight.

### Antidepressant utilisation and incidence of weight gain during 10 years' follow-up: population based cohort study [^f08868d7]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Main outcome measures

Antidepressant prescriptions were the exposure of interest. We initially classified these according to section 4.3 of the British National Formulary, including tricyclic and related antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and other antidepressant drugs. We then analysed individual antidepressant drugs: mirtazapine, duloxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, citalopram, fluoxetine, escitalopram, trazodone, amitriptyline, paroxetine, nortriptyline, and dosulepin.

Body weight was the outcome of interest. We evaluated all records of body weight, height, and BMI. If a body weight value was recorded that indicated a weight increase of ≥ 5% compared with the previous year, we classified the calendar year as being associated with weight gain. In the analysis we retained person time not associated with recorded body weight values, incorporating the assumption that weight gain had not occurred. In a sensitivity analysis, we excluded person time with no weight records, so as to provide a "complete case" analysis.

We included several variables as known confounders or effect modifiers in the relation between antidepressant use and subsequent weight gain: sex; initial BMI category; age; smoking status; coprescribing of antiepileptics or antipsychotics; and comorbidities of diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, and depression. Classifications of presence or absence of cancer, coronary heart disease, and stroke were recorded clinically, or if the participant had been referred to specialist services for management of any of these conditions. We classified diabetes as being present if the condition had been recorded in the dataset clinically, the participant had been prescribed a drug for the control of insulin dependent or non-insulin dependent diabetes, or the participant had been referred to a diabetes clinic. Participants were classified as depressed in each year of follow-up if they were recorded as having depression in a given year. Smoking status was taken from the clinical records, or inferred from referrals to smoking cessation clinics or from prescriptions of devices or drugs for smoking cessation. We also included whether participants had received advice about weight management or diet. Deprivation classification was based on fifths of the English index of multiple deprivation (2010), which evaluates social and material deprivation across seven domains. For subgroup analyses we categorised age into 10 year groups.

### Association between CYP metabolizer phenotypes and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors induced weight gain: a retrospective cohort study [^b43c7b7f]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current study identified that poor/intermediate metabolizer status for CYP2C19 is associated with a 1.7% more weight gain after 6 months than normal metabolizers in patients taking citalopram. This study shows that this remains significant among patients with overweight, where patients with poor/intermediate metabolizer status for CYP2C19 and taking citalopram had a TBWG of 3.0%. There were no disparities in comorbidities across individuals with various metabolizer statuses, and the difference in weight change remained after excluding patients who were using a CYP 450 inducer or inhibitor concurrently, highlighting the importance of the metabolizer status. Our results are generally consistent with previous studies showing the effect of citalopram on body weight. Aldrich et al. conducted a retrospective study using an electronic medical record of 263 youth with anxiety and depression prescribed citalopram. They showed a significant association between poor CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotype and earlier weight gain after 45 days of treatment. The weight changes related to other antidepressants were not connected with the other pharmacogenomic genes of interest.

Our findings are also consistent with previous studies in which fluoxetine and sertraline have shown minimal effects on weight gain. Conversely, paroxetine has demonstrated a greater risk of weight gain. Serretti et al. reported that the mean weight difference during 8 months of treatment was 2.73 kg for paroxetine. These findings were not replicated in our cohort treated with paroxetine; this discrepancy might be explained by the different intervals of the observations in the two studies.

A number of reasons complicate weight changes in individuals receiving depression medication; they may indicate an improvement in those who have lost weight due to their depression, but they can also be a side effect of the treatment. In our study, weight gain was seen in overweight patients on citalopram with poor/intermediate CYP2C19 metabolizer status. Previous research has found that participants who considered their weight status as overweight were more likely to gain weight in the future. We found that weight increase in patients treated with citalopram was significant even after controlling for BMI, indicating the importance of metabolizer status. As a result, it is critical to identify individuals who are prone to weight gain and risk factors that may contribute to it. It is crucial to underline that a decision tool such as pharmacogenomics may be more effective in these individuals as an ad hoc instrument.

Total body weight gain % by metabolizer status

The total body weight gain percentage (TBWG %) at six months for the patients prescribed any SSRIs was 0.7% (-1.4–2.9). When analyzed by medication prescribed, TBWG % at six months for citalopram was 1.1% (-1.3–3.1), paroxetine 0.9% (-1.2–3.3), sertraline 1.1% (-1.0–2.9), and fluoxetine 0.1% (-1.9–2.6). For patients on citalopram, patients who were poor/intermediate CYP2C19 metabolizers gained significantly more weight than normal and rapid/ultrarapid metabolizers (TBWG %: 2.6 [95% CI 1.3 — 4.1] vs. 0.4 [95% CI -0.5–1.3] vs. -0.1 [-95% CI -1.5 — 1.1], respectively; p = 0.001) (Fig. 2). After excluding 3 patients with an inducer or inhibitor of the CYP 450, patients who were poor/intermediate CYP2C19 metabolizers gained significantly more weight than normal and rapid metabolizers (TBWG %: 2.2 [95% CI 1.1 — 4.0] vs. 0.4 [95% CI -0.5–1.5] vs. -0.2 [95% CI -1.3 — 1.4], respectively; p = 0.003). No significant difference was found in TBWG percentage at three or six months according to the CYP2D6 phenotype for paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline, CYP2C9 for fluoxetine CYP2C19 for fluoxetine and sertraline (Table 3).

### The pharmacology of weight gain with antipsychotics [^a6861f02]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

In general, antipsychotic agents have diverse actions on a wide range of neurotransmitter systems. Data strongly suggest that a number of these systems may play a role in the regulation of body weight. In addition to having very distinct pharmacologic profiles, individual agents possess discrete weight gain liabilities. This article briefly reviews the evidence for the involvement of specific neurotransmitter systems in the control of body weight and describes the relevant pharmacologic characteristics of individual antipsychotic agents. By comparing the pharmacologic profiles of specific antipsychotic agents with their respective weight gain liabilities, this article attempts to gain an insight into the specific receptors underlying a drug's propensity to induce weight gain. However, there is still much to be learned concerning weight control mechanisms, and the role of many of the receptors at which antipsychotic agents are active remains unclear. In spite of this, an overview of current knowledge in the field may facilitate prediction of a potential novel antipsychotic agent's weight gain liability.

### Association between CYP metabolizer phenotypes and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors induced weight gain: a retrospective cohort study [^51382db3]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite their widespread usage of antidepressant medicine, initial drug selection success might be lower. According to the findings of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial, only one-third of the patients achieved remission within the first treatment level. Previous studies have found the clinical benefits of using pharmacogenomics to tailor the therapeutic approach in patients with major depressive disorder and anxiety. Poor metabolizers taking escitalopram resulted in a greater rate of therapeutic failure, indicating the potential clinical value of CYP2C19 genotyping for individualization of escitalopram. However, there has not been any difference in adverse drug events reported between pharmacogenomic tailored treatment compared with controls.

Previous studies have retrospectively assessed side effects and metabolizer status with antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and SSRIs. In terms of side effects and CYP2C19 and citalopram/escitalopram, a meta-analysis of 2037 patients found that, compared to normal metabolizers, CYP2C19 poor metabolizers had a greater risk of gastrointestinal, neurological, and sexual adverse effects. The Patient Rated Inventory of Side Effects (PRISE), which includes weight gain among other items and covers 9 categories and 32 items, is a typical measure used to evaluate side effects in most pharmacogenomics studies. Most research, however, focuses on side effects associated with a specific organ or system, which may restrict the relationship between pharmacogenomic studies with weight gain. Another study has looked at variations in the genes CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9 in patients taking SSRIs and tolerability and did not find a clear pharmacogenetic explanation for side effects. In a recent study of 9500 participants, poor metabolizers were at higher risk of side effects adding to the evidence for a link between CYP2C19 metabolism and SSRI tolerability. However, tolerability and side effects were evaluated by a survey using a qualitative assessment considering weight gain. The relationship between poor CYP2C19 metabolizer status and early weight gain documented in the medical record in children using escitalopram or citalopram has been described, adding to the data connecting metabolizer status and weight increase. This is the first study to objectively evaluate one of the common side effects of SSRIs, regardless of the response to treatment in adults.
