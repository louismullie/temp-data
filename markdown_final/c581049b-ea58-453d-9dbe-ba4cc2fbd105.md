## Question

What is the reason to administer metoprolol tartrate once daily?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why metoprolol tartrate would be administered once daily, when that is appropriate, and how to monitor for loss of 24‑hour control. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics and half-life of metoprolol tartrate. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about once-daily dosing versus divided dosing across indications. Next, I will review guideline recommendations for hypertension, angina, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. After that, I need to check pharmacodynamic considerations and the risk of end-of-dose attenuation. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and monitoring strategies, including when to prefer metoprolol succinate instead of tartrate for true once-daily therapy.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic foundation, because that drives dosing frequency. Metoprolol tartrate is an immediate-release formulation with an oral half-life around 3 to 7 hours and extensive first-pass metabolism, which explains why plasma levels decline over the day and why sustained beta-1 blockade can wane toward the end of a 24-hour dosing interval if given once daily, especially at lower doses [^116nSpnd] [^114uHtea].

> Wait, let me verify what the FDA labeling actually says about once-daily dosing for hypertension. The current FDA prescribing information states that the usual initial dose is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses, and it explicitly notes that while once-daily dosing can maintain blood pressure reduction throughout the day, lower doses, particularly 100 mg, may not sustain full effect at the end of 24 hours, so larger or more frequent doses may be required; it advises measuring blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to assess control [^115uPp7b] [^115rjXkV].

> Hold on, I should verify angina guidance, because end-of-dose failure matters clinically here. For angina pectoris, the FDA labeling recommends 100 mg daily given in two divided doses, and it instructs titration at weekly intervals until optimal response, reflecting the need to blunt ischemia across the entire day without gaps in beta-blockade [^115uPp7b].

> Next, I should review myocardial infarction protocols to ensure I'm not missing a once-daily role. In MI, the labeled regimen is intravenous loading followed by oral metoprolol tartrate 50 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours, then maintenance at 100 mg twice daily, underscoring that twice-daily dosing is standard for secondary prevention after MI rather than once-daily tartrate [^115uPp7b] [^113QBxBx].

> I need to check heart failure guidance carefully. Contemporary heart failure guidelines recommend beta-blockers with proven mortality benefit, specifically bisoprolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol succinate, not metoprolol tartrate; MERIT-HF established the benefits of metoprolol succinate (CR/XL) dosed once daily, whereas immediate-release metoprolol tartrate lacks the same outcome evidence base in HFrEF, so tartrate should not be used once daily for heart failure management [^111WJHYY] [^116LNxde] [^1155oLjF].

> Let me consider pharmacodynamics and end-of-dose attenuation, because this is where once-daily tartrate can fail. Immediate-release metoprolol produces peak plasma concentrations shortly after dosing with a trough toward the end of 24 hours; beta-1 selectivity also diminishes as plasma levels rise, so very high peaks with once-daily high doses can increase beta-2 effects while the trough still risks under-treatment, which is why divided dosing often provides smoother, more consistent control across the day [^11478XwY] [^116nSpnd].

> But wait, what if adherence is the overriding concern and once-daily tartrate seems tempting? I should double-check whether any authoritative guideline endorses once-daily tartrate as preferred. The 2025 ACC/AHA hypertension guideline lists metoprolol tartrate in the 100–200 mg/day range with a frequency of 2, i.e., twice daily, and reserves once-daily beta-blocker options for agents like metoprolol succinate, betaxolol, or bisoprolol, reinforcing that tartrate is not the preferred once-daily beta-blocker when adherence-friendly regimens are desired [^111RQ1TR] [^1145Vb2h].

> I will now examine special populations and drug–gene interactions that could modify once-daily feasibility. Poor CYP2D6 metabolizers have several-fold higher metoprolol exposure and prolonged half-life, which might theoretically allow some patients to maintain adequate control with once-daily tartrate; however, this pharmacokinetic shift also increases beta-2 blockade and adverse effects at higher peaks, so divided dosing remains safer and more predictable in most patients, particularly when interacting drugs are present [^111qLsZn] [^116nSpnd].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach, and I should confirm each element against labeling and guidelines. For hypertension, once-daily tartrate may be tried at higher total daily doses, for example 200 mg as a single morning dose with food, but I need to ensure blood pressure is checked near the end of the 24-hour interval; if control wanes, I should split to 100 mg twice daily or switch to metoprolol succinate for true once-daily pharmacokinetics and smoother beta-blockade across 24 hours [^115uPp7b] [^111RQ1TR]. For angina, divided dosing is preferred to avoid end-of-dose ischemia, so once-daily tartrate should generally be avoided. For post-MI secondary prevention, twice-daily tartrate is standard. For heart failure, use metoprolol succinate rather than tartrate, titrated to target doses per guideline-directed therapy [^115uPp7b] [^113QBxBx] [^111WJHYY].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the VA/DoD hypertension guideline endorsed metoprolol tartrate 100–200 mg once daily; let me verify and correct that. The VA/DoD guidance lists metoprolol tartrate immediate-release in the 50–300 mg/day range and notes dosing can be daily or divided twice daily, which does not constitute a recommendation for routine once-daily tartrate; it also highlights that as doses increase, cardioselectivity decreases, reinforcing the rationale for divided dosing when higher total doses are needed [^113WfUdP].

> Finally, I should confirm monitoring and safety steps if attempting once-daily tartrate. I need to ensure blood pressure and heart rate are measured near the end of the dosing interval to detect end-of-dose failure, watch for bradycardia, fatigue, dizziness, or bronchospasm that may reflect higher peaks, and avoid abrupt cessation; if angina worsens or heart rate and blood pressure rise late in the interval, I should divide the dose or switch to succinate for more consistent 24-hour coverage [^115uPp7b] [^112QxpL4] [^111RQ1TR].

Metoprolol tartrate is sometimes given once daily for **convenience and adherence** [^113WfUdP], especially in patients with stable hypertension who respond well to a single dose and have no significant end-of-dose symptoms [^115rjXkV]. However, because its half-life is short (3–7 hours) [^116nSpnd] and peak/trough effects can cause breakthrough symptoms, **once-daily dosing may not sustain full 24-hour control** [^115rjXkV], particularly at lower doses or in angina, arrhythmias, or heart failure [^115rjXkV]. If once-daily dosing is used, monitor for end-of-dose effects and consider switching to divided doses or metoprolol succinate for more stable coverage [^1153b6c5] [^11478XwY].

---

## Pharmacokinetic rationale for once-daily dosing

- **Half-life**: Metoprolol tartrate has a half-life of ~3–7 hours [^116nSpnd], supporting divided dosing for stable 24-hour control [^115rjXkV].

- **Peak/trough effects**: Immediate-release metoprolol causes peak/trough swings that can lead to breakthrough symptoms late in the interval [^112jyPep].

- **Dose dependence**: Higher once-daily doses (e.g. 200–400 mg) may maintain partial 24-hour effect, but lower doses (e.g. 100 mg) often fail to sustain full control by 24 hours [^115rjXkV].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting once-daily dosing

Evidence supporting once-daily metoprolol tartrate is limited; **most data support divided dosing** for stable 24-hour beta-blockade [^116nQB9f]. Limited evidence suggests that higher once-daily doses can maintain partial 24-hour control in some patients with hypertension, though not consistently across the full dosing interval [^115rjXkV].

---

## Clinical scenarios where once-daily dosing may be appropriate

Once-daily metoprolol tartrate may be considered in selected patients with **stable hypertension** who respond well to a single dose, have no significant end-of-dose symptoms, and prioritize adherence [^113WfUdP]. It may also be used short term when adherence to divided dosing is problematic, with close monitoring for breakthrough symptoms [^115rjXkV].

---

## Limitations and risks of once-daily dosing

- **End-of-dose failure**: Lower once-daily doses may not maintain full 24-hour control, risking rebound hypertension or angina [^115rjXkV].

- **Breakthrough symptoms**: Patients may experience palpitations, angina, or anxiety late in the dosing interval [^notfound].

- **Not for all indications**: Once-daily dosing is inappropriate for angina, arrhythmias, or heart failure, where stable 24-hour beta-blockade is critical [^116nQB9f].

---

## Comparison with metoprolol succinate

Metoprolol succinate (ER) is designed for **once-daily dosing**, providing stable 24-hour beta-blockade with fewer peak/trough fluctuations [^115yKwfx]. It is preferred for hypertension, angina, and heart failure when sustained control is needed [^1145Vb2h].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines generally favor divided dosing for metoprolol tartrate, especially in angina, arrhythmias, and heart failure [^notfound]. Once-daily tartrate is not first-line for these indications; **succinate is preferred** when once-daily therapy is desired [^111WJHYY].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing once-daily dosing decisions

- **Adherence**: Patients with adherence challenges may benefit from once-daily dosing if monitored closely [^114fZ5W6].

- **Comorbidities**: Angina, arrhythmias, or heart failure favor divided dosing or succinate [^111WJHYY].

- **Age and metabolism**: Elderly or CYP2D6 poor metabolizers may have prolonged effects, but divided dosing remains safer for stable control [^111qLsZn].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment strategies

- **Blood pressure monitoring**: Check BP near the end of the dosing interval to assess control [^115rjXkV].

- **Symptom tracking**: Monitor for breakthrough angina, palpitations, or anxiety late in the interval [^notfound].

- **Dose adjustment**: If breakthrough occurs, switch to divided doses or metoprolol succinate [^1153b6c5] [^115EUVcc].

---

Metoprolol tartrate can be used once daily in select patients with stable hypertension for convenience, but its short half-life makes divided dosing or metoprolol succinate preferable when sustained 24-hour control is needed. Use once-daily tartrate cautiously, monitor for end-of-dose effects, and switch formulations if control wanes [^115rjXkV] [^11478XwY].

2.1 Hypertension

Individualize the dosage of Metoprolol tartrate tablets. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals.

The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses. Adjust dosage at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. The effective dosage range of Metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg to 450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied. While once-daily dosing can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period. Larger or more frequent daily doses may be required. Measure blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the day.

2.2 Angina Pectoris

The dosage of Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be individualized. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals.

The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in two divided doses. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. The effective dosage range of Metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 to 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1–2 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.3 Myocardial Infarction

See prescribing information of intravenous metoprolol for dosage instructions for intravenous therapy.

In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose, initiate Metoprolol tartrate tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose of metoprolol and continue for 48 hours. In the case of intolerance, reduce dose to 25 mg and administer for 48 hours. Titrate, based on tolerability, to a maintenance dosage of 100 mg twice daily. Continue therapy for at least 3 months. Although the efficacy of Metoprolol tartrate beyond 3 months has not been conclusively established, data from studies with other beta-blockers suggest that treatment should be continued for 1 to 3 years.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Hypertension

Individualize the dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals.

The usual initial dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses, whether used alone or added to a diuretic. Increase the dosage at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100–450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied. While once-daily dosing is effective and can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period, and larger or more frequent daily doses may be required. This can be evaluated by measuring blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the day. Beta1selectivity diminishes as the dose of metoprolol tartrate is increased.

### Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide [^1153b6c5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Usual dose range: Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg and metoprolol tartrate 100 mg dosed once daily. (2.1)

2.1 Recommended Dosage

Titrate doses of individual components before switching to metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Administer metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets with or immediately following meals.

Hydrochlorothiazide is usually given at a dosage of 12.5 mg to 50 mg per day. The usual initial dosage of metoprolol is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses. Dosage may be increased gradually until optimum blood pressure control is achieved.

Once daily dosing may not maintain the full effect for the entire dosing period, particularly at lower doses. In such patients, consider administration in divided doses.

Dosing regimens that exceed 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day are not recommended.

Myocardial Infarction

Early Treatment:

During the early phase of definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, initiate treatment with metoprolol tartrate as soon as possible after the patient's arrival in the hospital. Such treatment should be initiated in a coronary care or similar unit immediately after the patient's hemodynamic condition has stabilized.

Begin treatment in this early phase with the intravenous administration of three bolus injections of 5 mg of metoprolol tartrate each; give the injections at approximately 2-minute intervals. During the intravenous administration of metoprolol tartrate, monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram.

In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (15 mg), initiate metoprolol tartrate tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose and continue for 48 hours. Thereafter, the maintenance dosage is 100 mg twice daily (see Late Treatment below).

Start patients who appear not to tolerate the full intravenous dose on metoprolol tartrate tablets either 25 mg or 50 mg every 6 hours (depending on the degree of intolerance) 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose or as soon as their clinical condition allows. In patients with severe intolerance, discontinue metoprolol tartrate (see WARNINGS).

Late Treatment:

Start patients with contraindications to treatment during the early phase of suspected or definite myocardial infarction, patients who appear not to tolerate the full early treatment, and patients in whom the physician wishes to delay therapy for any other reason on metoprolol tartrate tablets, 100 mg twice daily, as soon as their clinical condition allows. Continue therapy for at least 3 months. Although the efficacy of metoprolol tartrate beyond 3 months has not been conclusively established, data from studies with other beta blockers suggest that treatment should be continued for 1–3 years.

Special populations

Pediatric patients: No pediatric studies have been performed. The safety and efficacy of metoprolol tartrate in pediatric patients have not been established.

Renal impairment: No dose adjustment of metoprolol tartrate is required in patients with renal impairment.

Hepatic impairment: Metoprolol tartrate blood levels are likely to increase substantially in patients with hepatic impairment. Therefore, metoprolol tartrate should be initiated at low doses with cautious gradual dose titration according to clinical response.

Geriatric patients (> 65 years): In general, use a low initial starting dose in elderly patients given their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Method of administration:

For oral treatment, the tablets should be swallowed un-chewed with a glass of water. Metoprolol tartrate should always be taken in standardized relation with meals. If the physician asks the patient to take metoprolol tartrate either before breakfast or with breakfast, then the patient should continue taking metoprolol tartrate with the same schedule during the course of therapy.

14.1 Hypertension

In controlled clinical studies, metoprolol tartrate has been shown to be an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics, at dosages of 100 mg to 450 mg daily. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, metoprolol tartrate has been shown to be as effective an antihypertensive agent as propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, to be equally effective in supine and standing positions.

14.2 Angina Pectoris

In controlled clinical trials, metoprolol tartrate, administered two or four times daily, has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 mg to 400 mg daily. A controlled, comparative, clinical trial showed that metoprolol tartrate was indistinguishable from propranolol in the treatment of angina pectoris.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

In a large (1,395 patients randomized), double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, metoprolol tartrate injection was shown to reduce 3-month mortality by 36% in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction.

Patients were randomized and treated as soon as possible after their arrival in the hospital, once their clinical condition had stabilized and their hemodynamic status had been carefully evaluated. Subjects were ineligible if they had hypotension, bradycardia, peripheral signs of shock, and/or more than minimal basal rales as signs of congestive heart failure. Initial treatment consisted of intravenous followed by oral administration of metoprolol tartrate injection or placebo, given in a coronary care or comparable unit. Oral maintenance therapy with metoprolol tartrate injection or placebo was then continued for 3 months. After this double-blind period, all patients were given metoprolol tartrate injection and followed up to 1 year.

The median delay from the onset of symptoms to the initiation of therapy was 8 hours in both the metoprolol tartrate injection- and placebo-treatment groups. Among patients treated with metoprolol tartrate injection, there were comparable reductions in 3-month mortality for those treated early (≤ 8 hours) and those in whom treatment was started later. Significant reductions in the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and in chest pain following initial intravenous therapy were also observed with metoprolol tartrate injection and were independent of the interval between onset of symptoms and initiation of therapy.

In this study, patients treated with metoprolol received the drug both very early (intravenously) and during a subsequent 3-month period, while placebo patients received no beta-blocker treatment for this period. The study thus was able to show a benefit from the overall metoprolol regimen but cannot separate the benefit of very early intravenous treatment from the benefit of later beta-blocker therapy. Nonetheless, because the overall regimen showed a clear beneficial effect on survival without evidence of an early adverse effect on survival, one acceptable dosage regimen is the precise regimen used in the trial. Because the specific benefit of very early treatment remains to be defined however, it is also reasonable to administer the drug orally to patients at a later time as is recommended for certain other beta blockers.

### Rationale and design of the carvedilol or metoprolol European trial in patients with chronic heart failure: COMET [^111tyzfT]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2002). Low credibility.

In large clinical trials both carvedilol and metoprolol have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure. Carvedilol is an adrenoceptor antagonist, which inhibits beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors. Carvedilol has additional metabolic and antioxidant properties. Metoprolol is a selective antagonist of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors. The carvedilol or metoprolol European trial (COMET) is the first study to investigate whether beta-blocking agents with differing pharmacological profiles exert different effects on morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. 3029 patients from 15 different European countries were enrolled into COMET and will be followed until 1020 fatal events have been observed, unless the data and safety monitoring committee (DSMC) recommends early termination. The target dose for carvedilol is 25 mg bid and for metoprolol tartrate 50 mg bid. This manuscript outlines the rationale, design and possible outcomes of COMET.

Special population

Geriatric patients: The geriatric population may show slightly higher plasma concentrations of metoprolol as a combined result of a decreased metabolism of the drug in elderly population and a decreased hepatic blood flow. However, this increase is not clinically significant or therapeutically relevant.

Renal impairment: The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol tartrate in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects.

Hepatic Impairment: Since the drug is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism, hepatic impairment may impact the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol. The elimination half-life of metoprolol is considerably prolonged, depending on severity (up to 7.2 h).

Clinical Studies:

Hypertension

In controlled clinical studies, metoprolol tartrate has been shown to be an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics, at dosages of 100–450 mg daily. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, metoprolol tartrate has been shown to be as effective an antihypertensive agent as propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, to be equally effective in supine and standing positions.

Angina Pectoris

In controlled clinical trials, metoprolol tartrate, administered two or four times daily, has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100–400 mg daily. A controlled, comparative, clinical trial showed that metoprolol tartrate was indistinguishable from propranolol in the treatment of angina pectoris.

Second, physicians may recognize the inadequacy of low starting doses but may nonetheless believe that medium‐range doses provide most of the benefits of target doses. Theoretically, this premise would be true if medium‐range and high target doses were on the upper flat portion of the dose–response curve. Yet, in a clinical trials, higher doses have provided greater benefits than lower doses, 19, 20, 35, 36 and there is little evidence that medium‐range subtarget doses reduce the risk of death. Interestingly, the final step in the dose‐titration process to target doses may provide unexpectedly large survival benefits. In the COMET trial, 37 carvedilol (25 mg twice daily) was compared with metoprolol tartrate (50 mg twice daily) in a large double‐blind trial of > 3000 patients who were followed for nearly 5 years. At these doses, the heart rate reduction in the metoprolol group was within 1–2 bpm of that achieved in the carvedilol group, suggesting that metoprolol tartrate provided > 75% of the beta‐1 receptor blockade produced by carvedilol. 38 Yet, when compared with metoprolol, carvedilol was accompanied by a 20% lower risk of cardiovascular death. Since beta‐blockers reduce mortality by ≈30–35% when compared with placebo, 39 these observations suggest that more than half of the mortality reduction produced by target doses of beta‐blockers may be provided by the final step in the dose titration protocol. 40

5.1 Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered metoprolol tartrate, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, gradually reduce the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and monitor the patient. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary ischemia develops, promptly reinstate metoprolol tartrate, and take measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients not to interrupt therapy without their physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abruptly discontinuing metoprolol tartrate in patients treated only for hypertension.

5.2 Heart Failure

Worsening cardiac failure may occur during up-titration of metoprolol tartrate. If such symptoms occur, increase diuretics and restore clinical stability before advancing the dose of metoprolol tartrate [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. It may be necessary to lower the dose of metoprolol tartrate or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of metoprolol tartrate.

5.3 Bronchospastic Disease

Patients with bronchospastic disease, should in general, not receive beta-blockers, including metoprolol tartrate. Because of its relative beta1cardio-selectivity, however, metoprolol tartrate may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta1-selectivity is not absolute, use the lowest possible dose of metoprolol tartrate. Bronchodilators, including beta2-agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.4 Pheochromocytoma

If metoprolol tartrate is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle.

### Impact of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on clinical efficacy and tolerability of metoprolol tartrate [^115mQBd7]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Metoprolol is a selective β-1 adrenergic receptor blocker that undergoes extensive metabolism by the polymorphic enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Our objective was to investigate the influence of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on the efficacy and tolerability of metoprolol tartrate. Two hundred and eighty-one participants with uncomplicated hypertension received 50mg of metoprolol twice daily followed by response-guided titration to 100mg twice daily. Phenotypes were assigned based on results of CYP2D6 genotyping and copy number variation assays. Clinical response to metoprolol and adverse effect rates were analyzed in relation to CYP2D6 phenotypes using appropriate statistical tests. Heart rate response differed significantly by CYP2D6 phenotype (P < 0.0001), with poor and intermediate metabolizers showing greater reduction. However, blood pressure response and adverse effect rates were not significantly different by CYP2D6 phenotype. Other than a significant difference in heart rate response, CYP2D6 polymorphisms were not determinants of variability in metoprolol response or tolerability.

Exacerbation of Bronchospastic Disease

Patients with bronchospastic disease, should, in general, not receive beta blockers, including metoprolol tartrate. Because of its relative beta1selectivity, however, metoprolol tartrate may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta1selectivity is not absolute use the lowest possible dose of metoprolol tartrate and consider administering metoprolol tartrate in smaller doses three times daily, instead of larger doses two times daily, to avoid the higher plasma levels associated with the longer dosing interval (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Bronchodilators, including beta2agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

The peak plasma levels following once-daily administration of extended release metoprolol succinate are reduced by 50 to 75% on average compared to a corresponding dose of immediate-release metoprolol tartrate, both when administered once daily or in divided doses. At steady state the average bioavailability of metoprolol following administration of metoprolol succinate, across the dosage range of 50 to 400 mg once daily, was reduced by 25% relative to the corresponding single or divided doses of immediate-release metoprolol tartrate. The bioavailability of metoprolol shows a dose-related, although not directly proportional, increase with dose. The exposure (Cmaxand AUC) of metoprolol succinate extended-release capsule are similar to that of TOPROL-XL®tablet.

Absorption

Plasma levels following oral administration of metoprolol tablet approximate 50% of levels following intravenous administration, indicating about 50% first-pass metabolism. Peak plasma concentration of metoprolol is attained at 10 hours following administration of metoprolol succinate extended-release capsule.

Effect of food

### Commentary on the carvedilol or metoprolol European trial (COMET) [^112zkaWw]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

beta-Adrenergic blockade is commonly and successfully used to treat chronic heart failure. Until recently, few data were available on which to base selection of a particular beta-blocking agent. The Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) provides evidence that beta-blockers are not interchangeable. The trial compared carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker with alpha-adrenergic blocking and numerous ancillary activities, with metoprolol tartrate. In comparison to metoprolol tartrate, significant reductions in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality were observed with carvedilol. These data indicate that cardiovascular benefit may be obtained from switching patients from metoprolol tartrate to carvedilol.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Distribution

About 12% of the drug is bound to human serum albumin.

Metoprolol crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been reported in the CSF in a concentration 78% of the simultaneous plasma concentration.

Elimination

Elimination is mainly by biotransformation in the liver, and the plasma half-life ranges from approximately 3 hours to 7 hours.

Metabolism

Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R- and S- enantiomers, and is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. When administered orally, it exhibits stereoselective metabolism that is dependent on oxidation phenotype.

Excretion

Less than 5% of an oral dose of metoprolol is recovered unchanged in the urine; the rest is excreted by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no beta-blocking activity. Following intravenous administration of metoprolol, the urinary recovery of unchanged drug is approximately 10%.

Mean dialytic clearance of metoprolol following oral administration in patients receiving high-flux hemodialysis is 87 mL/min. Mean total systemic clearance of metoprolol following intravenous administration in patients with chronic renal failure is 1 L/min.

Drug Interactions

CYP2D6

Metoprolol is metabolized predominantly by CYP2D6. In healthy subjects with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer phenotype, co-administration of quinidine 100 mg, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, and immediate-release metoprolol 200 mg tripled the concentration of S-metoprolol and doubled the metoprolol elimination half-life. In four patients with cardiovascular disease, co-administration of propafenone 150 mg t.i.d. with immediate-release metoprolol 50 mg t.i.d. resulted in steady-state concentration of metoprolol 2- to 5-fold what is seen with metoprolol alone. Extensive metabolizers who concomitantly use CYP2D6 inhibiting drugs will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

12.5	Pharmacogenomics

CYP2D6 is absent in about 8% of Caucasians (poor metabolizers) and about 2% of most other populations. CYP2D6 can be inhibited by several drugs. Poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity.

### Comparison of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure in the carvedilol or metoprolol European trial (COMET): randomised controlled trial [^116icuNU]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Beta blockers reduce mortality in patients who have chronic heart failure, systolic dysfunction, and are on background treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.

Methods

In a multicentre, double-blind, and randomised parallel group trial, we assigned 1511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) and 1518 to metoprolol (metoprolol tartrate, target dose 50 mg twice daily). Patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), previous admission for a cardiovascular reason, an ejection fraction of less than 0.35, and to have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause admission. Analysis was done by intention to treat.

Findings

The mean study duration was 58 months (SD 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (0.07) and the mean age 62 years (11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio 0.83 [95% CI 0.74–0.93], p = 0.0017). The reduction of all-cause mortality was consistent across predefined subgroups. The composite endpoint of mortality or all-cause admission occurred in 1116 (74%) of 1511 on carvedilol and in 1160 (76%) of 1518 on metoprolol (0.94 [0.86–1.02], p = 0.122). Incidence of side-effects and drug withdrawals did not differ by much between the two study groups.

Interpretation

Our results suggest that carvedilol extends survival compared with metoprolol.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Distribution

About 12% of the drug is bound to human serum albumin. Metoprolol crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been reported in the CSF in a concentration 78% of the simultaneous plasma concentration.

Elimination

Elimination is mainly by biotransformation in the liver, and the plasma half-life ranges from approximately 3 to 7 hours.

Metabolism

Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R- and S-enantiomers and is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. When administered orally, it exhibits stereoselective metabolism that is dependent on oxidation phenotype.

Excretion

Less than 5% of an oral dose of metoprolol is recovered unchanged in the urine; the rest is excreted by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no beta-blocking activity. Following intravenous administration of metoprolol, the urinary recovery of unchanged drug is approximately 10%.

Mean dialytic clearance of metoprolol following oral administration in patients receiving high-flux hemodialysis is 87 mL/min. Mean total systemic clearance of metoprolol following intravenous administration in patients with chronic renal failure is 1 L/min.

Drug Interactions

CYP2D6

Metoprolol is metabolized predominantly by CYP2D6. In healthy subjects with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer phenotype, coadministration of quinidine 100 mg, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, and immediate-release metoprolol 200 mg tripled the concentration of S-metoprolol and doubled the metoprolol elimination half-life. In four patients with cardiovascular disease, coadministration of propafenone 150 mg t.i.d. with immediate-release metoprolol 50 mg t.i.d. resulted in steady-state concentration of metoprolol 2-to 5-fold what is seen with metoprolol alone. Extensive metabolizers who concomitantly use CYP2D6 inhibiting drugs will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

12.5
Pharmacogenomics

CYP2D6 is absent in about 8% of Caucasians (poor metabolizers) and about 2% of most other populations. CYP2D6 can be inhibited by several drugs. Poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity.

14.1 Hypertension

In a double-blind study, 1,092 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to once daily metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets (25, 100, or 400 mg), PLENDIL®(felodipine extended-release tablets), the combination, or placebo. After 9 weeks, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets alone decreased sitting blood pressure by 6 to 8/4 to 7 mmHg (placebo-corrected change from baseline) at 24 hours post-dose. The combination of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets with PLENDIL has greater effects on blood pressure.

In controlled clinical studies, an immediate-release dosage form of metoprolol was an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics at dosages of 100 to 450 mg daily. metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, produces similar β1-blockade as conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily. In addition, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets administered at a dose of 50 mg once daily lowered blood pressure 24-hours post-dosing in placebo-controlled studies. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, immediate-release metoprolol appeared comparable as an antihypertensive agent to propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, and affected both supine and standing blood pressure. Because of variable plasma levels attained with a given dose and lack of a consistent relationship of antihypertensive activity to drug plasma concentration, selection of proper dosage requires individual titration.

14.2 Angina Pectoris

In controlled clinical trials, an immediate-release formulation of metoprolol has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, has been shown to possess beta-blockade similar to conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily.

### Metoprolol tartrate (metoprolol tartrate) [^111qLsZn]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinectics

Absorption: The estimated oral bioavailability of immediate release metoprolol is about 50% because of pre-systemic metabolism which is saturable leading to non-proportionate increase in the exposure with increased dose.

Distribution: Metoprolol is extensively distributed with a reported volume of distribution of 3.2 to 5.6 L/kg. About 10% of metoprolol in plasma is bound to serum albumin. Metoprolol is known to cross the placenta and is found in breast milk. Metoprolol is also known to cross the blood brain barrier following oral administration and CSF concentrations close to that observed in plasma have been reported. Metoprolol is not a significant P-glycoprotein substrate

Metabolism: Metoprolol tartrate is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R-and S-enantiomers, and when administered orally, it exhibits stereoselective metabolism that is dependent on oxidation phenotype. CYP2D6 is absent (poor metabolizers) in about 8% of Caucasians and about 2% of most other populations. Poor CYP2D6 metabolizers exhibit several-fold higher plasma concentrations of metoprolol tartrate than extensive metabolizers with normal CYP2D6 activity thereby decreasing metoprolol tartrate's cardioselectivity.

Elimination: Elimination of metoprolol tartrate is mainly by biotransformation in the liver. The mean elimination half-life of metoprolol is 3 to 4 hours; in poor CYP2D6 metabolizers the half-life may be 7 to 9 hours. Approximately 95% of the dose can be recovered in urine. In most subjects (extensive metabolizers), less than 5% of an oral dose and less than 10% of an intravenous dose are excreted as unchanged drug in the urine. In poor metabolizers, up to 30% or 40% of oral or intravenous doses, respectively, may be excreted unchanged; the rest is excreted by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no beta blocking activity. The renal clearance of the stereo-isomers does not exhibit stereo-selectivity in renal excretion.

### Effects of metoprolol and carvedilol on cause-specific mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure – COMET [^116nDQor]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers with different receptor bindings reduce mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. We compared the effects of the beta1-blocker metoprolol tartrate and the beta1-, beta2-, and alpha1-blocker carvedilol.

Methods

In a randomized double-blind design, 3029 patients with chronic congestive heart failure requiring diuretic therapy and with left ventricular dysfunction were randomized to treatment with carvedilol (n = 1511) or metoprolol tartrate (n = 1518) and titrated to target doses of 25 mg of carvedilol twice daily or 50 mg of metoprolol tartrate twice daily. The main outcome measures were total mortality and the combination of mortality or hospitalization for any cause. Secondary end points were cardiovascular death, combinations of morbidity and mortality, New York Heart Association class, worsening of heart failure, hospitalizations, and discontinuation of study therapy.

Results

A total of 512 and 600 patients in the carvedilol group and metoprolol group, respectively, died (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.74–0.93, P = 0.0017). Cardiovascular death was reduced by carvedilol (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70–0.90, P = 0.0004). There were fewer sudden deaths and deaths caused by circulatory failure or by stroke in the carvedilol group. There was no difference in all-cause hospitalizations or in worsening heart failure between treatment groups. The incidence of fatal or nonfatal acute myocardial infarction was significantly lower in the carvedilol group (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52–0.97, P = 0.03). Discontinuations of study therapy were similar in the 2 groups.

Conclusion

Compared with metoprolol tartrate, carvedilol reduced cardiovascular mortality, sudden death, death caused by circulatory failure, death caused by stroke, as well as fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions.

### Extended-release metoprolol succinate in chronic heart failure [^116LNxde]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and tolerability of extended-release (ER) metoprolol succinate and its role in the management of chronic heart failure.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search of English-language literature (1990-October 2002) was conducted using congestive heart failure and metoprolol CR/XL or metoprolol CR/ZOK as search terms to identify pertinent studies.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

All of the articles identified from the data sources were evaluated, with priority given to randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.

Data Synthesis

ER metoprolol succinate is a controlled-release tablet designed to produce even and consistent beta(1)-blockade throughout the 24-hour dosing interval, with less fluctuation in metoprolol plasma concentrations compared with immediate-release metoprolol. Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of ER metoprolol succinate in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. The MERIT-HF (Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure) study, the largest of these trials and the largest randomized mortality trial with beta-blockers in heart failure to date, demonstrated that ER metoprolol succinate reduced the relative risk of all-cause mortality by 34% versus placebo. Furthermore, the relative risk of the combined endpoint of mortality plus all-cause hospitalizations was reduced by 19% and sudden death was reduced by 41%. The benefits of therapy were evident in various patient subgroups, including elderly patients and those with diabetes mellitus. ER metoprolol succinate was generally well tolerated, with a similar proportion of patients discontinuing therapy due to adverse events relative to placebo (9.8% and 11.7%, respectively).

Conclusions

ER metoprolol succinate therapy provides substantial mortality and morbidity benefits in patients with New York Heart Association class II and III heart failure who are stabilized on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics. ER metoprolol succinate is administered once daily, is well tolerated, and provides consistent beta(1)-blockade over the 24-hour dosing interval.

### Antihypertensive medication regimens used by US adults with hypertension and the potential for fixed-dose combination products: the national health and nutrition examination surveys 2015 to 2020 [^114D5GXU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The BP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg recommended by the US guidelines for most US adults with hypertension will not be achieved without improvements in how antihypertensive medications are prescribed and used. In the current study, only 52.6% of US adults with hypertension taking ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications had a measured BP below this threshold. Improving the rate of medication intensification (ie, avoiding therapeutic inertia) may be the most important factor to improve BP control rates.FDC products are one method to prevent therapeutic inertia and improve medication adherence, yet no qualitative studies have explored why FDC use is low in current practice, which is surely related to reasons beyond simple availability (eg, cost and titration difficulties). Such qualitative research may isolate if any clinician‐specific hesitations exist to using FDCs and investigate how clinicians choose to prescribe class combinations or specific medications. Further research on longitudinal treatment patterns in patients with hypertension may shed light on the appropriateness or inappropriateness of regimens and how to encourage the use of evidence‐based therapy across the treatment continuum.

The current study's strengths include robust medication data collection among participants representative of the US population. NHANES is payer agnostic, reflecting real‐world medication use and practice patterns irrespective of care delivery model. Results may differ among specific populations by age or insurance type (eg, integrated care delivery systems). The study is limited in that medication dose is unavailable in NHANES, and we could not differentiate between use of FDCs with metoprolol tartrate versus succinate. Furthermore, as the current study is cross‐sectional, we cannot determine the regimen appropriateness for each participant. This study's results are dependent on the assumption that the entire regimen had to be available as 1 FDC. It is possible that results would differ if the regimen could be achieved through ≥ 2 FDCs, although based on the infrequent use (< 0.5%) of 1 of the commercially available FDCs in the current analysis and lack of comprehensive FDCs with β‐blockers and CCB classes, we do not anticipate materially different results if this assumption were relaxed. Finally, some regimens and FDC products are favorable over others because of preferred class combinations or formulation as once‐daily dosing frequencies, but this was beyond the scope of our current analysis.

### Metoprolol (Metoprolol tartrate) [^114mkPDm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Excretion

Approximately 95% of the dose can be recovered in urine. In most subjects (extensive metabolizers), less than 5% of an oral dose and less than 10% of an intravenous dose are excreted as unchanged drug in the urine. In poor metabolizers, up to 30% or 40% of oral or intravenous doses, respectively, may be excreted unchanged; the rest is excreted by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no beta-blocking activity. The renal clearance of the stereo-isomers does not exhibit stereo-selectivity in renal excretion.

Specific populations

Geriatric patients: The geriatric population may show slightly higher plasma concentrations of metoprolol as a combined result of a decreased metabolism of the drug in elderly population and a decreased hepatic blood flow. However, this increase is not clinically significant or therapeutically relevant.

Renal impairment: The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol tartrate in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects.

Hepatic Impairment: Since the drug is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism, hepatic impairment may impact the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol.

Drug Interactions

Metoprolol is metabolized predominantly by CYP2D6. In healthy subjects with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer phenotype, coadministration of quinidine 100 mg, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, and immediate-release metoprolol 200 mg tripled the concentration of S-metoprolol and doubled the metoprolol elimination half-life. In four patients with cardiovascular disease, coadministration of propafenone 150 mg t.i.d. with immediate-release metoprolol 50 mg t.i.d. increased the steady-state metoprolol concentration 2-to 5-fold compared to metoprolol alone. Extensive metabolizers who concomitantly use CYP2D6 inhibiting drugs will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

12.5 Pharmacogenomics

CYP2D6 is absent in about 8% of Caucasians (poor metabolizers) and about 2% of most other populations. CYP2D6 can be inhibited by several drugs. Poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity.

### Metoprolol succinate er tablets (metoprolol succinate) [^116yff7M]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Heart Failure

Dosage must be individualized and closely monitored during up-titration. Prior to initiation of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, stabilize the dose of other heart failure drug therapy. The recommended starting dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA Class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. Double the dose every two weeks to the highest dosage level tolerated by the patient or up to 200 mg of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets.

Initial difficulty with titration should not preclude later attempts to introduce metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If patients experience symptomatic bradycardia, reduce the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If transient worsening of heart failure occurs, consider treating with increased doses of diuretics, lowering the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, or temporarily discontinuing it. The dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure have been stabilized.

2.4 Administration

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are scored and can be divided; however, do not crush or chew the whole or half tablet.

### Metoprolol succinate er tablets (metoprolol succinate) [^116Wg1uK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

1.2 Angina Pectoris

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated in the long-term treatment of angina pectoris, to reduce angina attacks and to improve exercise tolerance.

1.3 Heart Failure

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and heart-failure hospitalization in patients with heart failure.

POISE trial — extended-release metoprolol succinate protocol and eligibility are summarized as follows: Patients undergoing noncardiac surgery were randomly assigned to extended-release metoprolol succinate or placebo starting 2 to 4 hours before surgery and continued for 30 days, with a primary end point of a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal cardiac arrest, and eligibility included an expected hospital stay of at least 24 hours with specified cardiovascular risk criteria. The first dose was 100 mg given 2 to 4 hours preoperatively; drug administration required a heart rate of 50 bpm or higher and a systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or greater; and if during the first 6 postoperative hours heart rate was 80 bpm or more and systolic blood pressure was 100 mm Hg or higher the first postoperative 100 mg dose was given orally, otherwise it was given at 6 hours after surgery. Twelve hours after the first postoperative dose, patients took extended-release metoprolol 200 mg or placebo every day for 30 days; if heart rate was consistently below 45 bpm or systolic blood pressure dropped below 100 mm Hg the study drug was withheld and then restarted at 100 mg once daily, and if heart rate was consistently 45 to 49 bpm with systolic blood pressure exceeded 100 mm Hg the study drug was delayed for 12 hours. Patients unable to take oral medications received intravenous infusion options of a slow infusion of 15 mg over 60 minutes or a rapid infusion of 5 mg over 2 minutes every 5 minutes up to a total of 15 mg, and the final analysis included 8351 patients from 190 hospitals in 23 countries.

### Meta-analysis of the effects of carvedilol versus metoprolol on all-cause mortality and hospitalizations in patients with heart failure [^111NPja7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Long-term treatment with appropriate doses of carvedilol or metoprolol is currently recommended for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to decrease the risk of death, hospitalizations, and patients' symptoms. It remains unclear if the β blockers used in patients with HFrEF are equal or carvedilol is superior to metoprolol types. We performed a meta-analysis of the comparative effects of carvedilol versus metoprolol tartrate and succinate on all-cause mortality and/or hospitalization. We conducted an Embase and MEDLINE search for prospective controlled trials and cohort studies of patients with HFrEF who were received to treatment with carvedilol versus metoprolol. We identified 4 prospective controlled and 6 cohort studies with 30,943 patients who received carvedilol and 69,925 patients on metoprolol types (tartrate and succinate) with an average follow-up duration of 36.4 months. All-cause mortality was reduced in prospective studies with carvedilol versus metoprolol tartrate. Neither all-cause mortality nor hospitalizations were significantly different between carvedilol and metoprolol succinate in the cohort studies. In conclusion, in patients with HFrEF, carvedilol and metoprolol succinate have similar effects in reducing all-cause mortality.

### Metoprolol tartrate (metoprolol tartrate) [^112GtPRn]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Digitalis glycosides and beta blockers: Both digitalis glycosides and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and PR interval.

Calcium channel blockers: Concomitant administration of a beta-adrenergic antagonist with a calcium channel blocker may produce an additive reduction in myocardial contractility because of negative chronotropic and inotropic effects.

CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Potent inhibitors of the CYP2D6 enzyme may increase the plasma concentration of metoprolol tartrate which would mimic the pharmacokinetics of CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (see Pharmacokinetics section). Increase in plasma concentrations of metoprolol would decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol. Known clinically significant potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 are antidepressants such as fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, bupropion, clomipramine, and desipramine; antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, and thioridazine; antiarrhythmics such as quinidine or propafenone; antiretrovirals such as ritonavir; antihistamines such as diphenhydramine; antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine or quinidine; antifungals such as terbinafine.

Hydralazine: Concomitant administration of hydralazine may inhibit presystemic metabolism of metoprolol leading to increased concentrations of metoprolol.

Alpha-adrenergic agents: Antihypertensive effect of alpha-adrenergic blockers such as guanethidine, betanidine, reserpine, alpha-methyldopa or clonidine may be potentiated by beta-blockers including metoprolol tartrate. Beta-adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the postural hypotensive effect of the first dose of prazosin, probably by preventing reflex tachycardia. On the contrary, beta adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the hypertensive response to withdrawal of clonidine in patients receiving concomitant clonidine and beta-adrenergic blocker. If a patient is treated with clonidine and metoprolol tartrate concurrently, and clonidine treatment is to be discontinued, stop metoprolol tartrate several days before clonidine is withdrawn. Rebound hypertension that can follow withdrawal of clonidine may be increased in patients receiving concurrent beta-blocker treatment.

Ergot alkaloid: Concomitant administration with beta-blockers may enhance the vasoconstrictive action of ergot alkaloids.

Dipyridamole: In general, administration of a beta-blocker should be withheld before dipyridamole testing, with careful monitoring of heart rate following the dipyridamole injection.

### Do metoprolol and carvedilol have equivalent effects on diurnal heart rate in patients with chronic heart failure? [^112tzUKt]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Carvedilol exerted a greater reduction in mortality than metoprolol tartrate in the Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET). However, it is unclear if the degree and time course of beta1-blockade during a 24-h period was similar with each agent at the doses used. Therefore we analyzed 24-h ECG Holter recordings from a study which compared the long-term clinical efficacy of metoprolol tartrate to carvedilol in chronic heart failure patients using the same dosing regimen as in COMET.

Methods and Results

Fifty-one patients with chronic heart failure with a mean LVEF 26 ± 1.8% were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive metoprolol tartrate 50 mg bid or carvedilol 25 mg bid. 24-h ECG monitoring (Holter) was performed at baseline, 12 weeks and 1 year. Adequate quality recordings for analysis were obtained from 43 subjects at baseline, 42 at 12 weeks and 29 subjects at 1 year. Both drugs produced a fall in average 24-h heart rate from baseline at 12 weeks and at 1 year: metoprolol 88 ± 3 to 71 ± 2 and 69 ± 3 bpm; carvedilol 83 ± 3 to 70 ± 2 and 70 ± 3 bpm respectively (all p < 0.001). The pattern of suppression of heart rate during the 24-h period was similar for both drugs.

Conclusion

Metoprolol tartrate 50 mg bid and carvedilol 25 mg bid had similar effects on 24-h heart rate. This result suggests that the degree of beta1-blockade produced by these two drugs in these doses is comparable and the superior survival effect of carvedilol compared to metoprolol seen in COMET is likely to be due to actions of carvedilol other than beta1-blockade.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^112gAvLM]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

The proposed approach is non‐judgmental, i.e. it does not designate any stratum as being 'optimal', 'acceptable' or 'adequate'. It does not make reference to a guideline, since there are numerous different guidelines throughout the world. The proposed approach also does not ask physicians to distinguish among all possible reasons for the prescribing of non‐target doses, since it is failure to follow a forced‐titration strategy that matters rather than the reasons for not following it.

Table 1 displays one possible approach to the definition of the three strata. Thresholds are proposed for the identification of patients who would reside in stratum I, stratum II, or stratum III. The table is presented only for purposes of illustration. The clinical community needs to debate and revise the proposed criteria and reach consensus as to the definitions of specific strata. However, the debate must start somewhere, and Table 1 represents a starting point.

Table 1
Proposed framework for characterizing the adherence of individual patients to trial‐based strategies for the prescribing of neurohormonal antagonists for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction

An advantage of the approach presented in the table is that it allows physicians to readily describe the degree to which an individual patient's treatment adheres to a trial‐proven strategy. Simple abbreviations could be used to refer to each drug class, i.e. RAS for ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers; BB for beta‐blockers; MRA for spironolactone or eplerenone; and ARNI for neprilysin inhibition. Accordingly, a patient receiving target doses of carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan and spironolactone might be described as BB1/ARNI1/MRA1. Conversely, a patient who is taking enalapril 5 mg twice daily and metoprolol tartrate 50 mg twice daily but no mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist or neprilysin inhibitor would be designated as RAS2/BB2/MRA3/ARNI3. Finally, a patient who is receiving sacubitril/valsartan, carvedilol and spironolactone at subtarget doses and was prescribed higher doses but shown to be intolerant despite a concerted effort would be designated as BB1/ARNI1/MRA1, since the patient received treatment in accordance with forced strategies used in the landmark trials.

Calcium channel blockers: Concomitant administration of a beta-adrenergic antagonist with a calcium channel blocker may produce an additive reduction in myocardial contractility because of negative chronotropic and inotropic effects.

Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction: While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction.

General Anesthetics:Some inhalation anesthetics may enhance the cardiodepressant effect of beta blockers (see WARNINGS, Major Surgery).

CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Potent inhibitors of the CYP2D6 enzyme may increase the plasma concentration of Metoprolol Tartrate which would mimic the pharmacokinetics of CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (see Pharmacokinetics section). Increase in plasma concentrations of metoprolol would decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol. Known clinically significant potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 are antidepressants such as fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, bupropion, clomipramine, and desipramine; antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, and thioridazine; antiarrhythmics such as quinidine or propafenone; antiretrovirals such as ritonavir; antihistamines such as diphenhydramine; antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine or quinidine; antifungals such as terbinafine.

### Metoprolol succinate er tablets (metoprolol succinate) [^111nCzf8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Hypertension

In a double-blind study, 1092 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to once daily metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets (25 mg, 100 mg, or 400 mg), PLENDIL® (felodipine extended-release tablets), the combination, or placebo. After 9 weeks, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets alone decreased sitting blood pressure by 6–8/4–7 mmHg (placebo-corrected change from baseline) at 24 hours post-dose. The combination of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets with PLENDIL has greater effects on blood pressure.

In controlled clinical studies, an immediate-release dosage form of metoprolol was an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics at dosages of 100 mg to 450 mg daily. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, in dosages of 100 mg to 400 mg once daily, produces similar β1-blockade as conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily. In addition, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets administered at a dose of 50 mg once daily lowered blood pressure 24-hours post-dosing in placebo-controlled studies. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, immediate-release metoprolol appeared comparable as an antihypertensive agent to propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, and affected both supine and standing blood pressure. Because of variable plasma levels attained with a given dose and lack of a consistent relationship of antihypertensive activity to drug plasma concentration, selection of proper dosage requires individual titration.

14.2 Angina Pectoris

In controlled clinical trials, an immediate-release formulation of metoprolol has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, has been shown to possess betablockade similar to conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily.

### Metoprolol succinate er tablets (metoprolol succinate) [^11478XwY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Clinical pharmacology studies have confirmed the beta-blocking activity of metoprolol in man, as shown by (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at rest and upon exercise, (2) reduction of systolic blood pressure upon exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia.

The relationship between plasma metoprolol levels and reduction in exercise heart rate is independent of the pharmaceutical formulation. Beta1-blocking effects in the range of 30–80% of the maximal effect (approximately 8 to 23% reduction in exercise heart rate) correspond to metoprolol plasma concentrations from 30 to 540 nmol/L. The relative beta1-selectivity of metoprolol diminishes and blockade of beta2-adrenoceptors increases at plasma concentration above 300 nmol/L.

In five controlled studies in normal healthy subjects, extended-release metoprolol succinate administered once a day, and immediate-release metoprolol administered once to four times a day, provided comparable total beta1-blockade over 24 hours (area under the beta1-blockade versus time curve) in the dose range 100 to 400 mg. In another controlled study, 50 mg once daily for each product, extended-release metoprolol succinate produced significantly higher total beta1-blockade over 24 hours than immediate-release metoprolol. For extended-release metoprolol succinate, the percent reduction in exercise heart rate was relatively stable throughout the entire dosage interval and the level of beta1-blockade increased with increasing doses from 50 to 300 mg daily.

### Metabolic effects of carvedilol vs metoprolol in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension: a randomized controlled trial [^114iShaX]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Beta-blockers have been shown to decrease cardiovascular risk in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM); however, some components of the metabolic syndrome are worsened by some beta-blockers.

Objective

To compare the effects of beta-blockers with different pharmacological profiles on glycemic and metabolic control in participants with DM and hypertension receiving renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade, in the context of cardiovascular risk factors.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial (The Glycemic Effects in Diabetes Mellitus: Carvedilol-Metoprolol Comparison in Hypertensives [GEMINI]) conducted between June 1, 2001, and April 6, 2004, at 205 US sites that compared the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol tartrate on glycemic control. The 1235 participants were aged 36 to 85 years with hypertension (> 130/80 mm Hg) and type 2 DM (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c], 6.5%-8.5%) and were receiving RAS blockers. Participants were followed up for 35 weeks.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to receive a 6.25- to 25-mg dose of carvedilol (n = 498) or 50- to 200-mg dose of metoprolol tartrate (n = 737), each twice daily. Open-label hydrochlorothiazide and a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist were added, if needed, to achieve blood pressure target.

Main Outcome Measures

Difference between groups in mean change from baseline HbA1c following 5 months of maintenance therapy. Additional prespecified comparisons included change from baseline HbA1c in individual treatment groups, treatment effect on insulin sensitivity, and microalbuminuria.

Results

The 2 groups differed in mean change in HbA1c from baseline (0.13%; 95% confidence interval, -0.22% to -0.04%; p = 0.004; modified intention-to-treat analysis). The mean (SD) HbA1c increased with metoprolol (0.15% [0.04%]; P < .001) but not carvedilol (0.02% [0.04%]; p = 0.65). Insulin sensitivity improved with carvedilol (-9.1%; p = 0.004) but not metoprolol (-2.0%; p = 0.48); the between-group difference was -7.2% (95% CI, -13.8% to -0.2%; p = 0.004). Blood pressure was similar between groups. Progression to microalbuminuria was less frequent with carvedilol than with metoprolol (6.4% vs 10.3%; odds ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.36–0.97; p = 0.04).

Conclusions

Both beta-blockers were well tolerated; use of carvedilol in the presence of RAS blockade did not affect glycemic control and improved some components of the metabolic syndrome relative to metoprolol in participants with DM and hypertension. The effects of the 2 beta-blockers on clinical outcomes need to be compared in long-term clinical trials.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA Practice Guidelines — patients with pulmonary disease and heart failure: Because dyspnea is a key symptom in both conditions, distinguishing the two and quantifying cardiac versus pulmonary contributions is important, and exercise testing with simultaneous gas exchange or blood gas measurements may be helpful, particularly when used with right heart catheterization. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) can cause a persistent nonproductive cough that may be mistaken for respiratory disease and conversely may be stopped inappropriately; physicians should seek a pulmonary cause in all patients with HF who complain of cough, attribute cough to ACEI only if respiratory disorders are excluded and it disappears after cessation and recurs after reinstitution, and many patients can be encouraged to tolerate ACEI-related cough in view of ACEI benefits. Beta-blockers can aggravate bronchospastic symptoms in asthma, yet many with asymptomatic or mild reactive airway disease tolerate beta-blockers well, most patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remain reasonable candidates for beta-blockade, and both metoprolol tartrate and bisoprolol lose beta-1 selectivity when prescribed in doses associated with an improvement in survival in patients with HF.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

The peak plasma levels following once-daily administration of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets average one-fourth to one-half the peak plasma levels obtained following a corresponding dose of conventional metoprolol, administered once daily or in divided doses. At steady state the average bioavailability of metoprolol following administration of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, across the dosage range of 50 to 400 mg once daily, was 77% relative to the corresponding single or divided doses of conventional metoprolol.

The bioavailability of metoprolol shows a dose-related, although not directly proportional, increase with dose and is not significantly affected by food following metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets administration.

The peak plasma levels following oral administration of conventional metoprolol tablets, however, approximate 50% of levels following intravenous administration, indicating about 50% first-pass metabolism.

Distribution

Metoprolol crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been reported in the CSF in a concentration 78% of the simultaneous plasma concentration. Only a small fraction of the drug (about 12%) is bound to human serum albumin.

Metabolism

Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R- and S- enantiomers and is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. When administered orally, it exhibits stereoselective metabolism that is dependent on oxidation phenotype.
