## Question

Mickles diverticulum

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Meckel's diverticulum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the embryology and anatomy to anchor the foundation. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and the "rule of 2s". Next, I will examine the pathophysiology of complications. After that, I need to review clinical presentations by age and mechanism. Then, I should appraise diagnostic strategies and imaging performance, including pitfalls. Next, I will evaluate management, including the incidental MD debate and surgical techniques. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical algorithm, making sure I double-check any conflicting data points along the way.

> Let me first confirm the embryologic basis and core anatomy, because everything else flows from this. Meckel's diverticulum arises from failure of involution of the omphalomesenteric (vitelline) duct, typically forming a true diverticulum on the antimesenteric border of the distal ileum within about 80–100 cm of the ileocecal valve, with a dedicated blood supply from a terminal branch of the superior mesenteric artery, which is crucial for surgical planning and recognizing ectopic tissue risks [^113hXtED].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology and the "rule of 2s" before I overgeneralize. Prevalence is about 2% of the population, with a male predominance for complications around 2–3:1, and symptomatic cases are more common in children, especially under 2 years. The diverticulum averages about 2 cm in length, and ectopic tissue is present in roughly half of cases, though I should note that some series report ectopic tissue in up to 57% and nearly all symptomatic bleeding cases harbor ectopic gastric mucosa, so I need to keep that nuance in mind [^116Bjzm8] [^117RPxRc].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology of complications, and I need to ensure I separate mechanisms clearly. Bleeding in children is classically due to acid secretion from ectopic gastric mucosa causing peptic ulceration of adjacent ileal mucosa, whereas obstruction mechanisms include intussusception with MD as a lead point, volvulus around fibrous or mesodiverticular bands, internal hernias, Littre hernia, and strictures from chronic diverticulitis; diverticulitis arises from luminal obstruction by enteroliths, foreign bodies, or torsion, and perforation can follow diverticulitis, ulceration, or foreign body injury; neoplasms are rare but reported, reminding me to consider segmental resection when malignancy is a concern [^116w4MU1] [^117BMGKt] [^111fFKgn] [^111qDe9c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical presentations without age stratification. In children, painless hematochezia or melena from ectopic gastric mucosa is classic, while obstruction and intussusception are also common. In adults, obstruction predominates and bleeding may present as melena with crampy pain due to slower transit, and diverticulitis or perforation can mimic appendicitis or other inflammatory processes, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion when the appendix looks normal at exploration [^116w4MU1] [^1148EApY] [^111fFKgn].

> Next, I should review diagnostic strategies and their performance, and I need to double-check sensitivity figures because they vary by age and modality. Technetium-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy detects ectopic gastric mucosa with reported sensitivity around 80–92% in children but lower in adults, and adjuncts like H2 blockers, pentagastrin, and glucagon can optimize yield; repeat scanning is reasonable if suspicion remains high after a negative or equivocal study, and I should remember pitfalls such as urinary activity, inflammation, or duplication cysts mimicking uptake [^116cCCqa] [^116w4MU1] [^113YX7kw] [^115k9fE7]. High-frequency ultrasound can be surprisingly accurate in children with bleeding MD, with sensitivity up to 93.6% and specificity around 98%, so I should not dismiss sonography when a Meckel scan is negative or unavailable [^112AeHgU]. CT is relatively insensitive for bleeding MD but can identify complicated MD as a blind-ending ileal pouch with surrounding inflammation, obstruction, or free air, and MR enterography can help in select scenarios; device-assisted enteroscopy offers high diagnostic yield for obscure bleeding but is invasive and operator dependent [^1123fteP] [^111sfPDX] [^111t2CEU] [^116cCCqa].

> Let me consider the incidental Meckel's debate carefully, because I need to balance risks and benefits. Historically, some advocated selective resection based on features like age under 50, male sex, length greater than 2 cm, narrow base, or ectopic tissue, which increase the odds of future symptoms; however, a systematic review suggested higher postoperative complications with prophylactic resection and no increase in late complications when leaving incidental MD in situ, implying that many patients would need to be resected to prevent one death, so shared decision-making is essential, especially in older adults or those with comorbidities [^117RPxRc] [^114BQUyR]. But wait, what if the patient is immunocompromised or the diverticulum is long and narrow-based with palpable abnormality; in those contexts, resection may still be reasonable, and some contemporary series and guidelines lean toward resection in higher-risk incidental features, so I should individualize based on anatomy, patient factors, and surgical risk [^117RPxRc] [^116cCCqa].

> I should confirm the surgical approach for symptomatic disease and make sure I choose the right technique. Definitive treatment for complicated MD is surgical resection, with laparoscopy favored when feasible for reduced length of stay and faster recovery; options include diverticulectomy at the base or segmental ileal resection when there is ectopic tissue, ulceration in the adjacent ileum, perforation, or suspicion for neoplasm, and I need to orient the staple or suture line perpendicular to the bowel axis to avoid narrowing [^114gc6nW] [^111fFKgn] [^111qDe9c]. In unstable patients with massive bleeding, urgent laparotomy may be required, and I should remember that ectopic gastric mucosa can extend beyond the diverticulum into adjacent ileum, which is why segmental resection is sometimes preferred to ensure complete removal of acid-secreting tissue [^115hACn6].

> Let me review special populations and scenarios so I do not miss important nuances. In neonates, perforation or obstruction can present early and may require emergent laparotomy, as illustrated by recent case reports, so a high index of suspicion for acute abdomen is vital even when classic bleeding is absent [^114jvCgj]. In pregnancy, physiologic and anatomic changes delay diagnosis; if perforation is suspected, operative management with maternal–fetal coordination is indicated, and stoma strategies may be needed based on contamination and patient factors [^114rZGZn]. In resource-limited settings, ultrasound may be the primary modality and surgical exploration may be both diagnostic and therapeutic when imaging is inconclusive, so I should adapt the pathway to local capabilities [^114Jz61t].

> I should double-check the diagnostic algorithm to ensure it is practical and evidence-aligned. For a child with painless rectal bleeding, a Meckel scan is first-line. If negative but suspicion remains high, repeat scintigraphy with appropriate pharmacologic adjuncts or high-frequency ultrasound can be considered, and if still negative with ongoing bleeding, device-assisted enteroscopy or diagnostic laparoscopy may be warranted. For abdominal pain or obstruction, CT can identify complications and guide urgent surgery. For adults with obscure bleeding or obstruction, CT or MR enterography, device-assisted enteroscopy, and selective angiography can localize the source, recognizing that Meckel scan sensitivity is lower in adults [^116Bjzm8] [^112AeHgU] [^116cCCqa] [^1123fteP].

> Let me reconsider any potential inconsistencies before concluding. Some older sources suggested CT and ultrasound are generally not helpful, but more recent pediatric series show CT and ultrasound can reveal MD complications even when the Meckel scan is negative, so modality choice should be symptom-driven and age-specific rather than dismissive. Likewise, while the "rule of 2s" is a useful mnemonic, real-world anatomy and clinical behavior vary, so I should apply it as a guide rather than a strict rule [^113fm7cm] [^117Shkoj] [^1123fteP] [^116Bjzm8].

> In summary, I need to ensure my approach remains methodical: define pretest probability by age and symptoms, select imaging tailored to the presentation, escalate to invasive diagnostics when results are discordant with clinical suspicion, and individualize surgical decisions for incidental findings based on risk features and patient factors. Maintaining a high index of suspicion and using multimodality strategies are the keys to timely diagnosis and definitive management of Meckel's diverticulum [^116cCCqa] [^117RPxRc] [^114BQUyR].

Meckel's diverticulum is a **congenital anomaly** of the ileum [^116Bjzm8] that is often asymptomatic but can cause bleeding, obstruction, diverticulitis, or perforation [^116nKeNg]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical suspicion** plus imaging: ultrasound or CT for complications [^114fVUJc], and technetium-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy for ectopic gastric mucosa [^1178hvaD]. Management is **surgical resection** for symptomatic cases [^113UusBp]; for incidental findings, resection is considered if high-risk features are present (length > 2 cm, narrow base, ectopic tissue, age < 50, male sex) [^117RPxRc]. Laparoscopic surgery is preferred when feasible [^111KHJHy], with excellent outcomes when treated promptly [^114jvCgj].

---

## Epidemiology and anatomical features

- **Prevalence**: 1–3% of the population [^116Bjzm8]; males have higher complication rates (male:female ≈ 2–3:1) [^117RPxRc].
- **Location**: terminal ileum, 40–100 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve, on the antimesenteric border [^116Bjzm8].
- **Structure**: true diverticulum with all bowel wall layers; ~50% contain ectopic tissue (gastric most common, pancreatic less common) [^116Bjzm8].
- **Blood supply**: vitelline artery from the superior mesenteric artery [^113hXtED].

---

## Clinical presentations and complications

Meckel's diverticulum is **often silent**; when symptomatic, it presents with:

| **Complication** | **Clinical features** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| Gastrointestinal bleeding | Painless hematochezia or melena from ectopic gastric mucosa | 25–50% of symptomatic cases [^116EdJFn] |
| Intestinal obstruction | - Vomiting <br/> - Abdominal distension <br/> - Colicky pain <br/> - Intussusception or volvulus | 20–30% [^notfound] |
| Diverticulitis | Right lower quadrant pain mimicking appendicitis | 10–20% [^111fFKgn] |
| Perforation | - Severe abdominal pain <br/> - Peritonitis <br/> - Sepsis | Rare but life-threatening [^1135BYAP] |

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis requires a **high index of suspicion** and appropriate imaging:

- **Ultrasound**: high sensitivity/specificity for bleeding Meckel's in children; look for a blind-ending pouch or target sign [^112AeHgU].
- **CT**: identifies obstruction, diverticulitis, perforation, or ectopic tissue [^114fVUJc].
- **Technetium-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy**: detects ectopic gastric mucosa; sensitivity 80–92% in children, lower in adults [^1178hvaD].
- **Capsule or double-balloon enteroscopy**: for obscure bleeding or when other tests are inconclusive [^116cCCqa].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is indicated for symptomatic Meckel's and for incidental cases with **high-risk features**:

- **Symptomatic cases**: bleeding, obstruction, diverticulitis, or perforation [^113UusBp].
- **Incidental cases**: consider resection if length > 2 cm, narrow base, ectopic tissue, age < 50, or male sex [^117RPxRc].
- **Surgical techniques**: diverticulectomy or segmental resection; laparoscopic approach preferred when feasible [^1142Pn98].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Prognosis is **excellent** with timely surgical management; morbidity and mortality are low, especially in children [^111KHJHy]. Delayed diagnosis increases the risk of complications, including bowel obstruction, perforation, and significant hemorrhage [^114n199u].

---

## Controversies and challenges

Controversies include **management of incidental Meckel's** — whether to resect or observe — with risk–benefit decisions based on patient factors and diverticular features [^114BQUyR]. Diagnostic challenges stem from nonspecific symptoms that mimic appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or other causes of acute abdomen, requiring a high index of suspicion [^111RwNoF].

---

Meckel's diverticulum is a common congenital anomaly that can cause significant complications. Accurate diagnosis and **timely surgical management** yield excellent outcomes, while incidental cases require individualized risk assessment [^116cCCqa].

What we did and why?

Correct answer: F

Given purulent contamination in bilateral lower quadrants, immunocompromised patient, and significant fecal loading, it was not safe to perform a sigmoid resection and primary anastomosis alone. Therefore, sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis and proximal fecal diversion was considered most appropriate for this patient. The optimal site of a diverting loop ileostomy was near the incidental MD, presenting a challenge in this case. A Hartmann's procedure would have been the most conservative approach, however, primary anastomosis with proximal diversion was favored given higher rates of stoma reversal without additional morbidity. Additionally, a Hartmann's procedure would not address the MD. Other options (3, 4, and 5) were excluded given the risk of additional staple lines, anastomosis, and potential for small bowel devascularization with mesenteric division.

Resection is recommended when an incidental, asymptomatic MD has any of these factors: patients less than 50 years old, narrow base, length greater than 2 cm, palpable abnormality, or a fibrous band connecting the diverticulum to the umbilicus. The presence of any of these factors significantly increases the risk of future complications, with multiple factors increasing cumulative risk. In this case, the MD was narrow based and long (> 2 cm). Moreover, the patient was immunocompromised, and future complications related to the MD could be problematic. Finally, the patient's age supported resection for risk mitigation. Thus, the decision was made to perform a diverticulectomy, and use this site as the loop ileostomy. A standard ostomy orifice was created in the right lower quadrant. The MD was extirpated through the orifice (figure 3), then transected at its base using a linear tissue stapler. The staple line was removed to create a loop ileostomy.

### Diagnosis and management of pediatric appendicitis, intussusception, and Meckel diverticulum [^113cGDfG]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Three of the most common causes of surgical abdominal pain in pediatric patients include appendicitis, Meckel diverticulum, and intussusception. All 3 can present with right lower quadrant pain, and can lead to significant morbidity and even mortality. Although ultrasound is the preferred method of diagnosis with appendicitis and intussusception, considerable variety exists in the modalities needed in the diagnosis of Meckel diverticulum. This article discusses the pathways to diagnosis, the modes of treatment, and the continued areas of controversy.

### Contemporary management of abdominal surgical emergencies in infants and children [^114G6g7L]. The British Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute abdominal complaints in children are common presentations in the emergency department. The aetiology, presentation, diagnosis and management often differ from those in adults.

Methods

This review was based on expert paediatric surgical experience confirmed by evidence from the literature obtained by searching PubMed and the Cochrane Library. Keywords used were the combinations of 'abdominal emergencies', 'acute abdomen' and the disorders 'acute appendicitis', 'intussusception', 'volvulus', 'Meckel's diverticulum', 'incarcerated inguinal hernia', 'testicular torsion' and 'ovarian torsion' with 'children'. Information was included from reviews, randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, and prospective and retrospective cohort studies.

Results

Presentation and symptoms of abdominal emergencies, especially in young children, vary widely, which renders recognition of the underlying disorder and treatment challenging. Critically targeted imaging techniques are becoming increasingly important in obtaining the correct diagnosis without unnecessary delay. Minimally invasive techniques have become the method of choice for the diagnosis and treatment of many abdominal emergencies in children.

Conclusion

Knowledge of abdominal disorders in childhood, their specific presentation, diagnosis and treatment facilitates management of children with acute abdomen in emergency departments. Imaging and minimally invasive techniques are becoming increasingly important in the diagnosis of acute abdomen in children. Urgent operation remains the cornerstone of therapy for most acute abdominal disorders.

### Subacute Meckel's diverticulum perforation [^111uFNtf]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common intestinal congenital defect, its prevalence is 0.2%-4.0% and it occurs more commonly in children younger than 2-year old with intestinal bleeding and abdominal pain. Perforation in the elderly is very rare with no more than 35 articles reported worldwide. Here we report the case of a 62-year-old man who was admitted to hospital with a history of acute abdominal pain with a 20-day onset. The patient was treated with laparotomy and 30cm ileal resection was performed for an 8×5cm perforated ileum tumour at 50 from ileocecal valve with a side-to-side mechanical anastomosis for reconstruction. Having morbidity Clavien-Dindo scale I in postsurgical and good outcome in 6-month follow-up. Meckel's diverticulum is an infrequent pathology in paediatric and even rarer in adult population, however, it is always important to keep in mind how to act when is seen either as a finding or as a complication.

### Perforation of Meckel's diverticulum secondary to a large faecolith [^112D9Fta]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

A 79-year-old woman presented with a 4 day history of central abdominal pain and vomiting. Clinical examination revealed a distended abdomen with predominantly right sided tenderness. Following an initial period of supportive treatment pending further imaging, evolving abdominal signs became evident. Based on the suspicion of a perforated hollow viscus, an emergency laparotomy was carried out. Operative findings were of a Meckel's diverticulum with evidence of pressure necrosis and perforation near its apex, which was distended due to a 6 cm faecolith. Resection and primary anastomosis was performed. Despite a lower respiratory tract infection, the patient was deemed clinically stable enough to be discharged on the 24th postoperative day.

### Emergency surgery for Meckel's diverticulum [^113u32Nq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Meckel's diverticulum was first described by Fabricius Hildanus in 1598. The name derives from the German anatomist Johann Friedrich Meckel who described the embryological and pathological features in 1809. Although it generally remains silent but life threatening complications may arise making it an important structure for having a detailed knowledge of its anatomical and pathophysiological properties to deal with such complications.

The literature is replete with the description of Meckel's diverticulum for its clinical presentations and complications. A search of Pubmed with the word "Meckel's diverticulum" shows 2835 articles till May 2008. However, the emergency surgery part of the symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum is still deficient in the literature. This seems to be so because most of the articles have been in the form of case reports or case series, so that the management strategies have been highly individualized based on both the patients condition and on the surgeons perspective. This seems to be the appropriate approach in an emergency condition. We intend to underscore some general principles used by these surgeons in their emergency surgeries. The current work attempts to highlight the various life threatening complications of Meckel's diverticulum and to present the surgical strategies used in the emergency conditions so far in the form of a review of the works presented in the literature. Our aim behind this presentation is to cover the possible indications, methods, their complications and the outcome of these surgical techniques. For this, we made an extensive literature search using Google and Pubmed with the words-"Meckel's diverticulum", "Complications", "Management" and "Emergency surgery". All the relevant articles containing the surgical aspects of symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum till May 2008 were collected and analyzed.

### A Meckel's diverticulum presenting as pyogenic liver abscesses [^111HqHhg]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Meckel's diverticula are the most common congenital malformation of the small intestine. The condition is rarely symptomatic and is usually an incidental finding during surgery. Bleeding in children and obstruction in adults are the most common symptomatic presentations. Our case involves a 50-year-old man with multiple pyogenic liver abscesses due to a Meckel's diverticulum. The abscesses were percutaneously drained and the diverticulum was eventually resected. Pyogenic liver abscess is a very rare presentation of a Meckel's diverticulum. The diverticulum in our case appeared to have a thickened wall on imaging but no signs of acute inflammation were present on the CT scan or noticed intraoperatively. It was presumed to be the possible source as all other possibilities were ruled out. Ultimately, the surgical pathology revealed acute inflammation and focal abscess. We propose that elective resection of a Meckel's diverticulum should be considered in the setting of pyogenic liver abscess with no other identifiable source.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^112EZDk7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Systematic review methods — databases, dates, and eligibility state that the review searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Cochrane, and CINAHL for randomized controlled trials, observational studies, single-group studies, and existing systematic reviews published in English from 1 January 1990 through 1 June 2020 (search updated through 16 November 2020); it included studies of adults with acute (complicated or uncomplicated) left-sided colonic diverticulitis and excluded complicated diverticulosis without diverticulitis, symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease, Meckel diverticula (unless it was concurrent with acute diverticulitis), acute right-sided colonic diverticulitis, and noncolonic diverticulitis; right-sided diverticulitis was excluded because it is much less prevalent in Western countries and has a different natural history and management options.

### A moving Meckel's diverticulum on Tc-99m pertechnetate imaging in a patient with lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^113uLFPy]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum is one of the most common causes of lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the young. We report a case of a 16-year-old youth who presented with a 3-day history of bright red bleeding per rectum. Clinical examination revealed pallor but nothing else of note. The patient had a hemoglobin of 9 G% on admission. Tc-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy was performed and demonstrated an abnormal focus in the pelvis on the right that changed in position during the course of imaging. A laparotomy was done and a 5 x 2-cm Meckel's diverticulum was removed from the ileum. Histopathologic examination revealed heterotopic gastric mucosa of the body type. The patient recovered fully after operation.

### Meckel diverticulum in the pediatric population: patient presentation and performance of imaging in prospective diagnosis [^1123fteP]. Clinical Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine the most common presentations of Meckel diverticulum (MD) in children and the performance of imaging modalities in prospective diagnosis.

Materials and Methods

A 28-year retrospective review was performed of children under 18 years of age with MD listed as a diagnosis on pathology and/or surgical reports. The medical record was reviewed to determine presenting clinical scenarios. All imaging performed for each case was reviewed.

Results

Seventy-six patients met inclusion criteria. Of the surgically removed MD, most presented with abdominal symptoms (n = 31, 41%); gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (n = 15, 20%), or both abdominal symptoms and GI bleeding (n = 7, 9%). Twenty-nine percent of MD were discovered incidentally at surgery performed for other reasons. Of the symptomatic MD, only 31% were prospectively diagnosed. For patients with abdominal symptoms, CT had a sensitivity of 13% (3/24) while nuclear medicine (NM) scan had a sensitivity of 0% (0/2). For patients with GI bleed, CT had a sensitivity of 29% (2/7) and NM scan had a sensitivity of 71% (10/14). For patients with both abdominal symptoms and GI bleed, CT was 0% (0/2) and NM scan 75% (3/4) sensitive.

Conclusion

MD as a cause of abdominal symptoms and gastrointestinal bleeding may be difficult to diagnose due to nonspecific presentations and nonspecific findings. Most prospectively diagnosed MD are on NM scan in patients with GI bleed with abdominal pain (sensitivity of > 70%). CT is relatively insensitive for MD in all symptomatology groups (0 to 29%).

### Small bowel diverticular disease: are we clinically aware? [^117NZTf5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations to our study. First, this is a retrospective, two centers experience with limited number of patients. The incidence predicted by this study cohort may not be an accurate reflection of the general population. Selection bias may exist because the cohort included only hospitalized patients with prominent symptoms. Additionally, small-sized diverticula might be missed by current diagnostic modalities due to resolution limitations of imaging and endoscopic techniques, potentially affecting the estimation of the true incidence of SBD. While, asymptomatic SBD or outpatient SBD may be underestimated. The present study concluded that ileal diverticula may be associated with more severe symptoms and often present at a younger age. However, a subgroup analysis of Meckel's diverticulum was not performed due to the limited number of patients. The diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum can only be confirmed with pathology, wherein all four layers of the intestinal wall are intact with ectopic gastric or pancreatic tissues. However, not all patients received surgical treatment for ileal diverticulum with available pathology reports. Due to the limited number of patients, we were unable to calculate the diagnostic rates of radiological and endoscopic examination, specifically the sensitivity, specificity, the positive and negative predictive values of each individual diagnostic modality. While our study provides insights into the clinical presentation and short-term management of SBD, the absence of longitudinal follow-up data limits the evaluation of long-term outcomes such as recurrence rates and delayed complications (e.g. diverticulitis, fistula formation). Future prospective studies incorporating standardized follow-up protocols are critical to establish evidence-based guidelines for long-term monitoring and secondary prevention.

SBD remains poorly recognized in clinical practice, due to its varying symptoms and discrete location. The diagnosis of SBD is heavily reliant on small bowel investigation such has VCE and DBE. Currently, there is no treatment consensus of small bowel diverticular disease. Future multi-center studies with a larger patient cohort is warranted for better understanding of the disease, including underlying mechanism and potential genetic disposition.

### Demystifying Meckel's diverticulum-a guide for the gastroenterologist [^116cCCqa]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is a common congenital ileal diverticulum. Whilst mostly asymptomatic, 4–9% develop complications, such as small bowel obstruction, diverticulitis or bleeding. In 1933, Charles Mayo wrote that MD is 'frequently suspected, often looked for and seldom found', and it continues to pose a diagnostic challenge today. With advancements in small bowel imaging and endoscopy, this review outlines the gastroenterologist's approach to MD.

Recent Findings

There are a number of strategies for diagnosing MD. Meckel's scan has a sensitivity of 80–92% in children but 62–88% in adults. The diagnostic yield of small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) is only up to 50%. Device-assisted enteroscopy (DAE) has a sensitivity of 84–100% for MD but is invasive. The definitive treatment for symptomatic MD is surgical resection, but the management of asymptomatic cases are controversial. A recent systematic review favoured resection of incidental MD.

Summary

A high index of suspicion and a multimodality combination of SBCE, Meckel's scan, CT and DAE is often required to diagnose MD. Complicated MD is treated by surgical resection. Management of incidental MD remains debated, although current evidence appears to favour resection.

### Meckel diverticulum scintigraphy: technique, findings and diagnostic pitfalls [^1178hvaD]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Meckel diverticulum, the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, results from the aberrant involution of the omphalomesenteric duct and accounts for more than 50% of unexplained lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the pediatric population. The most accurate imaging tool to identify a Meckel diverticulum containing ectopic gastric mucosa is the Technetium-99m pertechnetate Meckel scan, a scintigraphic study with a reported accuracy of 90% in the pediatric population. In addition to depicting a Meckel diverticulum with ectopic gastric mucosa, careful attention to the normal biodistribution of the radiotracer can lead to the identification of unexpected pathology with implications for patient management. This article serves to review the embryological origin and anatomical features of Meckel diverticulum, highlight the role of scintigraphy in evaluating Meckel diverticulum, and discuss the proper imaging technique when performing this test. We will focus on pitfalls that can lead to an erroneous diagnosis as well as incidental findings that can affect patient management.

### Massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to Meckel's diverticulum in an atypical position [^112NL7TT]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

What we did and why

Correct answer: E

Surgical consultation was obtained emergently after the patient's deterioration in the ICU and identification of active contrast extravasation on re-review of imaging by the interventional radiology team. Although IR was consulted and angiographic embolization considered, it was not favored in this patient. The bleeding source was located in the terminal ileum, and embolization carried a high risk of compromising the proximal blood supply, potentially leading to bowel ischemia and the need for surgical resection regardless. Endoscopic intervention was also not pursued due to the lack of bowel preparation, making visualization unreliable in the setting of ongoing massive hemorrhage and a suspected proximal source. The patient was urgently taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy. On exploration, there was no hemoperitoneum or source of hemorrhage identified. The cecum and terminal ileum revealed large quantities of intraluminal blood. Careful inspection uncovered a firm lesion approximately 2×2 cm within the terminal ileal mesentery near the ileocecal junction, corresponding to the area of bleeding noted on the CT scan (figure 2). Although no classical projection of Meckel's diverticulum (MD) was externally visible, the suspicious area suggested the presence of ectopic tissue associated with MD. Subsequent pathological findings identified a diverticulum arising in association with the small bowel lumen and mucosal ulceration.

An ileocecectomy with a functional side-to-side ileocolic anastomosis was performed. Postoperatively, the patient's hemodynamic status stabilized. He recovered well, tolerated a regular diet, and was discharged on postoperative day 9 with stable vital signs and improved hemoglobin levels.

Discussion

MD is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. Although it often remains asymptomatic, it can lead to significant complications, including massive bleeding. This bleeding is more commonly observed in pediatric patients but should not be overlooked in adults. Diagnostic imaging, including CT angiography and Meckel's scans, can aid in localization but often yield false negatives.

In this case, active bleeding localized to the terminal ileum raised suspicion for MD, which was ultimately confirmed intraoperatively. This case presents two major challenges:

Rarity in adults: Symptomatic MD in older individuals is uncommon.

Atypical location: The diverticulum was found within the mesentery, a rare presentation. MD typically arises on the antimesenteric border.

Figure 3
Meckel's diverticulum brought out through right lower quadrant ileostomy site prior to diverticulectomy.

The postoperative course was significant for a small surgical site infection managed by wound opening and conventional packing. By postoperative day 2, there was return of bowel function via loop ileostomy. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 7. Final pathology revealed chronic and active diverticulitis without malignancy in the colon specimen, and benign small bowel mucosa with focal adhesions but without heterotopic mucosa in the MD. At 12 weeks postoperatively, loop ileostomy reversal was performed after confirming integrity and patency of anastomosis by cross-sectional imaging with rectal contrast. This procedure was uncomplicated and tolerated well. Final pathology was benign. Most recent follow-up revealed no complications.

Operative management of perforated diverticulitis continues to evolve and the chosen approach ultimately depends on patient and disease factors encountered during surgery. The Hartmann's procedure is the most traditional and conservative approach. More recently, sigmoidectomy with primary anastomosis and loop ileostomy has gained favor with similar short-term outcomes, and possibly better long-term outcomes in relation to stoma-free status at 1 year. Our case highlights two challenges for the acute care surgeon. First, managing perforated diverticulitis in the immunocompromised patient; and second, navigating an incidental MD in close proximity to an optimal loop ileostomy location. We describe a novel approach to this dilemma by creating a loop ileostomy at the site of MD. We would recommend this approach to others who encounter similar pathology.

Meckel diverticulum scintigraphy — preprocedure information and precautions emphasize assessing for active bleeding because a gastrointestinal bleeding scan may be more helpful than a Meckel scan, recognizing that prior in vivo–labeled RBC scintigraphy may give an indeterminate result, constantly monitoring vital signs of children suspected of acute gastrointestinal bleeding, and placing a large-bore intravenous catheter so hypotension can be rapidly treated.

Common clinical indications — Meckel scintigraphy is indicated to localize ectopic gastric mucosa in a Meckel diverticulum as the source of unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding; bleeding Meckel diverticulum usually occurs in young children, whereas when bleeding occurs in an older child it is more likely from a benign polyp or small-bowel tumor, and even in young children active bleeding is best studied by radiolabeled red blood cell (RBC) scintigraphy.

### Diverting opinions: surgical debate around method of Meckel's resection [^111qDe9c]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most common congenital anomaly of the GI tract and can present with obstruction, inflammation or haemorrhage, which requires surgical intervention. Primary malignancies of MD are rare with a reported incidence of 0.5%-3.2%. The standard treatment of symptomatic MDs is resection. However, there is no standard protocol regarding the type of resection. Similarly, for asymptomatic MDs, there is no standard management. We report our experience with a patient in her 60s who required emergent surgery for perforated MD where histology revealed a plexiform fibromyxoma at the junction of the ileum and MD. Current surgical resection techniques for MDs vary from linear or wedge diverticulectomy to segmental bowel resection. This case of an unexpected tumour supports segmental bowel resection in the treatment of MD and raises the question of whether incidental asymptomatic MDs should also be resected due to the risk of tumour or malignancy.

### Meckel's diverticulum: review and management… [^113fm7cm]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum results from incomplete obliteration of the omphalomesenteric or vitelline duct. Although several anomalies can occur, 90 percent of vitelline duct abnormalities are Meckel's diverticulum with or without connection to the umbilicus or mesentery. Meckel's diverticulum contains all layers of normal intestinal wall and is usually located within 100 cm of the ileocecal valve. The lifetime complication rate for Meckel's diverticulum is approximately 4 percent, with complications most often caused by ectopic tissue or bands. More than 50 percent of those who develop symptoms are younger than 10 years. Symptoms have also been found to be more common in males than in females. Complications can include obstruction or inflammation, bleeding, and tumors.

The diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum can be made by small bowel enema. Computed tomography and ultrasonography generally are not helpful because it is often difficult to distinguish between diverticulum and intestinal loops. Radionuclide scanning and arteriography may be useful when bleeding is present. Laparoscopy has been reported to be a helpful tool in diagnosing the anomaly. Symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum is treated with surgical resection using open or laparoscopic techniques. The indications for incidental diverticulectomy in patients with asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum are unclear, and there are no definite intraoperative anatomic or biologic criteria to predict the likelihood of future complications.

Recent epidemiologic studies compared patients who underwent surgery for Meckel's diverticulum–related complications over time with early and late diverticulectomy-associated complications in patients who underwent prophylactic removal of incidentally discovered Meckel's diverticulum. Among the patients with complications, the incidence of surgery increased steadily through the age of 80 years. The study findings showed that the risk of complications was higher in patients with Meckel's diverticulum than in those who underwent prophylactic removal of the anomaly. The authors concluded that because the risk of complications from Meckel's diverticulum does not decrease with age, the benefits of incidental diverticulectomy outweigh the morbidity and mortality of surgery.

### Simultaneous visualization of a Meckel diverticulum and its active bleeding on Tc-99m-pertechnetate scintigraphy: an unusual presentation [^11159WHP]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

We present the case of a 2-year-old girl with a recent history of rectorrhagia, the latest episode occurring two days ago. She was referred for 99mTc-pertechnetate scan to detect ectopic gastric mucosa. In the initial phases, a Meckel diverticulum was identified in the mid-lower abdomen. Simultaneously, a diffuse area of activity was observed in the left abdomen, indicating active bleeding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Meckel diverticulum presenting simultaneously with active bleeding. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by active bleeding, which can mimic or obscure findings on scintigraphy, complicating interpretation.

Results

1. Clinical characteristics of axial torsion of Meckel's diverticulum in our center

During the 15-year study period, approximately 1,100 symptomatic cases of MD underwent surgical treatment at our institution, of which axial torsion of the MD was identified in 12 patients, giving an incidence rate of 1.1% (12/1,100). The cohort comprised 10 males and 2 females (male-to-female ratio 5:1), with a median age of 4 years (range: 2–15 years). The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal pain (91.7%) and vomiting (75.0%), with symptom duration not exceeding three days. Laboratory analysis revealed leukocytosis in 75.0% of cases.

Surgical management included laparoscopy and laparotomy. Laparoscopy was attempted initially in eight cases, with successful completion in five, while three required conversion to laparotomy. Four patients underwent primary laparotomy. All cases underwent successful MD resection, with 2–5 cm ileal segments excised at both ends of the diverticulum. No intestinal necrosis was observed. The median distance of the MD from the ileocecal valve was 40 cm (range: 10–60 cm), and all were located at the antimesenteric border. The median diverticulum length was 6 cm (range: 4.5–10 cm), with a median width of 2.3 cm (range: 1.5–5.0 cm). The major-to-minor axis ratio was ≥ 1.5 in all cases. Torsion occurred at the diverticular base in 11 cases (91.7%) and at the mid-portion in one (8.3%). Gangrene was present in nine cases (75.0%), with torsion degrees ranging from 270° to 720°. Small bowel obstruction (SBO) was observed in 10 patients (83.3%), nine of which resulted from proximal bowel compression, while one case involved an intra-abdominal hernia secondary to MD torsion with adhesive bands forming a hernia ring (no necrosis). Congenital bands were identified in two cases (16.7%), including one omphalomesenteric band and one mesodiverticular band. The demographic, clinical, and surgical-pathological characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

### Coexistence of cecal duplication cyst and Meckel's diverticulum presenting as intussusception in a malnourished child a case report with literature review [^1127vCyQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cecal duplication cyst (CDC) represents an extremely rare form of gastrointestinal (GI) tract duplication, accounting for approximately 0.4% of all enteric duplication cases. It can potentially result in intestinal obstruction. Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is a more common GI anomaly, occurring in approximately 2% of the population. Both CDC and MD are more frequently observed in boys than in girls and typically present in infancy or early childhood. These conditions can mimic each other, often manifesting with GI bleeding, a palpable mass, or intestinal obstruction.

Ultrasonography (USG) and computed tomography (CT) scans are useful diagnostic modalities; however, technetium-99 m radionuclide scans can further help identify the location, size, and contents of these anomalies. A definitive diagnosis is usually made during exploratory laparotomy.

### Single-incision versus conventional multiport laparoscopic-assisted surgery for Meckel's diverticulum in children: a single-center propensity score analysis [^113suaKn]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study population

Following institutional approval, one of the authors, WF, accessed the hospital's database via the big data center to identify patients diagnosed with MD who underwent laparoscopic surgery in the Gastrointestinal Neonatal Surgery Department between February 2017 and February 2023. The selection of participants for this study was based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria required participants to be 18 years of age or younger, with a preoperative diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum confirmed by postoperative pathology. Additionally, all participants must have undergone laparoscopic surgery, including laparoscopically assisted procedures, and have complete clinical data available. The exclusion criteria included the presence of other gastrointestinal malformations, a history of previous abdominal surgery, or incomplete clinical data. These criteria were established to ensure the homogeneity of the included sample and the reliability of the study results.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of MD was primarily established through a combination of clinical evaluation and imaging studies. Initially, patients presented with symptoms such as abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, or intestinal obstruction, prompting further investigation. Imaging modalities included: (1) Ultrasound: always used as a first-line imaging technique, especially in pediatric patients, to assess for any abdominal abnormalities; (2) Computed Tomography (CT) Scan: a non-invasive method that provides detailed cross-sectional images of the abdomen, helping to identify the presence of MD, particularly in older children; (3) Technetium-99 m Pertechnetate Scintigraphy: this nuclear medicine scan is specifically useful for diagnosing MD by detecting ectopic gastric mucosa, which is particularly effective for cases of gastrointestinal bleeding. In some cases, a definitive diagnosis was confirmed through intraoperative findings during laparoscopic surgery, where the diverticulum was identified and subsequently resected.

### Meckel diverticulum: the mayo clinic experience with 1476 patients (1950–2002) [^117RPxRc]. Annals of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Through a comprehensive review of the Mayo Clinic experience with patients who had Meckel diverticulum, we sought to determine which diverticula should be removed when discovered incidentally during abdominal surgery.

Summary Background Data

Meckel diverticula occur so infrequently that most articles have reported either small series or isolated cases. From these limited series, various conclusions have been reported without clearly indicating which incidental diverticula should be removed.

Methods

Medical records were reviewed of 1476 patients found to have a Meckel diverticulum during surgery from 1950 to 2002. Preoperative diagnosis; age; sex; date of surgery; and intraoperative, macroscopic, and microscopic findings from operative and pathology reports were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine which clinical or histologic features were associated with symptomatic Meckel diverticulum. The features analyzed were age; sex; length, base width, and ratio of length to base width of the diverticulum; and the presence of ectopic tissue or abnormal tissue (inflammation or enteroliths).

Results

Among the 1476 patients, 16% of the Meckel diverticula were symptomatic. The most common clinical presentation in adults was bleeding; in children, obstruction. Among patients with a symptomatic Meckel diverticulum, the male-female ratio was approximately 3:1. Clinical or histologic features most commonly associated with symptomatic Meckel diverticula were patient age younger than 50 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.6–4.8; P < 0.001), male sex (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3–2.4; P < 0.001); diverticulum length greater than 2 cm (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1–4.4; P = 0.02), and the presence of histologically abnormal tissue (OR, 13.9; 95% CI, 9.9–19.6; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

After analyzing our data, we neither support nor reject the recommendation that all Meckel diverticula found incidentally should be removed, although the procedure today has little risk. If a selective approach is taken, we recommend removing all incidental Meckel diverticula that have any of the 4 features most commonly associated with symptomatic Meckel diverticulum.

### Diagnostic accuracy of high-frequency ultrasound in bleeding Meckel diverticulum in children [^112AeHgU]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Meckel diverticulum is one of the most important causes of small bowel bleeding in children. Reports suggest that ultrasonography can be used as an alternative examination for children with negative radionuclide scanning results or children with atypical clinical manifestations.

Objective

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of high-frequency ultrasound in children with bleeding Meckel diverticulum.

Materials and Methods

We collected the data of children who were admitted to our hospital for the main symptom of bloody stool from February 2006 to December 2017. Ultrasonography was performed in all children. The final diagnosis was confirmed by pathological analysis or clinical follow-up observation. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of ultrasonography according to the final diagnosis.

Results

A total of 784 eligible children were enrolled in the study. Presenting symptoms or findings included black and red stool in 528 (67.3%), bright red stool in 51 (6.5%) and obscure or occult bloody stool in 205 (26.1%). Anemia was diagnosed in 489 (62.4%). Ultrasonography diagnosed Meckel diverticulum with a sensitivity of 93.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 91.0–95.6%) and a specificity of 98.1% (95% CI 95.9–99.3%).

Conclusion

High-frequency ultrasound diagnosis of Meckel diverticulum in children has high sensitivity and specificity.

### Meckel diverticulum in children: evaluation of macroscopic appearance for guidance in subsequent surgery [^113VrZra]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of incidentally encountered asymptomatic Meckel diverticulum (MD) is controversial. We evaluated whether the macroscopic appearance correlates with clinical features, histopathological findings, future complications, and management decisions.

Methods

Patients who underwent MD resection at a single institution from 2000 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed in terms of age, sex, clinical features, laboratory data, perioperative findings (diverticulum length, diameter, depth, thickening, and height-to diameter ratio [HDR]), pathology, and postoperative follow-up.

Results

Fifty children were enrolled. Sixteen percent of the resected MDs were found incidentally. Of 42 complicated MDs, 17 (40%) were long (HDR ≥ 2), 14 (33%) were thickened, and 29 (70%) exhibited base widening. Histopathologically, ectopic mucosa was found in 32 (64%) of all MDs and in 5 (62%) of incidentally removed MDs. There was no statistical difference between the macroscopic appearance and clinical signs, sex, or presence of ectopic tissue based on palpation.

Conclusion

The macroscopic appearance of MD does not indicate the presence or absence of HGM and cannot be used to guide subsequent surgery. Additionally, 40% of symptomatic patients in our study had life-threatening complications requiring prompt fluid resuscitation. We consider that incidentally detected MD should be removed regardless of its macroscopic appearance.

### Meckel's diverticulum causing intestinal obstruction [^111CK3j2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum is an uncommon cause of acute abdominal pain and small bowel obstruction in adults. We present a case of a 31-yr-old man with recurrent vomiting and abdominal pain in whom the diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum was not suspected until CT of the abdomen revealed multiple fluid-filled, dilated loops of ileum with distal collapse after normal abdominal radiographs. We suggest that CT may be helpful when the diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum is suspected.

### The value of repeat scintigraphy in patients with a high clinical suspicion for Meckel diverticulum after a negative or equivocal first Meckel scan [^113YX7kw]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Technetium (99m)Tc-pertechnetate is the most common and accurate noninvasive method of preoperative investigation for Meckel diverticulum. Despite introducing various methods to increase the sensitivity of the study, there are many case reports of false-negative Meckel scans. A repeat scan is sometimes requested in patients with a high suspicion for Meckel diverticulum and negative or equivocal first Meckel scan.

Objectives

The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the value of repeat scintigraphy for these patients.

Materials and Methods

Seven hundred fifty-three Meckel scans were recorded retrospectively. In 33 cases (22 male and 11 female; mean age: 6.8 years), the Meckel scintigraphy was repeated either due to a high clinical suspicion of Meckel diverticulum and a negative study (n = 21) or due to equivocal findings in the first scan (n = 12). The study was interpreted as positive if an abnormal focal activity was identified in the abdomen and pelvis during the procedure. The results were correlated with pathology and clinical symptoms.

Results

Seven out of 12 (58%) equivocal studies were positive on the second study. Six of them were proven to be positive at operation (confirmed by pathology) while one of them was negative on laparoscopy. From 21 negative first scans with a high suspicion for Meckel diverticulum, three (14%) were positive on the second study. All three were proven to be Meckel diverticulum on pathology.

Conclusion

Repeat Meckel scans in patients with equivocal findings on the first study or a negative result with a high clinical suspicion for a Meckel diverticulum are useful especially in cases in which the first study had been done without appropriate preparation.

### Encountering Meckel's diverticulum in emergency surgery for ascaridial intestinal obstruction [^115znhGf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Meckel's diverticulum with intestinal ascariasis may remain asymptomatic or present with complications. Ascaris lumbrocoides can lead to direct complications of Meckel's diverticulum or secondarily after having complications of ileal segment on which it is located. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult. Silent Meckel's diverticulum encountered during the course of surgery for obstructive intestinal ascariasis in children is to be removed in view of anticipated complications. Diverticulectomy wound can be used as enterotomy site for complete removal of intestinal worms.

### Meckel's masquerade: penetrating the disguise [^111RwNoF]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Children with abdominal pain are frequently seen in emergency departments. Physicians and parents worry about appendicitis; physicians are also concerned about intussusception and bowel obstruction in patients with previous surgical procedures. Sometimes the patient is ill, and the diagnosis is elusive. In a 6-month period at our pediatric emergency department with an annual census of 57,400 patients, we cared for 4 patients who presented with abdominal pain due to complications of Meckel's diverticulum. None presented with painless rectal bleeding, the complication of which physicians are most aware. We are reporting these patients to raise awareness of Meckel's diverticulum as a cause of acute abdomen in children. Meckel's diverticulum may masquerade as appendicitis, an abdominal mass, intussusception, or a complication of severe constipation.

### Radiological and clinical characteristics of intussuscepted, inverting, and inverted Meckel's diverticulum: a case series [^113EW1Wd]. European Journal of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Inverted Meckel's diverticulum (IMD) is a well-established but rare disease. This study aimed to summarize the radiological and clinical characteristics of IMD, and correlates its radiological and surgical findings to obtain an accurate early preoperative diagnosis.

Method

This is a retrospective study included IMD patients from a large children's medical center in China, between January 2009 and March 2022. We reviewed demographic data, clinical manifestations, preoperative examinations, surgical findings, histopathological results, and outcomes.

Results

Twenty-three cases with IMD (14 male patients [60.9%]; median age, 6.7 years; age range, 9 months to 13 years) were retrospectively reviewed over a period of 13 years. The typical clinical manifestations of IMD included abdominal pain, vomiting, and abdominal tenderness. The most commonly used imaging modalities were abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography. This is the first case series on pediatric IMD, that describes the clinical process of IMD, proposes clinical phases of IMD, and first summarizes the radiological findings characteristic of each clinical phase.

Conclusions

The clinical process of IMD can be divided into four phases (intussuscepted Meckel's diverticulum [MD], inverting MD, inverted MD, intussusception secondary to IMD). Patients in different clinical phases present with various radiological features. Mastering the radiological and clinical characteristics of each phase of IMD can aid in its early diagnosis and timely operative intervention, thus avoiding unnecessary intestinal necrosis and resection.

### Meckel's diverticulum… [^112byHoY]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

What is Meckel's diverticulum. Meckel's diverticulum is a small pouch about the size of your thumb. The pouch is on the wall of the lower part of your small intestine. It's left over from a fetus' umbilical cord and intestines. It occurs in one out of 50 people. What problems might Meckel's diverticulum produce. Most people who have a Meckel's diverticulum have no problems. Only about one in 25 persons who are born with it have problems. These problems vary by age. In infants and children, the problem is usually bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract. Sometimes blood can be seen in the stool. In adults, the intestine may become blocked. If this happens, the person may have stomach pain and vomiting. Other symptoms include fever, constipation and swelling of the stomach. Should I be tested for this problem. Currently, there is no safe, simple way to test for Meckel's diverticulum.

Since most people who have Meckel's diverticulum don't have any problems, it is hard to detect. When Meckel's diverticulum does cause problems, it can usually be found by taking x-rays of the intestines. How is Meckel's diverticulum treated. People who have Meckel's diverticulum but are not having any problems are usually just observed. This varies with the person's age, and whether they are having other problems. Sometimes the doctor may want a patient to have surgery to remove the diverticulum, and then the intestine is repaired.

### Emergency surgery for Meckel's diverticulum [^111fFKgn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Diverticulitis

Diverticulitis represents 20% of the symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum and is common in adult patients. Clinical manifestation mimics acute appendicitis and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient with right lower quadrant pain. This feature necessitates the exploration of distal ileum when normal looking appendix is found during operation of suspected acute appendicitis. Pathophysiology is analogous to that of acute appendicitis, with inflammation being secondary to stasis and bacterial infection, which occurs due to the obstruction of the lumen by Enterolith or foreign body or by parasites (Ascaris lumbricoides or Taenia saginata). Alternatively, peptic ulceration of ileal mucosa due to ectopic gastric mucosa can cause diverticulitis. It may also result from diverticular torsion that causes secondary ischemia and inflammatory change. If this condition is left untreated, it usually leads to perforation and peritonitis.

This condition should be dealt with a surgical approach that can be open or laparoscopic, with resection of diverticulum at its base and closure perpendicular to the axis of intestine to minimize the risk of subsequent stenosis. And if perforation has occurred, thorough peritoneal toileting is done after resection.

Perforation

It is difficult to diagnose the site of perforation prior to exploration although duodenal and ileal perforation can be distinguish to a lesser extent by observing the nature of the aspirates from abdomen i.e. whether it is bilious or feculent. Various etiologies that can lead to perforation of Meckel's diverticulum are (a) Progression of diverticulitis, (b) Ulceration of adjacent ileal mucosa secondary to acid produced by ectopic gastric mucosa, (c) Secondary to ingested foreign body like fish bone, chicken bone and bay leaf, (d) Traumatic. (e) Perforation associated with tumors like Leiomyoma in Meckel's diverticulum has also been reported. It typically presents with the features similar to that of the perforation of other hollow viscera, with features of either localized or generalized peritonitis. Perforation of Meckel's diverticulum is usually managed by initial resuscitation and antibiotics followed by diverticulectomy or segmental resection along with peritoneal irrigation.

### Clinical diagnostic predictive score for Meckel diverticulum [^112fQdwX]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Purpose

Meckel diverticulum (MD) is present in 2% of the population. Many practitioner feel the diagnosis relies upon technetium-99 m pertechnetate scintigraphy. When negative, patients undergo additional invasive procedures delaying definitive therapy. This study aims to identify features of bleeding MD and generate a risk score, which could preclude unnecessary testing and facilitate earlier operation.

Methods

All patients < 18-years-old who presented with hematochezia from 2005 to 2015 were identified. MD diagnosis was based on histopathology of operative tissue. Controls were patients with hematochezia undergoing colonoscopy. A points system was used generate a risk score.

Results

A total of 215 patients presented with hematochezia out of which 42 patients with MD were identified. Predictive variables included infant (OR 7, 95%CI 2–29) and toddler (OR 20, 95%CI 8–50) age groups, duration < 6 days (OR 18, 95%CI 8–43), presence of large blood volume (OR 16, 95% CI 7–36), hemoglobin < 7 g/dL (OR 6, 95% CI 3–15) and transfusion requirement (OR 16, 95% CI 7–38). A score of 6 or higher is highly suggestive of MD.

Conclusions

This scoring system identifies children with bleeding MD who may benefit from exploratory surgery without undergoing endoscopy. This novel scoring system can be applied to provide accurate clinical diagnosis, reduce unnecessary tests and allow prompt surgical management.

Meckel's diverticulum is a common congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract, reported to be present in 2–4% of the population. Although most patients with Meckel's diverticulum remain asymptomatic throughout life, reports of acute inflammation, perforation, haemorrhage, intussusception, intestinal obstruction, vesicodiverticular fistulae and primary tumours are described. We present a rare diagnosis of diverticulotransverse colonic fistula and its management.

### Sonographic findings of Meckel's diverticulitis in children [^111KzSHH]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

We know of only one previous study that has described the sonographic appearances of the inflamed Meckel's diverticulum in several cases (nine patients). Our study reviews sonographic, clinical, and pathologic findings in 10 patients with an inflamed Meckel's diverticulum. We also describe unique findings on color Doppler sonography for two of our patients.

Conclusion

Sonographic findings of an inflamed Meckel's diverticulum may mimic findings for acute appendicitis or intestinal duplication. In patients with rectal bleeding due to diverticulitis, the visualization of a tubular hyperechoic structure on sonography is suggestive of Meckel's diverticulum. The inflamed Meckel's diverticulum may present as a cyst, but its mucosal layer is more irregular than that found in an intestinal duplication. We found that routine color Doppler sonography revealed anomalous vessels and signs of inflammation on the wall of the Meckel's diverticulum.

### Spontaneously perforated Meckel's diverticulum: a rare cause of neonatal acute abdomen [^114jvCgj]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum, a congenital gastrointestinal malformation, is seldom detected in the neonatal age group. Here, we present a neonate who presented to us with respiratory distress and acute abdomen. An X-ray showed pneumoperitoneum. Exploratory laparotomy revealed perforation at the tip of Meckel's diverticulum with faecal peritonitis. Wedge resection and anastomosis were performed. There were no heterotopic or dysplastic tissues. The baby improved and was discharged on exclusive breastfeeding. This case highlights a rare condition, which is rarely symptomatic, particularly in the neonatal period. While the most common clinical presentations include intestinal obstruction, inflammation or bleeding, our patient presented with a spontaneous perforation of the diverticulum in the absence of any clear predisposing risk factors. This case highlights the importance of a high index of suspicion in cases of sudden acute abdomen, as prompt diagnosis and management may have a good outcome.

Majority of the meckel's diverticulum remain silent and are diagnosed incidentally during small bowel contrast study, laparoscopy or laparotomy done for unrelated conditions, or until complications arise from the diverticulum. A person with Meckel's diverticulum has a 4–6% lifetime risk of developing a complication. The most common clinical presentation is gastrointestinal bleeding, which occurs in 25% – 50% of the patients having complication. Other complications include obstruction, intussusception, diverticulitis and perforation. Age wise statistics reveals that hemorrhage is the most common presentation in children aged 2 years or younger and intestinal obstruction being the commonest among adults, although some studies have found reverse. Overall, the complications have been found more common in males, with the ratios varying in different studies from 1.8:1 to 3:1. The pathogenesis of ulceration in a Meckel's diverticulum is secondary to peptic ulceration from heterotopic gastric mucosa. Although colonization of Helicobacter pylori in this ectopic gastric mucosa has been reported but its role in pathogenesis of complication is yet to established.

### Neonatal intestinal obstruction secondary to a floppy Meckel's diverticulum successfully treated by minimal access surgery [^113uwqdb]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum has several known complications including diverticulitis and perforation. The presence of mesodiverticular band or a band from the diverticulum to the anterior abdominal wall is also described and can cause obstruction or rotation of the small bowel leading to volvulus. Meckel's diverticulum is also well known as the lead point for intussusception. It may be lined by ectopic gastric mucosa and can cause life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding. We report a neonate who presented with acute intestinal obstruction secondary to a large, mobile Meckel's diverticulum which due to a direct compression effect on the adjacent small bowel caused mechanical intestinal obstruction. Diagnosis was confirmed at laparoscopy, and treated by curative surgical resection. This is the first report of a large mobile Meckel's diverticulum causing small bowel obstruction due to direct compression that was managed by minimally invasive surgical resection.

### Imaging of Meckel's diverticulum in adults: pictorial essay [^111mzA3J]. Clinical Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract. It is usually asymptomatic but may present with complications of acute diverticular inflammation, ulceration, hemorrhage, small bowel obstruction, perforation, retained foreign bodies, enterolith formation, and neoplasm development. Thus, the preoperative radiological diagnosis is crucial for proper management of the patients. This article reviews the anatomic and clinical features of Meckel's and describes the role of imaging in the detection of Meckel's and evaluation of its associated pathological processes.

### An internal hernia caused by Meckel's diverticulum: a case report [^117915Ev]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Meckel's diverticulum is a remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct. It can lead to intestinal perforation, obstruction and gastrointestinal bleeding. While the internal hernia caused by Meckel's diverticulum is rarely reported.

Case presentation

We report a case of a 45-year old female patient who presented with intestinal obstruction and on laparotomy was found to have Meckel's diverticulum with internal hernia causing intestinal gangrene. Segmental bowel resection was performed and the patient had uneventful recovery.

Conclusions

In patients with acute intestinal obstruction without previous abdominal surgery, Meckel's diverticulum and its complications should be suspected.

Intestinal obstruction

Intestinal obstruction due to Meckel's diverticulum is the most common presentation in adult and is the second most common in children. There are various mechanism by which it can cause intestinal obstruction like (a) Volvulus of small intestine around a fibrous band extending from Meckel's diverticulum to umbilicus. (b) Intussusception – in which Meckel diverticulum sags into the bowel lumen and then serves as a lead point to allow telescoping of the small intestine into first the distal ileum and then in to the large intestine causing ileo-ileal and ileocolic type of intussusception. (c) Littre's hernia – Incarceration of the diverticulum in hernia, (inguinal and femoral) causing intestinal obstruction. (d) Entrapment of small bowel beneath the blood supply of the diverticulum, also known as a mesodiverticular band (e) Stricture secondary to chronic diverticulitis (f) Meckel's diverticulum lithiasis – The formation of stone in Meckel's diverticulum can cause small bowel obstruction by two mechanisms; firstly, it can cause impaction in the terminal ileum after its extrusion from the diverticulum and secondly by promoting local inflammation of the diverticulum and intussusception (g) Band extending between the diverticulum and the base of the mesentery, forming a loop in which a part of ileum may get stuck causing obstruction. In our experiences we encountered one such case in which this band forming mechanism was associated with another rare complication of gangrenous change. (h) Other mechanisms involve rare causes of obstruction like tumors (Lipomas, Carcinoid tumors and others), impacted meconium in neonates causing inflammatory adhesions of Meckel's diverticulum to surrounding structures leading to volvulus, cecal volvulus around the band extending from Meckel's diverticulum to umbilicus, gall stone ileus, obstruction secondary to phytobezoar formation in Meckel's diverticulum.

### Small bowel intussusception with the Meckel's diverticulum after blunt abdominal trauma: a case report [^114zDmqt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

Intussusception is defined as the telescoping of one segment of the gastrointestinal tract into an adjacent one. It is relatively common in children and is the second most common cause of an acute abdomen in this age group. It is much less common in adults and accounts for less than 5% of cases of mechanical small bowel obstruction.

However, blunt abdominal trauma is an unusual cause and only a few isolated cases reports are available in the literature. The underlying mechanism of traumatic intussusception is unknown but has been proposed to be a pathological peristaltic wave and/or localized spasm of a bowel segment after the trauma. Another possible mechanism could be an intramural hematoma or edema acting as a lead point.

Meckel diverticulum is the commonest within a large number of lead points of structural, vascular/hematological, neoplastic, or inflammatory character. In our case we think that the focal lead point was a Meckel's diverticulum, but a trauma with disturbed bowel motility was the unlatching mechanism of intussusception.

Adults will have a variable presentation of intussusception, often with a chronic colicky pain and intermittent partial intestinal obstruction associated with nausea and Vomiting, Because of this variable presentation, the diagnosis is often late.

An experienced hands ultrasound has both high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of intussusception. Classic findings on transverse scanning include a so-called "target lesion" or "doughnut sign", with the presence of several concentric rings. CT is important in diagnosing associated pathology such as lymphadenopathy, it is often not very successful in determining the specific cause of the intussusception, as the lead point in many cases is small and often hidden within the intussuscepted mass.

All adult patients with intussusception will therefore require laparotomy. Resection is indicated in cases of large bowel intussusception, but reduction without resection may be an option in cases of small bowel involvement where the incidence of malignancy is not great and no abnormality of the small intestine is observed.

In conclusion, intussusception, although rare, should be considered when patients with blunt abdominal trauma present with insidious signs of obstruction.

### Meckel's diverticulum in an adult: an obscure presentation of gastrointestinal bleeding [^112HbRWX]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 17-year-old boy, with a background of haemophilia A, presented to hospital with an episode of brisk and painless per rectal (PR) bleeding. Initial investigation with gastroscopy and colonoscopy revealed no source of bleeding. Examination of the small bowel including MRI, CT angiogram and capsule endoscopy revealed no abnormalities. Double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) from an antegrade position was attempted, with no abnormalities noted. The symptoms persisted and DBE was attempted again from a retrograde approach and a diverticulum was subsequently noted. Laparoscopic surgery was performed identifying a diverticulum as the source of bleeding, 110cm from the ileocaecal valve, which is more proximal than is normally seen. Histological examination revealed a Meckel's diverticulum. The case described here, although more unusual in adults, demonstrates that complete visualisation of the small bowel remains challenging and that newer modalities of enteroscopy including DBE can help aid in the diagnosis of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Small bowel diverticular disease: are we clinically aware? [^115sTPPV]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Small bowel diverticular (SBD) disease is often overlooked in clinical practice. Due to its discrete location and limited access, the true incidence of SBD remains unknown. Currently, many researchers have reported different clinical manifestation, treatment and complications of SBD, but has been limited to individual reports of cases studies or case series. Available cohort studies from the past were unable to highlight the advancements of small bowel diagnostic modalities, such as DBE and VCE, in recent years. The present study is one of the few that demonstrates SBD and its associated characteristics in a single cohort population, with analysis of different clinical characteristics and diagnostic approach.

A total of 149 cases of SBD were included in the present study. Majority of the patients had duodenal SBD, while jeujunal ileal SBD were rare in incidence. SBD can be asymptomatic, or associated with nonspecific abdominal discomfort, due to bacterial overgrowth. However, jejunoileal SBD are often associated with more severe clinical manifestations such as small bowel obstruction, bleeding or acute perforation. For instance, congenital small bowel diverticula like Meckel's diverticulum are frequently linked to gastrointestinal bleeding. In contrast, acquired forms, such as pseudodiverticula (false diverticula lacking full bowel wall layers), are more commonly found in the duodenum and typically present with milder symptoms, including diverticulitis or complications like bacterial overgrowth. Due to the wide range of symptoms of SBD, it is not a commonly suspected disease in clinical practice, so it is still very difficult to diagnose SBD timely and accurately. Generalized abdominal discomfort may be dismissed as functional dyspepsia, as evident in our case highlights. GI bleeding may remain inconclusive after upper and lower GI endoscopic examinations. Therefore, the diagnosis of SBD is heavily reliant on diagnostic modalities of the small bowel, preferably with direct visualization. In clinical practice, traditional methods such as small intestinal CT or BaFT are usually used to diagnose SBD, but the above methods have poor diagnostic accuracy and cannot directly show the detailed characteristics of SBD. Double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is an examination method that can directly visualize small intestinal lesions. Compared with traditional examination methods, double balloon enteroscopy has obvious advantages such as wide field of vision and clear image, and allows for biopsy and corresponding treatment at the lesion. Due to the lengthy anatomy of the small bowel, SBD may be easily missed in radiological studies, even with small intestinal CT or BaFT. Advancements in endoscopy has allowed for increased recognition of SBD in clinical practice, which is also an important tool to help differentiate common diseases of the small bowel, such as Crohn's disease. As presented in our case highlights, Patient C may have received treatment with corticosteroids or immunomodulators given the "severity" of his disease based on CT findings. Luckily, a DBE was performed for the patient and rectified his diagnosis, which was ultimately curative with surgery. Although DBE and VCE may not be available in primary or secondary healthcare facilities, we would like to emphasize the importance of considering small bowel disease, such as SBD, especially in patients with inconclusive diagnosis. The treatment for SBD should be directed based on clinical symptoms and location of SBD. Asymptomatic small bowel diverticulosis usually does not require treatment. Although ileal SBD often require surgical intervention, due to its association with more severe clinical presentation. The purpose of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. The use of medicine and diet control can relieve dyspepsia and anemia caused by diverticulum. For those cases that respond to supportive treatment, surgery is not recommended to prevent recurrence. Complications generally include bleeding, obstruction, and perforation, serious complications often require surgical intervention. If Meckel's diverticulum occurs during the operation as an incidental finding, the removal of Meckel's diverticulum often requires further discussion. Antibiotics can be prescribed for bacterial overgrowth, while surgery is reserved for SBD associated with severe complications. Several tertiary centers in China, with expertise in GI endoscopy and DBE, has been exploring the possibility of endoscopic resection of SBD with techniques modified from endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). According to the Ma LL' case report, a novel technique called enteroscopic intestinal diverticulum dissection (EIDD) was proposed for the treatment of intussuscepted intestinal Meckel's diverticulum.

### Massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to Meckel's diverticulum in an atypical position [^112KpHPN]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Case summary

The patient presented with massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding. During the operation, intraluminal blood was discovered, but the source was not immediately evident. Definitive treatment involved surgical resection of the diverticulum en bloc with the adjacent intestinal segment. Meckel's diverticulectomy has been described, but given the location of the MD in this patient, bowel resection was indicated.

Although prophylactic resection of incidentally discovered MD remains controversial, symptomatic MD requires prompt surgical intervention. In this case, surgical consultation was obtained after the patient became unstable and imaging revealed active bleeding. Embolization was not pursued due to the risk of bowel ischemia, and endoscopy was not feasible given poor visualization in an unprepped colon. Awareness of atypical MD anatomy was critical to localizing the source and achieving hemorrhage control. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage is a multidisciplinary challenge, and an operation was ultimately chosen as the safest and most definitive approach in this context.

Conclusion

CDCs coexisting with MD are rare clinical entities that can lead to surgical emergencies requiring urgent intervention. Delayed diagnosis can further worsen the child's clinical outcome. In low-resource settings, raising general awareness and strengthening family medicine programs to educate families are key factors in ensuring timely and effective management of such cases.

### Post-appendicectomy small bowel obstruction due to internal hernia involving Meckel's diverticulum [^115y1yic]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital abnormality of the small bowel, present in about 2% of the population. A man in his 20s underwent a laparoscopic appendicectomy for acute appendicitis and recovered uneventfully. He presented to the emergency department 1month later with features of acute small bowel obstruction. Emergency diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a band adhesion between the apex of a Meckel's diverticulum to the appendicectomy stump. Internal herniation of ileum under this band adhesion resulted in small bowel obstruction and ischaemic necrosis of the Meckel's diverticulum. The band adhesion was divided, and the Meckel's diverticulum was resected at the base with a linear cutting stapler. This complication has not been reported previously. A Meckel's diverticulum is an important differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis and should routinely be searched for among other pathologies. It can rarely cause a postoperative complication of internal hernia.

### Meckel diverticulum presenting as abdominal pain and subsequent bowel perforation [^1123nYgU]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominal pain is a common presenting symptom with a broad array of potential etiologies. Meckel diverticulum (MD), the most common congenital gastrointestinal malformation, classically presents with painless gastrointestinal bleeding. However, it can also lead to diverticulitis, intussusception, or obstruction, manifesting as abdominal pain.

Case Report

A 2-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, and loose stools. Abdominal ultrasound findings were consistent with ileitis and ileocolic intussusception, but no such intussusception was seen during fluoroscopic air enema. The patient was admitted for serial abdominal examinations and subsequently developed an acute abdomen. Emergent laparotomy revealed a perforated MD. Small bowel resection and primary anastomosis were performed and no complications developed. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? The presence of an MD can lead to diverticulitis, intussusception, or obstruction, putting the patient at risk of bowel perforation. As such, it is important to consider MD in the differential diagnosis of patients with abdominal pain. In cases in which sonographic findings are ambiguous or transient, additional observation or alternative imaging, such as computed tomography, should be strongly considered.

### Double Meckel's diverticulum presenting as acute appendicitis: a case report and literature review [^1165VyrK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common developmental anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, affecting 1–3% of the general population. This anomaly is caused by incomplete obliteration of the omphalomesenteric duct during the 7th week of gestation and is located in the last meter of the ileum in 90% of patients. Meckel's diverticulum is often an incidental finding during a laparotomy for other causes, such as acute appendicitis, and occasional complications are bleeding, obstruction, diverticulitis, and perforation.

Objective

Primary aim of this study was to present and share an extremely rare case of double Meckel's diverticulum.

Methods

A 20-year-old woman who was admitted due to symptoms of right lower quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting. A laparotomy with a McBurney's incision was performed because of a presumed diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The surgical exploration revealed a double Meckel's diverticulum localized 50 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve, but no acute appendicitis. The operation was finished after a diverticulectomy and appendectomy. No complications occurred during the postoperative follow-up.

Conclusions

We conducted a literature review of studies published in the English language on double Meckel's diverticulum, accessed via PubMed, Medline, and the Google Scholar databases. We found only five case reports of such a Meckel's diverticulum variant.

### Reminiscing on remnants: imaging of Meckel diverticulum and its complications in adults [^111m5PkD]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Meckel diverticulum may become symptomatic if it is complicated by hemorrhage, intestinal obstruction, diverticulitis, or tumor. Although classically described in children, it is often missed in adults because of lack of suspicion and difficulty in detection. The purpose of this article is to review the imaging findings and management of Meckel diverticulum and its complications.

Conclusion

Although it is infrequently encountered incidentally, Meckel diverticulum should be considered especially when interpreting examinations for abdominal pain, small-bowel obstruction, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Encountering Meckel's diverticulum in emergency surgery for ascaridial intestinal obstruction [^113KXzZw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. The occurrence of symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum in male and female has ratio of 3:1, with complications being more frequently encountered in males. Reports from autopsy and retrospective studies show incidence ranges from 0.14 to 4.5%, 4.2% of cases were asymptomatic in a study from the U.S.

A variety of surgical complications in an abdomen caused by Ascaris lumbrocoides may arise and usually occur in the children. Wandering nature of Ascaris lumbricoides after migration from their usual habitat of small intestine leads to myriad of surgical complications in the abdomen. Intestinal obstruction, biliary ascariasis, pancreatic ascariasis, hepatic abscess, gallbladder ascariasis, hepatolithiasis, appendicitis and Meckel's diverticulitis are complications associated with the abdominal ascariasis. Among them, ascaridial intestinal obstruction is the most common complication seen in the children. Mode of intestinal obstruction involves mechanical obstruction, intussusception or volvulus of small gut. Mechanical obstruction is the most frequent mode of small gut obstruction and is due to bolus of worms (Fig 3A, B & Fig 4A, B, C). Ascaridial intestinal obstruction can be manifested as partial or the complete type of small gut obstruction. In children, abdominal pain, vomiting and abdominal distension are usually present. There can be diarrhea, constipation, passage of worms with stools as well as with vomitus.

Management of intestinal ascariasis may involve conservative treatment or the surgical intervention to patients who do not respond to the conservative management. Plain X-ray abdomen and the ultrasonography abdomen are routinely used radiological investigations used for diagnosis. Conservative treatment implemented by application of intravenous fluids for hydration, antibiotics and use of enemas. Antihelminthics are given when patients are asymptomatic.

When deciding for for surgical intervention in ascaridial intestinal obstruction, Wani criteria were used, and are as follows:

### Meckel's diverticulum: new solutions for an old problem? [^115oQnXq]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most commonly encountered true diverticulum in the small bowel. Although overall a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, it remains an important differential in a child/young adult presenting with lower gastrointestinal bleeding. We present two MD cases, one associated with brisk bleeding resulting in haemodynamic instability and the other in insidious blood loss causing symptoms of chronic iron deficiency. These cases illustrate the heterogeneous nature of the clinical picture associated with Meckel's diverticulae, a condition most gastroenterological and surgical units will encounter. We subsequently discuss the diagnostic and management dilemma Meckel's diverticulae pose and appraise the latest evidence and management strategies in this regard.

### SNMMI and EANM practice guideline for Meckel diverticulum scintigraphy 2.0 [^115B1rdh]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2014). Medium credibility.

Meckel diverticulum scintigraphy — interpretation criteria and temporal patterns: After injection of 99mTc-pertechnetate, stomach activity appears early on dynamic scintigraphy and is most prominent after 10–15 min; ectopic gastric mucosa appears as a focal area at the same time as normal gastric mucosa and increases with stomach activity, Meckel diverticulae are typically in the right lower quadrant, urinary tract activity usually appears after gastric activity and a small diverticulum may appear later than the stomach, and a lateral view at study end helps differentiate posterior urinary tract activity from usually anterior diverticular activity; small-bowel accumulation of secreted 99mTc-pertechnetate can be distinguished from a Meckel diverticulum by delayed appearance and a mildly, ill-defined increased activity pattern.

### Multimodality imaging manifestations of the Meckel diverticulum in children [^111sfPDX]. Pediatric Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Meckel diverticulum is the most common congenital abnormality of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, occurring in approximately 2% of the general population. The lifetime complication rate from a Meckel diverticulum is 0.5%-2%. The most common complications include bleeding, obstruction, inflammation and perforation. However, the clinical manifestations of a Meckel diverticulum are frequently nonspecific. As a result, complications secondary to Meckel diverticulitis can mimic a variety of more common intra-abdominal processes, such as appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease and any other cause of small bowel inflammation or obstruction. The radiologist should be aware of potential manifestations of the disease on different imaging modalities. In this pictorial essay, we illustrate several complications related to the Meckel diverticulum, in multiple modalities.

### Meckel's diverticular perforation presenting as acute abdomen in the second trimester of pregnancy [^114rZGZn]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Meckel's diverticular perforation is a rare cause of acute abdomen during pregnancy. We report the case of a 24-year-old woman at 24weeks of gestation who presented with abdominal pain for 4days accompanied with abdominal distension, tenderness and guarding in right lower quadrant. Ultrasonography was inconclusive. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with the clinical suspicion of appendicular perforation peritonitis. Intraoperatively, a perforated Meckel's diverticulum was detected. Owing to gross contamination of the peritoneal cavity, a diverticulectomy with ileostomy was performed. She had a normal full-term vaginal delivery, and ileostomy was reversed 1month after delivery. The physiological and anatomical changes in pregnancy can make a straightforward clinical diagnosis difficult. A high index of suspicion is required to prevent delay in diagnosis and surgical intervention, which could prove detrimental to the mother and fetus.

### Incidentally detected Meckel diverticulum: to resect or not to resect? [^114BQUyR]. Annals of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Management of incidentally detected Meckel diverticulum (MD) remains controversial. Our aims were to establish: (1) the prevalence of MD; (2) the morbidity and (3) mortality due to MD.

Methods

Systematic review: A total of 244 papers meeting defined criteria were included; there were no prospective or randomized studies. MD prevalence and mortality from autopsy studies, postoperative complications, and outcome of incidentally detected MD were extracted. Population-based data: Data were obtained from national databases on MD as cause of death, and on number of MD resections per year.

Results

The prevalence of MD is 1.2% and historical mortality of MD was 0.01%. The current mortality from MD is 0.001%. The number of MD resections per year per 100,000 population decreased significantly after the pediatric age range (P < 0.001). Resection of incidentally detected MD has a significantly higher postoperative complication rate than leaving it in situ (P < 0.0001). The long-term outcome of patients with incidentally detected MD left in situ showed no complications. Seven-hundred fifty-eight patients would require incidentally detected MD resection to prevent 1 death from MD.

Conclusions

MD is present in 1.2% of the population, it is a very rare cause of mortality, and it is primarily a disease of the young. Leaving an incidentally detected MD in situ reduces the risk of postoperative complications without increasing late complications. A large number of MD resections would need to be performed to prevent 1 death from MD. The above evidence does not support the resection of incidentally detected MD.

### SNMMI and EANM practice guideline for Meckel diverticulum scintigraphy 2.0 [^115k9fE7]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2014). Medium credibility.

Meckel diverticulum scintigraphy — pitfalls and repeat study considerations: False-positive activity suggestive of Meckel diverticulum can result from duplication cyst with ectopic gastric mucosa, bowel inflammation, intussusception or small-bowel obstruction, peptic ulcer, and vascular lesions with increased blood pool; false-negative findings usually result from anatomic or physiologic causes, and may also occur with gastrointestinal bleeding unrelated to ectopic gastric mucosa; in a patient with significant recent gastrointestinal bleeding and no other etiology over several weeks, a negative Meckel scan may warrant a repeated study, optimally using pretreatment with an H2 blocker or proton pump inhibitor.

### Imaging manifestations of Meckel's diverticulum [^116nKeNg]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, found in 2% of the population in autopsy studies. Most patients remain asymptomatic during their lifetime. Complications of Meckel's diverticulum are reported to occur in approximately 4–40% of patients and include inflammation (diverticulitis), hemorrhage, intussusception, small-bowel obstruction, stone formation, and neoplasm. The purpose of this article is to familiarize the radiologist with the current imaging of Meckel's diverticulum and its presenting complications. The spectrum of diagnostic findings on various imaging techniques will be reviewed.

Conclusion

Meckel's diverticulum and its complications are a serious health problem. Familiarity of the radiologist with the appearance of this pathologic entity enables an accurate diagnosis in emergent settings.

### Perforated Meckel diverticulum: a rare cause of acute abdomen in children [^1135BYAP]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Meckel diverticulum (MD) is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract and the most common cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in children. Although it usually follows the rule of 2's, exceptions to this rule are reported in the literature. Often asymptomatic, MD is commonly an incidental finding during surgical interventions. When symptomatic, the most common presentation of this condition is painless rectal bleeding. A myriad of other nonspecific symptoms are however possible, especially in adults, thus making this diagnosis difficult. Meckel diverticulum has been reported to mimic other abdominal pathologies like appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and pancreatitis to name a few. We report a patient with acute abdomen in whom the more common causes of acute abdomen were ruled out and a diagnosis of MD was established on exploratory laparoscopy, only after he developed perforation. This report emphasizes the need for maintaining a high index of suspicion towards a possibility of a complicated MD in patients presenting with an acute abdomen, once other causes of acute abdomen are ruled out.

### Encountering Meckel's diverticulum in emergency surgery for ascaridial intestinal obstruction [^113J8WfU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Though ascaris infestation is usually asymptomatic, ascariasis-related intestinal complications can be seen children with a high intestinal roundworm load. Presence of massive roundworm infestation in children may lead to symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum. High burden of intestinal roundworms, propensity to wander, size of the worm and the characteristics of Meckel's diverticulum constitute prerequisite for complications of Meckel's diverticulum. Surgical complications associated with Ascaris lumbricoides infection can be diverticulitis, gangrene or the perforation in the Meckel's diverticulum. Preoperative diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum is often difficult. Incidental diverticulectomies in asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum are considered safer. The work was designed to study findings of concomitant Meckel's diverticulum who had surgical intervention for ascaridial intestinal obstruction in children.

### A single-center study of secondary intussusception in children with Meckel's diverticulum [^114TVapo]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most prevalent congenital malformation of the digestive tract, caused by the omphalomesenteric or vitelline duct not being completely obliterated. The incidence of MD ranges from 0.3%~4.9%, with a higher prevalence in males compared to females. Complications associated with MD occur in 4.0%~9.0% of cases, and its clinical manifestations are varied, including bleeding, infection, intussusception, intestinal obstruction, perforation, and tumor formation. Notably, intussusception secondary to MD constitutes 11.0% of these complications. Intussusception is a common cause of acute abdomen in pediatric surgery, with MD being a significant etiological factor for secondary intussusception in children. The onset of intussusception secondary to MD is often insidious, making preoperative diagnosis challenging and potentially delaying treatment. This delay can result in intestinal ischemic necrosis, adversely affecting the quality of life in children and posing a risk to life. Despite its clinical significance, there is a paucity of reports focusing solely on intussusception secondary to MD. This study reviews the clinical data of 30 pediatric patients with intussusception secondary to MD who were admitted to the Pediatric Surgery Center of Linyi People's Hospital from June 2016 to June 2025.

### BWH emergency radiology-surgical correlation: torsion of Meckel's diverticulum [^115wKbC4]. Emergency Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

We present the radiologic findings and intraoperative correlation of a torsed Meckel's diverticulum leading to small-bowel obstruction in a 65-year-old male without prior abdominal surgery. As this is a rare entity and difficult to diagnose, an understanding of the clinical presentation and radiologic findings correlated with this pathology can help to expedite diagnosis and treatment.

Bleeding

Lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage is the most common presentation in children with a symptomatic Meckel diverticulum, with incidence rates recorded as high as 50%. The average age of presentation is 2 years but it may occur in older children and adults. The presence of heterotopic gastric and pancreatic mucosa within the Meckel's diverticulum, which secretes acid and highly alkaline pancreatic secretion respectively, causing ulceration of adjacent ileal mucosa is the main pathophysiology behind this. However, in adults, other rare causes of bleeding from Meckel's diverticulum have been noted which include the stromal tumors of the same. Children often present with dark red or maroon stools or stools with blood or mucus, whereas adults usually present with melena and crampy abdominal pain. This is perhaps attributable to slower colonic transit time in adults. The bleeding is typically painless and it may be brisk or massive giving the appearance of stool a bright red, brick red or black. Other causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in children which include polyps, clotting disorders, arteriovenous malformations, and Crohn's disease, need to be excluded by proper investigations. Technetium -99m pertechnetate radioisotope scintigraphy has been utilized universally for the diagnosis of bleeding Meckel's diverticulum and is at present the investigation of choice in a suspected Meckel diverticulum bleed. In this method the injected radioisotope is readily taken up by the ectopic gastric mucosa within the Meckel diverticulum. The diagnostic sensitivity has been reported as high as 85% with a specificity of 95% and accuracy of 90% in the pediatric age group. The accuracy of such scanning may be increased with the use of pentagastrin (to stimulate the uptake of the radioisotope), histamine-blockers (to inhibit the secretion of the pertechnetate once it is taken up), and glucagon (to inhibit peristalsis and thereby decrease "wash-out" of the pertechnetate). Capsule endoscopy has proved to be of diagnostic value in some cases of bleeding Meckel's diverticulum, however, the reports are very few and a concluding statement regarding its diagnostic value cannot be made at this time. Colonoscopy cannot diagnose the bleeding from a Meckel's diverticulum because the colonoscope usually cannot reach the part of the small intestine in which the Meckel's diverticulum is located. But we can think of this pathology when we get blood filled colon without another source of bleeding particularly if accompanied by an abnormal radioisotope scan. Angiography may be useful in the evaluation of an adult patient with occult or intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding for the localization of the site of bleeding, specific diagnosis, and therapeutic preoperative embolization. A vascular blush may also be identified at the site of the Meckel diverticulum. When active hemorrhage is occurring at the time of angiography, luminal extravasation of contrast material will be present.

### Meckel's diverticulum: comparison of incidental and symptomatic cases [^1157hzKX]. World Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Although Meckel's diverticulum is the commonest congenital gastrointestinal anomaly, there is still debate concerning the proper management of asymptomatic diverticula. Records of all patients whose Meckel's diverticulum was resected at our hospitals between 1990 and 2002 were reviewed. Clinical characteristics, mode of presentations, and management for all patients were analyzed. Meckel's diverticula were resected in 68 patients. Patients were divided into two groups: the incidental group included 40 patients (24 males) in whom the diagnosis of diverticula was incidental. The symptomatic group included 28 patients (20 males) who presented with diverticulum-related complications. Preoperative diagnosis was possible in only four cases. In four patients from the symptomatic group, Meckel's diverticula were found and left untouched during a previous laparotomy. There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to gender (p = 0.48). Patients in the symptomatic group were significantly younger than patients in the incidental group (p = 0.002). The diverticula in the symptomatic group tended to be longer (p = 0.001) with a narrower base (p = 0.001) than the diverticula in the incidental group. A diameter of ≤ 2 cm was significantly associated with more complications (p = 0.01). Heterotopic tissue was present more significantly in the symptomatic group than the incidental group (p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in the morbidity rate between the two groups (p = 0.71), and there was no mortality in either group. Preoperative diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum is difficult and should be kept in mind in cases of acute abdomen. Resection of incidentally found diverticula is not associated with increased operative morbidity or mortality.

### Emergency surgery for Meckel's diverticulum [^113UusBp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract but the life time risk of developing complications in this vestigial organ is 4–6%. Complications which require emergency treatment includes bleeding, obstruction, diverticulitis and perforation and the appropriate knowledge of various pathophysiologies by which a Meckel's diverticulum can cause complication should be kept in mind for the better management and to prevent recurrences. The diagnosis of symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum needs a high degree of suspicion as the preoperative clinical and investigational diagnosis is difficult to be made with accuracy. Open surgery has long been used as an effective method to deal with complicated Meckel's diverticulum. However, in this age of minimally invasive surgery, laparoscopic management of complicated Meckel's diverticulum is safe, cost effective and efficient as proved by various reports and studies. Although both the methods have their own limitations, still the choice of management depends on patients condition, surgeon's experiences, and availability of the laparoscopic instruments.

### Encountering Meckel's diverticulum in emergency surgery for ascaridial intestinal obstruction [^114uG5T3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. In children with intestinal ascariasis, the diverticulum remains asymptomatic or rarely the Ascaris lumbricoides may lead to its complications in the presence of massive intestinal roundworm load. Given that preoperative diagnosis is seldom carried out, when Meckel's diverticulum is found at laparotomy for obstructive intestinal complications of roundworm, the diverticulum should be removed as complications may occur at any time. The aim of this study was to describe the findings of concomitant presence of Meckel's diverticulum who had surgical intervention in symptomatic intestinal ascariasis in children.

Methods

A retrospective case review study of 14 children who had surgical intervention for symptomatic intestinal ascariasis having the presence of concomitant Meckel's diverticulum was done. The study was done at SMHS Hospital Srinagar, Kashmir.

Results

A total of the 14 children who had ascaridial intestinal obstruction with concomitant presence of Meckel's diverticulum were studied. Age of children ranged from 4–12 years, male:female ratio was 1.8:1. Nine patients had asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum, whereas 5 patients with symptomatic signs were found in the course of emergency surgery for ascaridial intestinal obstruction.

Conclusion

Meckel's diverticulum in intestinal ascariasis may pursue silent course or may be accompanied with complications of the diverticulitis, perforation or the gangrene. Incidental finding of the Meckel's diverticulum in the intestinal ascariasis should have removal.

### Haemoperitoneum caused by perforation of Meckel's diverticulum in a 5-year-old child [^116HRWvu]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Common complications of Meckel's diverticulum in children include gastrointestinal haemorrhage, intestinal obstruction or intussuception and diverticulitis. Here, the rare case of a perforated, non-inflamed Meckel's diverticulum causing significant haemoperitoneum in a young child, is reported. The case highlights the potential for rapid deterioration of patients with complications form vitelline duct abnormalities, for which surgical exploration should not be delayed.

### Management… [^113hXtED]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum is a true intestinal diverticulum that results from the failure of the vitelline duct to obliterate during the fifth week of fetal development. 1, 2 It contains all normal layers of the intestinal wall and, in approximately 50 percent of cases, contains tissue from other sites. 2 This ectopic, or heterotopic, tissue can often be the cause of complications occurring in Meckel's diverticulum. At laparotomy, an axially torsed, gangrenous Meckel's diverticulum was found without ileal volvulus. The lead point for the torsion was a fibrous adhesion attached between the distal tip of the diverticulum and the peritoneal surface. A diverticulectomy and segmental ileal resection were performed, and the patient had an uneventful postoperative course and recovery. Meckel's diverticulum arises from the antimesenteric border — the part of the intestine that lies opposite the mesenteric attachment.

Ninety percent of the diverticula are within 90 cm of the ileocecal valve, although reports of diverticula up to 180 cm from the ileocecal valve have occurred. 7 Its blood supply comes from a terminal branch of the superior mesenteric artery that crosses the ileum to the diverticulum. 1, 7, 16, 17 Meckel's diverticulum typically presents as short and wide mouthed, as in the case study presented here. 18 This shape often makes detection difficult. 18, 19. 7, 11, 21 The diagnosis must be considered in anyone with unexplained abdominal complaints, nausea and vomiting, or intestinal bleeding. 22, 23 Meckel's diverticulum can mimic a variety of more common ailments, such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroenteritis, biliary colic, colonic diverticulitis and milk allergy. This illustrative case demonstrates a rare phenomenon of axial torsion of the diverticulum, resulting in a compromised blood supply and gangrene. This condition could be considered a severe form of diverticulitis.

32–34 Less frequently, fistulas can form in the presence of perforation, especially in association with Crohn's disease. 3, 35 However, there is not an increased incidence of Meckel's diverticulum in patients with Crohn's disease. 3, 35 A Meckel's diverticulum can also be part of the contents of a Littre's or diverticular hernia. 3, 7, 16.

A 1-year-old boy presented at our hospital with common gastroenteritis symptoms such as fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical and laboratory findings were normal. An emergency ultrasound examination was performed and excluded abdominal complications. After 2 days of complete regression of symptoms, the patient began to vomit again, diarrhoea stopped with a sudden worsening of clinical conditions. Laboratory and radiological findings showed signs of an acute abdomen with differential diagnosis between an infectious and an obstructive cause. Owing to the rapid and progressive toxic condition, an emergency laparoscopy was performed. An axial torsion of a swollen and gangrenous Meckel's diverticulum was detected.

### Meckel's diverticulum with intussusception in a 5-year-old patient with Down's syndrome [^115dKNKy]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum is understood to be the commonest congenital malformation within the gastrointestinal tract with a prevalence of 2%, as found on autopsy studies. Although many cases are asymptomatic, complications can occur including haemorrhage, diverticulitis, chronic ulceration and intestinal obstruction. Intussusception is also a complication, but extremely rare. We present a rare case of Meckel's diverticulum causing intussusception, which was surgically resolved, in a 5-year-old girl. Our aim through this case report is to generate greater awareness of this complication and to provide some potential guidance towards its treatment.

### Small bowel MRI in adult patients: not just Crohn's disease-a tutorial [^116AXGxU]. Insights Into Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the GI tract without association with other congenital anomalies. A higher prevalence of Meckel's diverticulum in Crohn's disease patients is considered.

Meckel's diverticulum is the result of incomplete atrophy of the omphalomesenteric duct. This is a true diverticulum on the anti-mesenteric side of the distal ileum containing three layers of the bowel wall. Ectopic gastric or pancreatic mucosa is present in 50% of all Meckel's diverticula. There is no gender predilection for the development of Meckel's diverticulum; however symptoms and complications are considered to be more common in men. The clinical diagnosis is challenging, depending on the patient's age and the clinical findings, which may overlap more common diseases. The diagnosis is often suspected at cross-sectional imaging, scintigraphy or video capsule endoscopy.

Meckel's diverticulum itself is asymptomatic; clinical symptoms are caused by complications. Peptic ulceration with bleeding from heterotopic gastric mucosa located within or close to the diverticulum is the most frequent complication in the paediatric population, and it may appear in adults as well (Fig. 4). Meckel's diverticulum is diagnosed when a saccular, blind-ended structure continuous with the ileum is identified on imaging. An inflamed diverticulum has a distended lumen and surrounding infiltration.

### Radiological features of Meckel's diverticulum and its complications [^113cBcMf]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital abnormality of the small bowel. The majority of patients with this anomaly will remain asymptomatic; however, several complications may occur, including obstruction, intussusception, perforation, diverticulitis, and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. These complications may produce a variety of different clinical features and radiological appearances. The purpose of this article is to review the potential imaging manifestations of Meckel's diverticulum and its complications and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the imaging techniques available.

### Computed tomography of complicated Meckel's diverticulum in adults: a pictorial review [^1178WeHq]. Insights Into Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE: To show various CT aspects of complicated Meckel's diverticulum in adult patients to facilitate the preoperative diagnosis of this rare pathology in emergency settings. METHODS: A computer search of medical records over a 15 year period identified 23 adult patients who underwent surgery for acute abdomen generated by a complicated Meckel's diverticulum. CT images available for review were analyzed, and some specific patterns leading to the diagnosis of complicated Meckel's diverticulum are presented in this review. RESULTS: Complications were related to inflammation (14 patients), bleeding (5 patients), intestinal obstruction (3 patients), and penetrating foreign body (1 patient). The presence of a Meckel's diverticulum was usually suggested at CT scan by an abnormal outpouching, blind-ending digestive structure connected to the terminal ileum by a neck of variable caliber. Depending on the type of complications, the diverticulum was surrounded by mesenteric inflammatory changes, or presented as a localized fluid or air-fluid collection contiguous with the terminal ileum. The diverticulum was also the source of active bleeding or acted as the lead point to intestinal obstruction or intussusception. CONCLUSION: CT findings of complicated Meckel's diverticulum are polymorphic and should be considered in the evaluation of adult patients with acute abdomen.

### National trends in the surgical management of Meckel's diverticulum [^114gc6nW]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment recommendations for Meckel's diverticulum (MD) come mostly from single-institution case series. The objective of this study was to review the surgical management and outcomes of children undergoing Meckel's diverticulectomy using contemporary data from a national database.

Methods

We queried 2007 to 2008 data from the Pediatric Health Information System database and analyzed demographic and outcome variables for patients undergoing surgical resection of MD. Cases were classified as primary (symptomatic MD) or secondary (incidental MD). Outcomes in primary cases were compared between open and laparoscopic approaches. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Chicago, IL).

Results

Eight hundred fifteen children underwent Meckel's diverticulectomy. Meckel's diverticulectomy was more common in boys (boy-girl, 2.3:1), and half (53%) of the children required surgery before their fourth birthday. More cases (n = 485; 60%) were classified as primary, and most children were approached by laparotomy (75%). The most common presentations for primary cases were obstruction (30%), bleeding (27%), and intussusception (19%). In the primary group, patients treated with the laparoscopic approach had a shorter length of stay (open approach, 5.7 ± 5.2 days; laparoscopic approach, 4.3 ± 2.7 days; P < .02).

Conclusion

These data describe current trends in the surgical treatment of MD in the United States. Laparoscopic Meckel's diverticulectomy appears to shorten length of stay but is used much less frequently than the traditional open approach.

### A case series of Meckel's diverticulum: usefulness of double-balloon enteroscopy for diagnosis [^114x4TRz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is a congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. MD is usually located about 100 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. Although MD is usually asymptomatic, about 2% of cases are symptomatic. Sixty percent of patients who develop complications are younger than 2 years old. Among patients with symptomatic MD, the male: female ratio is approximately 3:1.

Observation of the small intestine has become easier since the development of double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) and single-balloon enteroscopy. The number of reports of MD observed by DBE is increasing. The present case series describes 10 patients with MD in whom DBE was useful for diagnosis.

### Emergency surgery for Meckel's diverticulum [^114hFTt9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The current work attempts to highlight the various life threatening complications of Meckel's diverticulum and to present the surgical strategies used in the emergency conditions so far in the form of a review of the works presented in the literature. Our aim behind this presentation is to cover the possible indications, methods, their complications and the outcome of these surgical techniques. For this, we made an extensive literature search using Google and Pubmed with the words-"Meckel's diverticulum", "Complications", "Management" and "Emergency surgery". All the relevant articles containing the surgical aspects of symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum till May 2008 were collected and analyzed. Meckel's diverticulum is the remains of the prenatal yolkstalk (Vitellointestinal duct). Although it generally remains silent but life threatening complications may arise making it an important structure for having a detailed knowledge of its anatomical and pathophysiological properties to deal with such complications.

### Approach to anaemia in gastrointestinal disease: a position paper by the ESPGHAN gastroenterology committee [^115hACn6]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum

MD is a quite common congenital diverticulum of the last part of the small intestine resulting from incomplete atrophy of the vitelline duct in the embryo. The estimated incidence is between 0.6% and 4%. MD can be asymptomatic or can present with life‐threatening conditions such as intestinal obstruction, perforation, inflammation, and severe bleeding. According to paediatric data, symptomatic MD presents mainly with obstruction (46.7%) and GI bleeding (25.3%), but also with anaemia. Painless rectal bleeding is the result of acid produced from a patch of ectopic gastric mucosa at the site of the MD. Nuclear scans with TC‐99m pertechnetate can visualise the MD with a specificity of 97.1%, but a lower sensitivity of 89.6%; therefore, if clinical suspicion is high the scan should be repeated. The therapy is surgical: either a diverticulectomy or a segmental resection of the ileum, with the latter being preferred to ensure full resection of any ectopic gastric tissue, which is usually located in the ileum and not in the MD itself.

Angiodysplasia

Angiodysplasia (vascular ectasia) is a rare cause of GI bleeding affecting any part of the GI tract. The most commonly involved areas in children are the ascending colon and the terminal ileum. Therapy depends on the severity of bleeding and recurrence of symptoms. In more than 90%, bleeding stops spontaneously, but it can recur. Argon plasma coagulation is a safe and effective therapy for symptomatic children.

Intestinal haemangiomatosis

Intestinal haemangiomatosis may be part of diffuse neonatal haemangiomatosis, which is a rare and possibly life‐threatening congenital disorder. Intestinal haemangiomas are more common in the small bowel and most commonly present with painless GI bleeding ranging from slowly progressive to massive or life‐threatening. Other manifestations include intussusception, bowel obstruction, anaemia or perforation, and congestive heart failure. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are non‐invasive and reliable methods to diagnose haemangiomatosis. In addition to colonoscopy, scintigraphy or capsule endoscopy may be useful when the bleeding focus is not detected by other exams. Propranolol has been described as an effective treatment for infantile haemangiomas, and besides surgical or endoscopic treatment, patients may respond to propranolol treatment alone.

### CT of Meckel's diverticulitis in 11 patients [^114fVUJc]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

This study reviews the CT findings of Meckel's diverticulitis in 11 patients and, to our knowledge, represents the largest series of such cases reported to date.

Conclusion

The inflamed Meckel's diverticulum may be visualized on CT in most patients, appearing as a blind-ending pouch of variable size and mural thickness and containing fluid, air, or particulate material with surrounding mesenteric inflammation. The location of the diverticulum may vary from the right lower quadrant to the mid abdomen, with most cases in this series located near midline. Optimal luminal opacification of the ileocecal bowel with oral contrast material facilitated detection of the diverticulum and also proved invaluable in enabling identification of the normal appendix. The diagnosis is most difficult in the setting of secondary intestinal obstruction.

### An internal hernia caused by Meckel's diverticulum: a case report [^115h7rVX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Meckel's diverticulum is a remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct. It can lead to intestinal perforation, obstruction and gastrointestinal bleeding. While the internal hernia caused by Meckel's diverticulum is rarely reported.

Case Presentation

We report a case of a 45-year old female patient who presented with intestinal obstruction and on laparotomy was found to have Meckel's diverticulum with internal hernia causing intestinal gangrene. Segmental bowel resection was performed and the patient had uneventful recovery.

Conclusions

In patients with acute intestinal obstruction without previous abdominal surgery, Meckel's diverticulum and its complications should be suspected.

### Multifaceted behavior of Meckel's diverticulum in children [^111KHJHy]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose/Background

Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is one of the most common congenital malformations of gastrointestinal tract in children. However, the nonspecific clinical manifestations of MD often cause a diagnostic as well as therapeutic challenge to pediatric surgeon. This study aimed to review our experience in managing this disease while evaluating the management strategies.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of all patients diagnosed with MD admitted to our center between January 2010 and December 2015. Factors documented including demographic criteria, clinical manifestations, preoperative examinations, surgical methods, histopathological characteristics, postoperative complications, and outcomes.

Results

The patients included 210 males and 76 females, aged from 1day to 15years. In fifty three patients, the MD was an incidental finding at laparotomy or laparoscopy. The remaining 233 patients were symptomatic and presented with various clinical features. Ninety nine patients presented with episodes of bleeding per rectum or melena. Fifty six patients demonstrated symptoms of diverticulitis or perforated MD. Forty patients were diagnosed as intestinal obstruction, and 35 patients with intussusception requiring surgical reduction. Two cases of Littre hernia and one case of foreign body trapped in MD were also observed in this group. Six patients misdiagnosed as appendicitis at another institution were reoperated in our department. Among the 99 patients with bleeding per rectum, 78 underwent a Tc-99m scan that showed a positive tracer in 55 patients and negative in 23. All patients underwent resection of the diverticulum, except for 2 cases of postponed resection. Histology revealed ectopic gastric mucosa or ectopic pancreatic tissue in 154 patients; significant differences were observed between the symptomatic group and the accidentally found group. One patient died of peritonitis and sepsis postoperatively; one case of anastomotic leak and one case of adhesive intestinal obstruction were reoperated.

Conclusion

Meckel's diverticulum has various clinical presentations and it is difficult to make a precise diagnosis preoperatively. It is necessary to maintain a high suspicion of MD in the pediatric age group with symptoms of abdominal pain, gastrointestinal hemorrhage or intestinal obstruction. Heterotopic tissue is the main cause of complicated diverticulum, and it is safe and feasible to remove the incidentally found MD. Laparoscopy should become the first choice of methods in diagnosis and treatment of MD.

### A single-center study of secondary intussusception in children with Meckel's diverticulum [^114n199u]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There are a limited number of clinical reports addressing intussusception resulting from uncomplicated Meckel's diverticulum (MD). This paper examines the clinical characteristics and treatment strategies for intussusception secondary to MD, synthesizes clinical experiences, and offers reference value for clinicians in selecting appropriate surgical approaches.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted involving thirty patients diagnosed with intussusception secondary to MD, who underwent surgical intervention in the Department of Pediatric Surgery at Linyi People's Hospital between June 2016 and June 2025. The patients were categorized into two groups based on the presence or absence of ectopic tissue within the diverticulum: the ectopic tissue group (Group A, 10 patients) and the non-ectopic tissue group (Group B, 20 patients). A comparative analysis of the clinical data between the two groups was performed. The results indicated that Group A included six patients with ectopic gastric mucosal gland tissue and four patients with ectopic pancreatic tissue. It was observed that, in female patients with MD, the ectopic tissue predominantly originated from gastric glands, whereas in male patients, it predominantly originated from pancreatic tissue (P = 0.035). Furthermore, compared to Group B, patients in Group A exhibited a greater distance from the ileocecal valve (P = 0.006) and increased diverticulum length (P = 0.017). However, no significant differences were found between the groups concerning age, gender, clinical symptoms, or diverticulum width (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

The clinical presentation of intussusception secondary to MD is atypical, necessitating surgical exploration and postoperative histopathological examination for a definitive diagnosis. The findings of this study indicate that ectopic tissue is not the primary etiological factor in intussusception secondary to MD. However, diverticula containing ectopic tissue tend to be marginally longer and are located at a greater distance from the ileocecal valve compared to those lacking ectopic tissue.

### CT findings in children with Meckel diverticulum [^117Shkoj]. Pediatric Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 0.04% of the general population will present with a complication related to Meckel diverticulum. The classic teaching is that symptomatic children with Meckel diverticulum present with painless rectal bleeding and are evaluated with a radionuclide scan. Our subjective experience is that we see children with Meckel diverticulum who present with abdominal pain and are evaluated by CT.

Objective

We reviewed the findings on CT in children with pathologically proven Meckel diverticulum to identify characteristic patterns of presentation.

Materials and Methods

Databases were searched (2004–2008) for all children who had a pathologic diagnosis of Meckel diverticulum and a CT scan performed prior to surgery. Demographics, pathology, and CT features were reviewed. CT features reviewed included: soft-tissue stranding, abnormal calcifications, bowel obstruction, free air, free peritoneal fluid, cystic mass, intussusception, obvious lead point, location, and whether a normal appendix was identified. The frequency of Meckel diverticulum encountered on CT scans was compared to that found during the same period of time on technetium pertechnetate studies.

Results

The review identified 16 subjects (mean age 9.5 years, M:F 9:7). CT findings included: soft-tissue stranding in nine (56%), small-bowel obstruction (SBO) in nine (56%), intussusception in three (19%), free fluid in ten (63%), cystic mass in four (25%), calcification in none (0%), free air in one (6%), and no abnormalities in two (13%). A normal appendix was identified in only five children (31%). There were three basic patterns of presentation of abnormalities: SBO only in five, intussusception with SBO in three, or cystic mass with inflammatory stranding in four (one with SBO). Also, 2.3 times more Meckel diverticulum was encountered on CT than on technetium pertechnetate studies.

Conclusion

Meckel diverticulum is currently more commonly encountered in children on CT performed for abdominal pain than on technetium pertechnetate studies. There are three categories of appearance on CT: SBO only, intussusception, or a cystic inflammatory mass.

In Afghanistan, inaccessibility to healthcare facilities, low socioeconomic status, poor literacy rates, and lack of awareness regarding emergency conditions contribute to delayed presentations and increased morbidity and mortality. Misdiagnosis due to a shortage of experienced clinicians and imaging professionals (mostly on an outpatient basis), along with the unavailability of advanced diagnostic tools such as the technetium-99 scan, further complicates timely diagnosis and treatment. Despite the challenges of a resource-limited setting, including the absence of a well-equipped intensive care unit (ICU), we made every effort to ensure the patient's full recovery.

Case description

A middle-aged man, with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis (treated with methotrexate) and gastroesophageal reflux disease presented to a community hospital with a 1-day history of abdominal pain. A CT scan abdomen/pelvis revealed acute diverticulitis with extensive sigmoid colon inflammation but no abscess. The patient was clinically well and non-peritonitic so intravenous antibiotics were initiated. He was later discharged home with oral antibiotics and a referral for outpatient colonoscopy. Approximately 6 weeks later, colonoscopy identified severe diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids, but no evidence of malignancy. After colonoscopy, the patient returned to the community hospital with severe left lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal pain. Laboratory investigations revealed a C-reactive Protein of 132 and neutrophilia leukocytosis White Blood Cell Count 11.1). A CT scan abdomen/pelvis demonstrated an abscess collection (7×3.5×6 cm) in the LLQ, persistent sigmoid colon thickening, and multiple scattered pockets of free intraperitoneal air (figure 1). The CT report diagnosed perforation of the colon either from diverticulitis or recent colonoscopy. Fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics were initiated. The patient was transferred to a tertiary care hospital for surgical management. On arrival, the patient was reassessed by the surgical team and found to be peritonitic but hemodynamically stable. Consent for a laparotomy, possible bowel resection, and possible stoma was obtained.

Intraoperative findings confirmed severe diverticulitis. A large abscess was encountered in the LLQ with purulent contamination, consistent with modified Hinchey III classification. The sigmoid colon was thickened and inflamed. Incidentally, a Meckel's diverticulum (MD) was noted at approximately 35–40 cm from the ileocecal valve. The diverticulum was approximately 10 cm long with a 2 cm base, and there was no gross or palpable abnormality appreciated (figure 2). The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the case.

Perforation of Meckel's diverticulum in children is a rare and serious complication. The authors report a case of a 3-year-old boy with perforation and hemoperitoneum caused by Meckel's diverticulum. Difficulty of preoperative diagnosis is discussed, indication for incidental diverticulotomy is established, and the literature is reviewed.

Meckel's diverticulum and acquired jejunoileal diverticulosis

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract, interesting 2% to 4% of population. It is a true diverticulum due to the persistence of omphalo-mesenteric duct, which connects in fetal life the yolk sac to the intestinal tract and usually obliterates in the 5 th to 7 th week of life. It is localized on anti-mesenteric border of the distal ileum, usually 30–40 cm far from the ileo-cecal valve. Meckel's diverticulum is lined mainly by the typical ileal mucosa as in the adjacent small bowel. However, in 20% of cases ectopic gastric mucosa may be found. Globally the incidence of complications ranges from 4% to 16%. Although there is no sex differences in the incidence of Meckel's diverticulum, its complications are 3–4 times more frequent in males. Meckel's diverticulum is the most common cause of bleeding in the pediatric age group. The risk of complications decreases with increasing age. The most frequent complications in adults are obstruction due to the intussusceptions or adhesive band, ulceration, diverticulitis and perforation. Preoperative diagnosis of symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum is difficult, especially in patients with symptoms other than bleeding. In doubtful cases, laparoscopy is the preferred diagnostic modality. However, technetium 99-m pertechnate scan is the most common and accurate non-invasive investigation, although it is specific to ectopic gastric mucosa, not to Meckel's diverticulum. In the presence of symptoms, the treatment of choice is the surgical resection. This can be achieved either by diverticulectomy or by the segmental bowel resection and anastomosis, especially when there is palpable ectopic tissue, intestinal ischemia or perforation.

Background

Meckel's diverticulum is an uncommon entity. A high index of suspicion is necessary for opportune diagnosis and prompt treatment. Technetium (TC) 99m pertechnetate scintigraphy is a sensitive and specific test for Meckel's diverticulum. In adults, the scan contributes little to clinical decision making and often will not change the need for surgical intervention. We describe our experience with four patients.

Methods

Between August 2000 and August 2001, four patients were seen with Meckel's diverticula. Three were male and one was female. The mean age was 39 years (range, 18–64). Three patients presented with anemia and one with an acute abdomen. A 99mTc pertechnetate scan was performed at a cost of 900 dollars in the three anemic patients after other endoscopic and radiographic tests were nondiagnostic. Only one patient had a positive scan. All four patients underwent exploratory laparoscopy and small bowel resection. In one patient, a minilaparatomy had to be performed.

Results

All patients had a satisfactory outcome without complications. Three patients were discharged within 3 days of surgery. The remaining patient had a prolonged hospital stay because of ongoing chemotherapy for small cell lung cancer. In the three anemic patients who underwent enterectomy, ulcerated small bowel outside the diverticulum was found by the pathologist.

Conclusion

Laparoscopy is safe, cost-effective, and efficient for the diagnosis and definitive management of Meckel's diverticulum. Technetium 99m pertechnetate scintigraphy scanning adds considerable time and expense to the care of the patient without significant benefits in adults. The practice of exploratory laparoscopy rather than scintigraphy is recommended.
