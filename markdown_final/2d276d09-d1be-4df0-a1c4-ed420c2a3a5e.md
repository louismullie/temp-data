## Question

Are steroids effective for multiple sclerosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether steroids are effective for multiple sclerosis, and in what contexts they should be used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the difference between treating an acute relapse versus modifying long-term disease progression. Then, I should verify dosing, route equivalence, and whether tapers add benefit. Next, I will evaluate safety and patient-reported tolerability. After that, I need to consider options for steroid-refractory relapses. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned recommendation and confirm it against high-credibility sources like FDA labeling and Cochrane reviews to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts, because I need to ensure we are not conflating short-term anti-inflammatory treatment with long-term disease modification. Controlled trials demonstrate that corticosteroids speed the resolution of acute exacerbations in MS, but they do not change the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease, which means they are not disease-modifying therapies in the conventional sense used for long-term control [^111M7cAB] [^112H9p3h] [^115YYBTw].

> Now, I will examine efficacy for acute relapses. High-dose regimens accelerate clinical recovery; the FDA explicitly notes that relatively high doses are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect, which aligns with common practice of methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3–5 days or bioequivalent high-dose oral therapy, and with guideline language supporting short-term high-dose corticosteroids for relapses [^111M7cAB] [^1146dPmM]. Wait, let me verify route equivalence, because patients often ask about skipping IV infusions: the Cochrane review comparing oral versus IV steroids for relapses supports similar clinical efficacy, and a randomized MRI study found high-dose oral methylprednisolone to be as effective as IV for reducing gadolinium-enhancing lesions and improving short-term disability, with comparable tolerability [^1175ngeE] [^1154YCFj]. Mechanistically, glucocorticoids exert potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects; for example, short-course high-dose therapy can restore impaired regulatory T-cell function during acute RRMS relapses, which is consistent with their clinical effect on relapse recovery speed [^115JAray].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about long-term outcomes. I need to check whether steroids prevent disability accumulation or alter disease trajectory, and the consistent answer across high-credibility sources is no. FDA labeling states trials do not show an effect on the ultimate outcome or natural history of MS, and a Cochrane review of long-term corticosteroid use did not demonstrate a clear reduction in long-term disability progression, reinforcing that steroids are not disease-modifying therapies and should not be used as maintenance treatment [^111M7cAB] [^112H9p3h] [^115YYBTw] [^112v4Dho]. But wait, what if treating relapses still influences longer-term disability indirectly? A large 2025 cohort analysis found that untreated relapses were associated with higher risk of confirmed disability worsening than steroid-treated relapses, suggesting a relative benefit at the time of relapse, although this does not equate to disease modification independent of relapse management or ongoing DMT use, so I should be careful not to over-interpret causality here [^111BUn9i].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerability, because I need to ensure the risk–benefit profile remains favorable for short-term use. Short-course high-dose therapy is generally well tolerated medically, but patient-reported outcomes highlight a substantial burden; about one in five patients considered refusing IV methylprednisolone due to adverse effects, which must be incorporated into shared decision-making and counseling on what to expect during and after infusions or high-dose oral therapy [^111rayy3]. For longer-term or repeated cumulative exposure, I should confirm risks: impaired bone health associates with cumulative steroid exposure and with disability-related immobility in MS cohorts, acute steroid myopathy can occur at high doses in susceptible patients, and immunosuppression mandates avoidance of exposure to certain infections and careful individual risk–benefit decisions regarding dose and duration per FDA warnings [^112P7ySi] [^112H9p3h] [^111M7cAB].

> Hmm, wait a minute, do patients need an oral prednisone taper after a 3–5 day IV methylprednisolone course to prevent rebound or improve outcomes? I initially thought a taper could improve recovery and reduce relapse recurrence, especially because some older guidelines suggested tapering after certain presentations like optic neuritis, but hold on, I should verify this with outcome data [^111KbGzU]. Let me reconsider: a comparative study found that adding an oral prednisone taper after IV methylprednisolone did not improve disability or recovery at 12 months versus IV alone, which argues against routine tapers after short, high-dose courses used for MS relapses, so I should counsel that a taper is generally unnecessary unless there are patient-specific reasons such as steroid withdrawal issues or comorbid adrenal considerations [^115R4dY6].

> I will now examine what to do when high-dose steroids are insufficient, because I need to ensure the pathway for steroid-refractory relapses is clear. In severe steroid-refractory relapses, therapeutic apheresis with plasma exchange or immunoadsorption is appropriate; randomized and controlled data indicate that both approaches achieve meaningful clinical responses in many patients, and older guideline statements endorse plasma exchange in refractory cases, supporting escalation in a timely manner when deficits do not improve with steroids [^1121Rdpr] [^1146dPmM] [^112aEmss].

> Next, I should review long-term disease control, since steroids address only acute inflammation. Disease-modifying therapies are required to reduce relapse rates, MRI activity, and the risk of disability progression, with contemporary guidance emphasizing early initiation and, increasingly, early high-efficacy approaches for better long-term outcomes when appropriate, which is distinct from the short-term role of steroids [^11278RKF] [^115V3N9z] [^113TuRYF] [^116xs3xd].

> Let me think about practical dosing and route details, and I should double-check equivalencies. Common practice is methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3–5 days IV or bioequivalent high-dose oral regimens, with evidence supporting oral–IV equivalence for relapse treatment; historical FDA labeling also includes an alternative high-dose prednisolone regimen for acute MS exacerbations, though contemporary use more often favors short, pulsed methylprednisolone courses without maintenance steroids; chronotherapy data suggesting improved tolerability with night-time dosing are intriguing but limited and not yet standard of care, so I should present that cautiously in discussions of timing and patient comfort [^1175ngeE] [^1154YCFj] [^116K83Fe] [^113SVmB7].

> Synthesis and recommendation: I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Steroids are effective for accelerating recovery during acute MS relapses, particularly when given in high-dose short courses, but they do not prevent long-term disability or alter the disease course and should not be used as maintenance therapy; management should incorporate patient counseling on adverse effects, avoid routine tapers after short courses, escalate to apheresis for steroid-refractory relapses, and ensure timely initiation or optimization of disease-modifying therapy for long-term control within guideline frameworks [^111M7cAB] [^112H9p3h] [^1175ngeE] [^115YYBTw] [^1121Rdpr] [^11278RKF] [^113TuRYF].

---

Yes, steroids treat acute MS relapses by **shortening relapse duration** [^112aEmss] and **improving short-term recovery** [^111M7cAB], but they do not alter long-term disability or disease progression [^112H9p3h] [^115YYBTw]. High-dose intravenous or oral methylprednisolone is standard [^112aEmss], with **oral regimens non-inferior to IV** [^1154YCFj] [^1175ngeE]. Steroids are not disease-modifying and are not used for long-term control; repeated or prolonged use increases risks such as osteoporosis, infections, and metabolic effects [^111M7cAB] [^112P7ySi] [^111rayy3]. For steroid-refractory relapses [^1121Rdpr], plasma exchange or immunoadsorption is considered [^112aEmss].

---

## Mechanism of action

Steroids reduce inflammation in MS relapses via **glucocorticoid receptor–mediated** [^114XgLFJ] transcriptional effects that suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduce immune cell infiltration, and stabilize the blood–brain barrier. They also restore impaired regulatory T cell function [^115JAray] during acute relapses, contributing to immunomodulation.

---

## Clinical efficacy in acute relapses

Steroids are effective for acute relapses — **shortening relapse duration** [^111M7cAB] and improving short-term recovery [^1175ngeE] — but they do not change long-term outcomes [^112H9p3h].

- **High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP)**: 1 g/day for 3–5 days [^112aEmss] is standard and improves short-term recovery [^112H9p3h].
- **Oral methylprednisolone**: High-dose oral regimens (e.g. 1 g/day for 5 days) [^11771Z2h] are non-inferior to IVMP for clinical and MRI outcomes [^1154YCFj] [^1175ngeE].
- **Oral prednisone taper**: Adding a taper after IVMP does not improve long-term outcomes [^115R4dY6] and may increase adverse effects.

---

## Long-term disease progression

Steroids do not prevent relapses or slow disability progression; **disease-modifying therapies** (DMTs) are required for long-term control [^112xQn9o] [^114ASCe6].

---

## Recommended steroid regimens

| **Steroid regimen** | **Dosage** | **Duration** | **Route** | **Clinical context** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Methylprednisolone | 1 g/day | 3–5 days | IV | Acute relapses [^111M7cAB] [^112aEmss] [^112H9p3h] |
| Methylprednisolone | 1 g/day | 5 days | Oral | Acute relapses [^1154YCFj] |
| Prednisone | 200 mg/day | - 7 days <br/> - Then 80 mg every other day for 1 month | Oral | Acute exacerbations [^116K83Fe] |

---

## Adverse effects and risks

Steroids have significant adverse effects [^111M7cAB], especially with repeated or prolonged use [^112H9p3h]; a **risk–benefit assessment** is essential. **Short-term effects** include insomnia, mood changes, hyperglycemia, hypertension, infections, and gastrointestinal upset [^111rayy3], while **long-term effects** include osteoporosis, cataracts, glaucoma, adrenal suppression [^111M7cAB], metabolic syndrome, and increased infection risk.

---

## Alternative treatments for steroid-refractory relapses

For relapses not responding to steroids, **plasma exchange (PE)** or **immunoadsorption (IA)** are effective alternatives [^112aEmss] [^1121Rdpr]. PE is standard for **steroid-refractory relapses**, with about a 42% response in randomized trials, while **IA** is well tolerated and non-inferior to PE.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines support steroids for acute relapses [^112aEmss] but not for long-term control; **DMTs are required** for disease modification [^112xQn9o] [^114ASCe6]. High-dose IV or oral methylprednisolone [^111M7cAB] is recommended for **acute relapses** [^112H9p3h], whereas for **long-term management** disease-modifying therapies are essential [^112xQn9o] [^114ASCe6].

---

Steroids are effective for acute relapses, **improving short-term recovery** [^1175ngeE] without altering long-term progression [^115YYBTw]; they are **not disease-modifying**, and repeated use increases adverse effects [^111rayy3]. For steroid-refractory relapses, plasma exchange or immunoadsorption are effective alternatives [^1121Rdpr].

### Safety and efficacy of immunoadsorption versus plasma exchange in steroid-refractory relapse of multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndrome: A randomised, parallel-group, controlled trial [^1121Rdpr]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). High credibility.

Plasma exchange (PE) constitutes the standard therapy for steroid-refractory relapse in multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndrome. Immunoadsorption (IA) is an alternative method of apheresis which selectively removes immunoglobulins (Ig) while preserving other plasma proteins. Although IA is regarded as a well-tolerated, low-risk procedure, high-level evidence for its efficacy is lacking. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether IA is superior to PE in patients with an acute relapse of multiple sclerosis or clinically isolated syndrome who had insufficiently responded to high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (MP).

Patients with an acute relapse of multiple sclerosis or clinically isolated syndrome and without complete clinical remission of symptoms after at least one cycle of high-dose intravenous MP therapy were enrolled in our randomised, controlled, parallel-group, monocentric trial. Eligible patients were aged at least 12 years and had no clinical or laboratory signs of systemic infection. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either IA or PE. Both groups underwent 5 treatments on 5 consecutive days. In the IA group, the 2.0-fold individual total plasma volume was processed on day 1, and the 2.5-fold on days 2–5. In the PE group, 2 liters of plasma (corresponding to the 0.69 ± 0.12-fold individual total plasma volume) were removed each day and substituted with a 5% human albumin solution. Patients were followed up directly after the last apheresis as well as 2 and 4 weeks after the last treatment.

### A short-term randomized MRI study of high-dose oral vs intravenous methylprednisolone in MS [^1154YCFj]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of intravenous methylprednisolone (IV MP) versus oral methylprednisolone (oMP) at equivalent high doses in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) experiencing a recent relapse.

Patients with a clinical relapse within the previous two weeks and at least one gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesion on a screening brain MRI scan were included. Forty patients with MS were randomized to receive either 1 g/day for 5 days of oMP (20 patients) or 1 g/day for 5 days of IV MP (20 patients). The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and brain MRI (dual-echo and postcontrast T1-weighted scans) were assessed at baseline and at weeks 1 and 4. The study's primary research question was to compare the efficacy of the two treatment routes in reducing the number of Gd-enhancing lesions one week after treatment initiation. Secondary outcomes were safety, tolerability, and clinical efficacy profiles of the two routes of administration.

The results showed that both groups experienced a reduction in Gd-enhancing lesions over time (p = 0.002 for oMP and p = 0.001 for IV MP), with a non-inferiority effect observed between the two routes of administration at week 1. Both groups also demonstrated an improvement in EDSS over time (p < 0.001) without a significant between-group difference at week 4. Both treatments were well-tolerated, with minimal adverse events occurring similarly in both treatment arms.

Oral methylprednisolone (oMP) is as effective as IV methylprednisolone in reducing gadolinium-enhancing lesions in patients with MS soon after an acute relapse, with similar clinical profiles for safety and tolerability in both administration routes.

### Prednisone [^111M7cAB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed. Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that corticosteroids affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)

Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.

Convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporine. Since concurrent use of these agents results in a mutual inhibition of metabolism, it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur.

- **Information for patients**: Persons who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles. Patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice should be sought without delay.

### Impaired ambulation and steroid therapy impact negatively on bone health in multiple sclerosis [^112P7ySi]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis is higher among patients with multiple sclerosis compared to the general population. In addition to the general determinants of bone health, two factors may contribute to reduced bone mineral density in multiple sclerosis: physical disability and corticosteroid therapy. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of physical disability and steroid exposure on bone health in weight-bearing bones and the spine, as well as on the incidence of low-trauma fractures in multiple sclerosis.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, associations between bone mineral density (at the femoral neck, total femur, and the lumbar spine) and changes due to disability or cumulative steroid dose were evaluated with random-effect models, adjusted for demographic and clinical determinants of bone health. The incidence of low-trauma fractures during the study follow-up was evaluated with Andersen-Gill models.

- **Results**: Overall, 474 and 438 patients were included in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses (follow-up 2347 patient-years), respectively. The effect of severely impaired gait was more apparent in weight-bearing bones (P ≤ 10⁻¹⁵) than in the spine (P = 0.007). The effect of a cumulative steroid dose was relatively less pronounced but diffuse (P ≤ 10⁻⁴). Risk of low-trauma fractures was associated with disability (P = 0.02) but not with cumulative steroid exposure and was greater among patients with severely impaired gait (annual risk 3.5% vs. 3.0%). Synergistic effects were found on [Text appears to be truncated].

### Orapredodt [^112H9p3h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Neuromuscular effects**: Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that they affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies indicate that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

	- An acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with disorders of neuromuscular transmission (e.g. myasthenia gravis) or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g. pancuronium). This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in quadriparesis. Elevation of creatinine kinase may occur. Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years.

- **Kaposi's sarcoma**: Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement of Kaposi's sarcoma.

### Patient-reported adverse effects of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone treatment: a prospective web-based multi-center study in multiple sclerosis patients with a relapse [^111rayy3]. Journal of Neurology (2016). High credibility.

Given the potential negative impact of IVMP treatment, doctors and nurses should counsel patients about possible adverse effects (AEs). However, the information provided may be biased or limited in scope. Until recently, the literature on IVMP was dominated by medical diagnoses of rare, serious AEs. This aligns with the discrepancy observed between the numbers of AEs reported by patients and doctors: neurologists reported three IVMP-related diagnoses in patients for whom information was provided (N = 41), whereas 306 AEs were reported by the patients themselves (N = 59).

Further clinical research is needed into the effectiveness and risks associated with methylprednisolone in MS relapses, as this would enable more informed and precise treatment recommendations. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have already allowed for a better evaluation of relapse burden from the patient perspective in terms of quality of life and functional ability. A similar approach using PROs to evaluate the burden of AEs seems equally important, enabling a clinically relevant benefit-risk assessment of short-term corticosteroid treatment. For example, in our study, one out of five patients considered refusing IVMP treatment due to AEs.

We hope our study contributes to better-informed choices regarding high-dose IVMP treatment by quantitatively and comprehensively informing on the occurrence, severity, and impact of the most common AEs from the patient perspective.

### Oral versus intravenous steroids for treatment of relapses in multiple sclerosis [^1175ngeE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

This is an updated Cochrane review of a previous version published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in 2009 (Issue 3, Art. No.: CD006921. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006921.pub2). Multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS), is characterized by relapses of CNS inflammation ranging from mild to severely disabling. Relapses have long been treated with steroids to reduce inflammation and hasten recovery. However, the commonly used intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) requires repeated infusions, leading to added costs of home care or hospitalization, and may interfere with daily responsibilities. Oral steroids have been used in place of intravenous steroids, offering lower direct and indirect costs.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of oral versus intravenous steroids in promoting disability recovery in MS relapses of six weeks or less. Secondary objectives included assessing subsequent relapse rate, disability, ambulation, hospitalization, immunological markers, radiological markers, and quality of life.

- **Search methods**: A literature search was performed using the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group's Trials Register (January 2012), abstracts from meetings of the American Academy of Neurology (2008–2012), the European Federation of Neurological Sciences (2008–2012), and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis and American Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (2008–2012).

### Sterol imbalances and cholesterol-24-hydroxylase dysregulation is linked to the underlying progression of multiple sclerosis [^112yf55Q]. Brain Pathology (2025). High credibility.

Disability worsening in multiple sclerosis (MS) is linked to neurodegeneration. Cholesterol homeostasis is essential for normal brain function. CYP46A1, crucial for brain cholesterol turnover and reduced in some neurodegenerative diseases, is a potential neuroprotective target. We hypothesized that CYP46A1 is downregulated in MS brains and linked to cholesterol dysbalance. Mass spectrometric analysis of sterols was performed from matched plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in an all-female MS cohort (n = 32, mean age = 33). Disability status was recorded at baseline and follow-up.

MS brain tissue samples (n = 11; 7 females; ages 38–67; 10 Secondary Progressive MS, 1 Primary Progressive MS; Disease Duration: 13–49 years) and control samples (n = 8; 3 females; ages 41–68) were analyzed for pathological regions using mass spectrometry and RNA expression using in-situ hybridization.

- **Significant dysregulation**: Dysregulation in 25-hydroxycholesterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol, and 3β-hydroxycholestenoic acid in CSF correlated with disability at baseline and follow-up in the patient population.
- **Changes in brain tissue**: Reduced cholesterol, 24S-hydroxycholesterol, and 24S,25-epoxycholesterol were observed in white matter lesions (p < 0.05), linked to CYP46A1 activity.
- **Neuron-specific expression**: CYP46A1 expression was enriched in neurons, with reductions in MS grey matter lesions and non-lesions compared to controls (p < 0.01).

Cholesterol metabolism is dysregulated in MS and is associated with reduced neuron-specific CYP46A1 expression. Modulating CYP46A1, a druggable target, may benefit progressive MS.

### Safety and efficacy of immunoadsorption versus plasma exchange in steroid-refractory relapse of multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndrome: A randomised, parallel-group, controlled trial [^1146dPmM]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Low credibility.

In accordance with the pathophysiological aspects outlined above, several case series showed promising results for the use of IA in steroid-refractory relapse of multiple sclerosis, reporting response rates between 71% and 88%. Retrospective studies suggest about equal efficacy and tolerability of PE and IA in this indication. However, high-level evidence in terms of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) is missing. Therefore, we conducted an investigator-initiated RCT to compare the efficacy and tolerability of IA versus PE in patients with multiple sclerosis or clinically isolated syndrome suffering from acute relapse with insufficient response to high-dose MP therapy.

### Early highly effective versus escalation treatment approaches in relapsing multiple sclerosis [^112jAR2i]. The Lancet Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Treatment decisions in multiple sclerosis are complex, given the large number of disease-modifying therapies with diverse safety and efficacy profiles. The importance of early treatment has been recognized, but how intensively to treat at onset is not known. There is substantial variability in treatment selection, with weak clinical trial evidence to guide initial treatment choices. Decision-making is further complicated by variable tolerance for the risk of side effects and the inability to accurately predict treatment response.

Whether to use moderately effective and safe medications with escalation as needed, or to use higher efficacy medications from the outset, is a key question in clinical practice. Clinical trials in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis have focused on pairwise comparisons, but the effectiveness of different treatment approaches has not been tested. Future pragmatic randomized clinical trials and observational studies will help to inform more rational selection of initial therapies and improve the quality of life of patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis.

### Recent developments in multiple sclerosis therapeutics [^1174J3EP]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis, the most common neurologic disorder of young adults, is traditionally considered to be an inflammatory, autoimmune, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Based on this understanding, the initial therapeutic strategies were directed at immune modulation and inflammation control. These approaches, including high-dose corticosteroids for acute relapses and long-term use of parenteral interferon-β, glatiramer acetate, or natalizumab for disease modification, are at best moderately effective.

Growing evidence supports that, while an inflammatory pathology characterizes the early relapsing stage of multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative pathology dominates the later progressive stage of the disease. Multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapies currently in development attempt to specifically target the underlying pathology at each stage of the disease while avoiding frequent self-injection. These include a variety of oral medications and monoclonal antibodies to reduce inflammation in relapsing multiple sclerosis and agents intended to promote neuroprotection and neurorepair in progressive multiple sclerosis. Although newer therapies for relapsing MS have the potential to be more effective and easier to administer, they also carry greater risks. Effective treatments for progressive multiple sclerosis are still being sought.

### Glucocorticoid treatment restores the impaired suppressive function of regulatory T cells in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis [^115JAray]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Patients relapsing from multiple sclerosis (MS) are treated with high-dose, short-term intravenous injection of glucocorticoid (GC), although its mechanism of action remains only partly understood. We evaluated the ex vivo and in vitro effects of GC on regulatory T cell (T(reg)) function in 14 relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS) patients in the acute phase and 20 healthy controls (HC). T(reg) function was enhanced significantly after 5 days of GC treatment. Furthermore, there was a trend towards increasing proportions of CD4(+)CD25(+)forkhead box P3(+) T cells and interleukin-10 secretion with GC treatment when compared with HC. In conclusion, GC treatment restores the impaired T(reg) function in patients with RR-MS in its acute phase.

### Immunomodulators and immunosuppressants for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a network meta-analysis [^116xs3xd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

We estimated the relative effects of the competing interventions according to the following primary outcomes:

- **Efficacy**:
	- **Relapses**: Proportion of participants who experienced new relapses over 12, 24, or 36 months after randomization or at the end of the study. A relapse is defined as newly developed or recently worsened symptoms of neurologic dysfunction that last for at least 24 hours, occurring in the absence of fever or other acute diseases and separated in time from any previous episode by more than 30 days. A more stringent 48-hour criterion has been used in some RCTs. A relapse can resolve either partially or completely.
	- **Disability worsening**: Proportion of participants who experienced disability worsening over 24 or 36 months after randomization or at the end of the study. Worsening is defined as at least a 1-point Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) increase or a 0.5-point increase if the baseline EDSS was greater than or equal to 5.5, confirmed during two subsequent neurological examinations separated by at least a six-month interval free of attacks. Disability worsening confirmed after only three months of follow-up is considered a surrogate marker for unremitting disability. EDSS is a common measure of MS disability (where 0 is normal, 3 mild disability, 6 care requirement, 7 wheelchair use, and 10 is death from MS) and is used to measure disability worsening in clinical trials for MS.

- **Safety**:
	- **Discontinuation due to adverse events**: Measured by the number of participants who withdrew due to any adverse effects.

### De-escalating and discontinuing disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis [^114y7rfy]. Brain (2025). High credibility.

The transient use of pulsed methylprednisolone, especially when longer washout periods are planned, has been suggested, but the evidence remains limited and controversial. In fact, the length of the washout period appears to be the most important factor associated with disease reactivation. It has been well shown that a washout period of less than 3 months is associated with a significantly lower risk of relapse. There is now a consensus for very short or no washout, i.e. starting the subsequent DMT 4 weeks after the last NTZ infusion. Interestingly, a tapered protocol, where participants received two injections of natalizumab at 6 and 14 weeks before switching to another DMT, was associated with a lower relapse rate compared with direct switching. Finally, regardless of the treatment and washout time chosen, the risk of carryover PML after discontinuing NTZ in JC virus-positive patients needs to be monitored with systematic MRI within 6 months of stopping.

- **Anti-CD20 agents**: In a retrospective study including 92 patients with RRMS, discontinuation of RTX for any reason was not associated with a risk of rebound or significant return of activity at 14 months of follow-up. In the study by Jouvenot et al, the risk of relapse in the year after discontinuation of RTX or OCR in people with MS over 50 years of age (n = 58) was similar (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.27–4.81, P = 0.852) to that of patients who continued this treatment. Thus, discontinuation of RTX and OCR may be considered in certain patients, particularly those who meet the age or disease stability criteria defined above.

### Sterol imbalances and cholesterol-24-hydroxylase dysregulation is linked to the underlying progression of multiple sclerosis [^1136k6HH]. Brain Pathology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: Sex is a key variable in the abundance of cholesterol and related sterols. We removed this variable to improve study power by selecting an all-female relapsing MS cohort (n = 32, mean age of onset = 33; range 16–50), mean age at lumbar puncture (LP) = 37.5 years (range 20–60) of patient-matched plasma and CSF samples. Plasma and CSF were captured at baseline before the initiation of disease-modifying treatment. Researchers performing the laboratory measurements were blinded until the analysis was complete. The expanded disability status scale (EDSS) at baseline and at follow-up (average between baseline and most recent EDSS: 90 months; range: 0–193) was collected as part of standard care. Capture of plasma and CSF followed standard protocol.

- **Post-mortem tissue**: Snap-frozen human brain tissue blocks were provided by the UK MS Society Tissue Bank (MSSTB) (Imperial College, London, UK) for MS tissue, and the Thomas Willis Brain Bank (Oxford University, Oxford, UK) for non-neurological control tissue, with appropriate ethical approval. All MS cases were confirmed as either secondary (SPMS) or primary (PPMS) progressive MS at the time of death (MS: n = 11; 7F; 1 PPMS, age at death: 38–67); (control: n = 8; 3F).

### Early use of high-efficacy therapies in multiple sclerosis in the United States: Benefits, barriers, and strategies for encouraging adoption [^115V3N9z]. Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, immune-mediated neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS). MS is traditionally categorized into clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS), and secondary progressive MS (SPMS), but there is increasing evidence that these subtypes form a continuous spectrum, with blurred boundaries between relapsing and progressive subtypes. MS disease activity and underlying neuroinflammation activity are typically indicated through clinical relapses, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity, and worsening disability.

Because inflammatory disease activity and irreversible neurodegeneration can occur early in the disease course, even before the first clinical event, early therapeutic intervention is recognized as giving the best long-term prognosis compared with delayed or no intervention. Despite this, many people with MS do not receive appropriate timely treatment, which can lead to poor disability outcomes. Selecting the optimal disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for newly diagnosed patients with MS is complex because our ability to precisely predict the MS disease course is limited. This is further complicated by drug-specific factors, such as mechanism of action, route of administration, dosing schedule, efficacy, and safety profile. Real-world evidence is emerging that early intervention with high-efficacy therapies (HETs) may provide the best opportunity to protect the CNS against irreversible injury and substantially mitigate the early inflammation.

### Chronotherapy using corticosteroids for multiple sclerosis relapses [^113SVmB7]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

The activity of the immune system displays a circadian rhythm. In diseases characterized by aberrant immune activity, chronotherapy — a treatment regimen tailored to diurnal body rhythms — may increase the efficiency, safety, and tolerability of drugs.

- **Aim**: To compare the outcomes of intravenous corticosteroid administration during the day or night for treatment of acute multiple sclerosis relapses.

- **Methods**: Seventeen patients with multiple sclerosis were included in the study. Clinical assessment of disability was performed at trial entry, and at days 7 and 30 from the initiation of treatment. Adverse events and preference for night-time versus daytime treatment were assessed at the end of the treatment course.

- **Results**: After night-time treatment, clinical recovery was significantly enhanced (p < 0.001), and the mean number of side effects was significantly lower (p = 0.007). Furthermore, most patients expressed a preference for night-time treatment over daytime treatment.

- **Conclusions**: The study suggests a potential benefit for the implementation of chronotherapy using steroid treatment for acute multiple sclerosis relapse, with implications for other immune-mediated disorders.

### Maximising therapeutic outcomes in patients failing on current therapy [^113YPxKr]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009).

The different immunomodulatory treatments available to patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis are only partially effective. Since these treatments are most effective in the early relapsing stage of the disease, it is important to adjust therapy in a timely fashion to fall within the window of opportunity when maximal benefit can be gained from a second-line treatment. Consensus guidelines have been established to define a sub-optimal treatment response.

Switching to another class of immunomodulatory therapy represents a logical treatment strategy in patients who fail to respond adequately to first-line treatments. Several observational studies have now shown such a strategy to be beneficial. Disease control can be improved following switching in patients with persistent relapse activity on first-line treatment. In patients experiencing intolerable side effects to first-line treatment, tolerability can be improved by switching without loss of disease control. In particular, a switch between different classes of immunomodulatory treatments seems to be more beneficial than switching within the same class.

Formal switching algorithms need to be developed to ensure that all patients who could benefit from such an approach are managed in a timely and optimal manner.

### Treatment trials in progressive MS — current challenges and future directions [^117N2QuY]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The introduction of immunomodulatory treatments has transformed the management of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) but has had no consistent benefit in progressive MS. Patients with primary or secondary progressive MS, therefore, face relentless functional decline that remains untreated. Clinical trials in progressive MS are clearly needed; however, their design and conduct are challenging and differ from trials in relapsing-remitting MS. Challenges include the reliable measurement of clinical progression, uncertainties about the natural history of progressive MS, and the unclear role of imaging outcomes, all of which impede optimal trial design.

Clinical trials in progressive MS have traditionally used time to a predefined change on the Expanded Disability Status Scale as their main outcome measure. This choice has significant consequences for trial duration and leads to the inclusion of only a highly selected minority of patients. Here, we review the approach to clinical trial design in progressive MS, outline key ongoing challenges, and suggest strategies to overcome such hurdles.

### Prednisone [^116K83Fe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week, followed by 80 mg every other day for one month, have been shown to be effective. The dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.

- **Alternate day therapy (ADT)**: ADT is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. This therapy aims to provide patients requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing undesired effects, such as pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children.

	- The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises:
	1. The anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effects of corticoids persist longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects.
	2. Administering the corticosteroid every other morning allows for the re-establishment of more normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on off-steroid days.

To better understand this rationale, a brief review of HPA physiology is helpful. The hypothalamus acts to maintain balance: a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH), while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally, the HPA system is characterized by a diurnal (circadian) rhythm, with serum levels of ACTH rising from a low point around 10 PM to a peak level around 6 AM.

### Corticosteroids and plasma exchange in multiple sclerosis [^111igh6o]. Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids (CS) remain a mainstay of treatment for relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) and optic neuritis. Currently, there is not enough evidence that long-term corticosteroid treatment delays the progression of long-term disability in patients with MS. Likewise, it is unclear whether there are true differences among the various CS agents, doses, and their applications in specific pulse and tapering regimens. In some patients suffering from severe steroid-resistant relapses, the clinical response to CS treatment may be insufficient. Such patients may obtain clinical benefit from subsequent plasma exchange (PE). PE is increasingly considered an individual treatment decision in patients with severe relapses not properly responding to CS. Due to the lack of appropriate studies, PE is not recommended as a permanent disease-modifying strategy in MS patients.

### Corticosteroids treatment [^116d1pwf]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2004). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids (Cs) are widely used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) acute relapses due to their potent immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties. For patients with relapsing-remitting (RR) MS, short-term administrations of Cs markedly reduce the severity of symptoms and promote faster recovery from clinical attacks. Chronic administrations of Cs significantly diminish the formation of T1 hypointense lesions and slow the progression of brain atrophy. For patients with secondary progressive MS, treatment with Cs delays the onset of sustained disability. Finally, the association between methylprednisolone and interferon beta (IFNbeta) enhances the recovery of active lesions to a greater extent and reduces the formation of neutralizing antibodies (NABs) against IFNbeta in patients with RRMS.

### Disease modifying therapies for relapsing multiple sclerosis [^112yZ5Le]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common, disabling, putatively autoimmune neurological disease with worldwide distribution. It typically begins as a relapsing disorder that later evolves into a secondary progressive phase. Inflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms seem to operate in both phases, but their relative contributions and interactions are incompletely understood. Disease modifying therapies (DMTs) approved for relapsing multiple sclerosis interfere with a variety of immunological mechanisms to reduce rates of relapse, accumulation of disease burden measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and decline in neurological function over the two to three-year duration of typical randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Benefits of a longer duration of therapy on disability are less clear, as data beyond three years are largely limited to observational studies. However, DMTs do not slow the accrual of disability once progressive multiple sclerosis is established. This review summarizes the evidence about the use of approved DMTs and examines how to individualize treatment despite the absence of validated biomarkers to guide drug selection. Methods such as stratifying patients based on estimated risk for future disability, weighing patient-specific factors and preferences, and using objective outcomes to adjudicate treatment success are discussed. Emerging drug therapies and strategies are also reviewed.

### Summary of evidence-based guideline: Complementary and alternative medicine in multiple sclerosis: Report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^114o4d8M]. Neurology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for multiple sclerosis, more specifically with respect to alternative and complementary therapies, AAN 2014 guidelines recommend considering counseling patients with MS regarding the following:

- **Ginkgo biloba is ineffective** for improving cognitive function but is possibly effective for reducing fatigue.

- **A low-fat diet with fish oil supplementation is probably ineffective** for reducing relapses, disability, or MRI lesions, or for improving fatigue or quality of life (QoL) in MS.

- **Lofepramine plus L-phenylalanine with vitamin B12, i.e. the Cari Loder regimen, is possibly ineffective** for treating disability, symptoms, depression, or fatigue.

- **Reflexology is possibly effective** for reducing paresthesia.

- **Bee sting therapy is possibly ineffective** for reducing relapses, disability, fatigue, total MRI lesion burden, new gadolinium-enhancing lesion volume, or health-related QoL.

- **Magnetic therapy is probably effective** for reducing fatigue and probably ineffective for reducing depression.

- **The safety and efficacy of other reviewed complementary and alternative medicine** or the interaction of complementary and alternative medicine with disease-modifying therapies for MS are unknown.

### Are statins a treatment option for multiple sclerosis [^1157p11y]. The Lancet Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment options for multiple sclerosis (MS) are limited. The immunomodulatory drugs interferon beta and glatiramer acetate are only partly effective in reducing the relapse rate, slowing disease progression, and diminishing the number and volume of lesions on MRI. Mitoxantrone, an immunosuppressant approved for the treatment of active forms of relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS, is dose-limited due to its potential cardiotoxicity. Therefore, identifying new effective therapeutic options with few side-effects is highly desirable.

- **Recent developments**: Evidence has emerged that statins, which are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, have immunomodulatory effects. Recent reports showed that statins prevent and reverse chronic and relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS. Furthermore, in vitro experiments with human immune cells have demonstrated an immunomodulatory profile of statins comparable to that of interferon beta. An open-label clinical trial of simvastatin for MS revealed a significant decrease in the number and volume of new MRI lesions and a favorable safety profile.

- **Where next**: The obvious advantage of statins over existing MS therapies is their oral route of dosing. Statins might be beneficial for MS patients as monotherapy or as an add-on to established disease-modifying drugs. As the evidence of the benefit of statins in MS is currently insufficient, large controlled clinical trials are needed. The first of these trials is about to start.

### Recent developments in multiple sclerosis therapeutics [^112v4Dho]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Clinically significant acute MS relapses are usually treated with high-dose, short-term, intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 3–5 days). This treatment shortens relapse duration but does not improve the degree of recovery or the long-term course of the disease. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS alter the course of the disease. They lower the clinical relapse rate, extend the time to the next relapse, and reduce the accumulation of new lesions on MRI, all of which are intended to decrease the long-term accumulation of disability.

The first approved DMT for MS, subcutaneous interferon beta-1b (IFNβ-1b, marketed as Betaseron in the United States and as Betaferon in Europe), was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for RRMS in 1993. This approval was based on a pivotal placebo-controlled trial in which treated subjects had significantly lower annualized relapse rates and more subjects were relapse-free after 2 years. IFNβ (interferon beta) acts as an anti-inflammatory agent and has several mechanisms of action, including reducing the production of pro-inflammatory IFNγ and TNFα, inhibiting T-cell activation and clonal expansion, modulating cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase production and release, and inhibiting T-cell migration and entry into the CNS.

### Oral prednisone taper following intravenous steroids fails to improve disability or recovery from relapses in multiple sclerosis [^115R4dY6]. European Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

A short course of intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) followed by oral prednisone taper (OPT) is often used for the treatment of relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS). We examined the effect of IVMP plus OPT compared with IVMP only on neurologic disability one year after treatment of a relapse in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

- **Methods**: Two hundred eighty-five consecutive relapses were analyzed in a retrospective fashion. One hundred fifty-two patients with a total of 171 relapses received IVMP plus an OPT at the time of relapse, while 112 patients who experienced 114 relapses received IVMP without OPT.

- **Results**: There was no difference between the two groups in the baseline characteristics as well as the mean or categorical EDSS at baseline, at the time of relapse confirmation, and at months 3, 6, and 12 after relapse confirmation.

- **Conclusion**: Our observations suggest that OPT following treatment with IVMP for an MS relapse does not lead to improved neurologic outcome after 12 months compared with treatment with IVMP only. Moreover, our findings raise concerns regarding the common practice of using OPT following IVMP. Further studies are indicated to validate our findings and minimize exposure to systemic corticosteroids, well known for systemic toxicity.

### Plasmapheresis and immunoadsorption in patients with steroid refractory multiple sclerosis relapses [^112Uw3M6]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Patients suffering from multiple sclerosis (MS) are treated with high-dose intravenous steroids during acute relapses. In cases of steroid refractory relapses, patients are treated with plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption. Data concerning the efficacy of both procedures remain scarce. Visual evoked potentials (VEP), visual acuity, and the degree of remission of deficits caused by relapses that led to admission in MS patients (n = 48) treated with PLEX, IA, or both in a single university center setting were evaluated retrospectively.

- **Grouped analysis**: In a grouped analysis of patients treated with combined PLEX/IA, PLEX, or IA alone, patients in all groups benefited as assessed by VEP. Visual acuity also showed a trend towards better performance, but this lacked statistical significance.

- **Subgroup analysis**: In a subgroup analysis concerning only patients with initially pathological VEP, there was a significant beneficial effect in the groups treated with PLEX/IA, as well as in the group summarizing all patients.

The combination of PLEX and IA provides a valid treatment option in steroid-refractory MS relapses, and IA should be considered in acute relapses, especially in patients experiencing side effects from PLEX.

### Oral versus intravenous steroids for treatment of relapses in multiple sclerosis [^11771Z2h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS), is characterized by relapses of CNS inflammation ranging from mild to severely disabling. Relapses have long been treated with steroids to reduce inflammation and hasten recovery. However, the commonly used intravenous methylprednisolone requires repeated infusions with the added costs of homecare or hospitalization and may interfere with daily responsibilities. Oral steroids have been used in place of intravenous steroids, with lower direct and indirect costs.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of oral versus intravenous steroids for MS relapses less than or equal to 6 weeks. Secondary comparisons included subsequent relapse rate, disability, ambulation, hospitalization, immunological markers, radiological markers, and quality of life.

- **Search strategy**: A literature search was performed using the Cochrane MS Group Trials Register (July 2008), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) "The Cochrane Library 2008, issue 3", MEDLINE (PubMed) (1966-July 2008), EMBASE (1980-July 2008), abstracts from meetings of the American Academy of Neurology (2002–2008), the European Federation of Neurological Sciences (2002–2008), the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis and American Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (2002–2008) handsearching. No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized or quasi-randomized trials comparing oral and intravenous steroids for acute relapses in multiple sclerosis were considered for inclusion.

### Steroid hormones in multiple sclerosis [^113uXj4G]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2005). Low credibility.

The possible influence of steroid hormones in multiple sclerosis (MS) has been a matter of great interest. A first illustration comes from the analysis of the influence of gender on susceptibility to MS and on MS severity. A series of arguments emerge in favor of a possible influence of steroid hormones in MS. The menstrual cycle, and even more so pregnancy, may influence the clinical evolution of MS. In the PRIMS study, there was a dramatic decrease in the relapse rate during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, with a rebound increase in the 3 months postpartum. Animal studies have provided further confirmatory results. Many experiments have shown that sex steroids may have immunological effects in preventing or treating experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. They could also affect myelinating and remyelinating the peripheral and possibly the central nervous system. These clinical and experimental data have led to the consideration of sexual steroids as potential therapeutic tools for preventing relapses in women with MS, particularly in the postpartum period.

### A changing treatment landscape for multiple sclerosis: Challenges and opportunities [^115SvX9z]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is primarily an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, but it also encompasses prominent neurodegenerative aspects. A significant proportion of MS patients will develop neurological disability over time. Until recently, treatment options have been limited. However, MS treatment is now at a stage of rapid progress, with several new drugs that have reached the market or will be launched in the near future. This provides new opportunities for individualized treatment, but also creates new challenges regarding the monitoring of disease activity, long-term safety issues, and efficacy, particularly in patients with progressive disease.

### Current and emerging disease-modulatory therapies and treatment targets for multiple sclerosis [^115fCNEc]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In most patients, MS starts as a relapsing–remitting disease (RRMS), which is termed clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) following a first bout of clinical symptoms. This is often preceded by a phase of subclinical disease activity that can be detected with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; yellow stars denote MRI signs of active inflammation). In later stages of RRMS, patients accumulate persistent disabilities, where recent evidence suggests that a progressive component may start soon after diagnosis (light grey).

This underlying progressive disease component becomes more pronounced at later stages, when the disease converts to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). The fact that inflammatory disease activity, as reflected by the frequency of bouts or MRI activity, diminishes over time suggests a shift from adaptive to innate or local disease mechanisms, which may explain the relative loss of efficacy of disease-modulatory treatments (DMT).

### Immunomodulators and immunosuppressants for progressive multiple sclerosis: A network meta-analysis [^115ZbhEP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common immune-mediated, chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). In 85% of affected individuals, the disease is characterized at onset by relapses followed by complete or partial recovery, known as the relapsing-remitting phase. These relapses correspond to the clinical expression of focal inflammation and subsequent loss of the myelin sheath surrounding axons in the CNS. Over time, a proportion of patients transition to a secondary progressive phase (SPMS), typically occurring 15 to 20 years after onset.

In about 10% to 15% of individuals with MS, the progressive course begins without preceding relapses, termed primary progressive MS (PPMS). Approximately 11% of individuals with PPMS and 40% of those with SPMS experience relapses during the disease course. However, new disease activity becomes less frequent over time, while microglial activation and neurodegeneration gain prominence.

### Progressive multiple sclerosis: Prospects for disease therapy, repair, and restoration of function [^117JY3Tt]. Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis is a major cause of neurological disability, which accrues predominantly during the progressive forms of the disease. Although the development of multifocal inflammatory lesions is the underlying pathological process in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, the gradual accumulation of disability that characterizes progressive multiple sclerosis seems to result more from diffuse immune mechanisms and neurodegeneration. As a result, the 14 anti-inflammatory drugs that have regulatory approval for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis have little or no efficacy in progressive multiple sclerosis without inflammatory lesion activity. Effective therapies for progressive multiple sclerosis that prevent worsening, reverse damage, and restore function are a major unmet need. In this series paper, we summarize the status of therapy for progressive multiple sclerosis and outline prospects for the future.

### Treatment of multiple sclerosis: A review [^112PkAjq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system and the leading cause of nontraumatic neurological disability in young adults. Effective management requires a multifaceted approach to control acute attacks, manage progressive worsening, and remediate bothersome or disabling symptoms associated with this illness.

Remarkable advances in the treatment of all forms of MS, especially for relapsing disease, have favorably changed the long-term outlook for many patients. There has also been a conceptual shift in understanding the immune pathology of MS, moving away from a purely T-cell-mediated model to recognizing that B cells have a key role in pathogenesis.

The emergence of higher-efficacy drugs requiring less frequent administration has made these preferred options in terms of tolerability and adherence. Many experts now recommend the use of these as first-line treatment for many patients with early disease, before permanent disability is evident.

### An argument for broad use of high efficacy treatments in early multiple sclerosis [^11752xWD]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Two different treatment paradigms are most often used in multiple sclerosis (MS). An escalation or induction approach is considered when treating a patient early in the disease course. An escalator prioritizes safety, whereas an inducer would favor efficacy. Our understanding of MS pathophysiology has evolved with novel in vivo and in vitro observations. The treatment landscape has also shifted significantly with the approval of over 10 new medications over the past decade alone. Here, we re-examine the treatment approach in light of these recent developments.

We believe that recent work suggests that early prediction of the disease course is fraught, the amount of damage to the brain that MS causes is underappreciated, and its impact on patient function oftentimes is underestimated. These concerns, coupled with the recent availability of agents that allow a better therapeutic effect without compromising safety, lead us to believe that initiating higher efficacy treatments early is the best way to achieve the best possible long-term outcomes for people with MS.

### EFNS guideline on treatment of multiple sclerosis relapses: Report of an EFNS task force on treatment of multiple sclerosis relapses [^112aEmss]. European Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Relapses, exacerbations, or attacks of multiple sclerosis are the dominating feature of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), but are also observed in patients with secondary progressive MS. High-dose methylprednisolone is the routine therapy for relapses at present, but other treatments are also in use. The objective of the task force was to review the literature on treatment of MS relapses to provide evidence-based treatment recommendations. A review was carried out on the literature with classification of evidence according to the EFNS guidelines for scientific task forces. Short-term, high-dose methylprednisolone treatment should be considered for the treatment of relapses of MS (level A recommendation). The optimal glucocorticoid treatment regimen, in terms of clinical efficacy and adverse events, remains to be established. A more intense, interdisciplinary rehabilitation program should be considered, as this probably further improves recovery after treatment with methylprednisolone (level B recommendation). Plasma exchange is probably efficacious in a subgroup of patients with severe relapses not responding to methylprednisolone therapy, and should be considered in this patient subgroup (level B recommendation). There is a need for further randomized, controlled trials to establish the optimal treatment regimen for relapses of MS.

### Immunological effects of methylprednisolone pulse treatment in progressive multiple sclerosis [^114Jzej5]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2014). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To investigate the effect of monthly oral methylprednisolone pulse treatment in progressive MS.

- **Methods**: Thirty progressive MS patients were treated with oral methylprednisolone every month. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.

- **Results**: Out of 102 leukocyte phenotypes investigated, 25 changed at nominal significance from baseline to week 12 (p < 0.05). After correction for multiple comparisons, we found 5 subpopulations that changed compared to baseline. No patterns suggested modulation of Th17 or TFH cells.

- **Conclusion**: Methylprednisolone pulse treatment has some effects on circulating immune cells but does not modulate markers of Th17 and TFH cell activity in progressive MS.

### Safety and efficacy of immunoadsorption versus plasma exchange in steroid-refractory relapse of multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndrome: A randomised, parallel-group, controlled trial [^116rjkmU]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Low credibility.

Plasma exchange (PE) constitutes the standard therapy for steroid-refractory relapse in multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndrome. Immunoadsorption (IA) is an alternative method of apheresis that selectively removes immunoglobulins (Ig) while preserving other plasma proteins. Although IA is regarded as a well-tolerated, low-risk procedure, high-level evidence for its efficacy is lacking. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether IA is superior to PE in patients with acute relapse of multiple sclerosis or clinically isolated syndrome who had insufficiently responded to high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (MP).

- **Methods**: Patients with acute relapse of multiple sclerosis or clinically isolated syndrome and without complete clinical remission of symptoms after at least one cycle of high-dose intravenous MP therapy were enrolled in our randomised, controlled, parallel-group, monocentric trial. Eligible patients were aged at least 12 years and had no clinical or laboratory signs of systemic infection. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either IA or PE. Patients in both groups received 5 treatments on 5 consecutive days. In the IA group, the 2.0-fold individual total plasma volume was processed on day 1, and the 2.5-fold on days 2–5. In the PE group, 2 liters of plasma (corresponding to the 0.69 ± 0.12-fold individual total plasma volume) were removed each day and substituted by 5% human albumin solution. Patients were followed up directly after the last apheresis as well as 2 and 4 weeks after the last treatment. The primary endpoint

### Immunomodulators and immunosuppressants for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: A network meta-analysis [^116z6BiD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Nine critical outcomes were identified by the Multiple Sclerosis Essential Medicines Panel appointed by the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation. These outcomes informed the review but were further differentiated into primary and secondary outcomes and assessed solely for certainty and efficacy/harm, in line with standard Cochrane methodology. The data underlying the review, from all nine outcomes, served as the evidence base for the MEMP guideline panel. This data was contextualized with the perspective of low-resource settings by considering further evidence related to other domains, in line with the GRADE Evidence to Decision Framework methodology. The MEMP recommendations were used as the basis of an application for the inclusion of disease-modifying treatments in the 23rd WHO Model List of Essential Medicines.

Many of the trials included in this review provided evidence on the proportion of participants who experienced new relapses, disability worsening, and adverse events over 12 or 24 months of follow-up. However, only five studies reported data on these outcomes over 36 months. Considering that MS is a chronic disease with a duration of 30 to 40 years, such findings limit the applicability of the available evidence for both efficacy and safety, particularly for long-term and uncommon adverse events.

Evidence relevant to 29 treatments considered in this review was derived from 50 studies involving 36,541 adult participants. Half of these studies (25/50; 17,294 participants) provided insights into the outcomes of concern.

### Overview of treatment options in multiple sclerosis [^1154ECpB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system that results in inflammation, demyelination, and axonal and neuronal loss. The typical course of MS is characterized by symptom exacerbations followed by periods of remission; however, patients will eventually accrue disability from these exacerbations. Several drugs, including interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, and fingolimod, have been shown to be effective in lowering relapse rates and slowing the progression of MS. For patients with a suboptimal response to medication, switching to another first- or second-line treatment can be an effective strategy.

Short-term high-dose corticosteroid treatment improves symptoms and short-term disability after an acute exacerbation of multiple sclerosis (MS), but it is unknown whether its long-term use can reduce the accumulation of disability.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy and safety of long-term corticosteroid use in MS.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the following bibliographic databases: CENTRAL (Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2007), and EMBASE (1980 to February 2007). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials, we searched reference lists and contacted trial authors and one pharmaceutical company.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered controlled, randomised trials (RCTs), with or without blinding, of long-term treatment (i.e. longer than 6 months) of any type of corticosteroid in MS, irrespective of disease course.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

- **Main results**: Three trials, all classified at high risk of bias, contributed to this review (Miller 1961; BPSM 1995; Zivadinov 2001), resulting in a total of 183 participants (91 treated). Corticosteroid therapy did not reduce the risk of being worse at the end of follow-up (odds ratio [OR] 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26 to 1.02), but there was substantial heterogeneity between studies (I²: 78.4%). Intravenous periodic high-dose methylprednisolone (MP) was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of disability progression at 5 years in relapsing patients.

### Corticosteroid treatment of multiple sclerosis relapses is associated with lower disability worsening over 5 years [^111BUn9i]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Corticosteroid treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses is assumed to improve the speed of relapse recovery, without modifying long-term disability risk. We aimed to re-evaluate this assumption in a large cohort of individuals with MS.

- **Methods**: Individuals with clinically definite MS and ≥ 3 Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) measurements over ≥ 12 months were identified within the international neuroimmunology registry MSBase. Individuals were required to have ≥ 1 relapse, with complete information on relapse treatment, phenotype, and severity for all documented relapses. The primary outcome was disability worsening confirmed over 12 months. The association of the cumulative number of steroid-treated and untreated relapses (as a time-varying exposure) with disability worsening was evaluated with Cox proportional hazards.

- **Results**: In total, 3673 individuals met the inclusion criteria (71% female, mean age 38 years, mean disability EDSS step 2); 5809 relapses (4671 treated/1138 untreated) were captured (annualized relapse rate 0.19). Over the study period (total 30175 person-years), 32.7% reached the outcome of confirmed disability worsening (median survival time 5.2 years). Non-treated relapses were associated with a higher risk of disability worsening (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.57 to 1.88) than steroid-treated relapses (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.43 to 1.57). This association was modified by the efficacy of disease-modifying therapy at the time of relapse.

- **Conclusions**: Our results suggest that a lack of steroid treatment of MS relapses is associated with a higher risk of disability worsening.

### Reconsidering clinical outcomes in multiple sclerosis: relapses, impairment, disability and beyond [^114zoyJV]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2008). Low credibility.

There is an increasing number of clinical trials testing new compounds which act at different stages of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). To prove their effectiveness, several clinical outcome measures are used. The overall quality of clinical trials is increasing steadily due to the growing experience in this area, the increasing awareness of quality standards in the MS community, and the more stringent requirements of regulatory authorities for approval of new treatments. Each successful clinical trial provides additional information that could be incorporated into the design of subsequent studies to improve their quality. However, the choice of appropriate outcome measures still presents major challenges. For an individual patient, improvement or stability of their disability and, to a lesser extent, the relapse rate, are the main targets of treatment. As there is yet no scale or assessment which objectively covers all major issues, it is recommended to use multiple instruments and endpoints as secondary outcome measures.

### Other therapy options and future strategies for treating patients with multiple sclerosis [^112ffHxn]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Research into therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS) is advancing rapidly, with FDA-approved treatment options specifically targeting the inflammatory phase of MS. However, drugs not approved by the FDA are routinely used to treat MS. One example is corticosteroids, commonly employed for acute relapses. Other drugs frequently used for patients not responding to FDA-approved agents include methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and pulse steroids.

Drugs being studied as potential therapeutic agents include statins, mycophenolate mofetil, various monoclonal antibodies (e.g. alemtuzumab, daclizumab, natalizumab, and rituximab), antibiotics, antivirals, and the pregnancy hormone estriol. Disease-modifying agents (DMAs) that promote remyelination could prevent long-term disability, and such agents are under active investigation (e.g. IV immunoglobulin G and stem cell transplantation).

Combination therapy with DMAs possessing different mechanisms of action may offer future advantages in providing optimal treatment that delays disability progression while promoting repair and remyelination.

### Current approved options for treating patients with multiple sclerosis [^116vTJ4x]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS), a neurologic disorder that affects 400,000 persons in the United States, consists of an inflammatory phase and a neurodegenerative phase. Treatment options now approved by the FDA specifically target the inflammatory phase of MS and include immunomodulators (i.e. interferon betas and glatiramer acetate) and an immunosuppressant, mitoxantrone. This article discusses the methods of monitoring disease progression using disability scales and MRI and reviews the clinical efficacy and tolerability of the FDA-approved therapies. All of the immunomodulators are approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS. Only mitoxantrone is approved for the treatment of worsening relapsing-remitting MS, secondary progressive MS, and progressive-relapsing MS. Early treatment with these disease-modifying agents is desirable to reduce the progression of the disease and to limit long-term disability.

### Sterol imbalances and cholesterol-24-hydroxylase dysregulation is linked to the underlying progression of multiple sclerosis [^112QQhrH]. Brain Pathology (2025). High credibility.

The progressive accumulation of disability experienced by most people with multiple sclerosis (MS) is underpinned by a combination of inflammatory lesions and neurodegeneration. Monitoring and modifying MS progression is hampered by an incomplete understanding of underlying biological mechanisms. Cholesterol, its metabolites, and the enzyme CYP46A1 — responsible for cholesterol turnover in the brain — are considered important fluid and imaging biomarkers, as well as potential treatment targets, for a wide range of neurological conditions, including MS.

Statins have pleiotropic effects, modulating inflammatory, oligodendrocyte, and neuronal processes. Simvastatin, a brain-penetrant statin, has been shown to reduce the rate of whole brain atrophy and aspects of neuropsychiatric dysfunction in secondary progressive MS when given at a high dose. This supports growing evidence that the balance between cholesterol synthesis and metabolism is important to biological processes underpinning the progressive accumulation of disability. However, recently, high-dose simvastatin was found to be ineffective in modifying confirmed disability progression in a larger cohort.

### New horizons for multiple sclerosis therapy: 2025 and beyond [^111ZAGks]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

The advances achieved against multiple sclerosis (MS) represent one of the great success stories of modern molecular medicine. The development of therapies with increasing selectivity and safety, guided by gains in understanding the fundamental immunology, neurobiology, genetics, and triggers of this disease, has broadened the traditional focus on treatment, adding realistic possibilities for prevention and repair. Here, we summarize recent advances that have collectively transformed the disease from the most common crippler of young adults in the Western world to its current status as a condition where most newly diagnosed patients can anticipate lives free from disability.

### Copp-ms: Corticosteroids during the post-partum in relapsing multiple sclerosis patients [^111NavTq]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

No specific treatment has demonstrated its effectiveness in preventing post-partum relapses in women with multiple sclerosis (MS).

- **Objective**: To assess the effectiveness of preventive high-dose corticosteroids in the post-partum period by comparing two strategies: (1) no preventive treatment and (2) standardized preventive treatment.

- **Methods**: We selected five French Multiple Sclerosis centers using the same post-partum strategy for their patients — either high-dose steroids (treating centers TC) or no treatment (non-treating centers NTC). We included women with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who delivered between January 2007 and January 2017. Our primary outcomes were the time from delivery to first relapse, EDSS progression, and MRI activity between patients of treating centers and non-treating centers, after propensity-score weighting.

- **Results**: Three hundred fifty patients were included (116 from treating centers, 234 from non-treating centers). For both groups, the annualized relapse rate decreased during pregnancy (0.28 in treating centers and 0.34 in non-treating centers during the third trimester) and increased during the first post-partum trimester (0.45 and 0.69, respectively), with 11% and 14% (NS) of patients facing at least one relapse, respectively. Our primary outcomes were not statistically different between both groups.

- **Conclusion**: This study provides class III evidence that systematic high-dose corticosteroids are not associated with a reduced inflammatory activity during the post-partum period in multiple sclerosis patients.

### Mechanisms of glucocorticoids in the control of neuroinflammation [^114XgLFJ]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used to treat inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). They predominantly act through the GC receptor, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that controls transcription by several different mechanisms. Owing to its ubiquitous expression, there are a variety of cell types that could serve as GC targets in the pathogenesis and treatment of MS. This brings about a great diversity of mechanisms potentially involved in the modulation of neuroinflammation by GCs, including the induction of apoptosis, repression of pro-inflammatory mediators, and the expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells.

Nevertheless, it is not well understood which of these mechanisms are essential for therapeutic efficacy. In this review, we summarize findings concerning the actions of GCs in MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and also elucidate concepts and developments that pertain to this clinically highly relevant treatment regimen.

### Multiple sclerosis: Time for early treatment with high-efficacy drugs [^113TuRYF]. Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

This review addresses changes in the approach to treating patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The widely practiced approach of utilizing agents with lower treatment efficacy (LETA) at onset with subsequent escalation has been challenged by new data suggesting that MS patients derive greater benefit when therapy is initiated with high-efficacy treatment agents (HETA). Several recent studies compared treatment efficacy and safety of early administration of HETA versus LETA. Results of randomized, double-blind, phase III studies with LETA as a control arm, along with population-based larger and longer studies using propensity scoring, marginal structural modeling, and weighted cumulative exposure analysis, support the benefit of early treatment with HETA. Patients initiating their treatment with HETA, regardless of prognostic factors and MRI burden at baseline, showed significantly lower annualized relapse rate (ARR) and reduced disability progression in follow-up periods of up to 10–15 years. Moreover, the safety profile of recently approved HETA ameliorates concerns about off-target effects associated with a number of earlier high-efficacy drugs. Patient perception has also changed, with an increasing preference for medication profiles that both improve symptoms and prevent disease progression. Accumulating data from randomized studies and results of large population-based studies demonstrating short-term and longer-term patient benefits support the view that HETA should be more widely used. The adoption of early treatment with HETA capitalizes on a window of opportunity to optimize patient outcomes.

### Multiple sclerosis: Preventing progression and disability in MS-when to treat [^117NVS86]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

In relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis, conversion to the progressive stage is thought to be influenced by early relapses. Despite a new study suggesting that relapses do not drive long-term disability, and proposing the latency period as an ideal target for therapeutic intervention, the relapsing phase remains a relevant treatment window.

### Current and emerging disease-modulatory therapies and treatment targets for multiple sclerosis [^113DBz2w]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory, demyelinating, and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS), affects approximately 2.5 million people worldwide, with a significant societal economic impact and high burden for patients and their relatives [1, 2, 3]. MS reduces life expectancy by 7–14 years, with infections and suicide being important contributors, though there are trends for a closing gap to the general population [2, 4]. The typical disease onset occurs in the third and fourth decades of life, with women being affected two to three times more often than men. MS is also more frequent among people of European descent, particularly those residing at higher latitudes, where the prevalence can exceed 200 per 100,000 [5].

- **Genetic and environmental influences**: MS disease risk is affected by complex gene–environment interactions, where allelic variants in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, history of infection with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)/mononucleosis, smoking, and low sun exposure/vitamin D levels have the greatest impact (for references, see [6]). The complexity of these interactions likely also explains a high degree of heterogeneity in disease characteristics across individuals, although factors regulating disease severity are still largely unknown [7].

- **MS disease phenotypes**: Three major MS disease phenotypes are traditionally recognized: relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS), and primary progressive MS (PPMS) [1, 2]. Most patients present with RRMS, characterized by at least partly reversible episodes of neurological deficits.

### Immunomodulators and immunosuppressants for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a network meta-analysis [^111JTtmh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the brain and spinal cord resulting from a complex interaction between genetic background and environmental factors. Its pathophysiology encompasses several pathological processes, including immune system dysregulation, demyelination, remyelination, microglial activation, and chronic neuroaxonal loss.

In most patients, the clinical course is initially characterized by attacks of neurological dysfunction, with or without residual deficits. MS has been traditionally viewed as a two-stage disease, with early inflammation responsible for the initial relapsing-remitting (RR) course and delayed neurodegeneration causing secondary disability progression. However, more recent evidence has shown a pathological continuum between the relapsing and progressive phases, with active ongoing inflammation and demyelination, which can also be seen in end-stage MS. Conversely, neurodegeneration and neuronal loss leading to brain atrophy have also been observed in the earlier stages of the disease, at least in some cases, as demonstrated by the high prevalence of a certain degree of cognitive impairment even at disease onset.

### Sex hormones, brain damage and clinical course of multiple sclerosis [^115Nuovz]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

There is evidence that gender influences the clinical course of multiple sclerosis (MS). Symptom prevalence, as well as characteristics, differ between the sexes. These differences can be at least partly explained by gender differences in the characteristics of tissue damage and disease progression measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The interaction between sex hormones and MS damage, supported by both MRI and clinical evidence, seems to play an important role in the clinical and sub-clinical gender bias in MS. Experimental data directly testing the effects of sex hormones on brain damage and their clinical relevance show that sex hormones have the potential to exert anti-inflammatory and protective effects on brain tissue. Both data in experimental models and patient studies discussed in this review encourage a gender-based approach to MS.
