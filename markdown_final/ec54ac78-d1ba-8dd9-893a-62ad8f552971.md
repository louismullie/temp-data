## Question

What is the prognosis for a patient with acetabular dysplasia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the prognosis for a patient with acetabular dysplasia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the spectrum of acetabular dysplasia and how prognosis differs by severity and stability. Then, I should verify the natural history without treatment, especially progression to osteoarthritis. Next, I will examine how age at diagnosis and treatment timing modify outcomes. After that, I need to review treatment-specific prognoses for nonoperative care, closed reduction, open reduction, and joint-preserving osteotomies. Finally, I will consider special populations, residual dysplasia, and long-term arthroplasty outcomes, and synthesize a practical prognostic framework with counseling points and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the disease spectrum and why prognosis varies. Acetabular dysplasia spans mild, stable forms with subtle undercoverage to unstable, subluxed, or frankly dislocated hips; borderline dysplasia typically uses a lateral center-edge angle around 18–25°, whereas frank dysplasia is generally LCEA less than 20°, and instability correlates with extrusion indices and Tönnis angles, all of which influence mechanical loading and cartilage fate over time [^eb9e7b5f] [^6a50101a] [^b4e95eb2].

> I need to check the natural history without treatment. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence linking dysplasia to osteoarthritis. Classic longitudinal cohorts and reviews show that stable dysplasia with LCEA less than 20° almost invariably progresses to osteoarthritis by middle age, and unstable dysplasia with subluxation progresses even faster; exceptions are rare, reinforcing a strong causal relationship and a poor untreated prognosis in most patients [^47da909d] [^678d0177]. Hold on, I should also confirm comparative data: in a long-term contralateral-hip model, DDH hips progressed to THA more rapidly than FAI or normal hips, with approximately two-thirds requiring arthroplasty by 20 years, underscoring accelerated degeneration in dysplasia [^b4e95eb2].

> Next, I should review how age at diagnosis and treatment timing change outcomes. Early detection and treatment in infancy, when acetabular remodeling potential is greatest, yield the best prognosis; delayed treatment after walking age increases risks of residual dysplasia, osteonecrosis, and early arthritis, and late-presenting dislocations carry the worst prognosis with high failure rates and early degenerative change [^0eda4a59] [^c0163aa0] [^871b1ce1]. Let me consider a specific example: in a long-term study of closed reduction, higher acetabular index and older age at reduction independently predicted poor outcomes at skeletal maturity, supporting early intervention thresholds and vigilant surveillance for residual dysplasia [^adc4a8a3].

> I will now examine nonoperative management in infants. For stable dysplasia or mild instability detected in the first 6 months, Pavlik harness or similar bracing achieves high success with low complication rates when applied correctly; however, I should double-check that overtreatment can occur, and some ultrasound abnormalities resolve spontaneously, so shared decision-making and close follow-up are essential to balance benefit and harm [^0eda4a59] [^6554a10b]. But wait, what if the hip is dislocated at rest or irreducible? In those cases, harness failure is common and timely closed or open reduction is indicated to avoid prolonged nonconcentric loading and poor remodeling [^68d6d4de].

> Let me consider closed reduction and spica casting outcomes. Prospective multicenter data show about 91% initial success for closed reduction, but 9% fail and require open reduction, and 11% need later corrective surgery for residual dysplasia; importantly, older age at closed reduction predicts more secondary procedures, and osteonecrosis risk persists, though improved abduction protocols have reduced rates in contemporary series [^f5853f6d] [^ba41f65c]. Hold on, I should verify long-term implications: even after successful closed reduction, residual acetabular dysplasia is common and may persist into adolescence, necessitating ongoing surveillance and readiness for secondary osteotomy if indices fail to normalize [^adc4a8a3].

> Next, I should review open reduction outcomes. In the largest prospective multicenter series to date, open reduction carried a 7% re-dislocation risk, 44% proximal femoral growth disturbance, and 55% residual acetabular dysplasia at short-term follow-up; concomitant pelvic osteotomy halved the rate of residual dysplasia, highlighting the importance of addressing both femoral and acetabular sides when instability is complex [^e56b21eb]. I need to ensure I note that these adverse outcomes are higher than many historical reports, likely reflecting rigorous, standardized radiographic review and prospective ascertainment, which better reflects real-world expectations [^e56b21eb].

> Now, I should evaluate joint-preserving osteotomies in adolescents and young adults. Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) is the cornerstone for symptomatic dysplasia with preserved joint space; long-term data show approximately 75–85% 10-year survival and about 36–60% 20-year survival free of conversion to THA, with median survival around 16 years, and better outcomes when performed before age 40 with no or mild osteoarthritis [^d391f7c7] [^557362c3]. Wait, let me verify the impact of preoperative arthritis: multicenter modeling demonstrates a sharp increase in progression to THA when preoperative Tönnis grade is 2 versus 0–1, reinforcing strict selection criteria and the penalty of delaying surgery until advanced degeneration [^557362c3]. I should also note that rotational acetabular osteotomy shows durable 20–30 year results in selected patients, with 30-year survival around 50% overall and substantially better in pre-osteoarthritis cohorts, supporting joint-preservation strategies in appropriately selected hips [^e7f638d8] [^39764f8d].

> Let me think about residual dysplasia after childhood treatment and its prognosis. Even after successful reduction, a substantial minority develop persistent acetabular dysplasia that may progress to pain and early arthritis; MRI and radiographic follow-up can identify at-risk hips, and contemporary series suggest that persistent labral inversion or abnormal cartilage signals after closed reduction correlate with residual dysplasia, though evidence quality varies and protocols differ [^7b5c783d] [^2fcc079f]. I should confirm that pediatric orthopedic literature supports a low threshold for secondary osteotomy when acetabular indices remain abnormal beyond age 2–3 years, as remodeling potential wanes and mechanical instability persists [^f2a4457e].

> I need to check special populations and modifiers. Borderline dysplasia behaves differently; arthroscopy can yield satisfactory mid-term outcomes in carefully selected patients with LCEA 18–25° when instability is addressed and capsular management is meticulous, but isolated arthroscopy does not correct biomechanics and should not be viewed as disease-modifying for dysplasia, so patient selection and counseling are critical [^d05a3403] [^10360522]. Hold on, I should verify that combined arthroscopy and PAO can be considered when intra-articular pathology coexists; mid-term data show good pain and function gains, though a meaningful minority remain symptomatic or convert to arthroplasty, again emphasizing the need for strict indications [^d1467b41]. In patients over 40, PAO can still be effective if preoperative arthritis is mild and function is good, but failure risk rises with Tönnis grade 2 or poor baseline scores, so expectations must be tempered and individualized [^7c48be27].

> Next, I should review long-term arthroplasty outcomes when joint preservation fails. Total hip arthroplasty in dysplasia is technically demanding due to bone deficiency and altered anatomy, yet modern techniques yield encouraging long-term results; for example, cemented cups with impaction grafting show approximately 7% revision at 15–20 years, and uncemented constructs with augmentation demonstrate promising mid-term survival, though outcomes vary by defect severity and surgical approach [^922c7602] [^3eb1dbdf]. I should confirm that patients with dysplasia often present younger, so implant longevity and activity demands are crucial counseling points, and contemporary bearing surfaces and fixation strategies are preferred when feasible [^3eb1dbdf].

> Let me synthesize a practical prognostic framework. Untreated or undertreated acetabular dysplasia carries a high risk of early osteoarthritis and disability, with progression accelerated in unstable hips; prognosis is best when diagnosed in infancy and managed with stable, concentric reduction, whereas delayed treatment after walking age yields higher risks of residual dysplasia, osteonecrosis, and early arthritis; in skeletally mature patients, PAO and related osteotomies can preserve the joint for decades in appropriately selected patients, but preoperative arthritis is the strongest predictor of failure; borderline dysplasia may respond to arthroscopy when instability is mild, but biomechanical correction remains the definitive approach for durable joint preservation [^47da909d] [^b4e95eb2] [^557362c3] [^d05a3403]. Hold on, I should verify that counseling should also address contralateral hip risk: after unilateral PAO, about half develop contralateral pain and one-third require contralateral surgery within 5 years, so surveillance and early discussion of bilateral disease are prudent [^a3c36240].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and research gaps. High-quality randomized data comparing screening strategies, brace protocols, and surgical approaches are limited; long-term prospective cohorts are strengthening but still heterogeneous; and we lack robust biomarkers or imaging predictors to personalize prognosis beyond radiographic severity and age. Until stronger evidence emerges, shared decision-making, longitudinal follow-up, and timely escalation to joint-preserving surgery when indicated remain the cornerstones of optimizing prognosis in acetabular dysplasia [^c68caf56] [^a2271802] [^d391f7c7].

Acetabular dysplasia carries a **poor prognosis without treatment**, with a high risk of early osteoarthritis and hip replacement by middle age [^47da909d] [^b4e95eb2]. Early diagnosis and **timely intervention** — especially in infancy — markedly improve outcomes, whereas delayed treatment increases the risk of persistent dysplasia, osteonecrosis, and arthritis [^0eda4a59] [^c0163aa0]. In adolescents and adults, periacetabular osteotomy can delay or prevent arthritis in carefully selected patients, but outcomes depend on age, joint status, and deformity severity [^557362c3] [^9321edde]. Even after successful childhood treatment, residual dysplasia and late arthritis can occur, so **long-term surveillance is essential** [^adc4a8a3] [^3dd713e9].

---

## Natural history and progression

Untreated acetabular dysplasia leads to **early osteoarthritis** due to abnormal joint mechanics and cartilage overload [^47da909d] [^678d0177]. Studies show that patients with dysplasia often develop osteoarthritis decades earlier than those with normal hips, with many requiring total hip arthroplasty (THA) by middle age [^b4e95eb2] [^47da909d]. The risk is highest in **unstable dysplasia** (subluxation or dislocation) and in those with severe morphological abnormalities (e.g. lateral center-edge angle < 20°) [^47da909d] [^b4e95eb2].

---

## Prognostic factors influencing outcomes

Several factors **significantly influence prognosis**:

| **Factor** | **Impact on prognosis** |
|-|-|
| Age at diagnosis and treatment | Earlier treatment (especially in infancy) significantly improves outcomes; delayed treatment increases risk of persistent dysplasia and osteoarthritis [^0eda4a59] [^c0163aa0] |
| Severity of dysplasia | Severe dysplasia (e.g. LCEA < 20°, acetabular index > 30°) is associated with higher risk of residual dysplasia, osteonecrosis, and early osteoarthritis [^47da909d] [^b4e95eb2] |
| Presence of osteoarthritis | Pre-existing osteoarthritis at the time of treatment significantly worsens prognosis and increases the likelihood of early THA [^557362c3] [^7c48be27] |
| Treatment method | Closed reduction with Pavlik harness is effective in infants, but open reduction or osteotomy may be required for severe cases; PAO is effective in adolescents and adults to delay or prevent arthritis [^0eda4a59] [^557362c3] |
| Residual dysplasia | Persistent dysplasia after treatment increases the risk of late osteoarthritis and the need for secondary procedures [^adc4a8a3] [^f2a4457e] |

---

## Long-term outcomes and complications

Long-term outcomes vary with treatment timing and severity. With early, effective treatment, many patients have **good function and delayed arthritis**, though residual dysplasia and late osteoarthritis can still occur [^3dd713e9] [^adc4a8a3]. Complications include **osteonecrosis of the femoral head**, redislocation, and chronic hip pain, which are more common with delayed or inadequate treatment [^ba41f65c] [^e56b21eb].

---

## Impact of treatment timing and methods

Early diagnosis and treatment — particularly in infancy — are critical for optimal outcomes [^0eda4a59]. Pavlik harness treatment in infants is highly effective for stable dysplasia, with success rates exceeding 90% in many series [^68d6d4de]. For older children or adults, **PAO** is the preferred joint-preserving procedure, with 10-year survival rates around 75–85% and 20-year survival around 36–60% [^d391f7c7] [^6a50101a]. PAO is most effective in patients younger than 40 with mild osteoarthritis and good joint congruency [^9321edde] [^557362c3].

---

## Quality of life and functional outcomes

Untreated or undertreated dysplasia significantly impairs quality of life, causing chronic pain, limited mobility, and early disability [^4d411868]. Effective treatment — especially when delivered early — improves pain, function, and quality of life, though some patients may require ongoing management or secondary procedures [^6ba2a1f0] [^d1467b41].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Acetabular dysplasia has a **poor prognosis without treatment**, with a high risk of early osteoarthritis and disability. Early diagnosis and appropriate intervention — particularly in infancy — dramatically improve outcomes. Long-term surveillance is essential because residual dysplasia and late arthritis can occur even after successful childhood treatment. In adolescents and adults, PAO can preserve joint function and delay arthritis, but patient selection and timing are critical [^557362c3] [^9321edde].

### How to choose the right patient for correction of acetabular dysplasia after skeletal maturity [^e13ed6cb]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2013). Low credibility.

The "how to" of surgical correction of acetabular dysplasia has been well described. However, choosing the hip that is suitable for surgery can often be the biggest challenge. What we and our patients want to know is whether their hip is a good candidate for a joint-preserving surgery and will that surgery yield a long-lasting result. The problem of hip dysplasia spans the entire age spectrum and the treatments vary highly based upon age and skeletal maturity. This paper is presented as part of the POSNA 1-day hip course from the 2012 meeting and is an effort to present current thinking and the literature regarding patient selection for, and outcomes after surgical correction of acetabular dysplasia in the skeletally mature patient.

### Risk factors for misdiagnosis in children with developmental dysplasia of the hip: a retrospective single centre study [^c0163aa0]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is one of the common congenital disorders in paediatric orthopaedics. It ranges from mild acetabular dysplasia to complete hip dislocation. The incidence of DDH varies in different countries and regions, ranging from 1‰ to 34‰.

Early treatment is the key to improving the prognosis of DDH in children. Delayed treatment will not only complicate the treatment, but lead to poor prognosis and early occurrence of degenerative hip disease.DDH diagnosed late after the age of 8 years tends to perform poorly at open reduction of the hip, so it remains highly controversial whether to perform the reduction in these patients.

Children with DDH often lack typical clinical manifestations. Additionally, some are asymptomatic and can only be detected by hip screening. Even children with an early hip physical examination may be easily missed. Ziegler et al found that compared with hip ultrasound screening, the rate of false negative results of neonatal hip physical examination was 55.6%. Since the level of public health development in China still has a particular gap compared with developed countries. Many regions have not established a good screening system for DDH. Therefore, children with DDH who do not participate in hip ultrasound screening will inevitably have some misdiagnoses during hospital visits. In clinical work, we have also encountered many children who were misdiagnosed at the first visit, which caused some children to miss the best treatment time. This study aimed to examine the risk factors of misdiagnosis at the first visit in children with DDH who did not participate in hip ultrasound screening. To provide a scientific basis for reducing the misdiagnosis rate and promoting early diagnosis of children with DDH.

### Magnetic resonance imaging follow-up can screen for soft tissue changes and evaluate the short-term prognosis of patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip after closed reduction [^2fcc079f]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

This study has some limitations. First, the sample size in the RAD group and the normal acetabular group included in this study was small, and the diagnostic efficiency was insufficient. It is necessary to further increase the number of patients in each group in the future. Second, the follow-up time of the patients after CR was uneven and relatively short, without follow-up until the patients grew up, and the outcome of the condition of the patients was unknown. The follow-up time of the normal acetabular group is longer than that of the RAD group, so there may be some patients in the RAD whose OAI returned to normal with time. Therefore, it is necessary to continue long-term follow-up in these patients to observe the outcome. Lastly, the use of MRI repeatedly in young children is impractical in the clinical setting because of compliance, need for anesthesia, and expenses; therefore, it is very difficult to perform MRI examinations universally.

### Is there a role for acetabular dysplasia correction in an asymptomatic patient? [^cd273db7]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Childhood hip dysplasia is best treated in infancy or early childhood with hopes that the acetabulum will be completely normalized by nonoperative treatment methods, which may include Pavlik and brace treatment as well as formal closed reduction and hip spica casting. In many cases, this ideal result cannot be achieved and the child is left with residual dysplasia, which is often not symptomatic. Other patients may present late with hip dysplasia that is not identified in early childhood. Some develop hip pain with no prior known hip problem. Other children have asymptomatic dysplasia that is picked up on an incidental radiograph. The orthopaedic literature is clear regarding the need for corrective hip osteotomies in symptomatic children. Surgery to correct asymptomatic hip dysplasia remains controversial.

Methods

Children who have no symptoms yet have abnormal radiographs present a puzzling circumstance. In these cases, surgeons need to use quoted radiographic normal values for acetabular coverage of the femoral head as well as long-term natural history studies to decide whether to proceed with a corrective acetabular osteotomy. Long-term follow-up studies confirm that even patients with borderline dysplasia are likely to have significant hip symptoms and arthritis by middle age.

Results

Many children and adolescents with asymptomatic residual hip dysplasia should have corrective acetabular procedures performed. Surgery is more easily performed with more predictable results when the child is younger than 8 years.

Conclusions

It is impossible to state with certainty which children with residual radiographic hip dysplasia, but without symptoms, should have a corrective acetabular osteotomy. Review of the literature confirms that many patients have been undertreated in the past, with a high percentage of children with borderline hip dysplasia developing premature arthritis in early to mid-adult life. Current data suggest that surgery should be performed in borderline cases. Skill of the surgeon in performing acetabular osteotomies and/or ease of referral to a treatment center may temper the timing of such decisions.

### Magnetic resonance imaging follow-up can screen for soft tissue changes and evaluate the short-term prognosis of patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip after closed reduction [^301291ce]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders in children, and some patients may develop hip osteoarthritis in early adulthood and already require joint replacement. The treatment of DDH is determined by the age at initial diagnosis, degree of hip dislocation, and initial therapeutic effects. Patients with DDH between 6 and 24 months or with failed Pavlik harness treatment within 6 months are treated with either conservative or surgical treatment modalities, such as closed reduction (CR) with spica casting and femoral osteotomies. CR and spica casting are the most utilized conservative treatment.

The patient needs an intraoperative X-ray arthrography to evaluate whether CR is successful and to detect abnormal soft tissue structures in the hip, such as hypertrophied acetabular cartilage, narrowed capsule, and labral inversion. A plain pelvic film was typically used for follow-up after CR. However, X-ray films cannot evaluate the alignment of the acetabulum and the femoral head accurately nor observe the changes in soft tissue structures of the hip directly. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has no radiation and can clearly show the soft tissue and osseous structures of the hip joint, and its use in DDH detection and follow-up has been increasing.

Currently, it is debated whether the abnormal soft tissue structures in the hip of DDH patients can hinder CR and affect the outcome. Renshaw et al. found that "false reduction", where reduction was achieved immediately after CR but eventually the hip joint became unstable due to obstruction of soft tissue structures, can occur in some patients. However, Druschel et al. believed that abnormalities of soft tissue structures did not affect the success of CR.

Initially, it is often impossible to obtain a concentric reduction in the affected hip after CR. Complete relocation is achieved when the femoral head reaches the bottom of the acetabulum. Some authors believe that complete relocation may increase the risk of femoral head necrosis, which may be caused by increased pressure in the hip joint after reduction or due to damage to the blood supply of the femoral head when performing CR. In addition, risk factors for residual acetabular dysplasia (RAD) after CR are also being studied extensively. Some authors believe that the cartilaginous/osseous acetabular index, cartilaginous/osseous central-edge angle, the shape of the acetabular load area, and the abnormal high signal intensity on T2WI of acetabular cartilage are risk factors for RAD.

### Editorial commentary: hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement in patients with borderline dysplasia does not result in inferior outcomes compared with outcomes in patients without dysplasia: Do not fear [^f503bc63]. Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

The treatment of adult borderline hip dysplasia remains challenging and continues to be a subject of controversy. The preferred treatment for hip instability and acetabular undercoverage is periacetabular osteotomy. However, patients with painful hips and associated femoroacetebular impingement, microinstability, or no instability may benefit from arthroscopic surgery. Short-term studies have reported favorable clinical outcomes. Traditionally, the lateral center-edge angle was used to determine hip dysplasia. More recently the femoro-epiphyseal acetabular roof (FEAR) index was introduced as a measure for borderline dysplasia. In general, a FEAR index of less than 5° indicates hip instability. When using a FEAR index of more than 2° as a cut-off for hip instability and borderline dysplasia, arthroscopic hip surgery can achieve very similar clinical outcomes to patients with a FEAR index of less than 2°. However low and unequal sample sizes have potentially resulted in both type I and II errors, reducing internal study validity. Although this may be a step in the right direction, further high-quality studies are required to understand patients' characteristics on diagnosis, prognosis, outcomes of surgical interventions, and long-term disease progression for adult borderline hip dysplasia.

### The John charnley award: redefining the natural history of osteoarthritis in patients with hip dysplasia and impingement [^b4e95eb2]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Structural hip deformities including developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) are thought to predispose patients to degenerative joint changes. However, the natural history of these malformations is not clearly delineated.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Among patients undergoing unilateral THA who have a contralateral hip without any radiographic evidence of hip disease, what is the natural history and progression of osteoarthritis in the native hip based on morphological characteristics? (2) Among patients undergoing unilateral THA who have a contralateral hip without any radiographic evidence of hip disease, what are the radiographic parameters that predict differential rates of degenerative change?

Methods

We identified every patient 55 years of age or younger at our institution who received unilateral primary THA from 1980 to 1989 (n = 722 patients). Preoperative radiographs were reviewed on the contralateral hip and only hips with Tönnis Grade 0 degenerative change that had minimum 10-year radiographic followup were included. A total of 172 patients met all eligibility criteria with the following structural diagnoses: 48 DDH, 74 FAI, and 40 normal morphology, and an additional 6% (10 of the 172 patients) met all eligibility criteria but were lost to followup before the 10-year minimum. Mean age at the time of study inclusion was 47 years (range, 18–55 years), and 56% (91 of 162) of the patients in this study were female. Mean followup was 20 years (range, 10–35 years). Radiographic metrics, in conjunction with the review of two experienced arthroplasty surgeons, determined the structural hip diagnosis as DDH, FAI, or normal morphology. Every available followup AP radiograph was reviewed to determine progression from Tönnis Grade 0 to 3 until the time of last followup or operative intervention with THA. Survivorship was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier methodology, hazard ratios, and multistate modeling. Thirty-five patients eventually underwent THA: 16 (33%) DDH, 13 (18%) FAI, and six (15%) normal morphology.

Results

Degenerative change was most rapid in patients with DDH followed by FAI and normal morphology. Among patients who recently developed Tönnis 1 degenerative change, the probability of undergoing THA in 10 years based on hip morphology was approximately one in three for DDH and one in five for both FAI and normal morphology hips, whereas the approximate probability at 20 years was two in three for DDH and one in two for both FAI and normal morphology hips. The likelihood of radiographic degeneration was increased in patients with the following findings: femoral head lateralization > 8 mm, femoral head extrusion index > 0.20, acetabular depth-to-width index < 0.30, lateral center-edge angle < 25°, and Tönnis angle > 8°.

Conclusions

Degenerative change occurred earliest in patients with DDH, whereas the natural history of patients with FAI was quite similar to structurally normal hips. However, patients with cam deformities and concomitant acetabular dysplasia developed osteoarthritis more rapidly. Although the results of this study cannot be directly correlated to highly active patients with FAI, these findings suggest that correction of FAI to a normal morphology may only minimally impact the natural history, especially if intervention takes place beyond Tönnis 0. Analysis of radiographic parameters showed that incremental changes toward dysplastic morphology increase the risk of degenerative change.

### Clinical presentation of symptomatic acetabular dysplasia in skeletally mature patients [^6ba2a1f0]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acetabular dysplasia is recognized as a cause of early degenerative hip osteoarthritis. The purpose of this study was to prospectively determine the early clinical presentation of symptomatic acetabular dysplasia in skeletally mature patients.

Methods

Fifty-seven consecutive skeletally mature patients with a total of sixty-five symptomatic hips were diagnosed with symptomatic acetabular dysplasia on the basis of the history, physical examination, and radiographs. These fifty-seven patients were enrolled in this study and were followed prospectively for a minimum of twenty-four months postoperatively.

Results

The study group included forty-one female patients (72%) and sixteen male patients (28%) with a mean age of twenty-four years. All were treated with a periacetabular osteotomy and were followed for a minimum of twenty-four months. The initial presentation was insidious in 97% of the hips, and the majority (77%) of the hips were associated with moderate-to-severe pain on a daily basis. Pain was most commonly localized to the groin (72%) and/or the lateral aspect of the hip (66%). Activity-related hip pain was common (88%), and activity restriction frequently diminished hip pain (in 75% of the cases). On examination, thirty-one hips (48%) were associated with a limp; twenty-five (38%), with a positive Trendelenburg sign; and sixty-three (97%), with a positive impingement sign. The mean time from the onset of symptoms to the diagnosis of hip dysplasia was 61.5 months. The mean number of health-care providers seen prior to the definitive diagnosis was 3.3. The mean Harris hip score improved from 66.4 points preoperatively to 91.7 points at a mean of 29.2 months after the periacetabular osteotomy.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of symptomatic acetabular dysplasia is commonly delayed, and procedures other than a pelvic reconstructive osteotomy are frequently recommended. The diagnosis of developmental dysplasia of the hip should be suspected and investigated when a skeletally mature, young, active patient has a predominant complaint of insidious activity-related groin pain and/or lateral hip pain.

### Prognosticating residual dysplasia at skeletal maturity following closed reduction for developmental dysplasia of the hip: a long-term study with an average 20-year follow-up [^adc4a8a3]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) are at risk for residual acetabular dysplasia even after successful closed reduction. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of long-term outcomes in order to guide prognostication and management.

Methods

Patients who were treated for DDH at 2 institutions between 1970 and 2010 and had follow-up until skeletal maturity were screened for inclusion. Hips that underwent open reduction were excluded to reduce iatrogenic confounding. Syndromal (including neuromuscular and arthrogrypotic) hip instability with collagenopathies were excluded. Demographic characteristics, Tönnis grade, age at the time of the reduction, surgical treatment, acetabular index, lateral center-edge angle, residual dysplasia graded using the Severin classification, and the presence and type of proximal femoral growth disturbance categorized using the Bucholz and Ogden classification were assessed. In addition, the the acetabular angle was recorded at the latest follow-up before secondary procedures, and the Oxford Hip Score and 5-level EuroQoL (EQ)-5 Dimension score were recorded at the latest follow-up. To account for repeated measures, generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression was utilized for the multivariable analysis. A support vector machine model and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were utilized to identify prognostication thresholds.

Results

One hundred and seven hips (96 female, 11 male) that were followed to skeletal maturity, with a mean follow-up of 20 years (range, 10 to 54 years), were included in the analysis. Eighty-nine hips (83%) demonstrated a good outcome at skeletal maturity, with a Severin grade of I or II. Major growth disturbances of Bucholz and Ogden types II, III, or IV were present in 13 hips (12%). At the latest follow-up after skeletal maturity (before any secondary procedures), the mean acetabular angle was 45° ± 4° and the mean lateral center-edge angle was 26° ± 8°. The mean Oxford Hip Score and EQ visual analog scale values were 47 and 86, respectively. A GEE logistic regression analysis of 1,135 observations revealed that the acetabular index (odds ratio [OR], 1.16 per degree; p < 0.001) and age (OR, 1.20 per year; p = 0.003) were significant predictors of a poor outcome (i.e. Severin grade III, IV, or V). Significant differences in acetabular indices across all age groups were found between hips with a good outcome and those with a poor outcome. Age-specific acetabular index prognostication cutoff values are presented.

Conclusions

This long-term follow-up study demonstrated that the age-specific acetabular index remains an important predictor of residual dysplasia at skeletal maturity. The proposed prognostication chart and thresholds herein can help to guide orthopaedic surgeons and parents when contemplating the use of an intervention versus surveillance to optimize long-term outcomes.

### A review of long-term outcomes for late presenting developmental hip dysplasia [^871b1ce1]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Successful management of late presenting hip dislocation in childhood is judged by the outcome not just at skeletal maturity but well beyond into adulthood and late middle age. This review considers different methods of treatment and looks critically at the handful of studies reporting long-term follow-up after successful reduction.

### Reliability of a new radiographic classification for developmental dysplasia of the hip [^f3957957]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2014). Low credibility.

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a common disorder in the pediatric population with an overall incidence of approximately 3 to 4 per 1000 live births. Although the clinical examination remains the mainstay for diagnosing DDH in early infancy, not all cases of DDH are detectable by physical examination. Imaging, either by ultrasonography or radiography, have become popular worldwide for screening or confirmation of the diagnosis as well as to classify the severity of the dysplasia. Quantifying the severity of displacement in DDH is useful for prognostication and clinical decision-making. In the newborn and young infant, ultrasounds are superior because the cartilaginous femoral head is not visible on radiographs. Following the appearance of the ossific nucleus in the older infant, anteroposterior (AP) pelvic radiographs replace ultrasonography as the screening imaging modality of choice. Ultrasonography has the limitation of being less accurate with continued growth and ossification of the femoral head. However, radiographic assessment may still be suboptimal or misleading when ossification of the femoral head is delayed or eccentric as in hips with DDH.

Several ultrasonographic and radiographic parameters have been described to define hip dysplasia. Some radiographic parameters such as the center-edge angle of Wiberg and the acetabular angle of Hilgenreiner are used to quantify subtle differences in acetabular dysplasia. In the older child, the center-edge angle of Wiberg is used to evaluate the degree of lateral femoral head coverage by the acetabulum in the frontal plane. The acetabular index angle of Hilgenreiner quantifies the development of the acetabulum by measuring the slope of the boney acetabulum in the frontal plane. However, these do not address more severe categories of dislocation for prognostic purposes before treatment. For classification of the full spectrum of severity, the Graf sub-types are well established on ultrasound, whereas the Tönnis method helps classify the severity of DDH using plain radiographs.

### A prospective, multicenter study of developmental dysplasia of the hip: what can patients expect after open reduction? [^e56b21eb]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Although there are several predominantly single-center case series in the literature, relatively little prospectively collected data exist regarding the outcomes of open hip reduction (OR) for infantile developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). The purpose of this prospective, multi-center study was to determine the outcomes after OR in a diverse patient population.

Methods

The prospectively collected database of an international multicenter study group was queried for all patients treated with OR for DDH. Minimum follow-up was 1 year. Proximal femoral growth disturbance (PFGD) was defined by consensus review using Salter's criteria. Persistent acetabular dysplasia was defined as an acetabular index > 90th percentile for age. Statistical analyses were performed to compare preoperative and operative characteristics that predicted re-dislocation, PFGD, and residual acetabular dysplasia.

Results

A cohort of 232 hips (195 patients) was identified; median age at OR was 19 months (interquartile range 13 to 28) and median follow-up length was 21 months (interquartile range 16 to 32). Re-dislocation occurred in 7% of hips (n = 16/228). The majority (81%; n = 13/16) occurred in the first year after initial OR. Excluding patients with repeat dislocation, 94.5% of hips were IHDI 1 at most recent follow-up. On the basis of strict radiographic review, some degree of PFGD was present in 44% of hips (n = 101/230) at most recent follow-up. Seventy-eight hips (55%) demonstrated residual dysplasia compared with established normative data. Hips that had a pelvic osteotomy at index surgery had about half the rate of residual dysplasia (39%; n = 32/82) versus those without a pelvic osteotomy with at least 2 years follow-up (78%; n = 46/59).

Conclusions

In the largest prospective, multicenter study to date, OR for infantile DDH was associated with a 7% risk of re-dislocation, 44% risk of PFGD, and 55% risk of residual acetabular dysplasia at short term follow-up. The incidence of these adverse outcomes is higher than previous reports. Patients treated with concomitant pelvic osteotomy had lower rates of residual dysplasia. These prospectively collected, multicenter data provide better generalizable information to improve family education and appropriately set expectations.

### A pre-operative predictive score for the outcome of eccentric rotational acetabular osteotomy in the treatment of acetabular dysplasia and early osteoarthritis of the hip in adults [^93568a8b]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

The influence of identifiable pre-operative factors on the outcome of eccentric rotational acetabular osteotomy (ERAO) is unknown. We aimed to determine the factors that might influence the outcome, in order to develop a scoring system for predicting the prognosis for patients undergoing this procedure.

Patients and Methods

We reviewed 700 consecutive ERAOs in 54 men and 646 women with symptomatic acetabular dysplasia or early onset osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip, which were undertaken between September 1989 and March 2013. The patients' pre-operative background, clinical and radiological findings were examined retrospectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed using the time from the day of surgery to a conversion to total hip arthroplasty (THA) as an endpoint. A risk score was calculated to predict the prognosis for conversion to THA, and its predictive capacity was investigated.

Results

The congruity of the hip, age, the pre-operative minimum width of the joint space and range of abduction were identified as factors predicting conversion to THA. For three groups of patients (scoring 0 to 5, 6 to 7, and 8 to 9 points), the Kaplan-Meier event-free rates of survival at 15 years post-operatively for conversion to THA were 99.6%, 85.2% and 67.3%, respectively.

Conclusion

These four pre-operative factors are easily measured and predict the prognosis for patients following ERAO. They may be used for decision making when offering surgical treatment to patients with acetabular dysplasia and early onset osteoarthritis. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2016;98-B:1326–32.

### Abstract… [^87a64901]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

The goal of treatment in DDH is to achieve and maintain reduction of the femoral head in the true acetabulum by closed or open means. The earlier treatment is initiated, the greater the success and the lower the incidence of residual dysplasia and long-term complications. Reduction of the hip should be confirmed by ultrasonography within three weeks of harness placement. Treatment usually is continued for at least six weeks full-time and six weeks part-time in young infants, and possibly longer in older children. The end point of brace treatment is a stable hip with normal imaging studies. If a dislocated hip is not reduced within three weeks, the harness should be discontinued and an alternative treatment selected. This usually involves closed reduction under anesthesia with hip spica casting. 21 In children older than six months, closed reduction under general anesthesia and hip spica casting is the treatment of choice.

Postoperative computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging should be used to confirm concentric reduction. 24, 25 Immobilization in the hip spica cast after closed reduction usually continues for at least 12 weeks after closed reduction.
26. If the hip is irreducible by closed means, or a concentric reduction is not achieved, successful treatment requires open reduction. 27 Open reduction of the hip in a child with DDH involves lengthening tendons about the hip, removing obstacles to reduction, and tightening the hip capsule once reduction is obtained. Complications include femoral head osteonecrosis and redislocation. 28 Surgery becomes more technically demanding in older children with established dislocations. By 18 months, femoral osteotomies with or without pelvic osteotomies may be necessary to reconstruct and safely maintain the hip in a reduced position.

Joint-preserving salvage osteotomies and total hip arthroplasty are surgical options once a child has achieved skeletal maturity. Both procedures have mixed long-term results and are inferior to surgical treatment initiated at earlier ages. 32, 33 Children in whom Pavlik harness treatment is initiated before six months of age have excellent results, although long-term studies are lacking. The majority have no symptoms of arthritis, with mild radiographic abnormalities by skeletal maturity. 34, 35 A child with DDH usually requires long-term follow-up with radiographic evaluation until skeletal maturity is reached to ensure normal hip development. 36–38.

### Acetabular development in the contralateral hip in patients with unilateral developmental dysplasia of the hip [^573ea8d8]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Adult patients may present with acetabular dysplasia without a history of developmental dysplasia of the hip. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the development of primary acetabular dysplasia in patients under the age of eighteen years by evaluating the contralateral hip in those with unilateral developmental dysplasia of the hip.

Methods

Radiographs of the contralateral hip of eighty-eight patients with unilateral developmental dysplasia of the hip were reviewed retrospectively. The center-edge angle was measured at the age of eighteen years. The primary acetabular dysplasia group included hips with a center-edge angle of < 20 degrees, and the normal group included hips with an angle of ≥ 20 degrees. The acetabular index at the age of three years, the center-edge angle between the ages of three and eighteen years, and the acetabular angle of Sharp between the ages of six and eighteen years were measured.

Results

According to our classification system, twelve hips (13.6%) were assigned to the primary acetabular dysplasia group. At the age of three years, there were no significant differences between the two groups radiographically. A significant difference in the center-edge angle between the two groups was seen at each evaluation period after the age of six years. However, twenty-two patients in the normal group had poor acetabular coverage and three patients in the primary acetabular dysplasia group had good acetabular coverage at the age of nine years. After the age of nine years, improvements in the center-edge angle and the acetabular angle of Sharp were noted in the normal group, whereas no acetabular growth was seen in the primary acetabular dysplasia group. There was no patient with a center-edge angle of < 15 degrees at the age of twelve years in the normal group.

Conclusions

After the age of six years, a difference in acetabular growth develops between patients with primary acetabular dysplasia and those with normal hips. However a final prognosis for acetabular development appears to be difficult to determine until the age of twelve years.

### Incidence of hip problems in developmental central hypotonia: a scoping review [^919ac163]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Children and adults with developmental central hypotonia are at increased risk of hip dysplasia, subluxation, and dislocation compared with the general population. This review included a range of genetic diagnoses, where hypotonia is a prominent feature in almost all infants, and continues for a significant proportion into adulthood. Early recognition and conservative intervention may be effective for some of these infants, although genetic diagnoses may not be confirmed until older ages. Proactive screening and hip ultrasound between the ages of 6 weeks and 6 months should therefore be considered for all infants with significant hypotonia, with or without a confirmed genetic diagnosis. Although children with developmental central hypotonia appear to have a higher incidence of acetabular dysplasia in infancy than children with CP, they also present with increasing instability over time. These individuals warrant inclusion in hip surveillance programmes, although there are some differences between the presentation, timing, and progression of hip problems in children with hypotonia compared with the typical protocols for children with CP. For individuals with significant hypotonia, hip surveillance may need to continue through the adolescent years into adulthood, as there are reports of late‐onset hip instability in some diagnoses. There is a need for consistent definition and reporting of hip problems in the literature to adequately map the natural history, intervention, and outcomes of children and adults with developmental central hypotonia.

### One-third of hips after periacetabular osteotomy survive 30 years with good clinical results, No progression of arthritis, or conversion to THA [^5e16388d]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Since its first description in 1984, periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) has become an accepted treatment for hip dysplasia. The 30-year survivorship with this procedure has not been reported. Because these patients are often very young at the time of surgery, long-term followup and identification of factors associated with poor outcome could help to improve patient selection.

Questions/Purposes

Looking at the initial group of patients with hip dysplasia undergoing PAO at the originator's institution, we asked: (1) What is the cumulative 30-year survival rate free from conversion to THA, radiographic progression of osteoarthritis, and/or a Merle d'Aubigné-Postel score < 15? (2) Did hip function improve and pain decrease? (3) Did radiographic osteoarthritis progress? (4) What are the factors associated with one or more of the three endpoints: THA, radiographic progression of osteoarthritis, and/or Merle d'Aubigné-Postel score < 15?

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated the first 63 patients (75 hips) who underwent PAO for hip dysplasia between 1984 and 1987. At that time, hip dysplasia was the only indication for PAO and no patients with acetabular retroversion, the second indication for a PAO performed today, were included. During that period, no other surgical treatment for hip dysplasia in patients with closed triradiate cartilage was performed. Advanced osteoarthritis (≥ Grade 2 according to Tönnis) was present preoperatively in 18 hips (24%) and 22 patients (23 hips [31%]) had previous femoral and/or acetabular surgery. Thirty-nine patients (42 hips [56%]) were converted to a THA and one patient (one hip [1%]) had hip fusion at latest followup. Two patients (three hips [4%]) died from a cause unrelated to surgery 6 and 16 years after surgery with an uneventful followup. From the remaining 21 patients (29 hips), the mean followup was 29 years (range, 27–32 years). Of those, five patients (six hips [8%]) did not return for the most recent followup and only a questionnaire was available. The cumulative survivorship of the hip according to Kaplan-Meier was calculated if any of the three endpoints, including conversion to THA, progression of osteoarthritis by at least one grade according to Tönnis, and/or a Merle d'Aubigné-Postel score < 15, occurred. Hip pain and function were assessed with Merle d'Aubigné-Postel score, Harris hip score, limp, and anterior and posterior impingement tests. Progression of radiographic osteoarthritis was assessed with Tönnis grades. A Cox regression model was used to calculate factors associated with the previously defined endpoints.

Results

The cumulative survivorship free from conversion to THA, radiographic progression of osteoarthritis, and/or Merle d'Aubigné-Postel score < 15 was 29% (95% confidence interval, 17%-42%) at 30 years. No improvement was found for either the Merle d'Aubigné-Postel (15 ± 2 versus 16 ± 2, p = 0.144) or Harris hip score (83 ± 11 versus 85 ± 17, p = 0.602). The percentage of a positive anterior impingement test (39% versus 14%, p = 0.005) decreased at 30-year followup, whereas the percentage of a positive posterior impingement test (14% versus 3%, p = 0.592) did not decrease. The percentage of positive limp decreased from preoperatively 66% to 18% at 30-year followup (p < 0.001). Mean osteoarthritis grade (Tönnis) increased from preoperatively 0.8 ± 1 (0–3) to 2.1 ± 1 (0–3) at 30-year followup (p < 0.001). Ten factors associated with poor outcome defined as THA, radiographic progression of osteoarthritis, and/or Merle d'Aubigné-Postel score < 15 were found: preoperative age > 40 years (hazard ratio [HR] 4.3 [3.7–4.9]), a preoperative Merle d'Aubigné-Postel score < 15 (HR 4.1 [3.5–4.6]), a preoperative Harris hip score < 70 (HR 5.8 [5.2–6.4]), preoperative limp (HR 1.7 [1.4–1.9]), presence of a preoperative positive anterior impingement test (HR 3.6 [3.1–4.2]), presence of a preoperative positive posterior impingement test (HR 2.5 [1.7–3.2]), a preoperative internal rotation of < 20° (HR 4.3 [3.7–4.9]), a preoperative Tönnis Grade > 1 (HR 5.7 [5.0–6.4]), a postoperative anterior coverage > 27% (HR 3.2 [2.5–3.9]), and a postoperative acetabular retroversion (HR 4.8 [3.4–6.3]).

Conclusions

Thirty years postoperatively, 29% of hips undergoing PAO for hip dysplasia can be preserved, but more than 70% will develop progressive osteoarthritis, pain, and/or undergo THA. Periacetabular osteotomy is an effective technique to treat symptomatic hip dysplasia in selected and young patients with closed triradiate cartilage. Hips with advanced joint degeneration (osteoarthritis Tönnis Grade ≥ 2) should not be treated with PAO. Postoperative anterior acetabular overcoverage or postoperative acetabular retroversion were associated with decreased joint survival.

Level Of Evidence

Level III, therapeutic study.

### Editorial commentary: at the intersection of borderline dysplasia and femoroacetabular impingement-which way should we turn? [^f0baa81d]. Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Borderline acetabular dysplasia remains a controversial topic in hip preservation, with poor current comparative literature to guide accurate diagnosis and treatment decision making. Borderline dysplasia represents a "transitional acetabular coverage" pattern between more classic acetabular dysplasia and normal coverage. Traditionally, borderline dysplasia has been defined by a lateral center-edge angle between 20° and 25°, whereas more recently, some authors have used 18° to 25°. Treatment decisions between isolated hip arthroscopy (addressing labral tears, femoroacetabular impingement morphology, and capsular laxity) and periacetabular osteotomy (improving joint stability, often combined with arthroscopy) remain challenging because the fundamental mechanical diagnosis (instability vs femoroacetabular impingement) can be difficult to determine clinically. Obtaining an accurate diagnosis to direct surgical treatment relies on comprehensive assessment of additional bony anatomy features (including femoral version) and patient characteristics (including sex, soft-tissue laxity, and range of motion). Future research efforts in borderline dysplasia should better characterize the role of disease- and patient-specific factors that will inform accurate diagnoses, leading to the development of optimal treatment strategies in distinct patient subgroups through comparison of treatment outcomes.

### Primary hip arthroscopy in patients with acetabular dysplasia: a systematic review of published clinical outcomes at minimum 5-year follow-up [^d05a3403]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hip arthroscopy in patients with borderline hip dysplasia has satisfactory outcomes at short-term follow-up; however, the data on midterm outcomes are inconsistent, and failure rates are high in some studies, limiting understanding of the role and utility of hip arthroscopy in this patient cohort.

Purpose

To provide an up-to-date, evidence-based review of the clinical outcomes of primary hip arthroscopy in patients with frank or borderline hip dysplasia at ≥ 5-year follow-up and report the failure rate and progression to total hip arthroplasty in this cohort.

Study Design

Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was performed according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Studies were included if they evaluated outcomes of primary hip arthroscopy in patients with lateral center-edge angle (LCEA) < 25° at ≥ 5-year follow-up. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the methodological index for non-randomized studies scoring system. Level of evidence was determined using criteria from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.

Results

Nine studies were included in this review. Patients with LCEA < 25° demonstrated satisfactory clinical outcomes, high patient satisfaction, and significant postoperative improvements in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) at follow-up ranging from a ≥ 5 to 10 years. Studies comparing patients with dysplasia to those without did not demonstrate significant differences in preoperative, postoperative, or delta PROs or in failure, reoperation, or revision rates. There was no overall significant correlation between outcomes and LCEA stratification.

Conclusion

Hip arthroscopy in carefully selected patients with LCEA < 25° can be successful at mid- to long-term follow-up and may provide clinical outcomes and failure rates comparable with patients with normal LCEA, understanding that this is a singular, 2-dimensional radiographic measure that does not differentiate instability from impingement or combinations thereof, warranting future studies delineating these differences. These findings suggest that hip dysplasia may not be an absolute contraindication for isolated hip arthroscopy and may serve as a viable intervention with consideration of staged future periacetabular osteotomy (PAO). Importantly, this review does not suggest that hip arthroscopy alters the natural history of dysplasia; therefore, patients with dysplasia should be counseled on the potential utility of PAO by appropriate hip preservation specialists.

Methods

Tianjin Hospital Ethics Committee approved the study (Approval number: 2017医伦审018). Informed consent was obtained from all the parents of individual participants included in the study. The datasets used and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

In this prospective study, DDH is diagnosed if the osseous acetabular index (OAI) > 30°. The study enrolled patients aged 6–24 months with unilateral developmental hip dislocation from October 2012 to July 2018. The exclusion criteria are: 1) CR failure when performing initial MRI, and re-dislocation at the time of replacing spica casts; 2) poor image resolution or poor body position leading to difficulties in diagnosis; 3) hip dysplasia caused by neuromuscular abnormalities, such as Ehlers-Danlos disease, congenital torticollis, equinovarus, arthrogryposis, and achondroplasia. A total of 78 patients met the inclusion criteria; six patients were excluded due to CR failure, four patients due to re-dislocation, three patients due to poor image resolution, and two patients due to other neuromuscular abnormalities. Therefore, 63 patients (63 hips) with hip dislocation were included in this study.

### Developmental dysplasia of the hip [^c68caf56]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

In its severest form, developmental dysplasia of the hip is one of the most common congenital malformations. The pathophysiology and natural history of the range of morphological and clinical disorders that constitute developmental dysplasia of the hip are poorly understood. Neonatal screening programmes, based on clinical screening examinations, have been established for more than 40 years but their effectiveness remains controversial. Whereas systematic sonographic imaging of newborn and young infants has afforded insights into normal and abnormal hip development in early life, we do not clearly understand the longer-term outcomes of developmental hip dysplasia, its contribution to premature degenerative hip disorders in adult life, and the benefits and harms of newborn screening. High quality studies of the adult outcomes of developmental hip dysplasia and the childhood origins of early degenerative hip disease are needed, as are randomised trials to assess the effectiveness and safety of neonatal screening and early treatment.

### Rotational acetabular osteotomy for pre-and early osteoarthritis secondary to dysplasia provides durable results at 20 Years [^39764f8d]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hip dysplasia is a common cause of secondary osteoarthritis (OA). Periacetabular osteotomy or rotational acetabular osteotomy has been used as joint-preserving procedures. However, only a few reports of long-term results with these operations have been reported.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Would satisfactory clinical and radiographic outcomes be maintained at a mean duration of 20 years after rotational acetabular osteotomy for pre- and early-stage OA; and (2) could we identify risk factors for radiographic progression of OA?

Methods

Between 1987 and 2001, we treated 159 patients (173 hips) with rotational acetabular osteotomies for the diagnosis of pre-OA or early-stage OA according to the technique of Ninomiya and Tagawa. During that period, our general indications for this approach were age younger than 60 years, center-edge angle less than 20°, and improved femoral head coverage and joint congruency on preoperative AP plain radiographs of the hip in abduction; we did not use this approach when joint congruency was not improved or no widening of the joint space was noted on preoperative AP plain radiographs of the hip in abduction. Of those patients, 21 patients with pre-OA (followup rate: 84% [27 hips]) and 110 patients in the early-stage group (followup rate: 82% [118 hips]) were available at a minimum of 15 years for a total patient group of 131 (followup rate: 82% [145 hips]). The mean age at the time of surgery was 22 years in the pre-OA group and 38 years in the early-stage group. The mean followup was 21 years in the pre-OA group and 20 years in the early-stage group. Clinical evaluation was performed with the Merle d'Aubigne and Postel rating scale, and radiographic analyses included measurements of the center-edge angle, acetabular roof angle, and head lateralization index on preoperative and postoperative AP radiographs of the pelvis. Postoperative joint congruency was also evaluated. The cumulative probabilities of radiographic signs of OA progression were estimated with use of the Kaplan-Meier product-limited method and parametric survivorship analysis using the Cox proportional-hazards model was used to determine risk factors for radiographic OA progression.

Results

The mean clinical score improved very slightly, from 15 (SD, 0.8) to 18 (SD, 1.1) (95% confidence interval [CI] -2.9 to -2.0; p < 0.001) in the pre-OA group and from 15 (SD, 1.0) to 16 (SD, 2.1) (95% CI, -2.0 to -1.2; p < 0.001) in the early-stage group at followup. Fourteen patients (15 hips) including one pre-OA patient (one hip) and 13 early-stage patients (14 hips) experienced worsening of their Merle d'Aubigne and Postel score, from a mean of 15 (SD, 0.9) to 12 (SD, 1.6) (95% CI, 1.8–3.3; p < 0.001). Eight patients (nine hips) with early-stage OA preoperatively underwent total hip arthroplasty at a mean duration after rotational acetabular osteotomy of 20 (SD, 2.5) years. Radiographic indices were improved after surgery in both groups. Radiographic progression of OA occurred in 24 patients (25 hips). Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis, with radiographic signs of progression of OA as the endpoint, predicted survival of 96% (95% CI, 89%-100%) at 10 years and 20 years in the pre-OA group. For the early-stage group, we found survivorship of 89% (95% CI, 83%-95%) at 10 years and 78% (95% CI, 69%-87%) at 20 years. We identified two factors associated with poor outcome: fair (rather than excellent and good) postoperative joint congruency (hazard ratio, 12.1; 95% CI, 3.8–39; p < 0.001) and age older than 46 years at the time of surgery (hazard ratio, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.9–11; p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Rotational acetabular osteotomy is an effective surgical procedure for symptomatic dysplastic hips in pre- and early-stage OA, and it prevented radiographic OA progression and maintained hip function at a mean 20 years after surgery.

### Natural history of the dysplastic hip following modern periacetabular osteotomy [^557362c3]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) is the most common treatment for symptomatic acetabular dysplasia, or developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), in skeletally mature patients. The purpose of this multicenter cohort study was to delineate the long-term radiographic natural history of the dysplastic hip following PAO.

Methods

We evaluated all patients undergoing PAO from 1996 to 2012 at 3 academic institutions in the United States. Inclusion criteria were PAO for DDH with a minimum 5-year radiographic follow-up. Exclusion criteria were PAO for isolated acetabular retroversion, neurogenic dysplasia, Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, and prior hip surgery including osteotomies and arthroscopy. There were 288 patients, 83% of whom were women; the mean age and body mass index (BMI) were 29 years and 25 kg/m, respectively. The mean clinical and radiographic follow-up was 9.2 years (range, 5.0 to 21.1 years). Every preoperative and postoperative hip radiograph was assessed to determine the degree of osteoarthritis according to the Tönnis classification. Survivorship was analyzed by multistate modeling, enabling assessment of progression through the Tönnis grades rather than just individual transitions as with Kaplan-Meier techniques.

Results

At the time of final follow-up, 144 patients (50%) had progressed at least 1 Tönnis grade, with 42 patients (14.6%) undergoing total hip arthroplasty. The mean number of years spent in each Tönnis grade following PAO was 19 for Tönnis grade 1, 8 for Tönnis grade 2, and 4 for Tönnis grade 3. The probability of progression to total hip arthroplasty increased significantly on the basis of a higher initial Tönnis grade (p < 0.001). The most marked difference occurred between Tönnis grade 0 or 1 and Tönnis grade 2; for Tönnis grade 1, the probability of progression to total hip arthroplasty at 5 and 10 years was 2% and 11%, respectively, compared with 23% and 53%, respectively, for Tönnis grade 2.

Conclusions

PAO effectively alters the natural history of DDH. Precise radiographic progression based on the Tönnis grade can now be used to ascribe prognosis for the native hip. Importantly, this investigation demonstrates a stark increase in progression to total hip arthroplasty within 10 years of PAO for patients with preoperative Tönnis grade-2 osteoarthritis compared with those with Tönnis grade-0 or 1 osteoarthritis.

### Prevalence of acetabular dysplasia at a mean age of 18 years after treatment for neonatal hip instability [^3dd713e9]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have suggested a tendency in patients treated for DDH to develop dysplasia during growth. The two long-term follow-ups of DDH until skeletal maturity had participants treated from a mean age of 4 months and found acetabular dysplasia was common. The present results emphasize the excellent prognosis of NHI in contrast to DDH with later treatment. Also, in the subgroup analysis, even the hips positive for the Ortolani test did not have more dysplastic measures compared with the nonaffected hips in unilateral NHI.

The studies with follow-ups until school age in patients with early treatment of DDH support the present results. Patients with successful early treatment had a similar mean LCEA and SA to those in the present study at a mean age of 10.2 years. Cashman et al found a mean AI value 4° larger than the values of the normal population at a mean surveillance of 6.5 years, but the prevalence of an LCEA < 20° was only 3.5%, similar to the findings in the present study.

### Detection and nonoperative management of pediatric developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants up to six months of age [^e704f6bd]. AAOS (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for developmental dysplasia of the hip, more specifically with respect to clinical and imaging follow-up, AAOS 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain serial physical examinations and periodic imaging assessments (ultrasound or radiograph based on age) during the management of patients with unstable hips.

### How good is the evidence linking acetabular dysplasia to osteoarthritis? [^47da909d]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A common claim in the orthopaedic literature is that acetabular dysplasia (AD) exists when the center-edge angle of Wiberg (CE angle) is < 20 degrees and that AD leads to osteoarthritis (OA). Our purpose is to evaluate the validity of the linkage between AD and OA.

Methods

We assess and discuss the theories and the empirical evidence relating AD to OA. Moreover, we test the rule that hips with a CE angle < 20 degrees will develop OA by 65 years of age, by looking for exceptions to this rule.

Results

Wiberg and Cooperman and colleagues present 30 ideal patients for assessing the relationship between AD and OA. Each was arthritis free, with stable AD, CE angle < 20 degrees, without signs of subluxation. They were all followed and all developed OA. In the studies by Stulberg and colleagues, and Jacobsen and colleagues, every patient presented with OA, making it difficult to be certain about the appearance of the hip before the onset of OA. In the study by Murphy and colleagues, we have the same problem, as an unknown number of patients already had OA at first assessment. All of these studies used different schemes for diagnosing OA, making the studies difficult to compare. Most of the patients in the studies were of Northern European ancestry, making the results difficult to generalize to other populations. Four patients had CE angles < 20 degrees and did not develop severe arthritis by 65 years of age.

Conclusions

Our conclusions apply directly to patients of Northern European ancestry. A few patients with stable, mild AD (CE angle 15 to 19 degrees) will be arthritis free at 65 years of age. Almost all patients with stable AD develop OA by 65 years of age. Unstable AD (CE angle < 20 degrees, with subluxation) always leads to OA by 65 years of age. It is probably reasonable to extend these conclusions to other populations, but the reader must be prepared to re-evaluate them, as more data accumulates.

### Prediction of late dysplasia based on ultrasound and plain X-ray at 6 months [^a2b6f881]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Developmental dysplasia of the hip represents a spectrum of deformity. Residual dysplasia at 2 years of age is associated with an increased risk for osteoarthritis and functional limitations. We compared the prognostic value of 6-month imaging modalities and aimed to identify optimal diagnostic metrics for the prediction of residual dysplasia.

Methods

After IRB approval, patients who underwent Pavlik treatment between 2009 and 2018 with 2-year follow-up were identified. Sonographs [ultrasound (US)] and radiographs (x-ray) were obtained at 6-month and 2-year-old visits. Dysplasia at 2 years was defined as an acetabular index (AI) > 24 degrees. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to quantitatively compare the prognostic ability of US and x-ray-based measures at 6 months. Youden's index [(YI) (values range from 0 (poor test) to 1 (perfect test)] was used to evaluate existing cutoffs at 6 months of age (normal measurements: alpha angle (AA) ≥ 60 degrees, femoral head coverage (FHC) ≥ 50%, and AI < 30 degrees) relative to newly proposed limits.

Results

Fifty-nine patients were included, of which 28.8% of patients (95% CI: 17.3 to 40.4%) had acetabular dysplasia at 2 years. After adjusting for sex, AA [Area under the Curve (AUC): 80] and AI (AUC: 79) at 6 months of age were better tests than FHC (AUC: 0.77). Current diagnostic cutoffs for AA (YI: 0.08), AI (YI: 0.0), and FHC (YI: 0.06) at 6 months had poor ability to predict dysplasia at 2 years. A composite test of all measures based on proposed cutoffs (AA ≥ 73 degrees, FHC > 62% and AI ≤ 24 degrees) was a better predictor of dysplasia at 2 years (Youden's index (YI): 0.63) than any single metric.

Conclusions

The rate of residual dysplasia remains concerning. The 6-month x-ray and US both play a role in the ongoing management of the developmental dysplasia of the hip. The prediction of dysplasia is maximized when all metrics are considered collectively. Existing parameters were not accurate; We recommend the following cutoffs: AA ≥ 73 degrees, FHC > 62%, and AI ≤ 24 degrees. These cutoffs must be validated.

### Management of irreducible hip dislocations in infants with developmental dysplasia of the hip diagnosed below 6 months of age [^68d6d4de]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2019). Medium credibility.

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is the most common pediatric hip condition, affecting 4 to 7/1000 live births, but the true prevalence is difficult to accurately quantify. Severity ranges from mild instability in a reduced hip to complete hip dislocation. The Pavlik harness is one of the most commonly used orthoses for the nonoperative management of DDH, with success rates of 95% to 100% reported for management of hip instability. However, infants with hips dislocated at rest continue to have the poorest prognosis, regardless of management.–In these cases, the dislocated hip can either be reducible or irreducible during a clinical examination. Those hips that are irreducible present particular challenges to treatment, with harness treatment failure rates reported in 37% to 100% of patients.–Harness failure typically necessitates surgical intervention in the form of closed or open reduction in order to achieve concentric reduction of the hip.

The variability in incidence, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes of DDH reported in the literature highlights the lack of standardized screening and management protocols and emphasizes the need for stronger supporting evidence. Some of this variability arises due to the broad spectrum of DDH pathology. Most previous studies are single center, retrospective and have no radiologic confirmation of hip position. To address this knowledge gap, we established a multicentre prospective observational study of children who have been diagnosed with hips dislocated at rest. This study excludes all teratological hips, whereby dislocation is secondary to other causes (neuromuscular, syndromic, chromosomal abnormalities, sacral agenesis, myelodysplasia, arthrogyposis). Therefore, all hips in this study are primarily dislocated and fall within the true definition of DDH.

The purpose of this study was to examine variations in treatment modalities for infants diagnosed below 6 months of age with dislocated irreducible (D/I) hips at rest. This study aimed to identify variables associated with increased risk of treatment failure for this particularly challenging patient cohort.

### What is the evidence to support acetabular dysplasia as a cause of osteoarthritis? [^678d0177]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2013). Low credibility.

The term "acetabular dysplasia" suggests a smaller than normal acetabulum or one that is abnormally vertical. Acetabular dysplasia has been linked to the development of hip osteoarthritis over the last 90 years in 3 ways. First, it has been linked through the concept that biomechanical forces can cause osteoarthritis. A smaller than normal acetabulum will result in a smaller than normal contact surface between the femoral head and the acetabulum. This will generate increased pressure per unit of area, which will precipitate articular cartilage failure when the pressure reaches a critical point. Osteoarthritis will ensue in response to this cartilage failure. A more vertical than normal acetabulum will be associated with increased shear. When that shear reaches a critical level, articular cartilage will fail, leading that to osteoarthritis. This critical level, for a small or a steep acetabulum, may differ between individuals, based on their biology and their life styles. Second, it has been linked by multiple empirical studies. One of these is Wiberg's 1939 thesis entitled "Studies on Dysplastic Acetabula and Congenital Subluxation of the Hip Joint with Special reference to the Complication of Osteoarthritis". It is among the most quoted and most powerful works in the Orthopaedic literature connecting a disease entity with an antecedent. Third, the linkage is reenforced by an absence of glaring exceptions to the hypothesis that acetabular dysplasia causes osteoarthritis. Orthopaedic surgeons just do not report on dysplastic hips in the arthritis-free elderly. The inability of the Orthopaedic community to identify even 1 elderly, arthritis-free individual with significant hip dysplasia should not carry weight in establishing the concept that acetabular dysplasia causes osteoarthritis. However, the longer this case report goes unpublished, the more certain orthopaedic surgeons will be that the 2 are linked.

### Satisfying results of primary hip arthroplasty in patients with hip dysplasia at a mean followup of 20 years [^922c7602]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Secondary OA of the hip attributable to DDH is a common indication for THA, especially in younger patients. However, this specific patient group is challenging owing to the acetabular defects that usually come along with the dysplasia. Numerous studies have reported reconstruction methods for acetabular defects using various operative techniques. Comparisons with other techniques and the presence of long-term followup reports are important to evaluate the durability of a technique or implant. To the best of our knowledge, there are no other studies presenting 20-year results of this technique in patients with DDH. Our study showed a 7% probability of cup revision surgery with revision for any reason as the endpoint at 15 years and 20 years in patients with THA after previous DDH. A previous study showed a survival of 96% at 10 years with revision for any reason as the endpoint. Limitations of the current study include the small number of patients and various grades of dysplasia were included, which could cause bias as the number of hips with high grades of dysplasia is low which makes it less reliable to draw conclusions for patients with severely dysplastic hips. Although the number of patients with severely affected hips is low, we decided to include all patients during this period. In addition, two patients (four hips) were not able to visit the outpatient clinic or have their radiographs taken. However, we contacted these patients and obtained information regarding their hip status. All other patients were seen in the outpatient clinic during the past 5 years. Finally, in some cases, the radiographic assessment can be hampered by the reconstruction material, cement, and prosthesis. We tried to minimalize this assessment bias by reviewing all subsequent radiographs of each patient and discussing the difficult radiographs until a consensus was reached.

### Prognostic factors influencing the functional outcome of total hip arthroplasty for hip infection sequelae [^69628304]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2005). Low credibility.

To investigate factors influencing functional prognosis for patients who have undergone total hip arthroplasty for late sequelae of infective arthritis of the hip, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 75 hips. All patients had had pyogenic or tuberculous infection and later underwent total hip arthroplasty. The average follow-up period was 5.8 years (range, 3–9 years). Various clinical and radiographic measures were analyzed with respect to Harris hip scores. Younger age at the time of infection onset, preoperative leg length discrepancy greater than 1 in, fusion, severe femoral hypoplasia, and severe acetabular dysplasia were associated with poorer prognosis. The complication rate, including 1 recurrent infection, was relatively low. Previous infections seemed to predict poorer results mostly because of the consequences of infection for the development of the hip joint, rather than because of infection recurrence.

The patient underwent MRI examination of both hips immediately after CR, 3 months after CR, and five and a half months after reduction. a and b show the coronal and transverse FS PDWI images of MRI immediately after CR. It is suggested that the LCC of the left hip is hypertrophied and completely inverted immediately after reduction, which is considered as type 4; the ligamentum teres, transverse ligament, and pulvinar are hypertrophic. c shows that the LCC became flattened 3 months after reduction, and the ligamentum teres, transverse ligament, and pulvinar were less hypertrophic than before. d shows that five and a half months after reduction, the LCC still had partial inversion which was considered as a type 3 complex. The ligamentum teres, transverse ligament, and pulvinar were not thickened and returned to normal, and the left hip joint achieved complete relocation. e shows the pelvic X-ray film of the patient 22 months after closed reduction, the left osseous acetabular index is 33.3°, indicating that there is still residual acetabular dysplasia; the shape of the left femoral head is intact, and no obvious abnormal density is found

### What are the factors associated with acetabular correction in perthes-like hip deformities? [^8ce75af8]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Perthes-like hip deformities encompass variable proximal femoral abnormalities and associated acetabular dysplasia that can be reconstructed with contemporary hip preservation procedures. Nevertheless, the necessity and indications for surgical correction of associated acetabular dysplasia have not been established.

Questions/Purposes

We determined whether patient-specific factors (sex, age, BMI, previous surgery, hip pain and function) and/or structural deformity characteristics (radiographic parameters of acetabular morphology) were associated with our indications for acetabular reorientation in surgical reconstruction of Perthes-like hip deformities.

Methods

We compared patient-specific characteristics and radiographic parameters of acetabular morphology in 94 patients (97 hips) with residual Perthes deformities who underwent joint preservation surgery without or with a periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) as part of the reconstruction.

Results

Patient sex, BMI, preoperative Harris hip score, and previous hip surgery were not associated with our indications for a combined femoral and PAO procedure. Radiographic parameters associated with the indication for a PAO included the lateral center-edge angle, anterior center-edge angle, acetabular inclination, and acetabulum-head index. No or mild secondary osteoarthritis and joint congruency were associated with the indication for a PAO as part of the reconstruction.

Conclusions

Contemporary hip preservation surgery for residual Perthes deformities covers a wide spectrum of procedures. We believe a PAO should be considered in the surgical treatment plan for symptomatic patients having radiographic parameters indicating acetabular dysplasia, no or mild secondary osteoarthritis, and adequate joint congruity.

### Magnetic resonance imaging follow-up can screen for soft tissue changes and evaluate the short-term prognosis of patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip after closed reduction [^9a174816]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

This study found that at the second time of replacing spica casts (4–6 months after CR), most femoral heads can achieve complete relocation, meaning that the hip joint achieved concentric reduction. One of the most serious complications of CR is secondary femoral head necrosis. The cause of necrosis is unknown, but may be related to the interruption of blood supply to the femoral head, excessive abduction of the hip joint, and increased stress on the femoral head. It is suggested that the rate of femoral head necrosis after CR in patients with DDH varies between 0 and 67%. This study found that the rate of femoral head necrosis with 18 months or more of follow-up after CR was 8.6%, which was acceptable and were lower than the multicenter study of Li et al. It was shown that with the improvement of orthopedic surgeons' understanding of the "safe zone" when performing hip abduction, CR and spica casting proved to be a safe and effective treatment for 6–24-month-old DDH patients.

In this study, it was found that partial inversion of the labrum at 4–6 months after CR was a risk factor for RAD, while complete relocation of the femoral head does not influence the development of osseous acetabulum. Some risk factors of RAD have been found; however, these factors are still controversial, and there is a lack of in-depth research on the causes of abnormal signals and parameters of acetabular cartilage. We have conducted a study on the application of T2 mapping combined with CUBE, which found that the T2 values of acetabular and femoral head cartilage in patients with inverted labra were higher than those in patients without labra inversion, and the more serious the labral inversion, the higher the T2 value, suggesting that the acetabular cartilage in patients with labral inversion was mostly made of hyaline cartilage with increased free water content, and it could not be mineralized in time. Combined with this study, we believe that labral inversion can hinder the normal ossification of the acetabular cartilage, resulting in RAD after reduction. The complete relocation of the femoral head suggests that CR can achieve a concentric reduction of the hip in patients with DDH, but if the labral inversion persists, it will hinder the normal development of acetabular cartilage.

### Detection and nonoperative management of pediatric developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants up to six months of age [^a2271802]. AAOS (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) — research priorities emphasize defining foundational constructs and measurement standards, including developing "clinical terms that describe hip stability", specifying "radiographic and ultrasound criteria for dysplasia and dislocation based upon age", identifying "historical and clinical risk factors to be assessed for all children that are related to DDH", clarifying "what constitutes "standard" brace treatment of DDH", and determining "what are outcomes criteria that define successful or failed treatment for DDH". Additional priorities are to "establish universally accepted and reproducible ranges of normal values across ages for sonographic and/or radiographic hip measures or any future surrogates for normal hip development", "establish clear relationships between these surrogates for hip development and demonstrate long-term functional limitations that are correlated to surrogate values that fall outside of the normal ranges", "define the benefits and harms of late diagnosis of DDH", "define the harms of early diagnosis and treatment of DDH", "standardize follow-up times after bracing to improve objective testing of outcomes", and "provide research design that is applicable to routine practice situations and allows for comparison of alternative methods of diagnosis and treatment".

### Magnetic resonance imaging follow-up can screen for soft tissue changes and evaluate the short-term prognosis of patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip after closed reduction [^e6a020fc]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

There are many studies on soft tissue structures in and around the hip joint, which hinder CR in DDH patients. Studer et al. observed that hypertrophy of the ligamentum teres, transverse ligaments, pulvinar, joint capsule, inverted labrum, and acetabular cartilage hypertrophy were important factors that hindered CR. Rosenbaum et al. concluded that labral hypertrophy and inversion, and hypertrophy of the pulvinar, ligamentum teres, and transverse ligaments were the main reasons hindering CR. By arthrography and MRI, Hattori and Kim found that obvious soft tissue insertion in the hip joint, widening of the medial contrast cistern, and LCC hypertrophy would increase the probability of CR failure, thus increasing the need for open surgery, even if surgical treatment cannot achieve a good prognosis. Yuan et al. found that poor delineation of the labrum and acetabular surface during arthrogram predicted failure of CR in children with DDH, and medial dye pool distance ≥ 6 mm significantly increased the risk of CR failure. However, the studies by Severin and Aoki have shown that the inverted labrum can be gradually shaped and returned to a normal shape after CR without affecting the final acetabular-head alignment. Walter et al. believed that the hypertrophy of soft tissues in the hip joint does not lead to CR failure. The failure is due to the mismatch between the femoral head and the acetabulum. Lü et al. found that if the LCC was thin, most hips could be successfully reduced and achieve complete relocation, while patients with thick LCC would prevent reduction of the femoral head. In our study, the incidence of hypertrophy of the pulvinar, ligamentum teres, and transverse ligaments was high before and at the time of CR, but these structures gradually returned to normal. Therefore, the authors believe that the abnormal soft tissue structures of the affected hip joints at reduction have no significant effect on the ultimate outcome, and it seems that it is not necessary to deal with these structures at the time of reduction. The CAHI of the affected hips increased gradually after CR, suggesting that CR increases the stress between the femoral head and the acetabulum and the cartilaginous acetabulum develops.

### Clinical and radiographic assessment of the young adult with symptomatic hip dysplasia [^7e484e4c]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Acetabular dysplasia is a major precursor of osteoarthritis of the hip. It is important to identify patients before the development of osteoarthritis, because these patients may be candidates for joint-preserving surgery, such as pelvic osteotomy. Patients with hip dysplasia, and no osteoarthritis, present with unique findings on history and physical examination. On history, patients should be questioned for symptoms unique to dysplasia, such as locking, snapping, and feelings of instability. Physical examination should look for signs of labral disease, by using the impingement test. Patients suspected of having symptomatic dysplasia should have plain radiographs, including an anteroposterior radiograph of the pelvis taken with the patient standing, a false profile view, and an abduction view of the hip. The anteroposterior radiograph of the pelvis and false profile view will help to quantify the degree of the dysplasia. The abduction view is important in determining the patient's eligibility for joint-preserving hip surgery. Computed tomography scanning and magnetic resonance imaging are reserved for patients who are operative candidates. Computed tomography scanning can aid in the planning of complex pelvic osteotomies. Magnetic resonance imaging especially is useful for delineating labral disease. It is this combination of history, physical examination, and radiographic workup that will allow successful treatment of the dysplastic hip before the development of osteoarthritis.

### Hip dysplasia in the young adult [^14676695]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2016). Low credibility.

Hip dysplasia is a leading precursor of osteoarthritis and is seen in 20% to 40% of patients with osteoarthritis of the hip. An increase in mechanical stress on the cartilage matrix with failure of the acetabular labrum represents the major pathomechanism of degeneration. Because the prevalence of associated femoral deformities is high (> 50%), the structural anatomy of the dysplastic hip must be assessed in multiple planes using radiographs and, if needed, advanced imaging modalities. Acetabular osteotomy (periacetabular and/or rotational) is the most commonly used procedure for the treatment of the majority of dysplastic hips in adults. Modern total hip replacement remains an excellent option for the more arthritic joints. Difficulties can arise from anatomical abnormalities and previous operations.

### Impact of postoperative acetabular wall index on patient-reported outcomes after transposition osteotomy of the acetabulum in patients with hip dysplasia [^21adaf44]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with hip dysplasia manifest hip deformities characterized by insufficient acetabular coverage and shallow acetabular concavity, resulting in structural instability, reduced load-transmitting area, and abnormal stress distribution across the articular cartilage. This predisposition makes patients susceptible to labral injury and cartilage degeneration, ultimately leading to early onset of osteoarthritis (OA). To address these deformities and improve hip biomechanics in an effort to delay or prevent OA progression, periacetabular osteotomies (PAOs), including Bernese PAO, rotational acetabular osteotomy, and transposition osteotomy of the acetabulum (TOA), have been developed. - Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of these osteotomies in promoting long-term joint preservation, with a consensus that younger patients without advanced cartilage degeneration derive the greatest benefit from PAO procedures. -

In addition to appropriate surgical indications, previous studies have highlighted precise acetabular correction as a critical factor in ensuring successful joint survival after PAO.- Although the conventional radiographic measure of acetabular coverage for preoperative planning and intraoperative assessment remains the lateral center-edge angle (LCEA),- recent studies have shed light on the importance of sagittal plane acetabular correction in improving postoperative prognosis. Valid metrics for quantifying sagittal plane acetabular coverage on anterior-posterior (AP) pelvic radiographs are represented by acetabular wall indices. Notably, a recent study demonstrated that a deficient postoperative anterior wall index (AWI) adversely affects joint survival after PAO, suggesting the potential utility of these indices in both preoperative planning and intraoperative assessment to facilitate precise acetabular realignment.

However, there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding the impact of acetabular correction on patients' subjective symptom status, including pain, functional capacity, patient satisfaction, and quality of life (QOL), particularly with regard to sagittal plane acetabular coverage. Given that patients undergoing PAO are typically young and active, it is imperative to assess how the preserved joint affects their future well-being, beyond simply evaluating joint survival. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have gained prominence in recent years for accurately quantifying the patient experience following PAO, underscoring their validity in this context. - Nevertheless, previous studies investigating factors influencing PROMs after PAO have been limited, primarily focusing on preoperative variables such as age, BMI, and preoperative degree of OA.

### Magnetic resonance imaging follow-up can screen for soft tissue changes and evaluate the short-term prognosis of patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip after closed reduction [^9c256933]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Observation and measurements

The patients changed spica casts once or twice within 4–6 months after CR and were followed up for at least 18 months.

In our study, the labro-chondral complex (LCC) was classified into four types: type 1: normal (acetabular cartilage and labrum matches, the morphology of the labrum is triangular and outward); type 2: everted (mild hypertrophy of acetabular cartilage, the labrum is round and outward); type 3: partially inverted (mild or moderate hypertrophy of the acetabular cartilage, the labrum inverted partially, which inserts between the femoral head and the acetabulum); type 4: completely inverted (the labrum is inverted entirely and there is significant cartilage hyperplasia) (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
The labro-chondral complex classification. The labro-chondral complex was divided into 4 types (Coronal FS PDWI images), type 1 (a): normal (acetabular cartilage and labrum matches, the morphology of labrum is triangular and outward); type 2 (b): everted (mild hypertrophy of acetabular cartilage, the labrum is round and outward); type 3 (c): partially inverted (mild or moderate hypertrophy of the acetabular cartilage, the labrum inverted partially, which inserts between the femoral head and the acetabulum); type 4 (d): completely inverted (the labrum is inverted entirely and with significant cartilage hyperplasia)

The study observed whether the ligamentum teres, the transverse ligament, and the pulvinar hypertrophied before and after CR. Hypertrophy of the ligamentum teres and the transverse ligament: the ligament was thicker than that on the normal side, and was strip-like, tortuous, prolonged, and manifested mixed signal intensity; pulvinar hypertrophy: the pulvinar was thick and visible (Fig. 2).

### Hip pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^4d411868]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT Femoroacetabular impingement is one of the most common causes of hip pain in young adults. Labral tears and femoroacetabular impingement are often comorbid conditions in young active patients. Athletes are more likely to require surgical intervention for these conditions, especially those with both conditions.
9. AVASCULAR NECROSIS Avascular necrosis of the femoral head most commonly presents in middle-aged to older adults. Risk factors include alcohol use, smoking, systemic corticosteroid use, hemoglobinopathies, chemotherapy, metabolic syndrome, and obesity. Early detection of avascular necrosis can be joint sparing, but no physical examination finding is specific for this diagnosis. 11 Late-stage disease may be visible on a radiograph, but earlier diagnosis often requires MRI or computed tomography. 12, 21. OSTEOARTHRITIS In older adults, osteoarthritis of the femoroacetabular joint is the most common cause of anterior hip pain.

3 It can lead to significant morbidity and decrease in physical activity. Osteoarthritis of the hip typically has a gradual onset, but some patients recall a specific injury or fall. Patients with this condition may have pain with sitting and ambulating for long periods and may have an antalgic gait. Physical examination maneuvers such as flexion and internal and external rotation may reproduce pain, and range of motion may be decreased. 4, 6. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome presents as lateral hip pain aggravated by ambulation or other physical activities, sitting for long periods, and sleeping on the affected hip. It most commonly affects women 40 to 60 years of age. 16 There is typically no inciting injury. The patient may walk with a Trendelenburg gait or have positive findings on the Trendelenburg test or resisted external derotation test. 7, 16.

If a patient with greater trochanteric pain syndrome does not improve with anti-inflammatory medications and physical therapy, a gluteus medius tendon tear should be considered. MRI and musculoskeletal ultrasonography performed by an experienced sonographer are sufficiently sensitive and specific for diagnosing a gluteus medius tendon tear. 15, 16, 21 Referral to an orthopedic hip specialist is often indicated for large partial or complete tears because surgery is typically associated with good outcomes in patients with this condition. 15, 16.

### Surgical treatment of acetabular dysplasia with labral tears [^6a50101a]. Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Acetabular dysplasia results in abnormal forces across the hip joint and can result in both labral tears and cartilage degeneration. A continuum exists from classic dysplasia to normal acetabular morphology. Diagnosis is aided by several radiographic measurements and parameters including a lateral center edge angle of less than 20°, an anterior center edge angle of less than 20°, a Sharp's angle of greater than 42°, and a Tonnis angle of greater than 10°, or version abnormalities. When patients with acetabular dysplasia present with intra-articular hip pain, skeletal maturity, and preserved radiographic joint space, a periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) is considered as a surgical treatment option when conservative measures have failed. The Bernese PAO was developed in 1984 as a way for reorienting the acetabulum to restore more normal femoral head coverage and orientation. The long-term results of this procedure have been promising with 10-year and 20-year survivorships of approximately 85% and 60%, respectively. When dysplasia is coupled with a labral tear or other intra-articular pathology including focal chondral damage, ligamentum teres tears, or capsular defects, hip arthroscopy and PAO are performed. Although there is a paucity in the literature of the long-term evidence for the combined procedure, early results indicate improved patient reported outcome measures. Appropriate treatment of borderline hip dysplasia remains controversial.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^de56c408]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and acetabular dysplasia — predictors of progression to surgery after nonsurgical management are reported from Cheng et al, who analyzed outcomes at a minimum of a 1-year follow-up in 713 patients (830 hips), with patient ages 13 to 40 years (25.4 ± 8.1 years), 72.7% female, and a mean follow-up of 2.6 years (0.4–8-year range); at a minimum of 1-year follow-up, 429 out of 830 hips (51.7%; 95% CI: 48.2%, 55.1%) did not progress to surgery, while predictors for progression included younger age (OR = 0.95/year; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.98), pain duration longer than 6 months (ORs = 1.87, 2.03; P ≤ .027), worse physical function (OR = 0.96/PROMIS point, 0.92–0.99), diagnosis of FAI (OR = 3.47 [2.05–5.89]) acetabular dysplasia (OR = 2.75 [1.73–4.35]), and labral tears (OR = 2.70 [1.65–4.47]); additionally, radiographic dysplasia with an LCEA less than 20° increased surgery likelihood in all subgroups (ORs = 2.05–8.47, P ≤ .008), and in severe cam FAI (α > 63°) a larger alpha angle was associated with increased surgery likelihood (OR = 1.03/degree, 1.00–1.06).

### Natural history of structural hip abnormalities and the potential for hip preservation [^28f48c13]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis (OA) exerts a significant burden on society, affecting 3% of Americans aged > 30 years. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathoanatomy and pathomechanics of the hip have led to treatment options for young adults with hip pain. Femoroacetabular impingement, specifically cam-type femoroacetabular impingement, hip dysplasia, and the sequelae of pediatric hip disease can predispose the hip to early OA. However, many patients with abnormal anatomic findings do not develop early OA, suggesting that there exist other patient characteristics that are protective despite abnormal bony anatomy. Outcome studies show that arthroscopic and open hip procedures improve pain and function in patients with symptomatic hips. However, there is currently limited evidence that these procedures extend the life of the patient's natural hip. Additional studies are needed to determine protective or adaptive factors in patients with abnormal anatomy who do not develop early OA and to determine whether joint preserving hip surgery extends the life of the native hip joint.

### Periacetabular osteotomy for symptomatic acetabular dysplasia in patients ≥ 40 years old: intermediate and long-term outcomes and predictors of failure [^7c48be27]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The Bernese periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) is controversial as a treatment for symptomatic acetabular dysplasia in patients ≥ 40 years of age. We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the outcomes, measure the survival rate, and identify factors associated with PAO failure in patients ≥ 40 years of age.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of patients ≥ 40 years of age undergoing PAO. Study eligibility criteria were met by 166 patients (149 women; mean age, 44 ± 3 years), and 145 (87%) were followed for ≥ 4 years after PAO. We used a Kaplan-Meier curve with right-censoring to calculate survivorship, with "failure" defined as either conversion to or recommendation for total hip arthroplasty or a Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score of ≥ 10 at the most recent follow-up. We used simple logistic regression models to determine whether any preoperative characteristics were significantly associated with PAO failure.

Results

The median follow-up time was 9.6 years (range, 4.2 to 22.5 years). Sixty-one of 145 hips (42%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 34% to 51%) experienced PAO failure during follow-up. The median survival time was 15.5 years (95% CI = 13.4 to 22.1 years). The median survival time was longer for hips with no or mild preoperative osteoarthritis: 17.0 years for Tönnis grade 0, 14.6 years for grade 1, and 12.9 years for grade 2. Higher preoperative Tönnis arthritis grades (p = 0.03) and worse WOMAC function scores (p < 0.001) were associated with an increased likelihood of failure.

Conclusions

PAO is usually effective at improving function and is effective at preserving the hip in patients ≥ 40 years of age provided that they have good preoperative function and no or mild preoperative osteoarthritis (Tönnis grade 0 or 1). Patients who are ≥ 40 years old with advanced preoperative osteoarthritis (Tönnis grade 2) and those with poor preoperative dysfunction have a high risk of therapeutic failure after PAO.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^eb9e7b5f]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Hip dysplasia — definitions and prevalence — In the context of this review, the term acetabular dysplasia will be used to discuss changes in the normal orientation (direction or version) or in the shape (inclination or depth) of the acetabulum. One form of acetabular dysplasia, characterized by a shallow acetabulum, is a well-recognized cause of hip pain in young adults; the primary distinction between "borderline dysplasia" and acetabular dysplasia is based on radiographic measures of femoral head coverage, and this acetabular deficiency results in decreased coverage of the femoral head and increased loading of the anterolateral acetabular rim and labrum, most often observed in the superolateral region. Prevalence data include a 1.0%-11.3% prevalence of acetabular dysplasia in the adult population, with females being more commonly affected than males, and a pooled prevalence of borderline dysplasia of 18.9% (16.7%-46.0%) in the asymptomatic general population; risk factors for the development of acetabular dysplasia include breech position in utero, primiparity, and family history.

### Development of hip dysplasia in hereditary multiple exostosis [^5649f6ef]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2001). Low credibility.

In approximately 25% of patients with hereditary multiple exostosis, there is an abnormal osteochondral formation localized in the femoral proximal metaphysis. This formation often causes a mechanically progressive insufficiency of the acetabular cavity, a true developmental hip dysplasia, that together with a coxa valga deformity, which is also present, causes a gradual deterioration in the relations of this joint. This malformation has a poor prognosis and is difficult to manage. Although this entity is rather frequent and quite severe, it is rarely found in the medical literature. The author describes six private cases, taken from a total of 24,000 patients (0.25/1000) as examples of this entity, and provides a review of the literature.

### Satisfying results of primary hip arthroplasty in patients with hip dysplasia at a mean followup of 20 years [^0aacc605]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a common cause of secondary osteoarthritis (OA) in younger patients, and when end-stage OA develops, a THA can provide a solution. Different options have been developed to reconstruct these defects, one of which is impaction bone grafting combined with a cemented cup. To determine the true value of a specific technique, it is important to evaluate patients at a long-term followup. As there are no long-term studies, to our knowledge, on THA in patients with DDH using impaction bone grafting with a cemented cup, we present the results of this technique at a mean of 15 years in patients with previous DDH.

Questions/purposes

We wished to determine (1) the long-term probability of cup revision at a minimum followup of 15 years for cemented acetabular impaction bone grafting in patients with DDH; (2) the radiographic appearance of the bone graft and radiographic signs of implant loosening; and (3) the complications and pre- and postoperative Harris hip scores with cemented THA combined with impaction bone grafting in patients with previous DDH.

Methods

Between January 1984 and December 1995 we performed 28 acetabular impaction bone grafting procedures for secondary OA believed to be caused by DDH in 22 patients; four patients died before 15 years, leaving 24 hips in 18 patients for retrospective analysis at a minimum of 15 years (mean, 20 years; range, 16–29 years). The diagnosis of DDH was made according to preoperative radiographs and intraoperative findings. All grades of dysplasia were included; five patients had Crowe Group I, eight had Group II, nine had Group III, and two had Group IV DDH. No patients were lost to followup. In all cases the acetabular defects were combined cavitary and segmental. Owing to the high number of deaths, we performed a competing-risk analysis to determine the probability of cup revision surgery.

Results

The competing-risk analysis showed cumulative incidences at 15 and 20 years, with endpoint revision for any reason of 7% (95% CI, 0%–17%), whereas this was 4% (95% CI, 0%–11%) with endpoint revision of the cup for aseptic loosening. Three revision surgeries were performed. Two cup revisions were performed for aseptic loosening at 12 and 26 years. Another cup revision was performed owing to sciatic nerve problems at 2 years. A stable radiographic appearance of the graft was seen in 19 of the 25 unrevised hips. Four hips showed acetabular radiolucent lines and two showed acetabular osteolysis. None of the unrevised cups showed migration or radiographic failure. Postoperative complications included a pulmonary embolus and a superficial wound infection. The Harris hip score improved from 37 (range, 9–72) preoperatively to 83 (range, 42–99) at latest followup.

Conclusions

Cemented primary THA with the use of impaction bone grafting shows satisfying long-term results in patients with previous DDH. For future research it is important to evaluate this technique in a larger cohort with a long-term followup. Other techniques also should be evaluated at long-term followup to be able to compare different techniques in this important and specific patient group.

### Natural history of hips with borderline acetabular index and acetabular dysplasia in infants [^3a6b1143]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2002). Low credibility.

Management of clinically stable hips with an increased age-related acetabular index (AI) remains controversial. The authors' purpose was to document the natural history of such hips. Sixty-eight clinically stable hips with an increased age-related AI were followed up for a mean of 9.5 years. Four patterns of evolution were observed: type 1 (25 hips) had rapid progression to normal range in the first 2 years; type 2 (19 hips) had slow improvement, with AI values reaching the normal range between 4 and 11 years; type 3 (20 hips) had improved hip morphology with persistence of minor deviations from the normal values; and type 4 (4 hips) showed no improvement. Initially, none of the hips with type 1, 2, or 3 pattern showed radiologic signs of displacement; in contrast, all our type 4 hips were radiologically eccentered. Clinically stable and radiologically well-centered hips with an increased age-related AI improved spontaneously without treatment. For these cases, clinical and radiologic follow-up is all that is needed.

### The utility of hip arthroscopy in the setting of acetabular dysplasia: a systematic review [^10360522]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare patient-reported outcomes, progression of osteoarthritis, and conversion to total hip replacement in a dysplastic population when hip arthroscopy was used as an isolated treatment or as an adjunct to pelvic reorientation osteotomy.

Methods

An exhaustive search of the existing literature was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Three databases (PubMed, CINAHL [Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature], Embase) were searched for studies from January 1930 through January 2018 published in the English language concerning the use of hip arthroscopy with diagnostic and therapeutic intentions in individuals with acetabular dysplasia. We excluded studies that presented ambiguous data sets or in which clear identification of the strategy for arthroscopy was absent.

Results

The selection criteria were defined, and 33 studies (1,368 hip arthroscopies) were included in the final analysis. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were classified within 5 different categories: (1) hip arthroscopy for screening, chondral mapping, and planning (9 studies, 729 hip arthroscopies); (2) isolated arthroscopic treatment (13 studies, 434 hip arthroscopies); (3) outcomes of hip arthroscopy after previous reorientation pelvic osteotomy for acetabular dysplasia (4 studies, 52 hip arthroscopies); (4) arthroscopy followed by unplanned hip-preservation surgery (3 studies, 48 hip arthroscopies); and (5) combined arthroscopy and periacetabular osteotomy (4 studies, 106 hip arthroscopies). A risk-of-bias analysis showed a moderate to high risk of bias (level 3 or 4) within and across the included studies.

Conclusions

Although hip arthroscopy can be used to accurately grade the severity of chondral injuries in the native hip and provide zone-specific geographic mapping that may aid in subsequent surgical planning, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that arthroscopic characterization alone has any bearing on the ultimate clinical outcomes after osseous structural correction. Isolated arthroscopic treatment is not recommended in the setting of moderate to severe dysplasia, given the inferior clinical outcomes and risk of iatrogenic instability reported for this group. However, there is limited evidence to suggest that the isolated use of hip arthroscopy may be considered in cases of borderline acetabular dysplasia when careful attention is paid to labral and capsular preservation. Limited evidence supports the conclusion that after prior reorientation pelvic osteotomy for acetabular dysplasia, hip arthroscopy leads to improved clinical and functional outcomes and should be considered in this setting. Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that failed hip arthroscopy compromises or challenges the ultimate clinical outcomes in patients undergoing subsequent reorientation pelvic osteotomy. Last, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the adjunctive use of hip arthroscopy with reorientation pelvic osteotomy produces superior clinical outcomes compared with pelvic osteotomy alone. In summary, arthroscopic techniques may provide a useful complement to the correction of acetabular dysplasia and should be thoughtfully considered on a case-by-case basis when designing a comprehensive treatment strategy in dysplastic populations.

### Dysplasia of the contralateral hip in patients with unilateral late-detected congenital dislocation of the hip: 50 years' follow-up of 48 patients [^a8a133e5]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of dysplasia in the 'normal' contralateral hip in patients with unilateral developmental dislocation of the hip (DDH) and to evaluate the long-term prognosis of such hips. A total of 48 patients (40 girls and eight boys) were treated for late-detected unilateral DDH between 1958 and 1962. After preliminary skin traction, closed reduction was achieved at a mean age of 17.8 months (4 to 65) in all except one patient who needed open reduction. In 25 patients early derotation femoral osteotomy of the contralateral hip had been undertaken within three years of reduction, and later surgery in ten patients. Radiographs taken during childhood and adulthood were reviewed. The mean age of the patients was 50.9 years (43 to 55) at the time of the latest radiological review. In all, eight patients (17%) developed dysplasia of the contralateral hip, defined as a centre-edge (CE) angle < 20° during childhood or at skeletal maturity. Six of these patients underwent surgery to improve cover of the femoral head; the dysplasia improved in two after varus femoral osteotomy and in two after an acetabular shelf operation. During long-term follow-up the dysplasia deteriorated to subluxation in two patients (CE angles 4° and 5°, respectively) who both developed osteoarthritis (OA), and one of these underwent total hip replacement at the age of 49 years. In conclusion, the long-term prognosis for the contralateral hip was relatively good, as OA occurred in only two hips (4%) at a mean follow-up of 50 years. Regular review of the 'normal' side is indicated, and corrective surgery should be undertaken in those who develop subluxation.

### Single-stage triple procedure bilateral hip open reduction, acetabuloplasty, and femoral shortening for late diagnosed patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip [^892214f2]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Developmental dysplasia of the hip is a challenging pediatric condition requiring timely and effective surgical management. This study evaluates the clinical and radiographic outcomes of a simultaneous bilateral single-stage triple procedure, which integrates open reduction, acetabuloplasty, and femoral shortening osteotomy. This approach offers a potential alternative to standard staged procedures by reducing treatment time and cumulative anesthesia exposure.

Methods:

This retrospective study included 54 patients who underwent a standardized simultaneous bilateral single-stage procedure at two tertiary centers. The average age at the time of surgery is 3 ± 1.5 years. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were assessed, with follow-up extending to an average of 3 years.

Results and Conclusion:

In our study of 54 patients (108 hips), significant improvements were noted after surgery with a mean reduction in the acetabular index of 27° ± 7° for the right hip and 26° ± 6° for the left hip (P = 0.0001). The Severin classification indicated 83% excellent, 13% good, and 4% poor outcomes. Redislocation occurred in 6% of hips, with no significant differences in osteonecrosis, lateral subluxation, or redislocation based on sex or age (P > 0.05). All patients achieved good-to-full range of motion by the final follow-up.

### Minimally-invasive dega osteotomy in ambulatory pediatric patients with residual developmental dysplasia of the hips – A technique and prospective case series [^f2a4457e]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Residual acetabular dysplasia of the hip remains a challenging condition with diverse therapeutic approaches tailored to the patient and the extent of dysplasia. Various surgical techniques have been used to address the anatomical abnormalities associated with DDH. Recently, there has been a rise in the utility of minimally invasive techniques; however, these techniques are still uncommonly used. Furthermore, the minimally invasive osteotomy initially described by Canavese et alhas only been performed in nonambulatory patients with cerebral palsy. Translating this technique for utilization in ambulatory patients with dysplastic hips is a potential direction for select patients, especially when reasonable conservative attempts with monitoring shows progression of the dysplasia. Nevertheless, it is important to stress that a concentrically reduced hip is required for this technique to yield favorable results, and this is confirmed by an intraoperative arthrogram.

There is ongoing controversy regarding the optimal approach to managing these patients, with potential geographic variation in treatment strategies across different institutions. Although some advocate for long-term observation, increasing evidence suggests that residual dysplasia carries a notable risk of early degenerative joint disease. Therefore, addressing dysplasia may play a crucial role in long-term hip preservation. Predicting cases of dysplasia that will resolve spontaneously is challenging and often unpredictable. In addition, correcting dysplasia at a younger age is typically a simpler procedure compared with interventions performed in older children. Furthermore, early correction of dysplasia with pelvic osteotomies potentially limits or reverses dysplastic changes in the acetabulum. In their multicenter study, Li et al emphasized the importance of the acetabular index in predicting outcomes. In their study, they identified an acetabular index of 28° at 1 year post closed reduction and 25° at 2 years as critical thresholds for surgical intervention, citing poor outcomes beyond these values. They concluded that the acetabular index is the most reliable predictor of late residual dysplasia.

### Metastatic acetabular fractures: evaluation and approach to management [^2c526d36]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2006). Low credibility.

Although bone metastasis to the acetabulum can cause significant disability from pain and immobility, little has been written about the diagnosis and management of a pathologic acetabular fracture. We present three patients with metastatic acetabular fractures and discuss an approach to evaluation and management. When a high index of suspicion of fracture exists, further radiographic workup is warranted. Management requires a multidisciplinary approach. Factors such as age, associated comorbidities, natural history of the underlying primary cancer, general health status, prognosis, acetabular fracture characteristics, and quality of bone should be considered. We briefly discuss the options available to nonoperative candidates.

### How is variability in femoral and acetabular version associated with presentation among young adults with hip pain? [^05f8c0bd]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acetabular and femoral version contribute to hip pain in patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) or dysplasia. However, definitions and measurement methods of femoral version have varied in different studies, resulting in different "normal" values being used by clinicians for what should be the same anatomic measurement. This could result in discrepant or even inappropriate treatment recommendations.

Questions/Purposes

In patients undergoing hip preservation surgery, (1) what is the range of acetabular and femoral version at presentation, and how much do two commonly used measurement techniques (those of Murphy and Reikerås) differ? (2) How are differences in acetabular and femoral version associated with clinical factors and outcomes scores at the time of presentation?

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of data gathered in a longitudinally maintained database of patients undergoing hip preservation at a tertiary care referral center. Between June 2020 and December 2021, 282 hips in 258 patients were treated for an isolated labral tear (9% [26 hips]), hip dysplasia (21% [59 hips]), FAI (52% [147 hips]), mixed FAI and dysplasia (17% [47 hips]), or pediatric deformity (slipped capital femoral head epiphysis or Perthes disease; 1% [3 hips]) with hip arthroscopy (71% [200 hips]), periacetabular osteotomy (26% [74 hips]), surgical hip dislocation (2.5% [7 hips]), or femoral derotation osteotomy (0.5% [1 hip]). We considered those with complete radiographic data (CT including the pelvis and distal femur) and patient-reported outcome scores as potentially eligible. Exclusion criteria were age younger than 18 or older than 55 years (5 hips, 3 patients), signs of hip osteoarthritis (Tönnis grade ≥ 2; 0), pediatric deformity (slipped capital femoral head epiphysis or Perthes disease; 3 hips, 3 patients), previous femoral or acetabular osteotomy (2 hips, 2 patients), avascular necrosis of the femoral head (0), history of neuromuscular disorder (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; 3 hips, 3 patients) or rheumatoid disease (ankylosing spondylitis; 1 hip, 1 patient), and when CT did not include the knees (19 hips, 19 patients). Based on these criteria, 249 hips in 227 patients were included. Of patients with bilateral symptomatic hips, one side was randomly selected for inclusion, leaving 227 hips in 227 patients for further analysis. The patients' median age (range) was 34 years (19 to 55 years), the median BMI (range) was 27 kg/m 2 (16 to 55 kg/m 2), and 63% (144) were female; they were treated with hip arthroscopy (in 74% [168]) or periacetabular osteotomy (in 23% [52]). Patients underwent a CT scan to measure acetabular version and femoral version using the Murphy (low < 10°; normal: 10° to 25°; high > 25°) or Reikerås (low < 5°; normal: 5° to 20°; high > 20°) technique. The McKibbin index was calculated (low: < 20°; normal: 20° to 50°; high > 50°). Based on the central acetabular version and femoral version as measured by Murphy, hips were grouped according to their rotational profile into four groups: unstable rotational profile: high (high acetabular version with high femoral version) or moderate (high acetabular version with normal femoral version or normal acetabular version with high femoral version); normal rotational profile (normal acetabular version with femoral version); compensatory rotational profile (low acetabular version with high femoral version or high acetabular version with low femoral version); and impingement rotational profile (low acetabular version with low femoral version): high (low acetabular version with low femoral version) or moderate (low acetabular version with normal femoral version or normal acetabular version with low femoral version). Radiographic assessments were manually performed on digitized images by two orthopaedic residents, and 25% of randomly selected measurements were repeated by the senior author, a fellowship-trained hip preservation and arthroplasty surgeon. Interobserver and intraobserver reliabilities were calculated using the correlation coefficient with a two-way mixed model, showing excellent agreement for Murphy technique measurements (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.908 [95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.97]) and Reikerås technique measurements (ICC 0.938 [95% CI 0.81 to 0.97]). Patient-reported measures were recorded using the International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-33) (0 to 100; worse to best).

Results

The mean acetabular version was 18° ± 6°, and mean femoral version was 24° ± 12° using the Murphy technique and 12° ± 11° with the Reikerås method. Eighty percent (181 of 227) of hips had normal acetabular version, 42% (96 of 227) to 63% (142 to 227) had normal femoral version per Murphy and Reikerås, respectively, and 67% (152 to 227) had a normal McKibbin index. Patients with an impingement profile (low acetabular version or femoral version) were older (39 ± 9 years) than patients with an unstable (high acetabular version or femoral version; 33 ± 9 years; p = 0.004), normal (33 ± 9 years; p = 0.02), or compensatory (high acetabular version with low femoral version or vice versa; 33 ± 7 years; p = 0.08) rotational profile. Using the Murphy technique, femoral version was 12° greater than with the Reikerås method (R 2 0.85; p < 0.001). There were no differences in iHOT-33 score between different groups (impingement: 32 ± 17 versus normal 35 ± 21 versus compensated: 34 ± 20 versus unstable: 31 ± 17; p = 0.40).

Conclusion

Variability in femoral version is twice as large as acetabular version. Patients with an impingement rotational profile were older than patients with a normal, compensatory, or unstable profile, indicating there are other variables not yet fully accounted for that lead to earlier pain and presentation in these groups. Important differences exist between measurement methods. This study shows that different measurement methods for femoral anteversion result in different numbers; if other authors compare their results to those of other studies, they should use equations such as the one suggested in this study.

### Acetabular labral tears of the hip in women [^2083eaeb]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Acetabular labral tears are a major cause of hip dysfunction in young patients and a primary precursor to hip osteoarthritis. In addition, labral disease more commonly occurs in women and can present with nonspecific symptoms. It is possible to diagnose, quantify, and treat labral tears before the onset of secondary joint deterioration. However, the diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, special attention to subtle patterns of presentation, and timely consideration for imaging studies. Treatment options are still evolving and include a wide array of nonsurgical and surgical techniques. Treatment should also address secondary dysfunction that can be associated with hip pathology. An initial trial of conservative management is recommended and failure to progress is an indication for surgical consultation.

### Closed reduction for developmental dysplasia of the hip: early-term results from a prospective, multicenter cohort [^f5853f6d]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2019). Medium credibility.

Achieving, and maintaining, a concentric reduction of the hip is one of the primary drivers of future acetabular growth and development. Although potential overlap is likely, rates of failed initial reduction across the literature vary between 6% and 25%, and rates of loss of reduction from 0% to 18%. In this cohort, 91% of hips were successfully reduced on the initial attempt, with 9% going on to fail CR at latest follow-up. Importantly, however, rates of failed initial reduction are likely to vary considerably based upon the treating surgeon's threshold for proceeding directly to open reduction. Nevertheless, our results fall within the lower half of the previously reported ranges, suggesting reasonable success may be achieved following CR.

Several factors have been proposed to increase risk of residual dysplasia following CR. In this study, we chose to measure residual dysplasia in 2 ways: objective acetabular measurements (acetabular index and IHDI grade) and the incidence of further corrective surgery. Regarding the former, no patient-specific factors in this cohort were predictive of worsened acetabular index, including prereduction IHDI grade, age at reduction, or final AVN status. Regarding the latter, 11% of hips in this study were treated with a subsequent acetabuloplasty and/or femoral osteotomy, although that rate will likely rise with continued follow-up. In comparison, rates of further corrective surgery across the literature range as high as 57% to 100%, with the majority of published studies identifying a frequency ≤ 35%. In contrast to the acetabular index, we did observe that increased age at the time of CR predicted a higher rate of further corrective surgery, which is consistent with Luhmann et al'sobservation that delaying CR may increase the need for later intervention.

### What mid-term patient-reported outcome measure scores, reoperations, and complications are associated with concurrent hip arthroscopy and periacetabular osteotomy to treat dysplasia with associated intraarticular abnormalities? [^d1467b41]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) is a well-accepted treatment for acetabular dysplasia, but treatment success is not uniform. Concurrent hip arthroscopy has been proposed for select patients to address intraarticular abnormalities. The patient-reported outcomes, complications, and reoperations for concurrent arthroscopy and PAO to treat acetabular dysplasia remain unclear.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What are the functional outcome scores among select patients treated with PAO plus concurrent hip arthroscopy at mid-term follow-up? (2) What factors are associated with conversion to THA or persistent symptoms (modified Harris hip score ≤ 70 or WOMAC pain subscore ≥ 10)? (3) What proportion of patients underwent further hip preservation surgery at mid-term follow-up? (4) What are the complications associated with the procedure?

Methods

Between November 2005 and December 2012, 78 patients (81 hips) who presented with symptomatic acetabular dysplasia-defined as a lateral center-edge angle less than 20° with hip pain for more than 3 months that interfered with daily function-had undergone unsuccessful nonsurgical treatment, had associated intraarticular abnormalities on MRI, and underwent combined hip arthroscopy and PAO. Eleven patients did not have minimum 4-year follow-up and were excluded, leaving 67 patients (70 hips) who met our inclusion criteria and had a mean follow-up duration of 6.5 ± 1.6 years. We retrospectively evaluated patient-reported outcomes at final follow-up using the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score, the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), and the WOMAC pain subscore. Conversion to THA or persistent symptoms were considered clinical endpoints. Repeat surgical procedures were drawn from a prospectively maintained database, and major complications were graded according to the validated Clavien-Dindo classification (Grade III or IV). Student t-tests, chi-square tests, and Fisher exact tests identified the association of patient factors, radiographic measures, and surgical details with clinical endpoints. For patients who underwent bilateral procedures, only the first hip was included in our analyses.

Results

At final follow-up, the mean mHHS for all patients improved from a mean ± SD of 55 ± 19 points to 85 ± 17 points (p < 0.001), the UCLA activity score improved from 6.5 ± 2.7 points to 7.5 ± 2.2 points (p = 0.01), and the WOMAC pain score improved from 9.1 ± 4.3 points to 3.2 ± 3.9 points (p < 0.001). Three percent (2 of 67) of patients underwent subsequent THA, while 21% (15 of 70) of hips were persistently symptomatic, defined as mHHS less than or equal to 70 or WOMAC pain subscore greater than or equal to 10. Univariate analyses indicated that no patient demographics, preoperative or postoperative radiographic metrics, or intraoperative findings or procedures were associated with subsequent THA or symptomatic hips. Worse baseline mHHS and WOMAC pain scores were associated with subsequent THA or symptomatic hips. Seven percent (5 of 67) of patients underwent repeat hip preservation surgery for recurrent symptoms, and 4% (3 of 67) of patients had major complications (Clavien-Dindo Grade III or IV).

Conclusion

This study demonstrated that concurrent hip arthroscopy and PAO to treat symptomatic acetabular dysplasia (with intraarticular abnormalities) has good clinical outcomes at mid-term follow-up in many patients; however, persistent symptoms or conversion to THA affected almost a quarter of the sample. We noted an acceptable complication profile. Further study is needed to directly compare this approach to more traditional techniques that do not involve arthroscopy. We do not use isolated hip arthroscopy to treat symptomatic acetabular dysplasia.

### Demographic differences in adolescent-diagnosed and adult-diagnosed acetabular dysplasia compared with infantile developmental dysplasia of the hip [^2bdced52]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acetabular dysplasia is a common cause of hip pain that can lead to premature osteoarthritis. This study explores whether demographic characteristics of patients diagnosed with acetabular dysplasia in adolescence and adulthood [adult-diagnosed dysplasia (AD)] differ from those who are diagnosed with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in infancy.

Methods

Database review identified 633 patients undergoing periacetabular osteotomy for dysplasia from August 1991 to January 2008. Excluding patients with syndromal conditions and 80 lacking contact information, 421 patients received a questionnaire regarding birth and family history; 324 (70.3%) completed the survey. Thirteen were excluded because of unrelated hip conditions, leaving 311 patients for analysis.

Results

Respondents were divided into 2 groups according to whether they had a history of DDH in infancy (102 patients) or were diagnosed in adolescence/adulthood (209 patients). Statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) were found in sex distribution (female: DDH = 98.0%, AD = 88.0%), affected limb (left hip: DDH = 33.3%, AD = 19.1%), bilaterality (DDH = 45.1%, AD = 61.2%), and breech presentation (DDH = 25.3%, AD = 9.4%). Over 50% of all the respondents had a family history of hip disease; over 40% were first-order relatives. First-order family members of patients with AD had a higher incidence of hip replacement by the age of 65 (50.0% vs. 22.7%). Patients with DDH were more likely to have first-order family members with DDH (59.0% vs. 15.8%).

Conclusions

This study confirms demographic differences between patients diagnosed with hip dysplasia in infancy versus adolescence/adulthood and supports the hypothesis that these represent distinct forms of dysplasia. In both, there is a familial tendency toward hip disease with a higher incidence of arthroplasty in the AD group's family members and higher frequency of infantile dysplasia in the DDH group's family members.

Clinical Relevance

Infantile DDH is diagnosed with neonatal examination and patients are routinely followed into adolescence. Adolescent/adult AD is not detected until symptoms develop. Further study is needed to determine whether younger family members of patients with hip osteoarthritis should be screened to detect potentially at-risk hips.

### Does severity of acetabular dysplasia influence clinical outcomes after periacetabular osteotomy? – A case-control study [^88a69a6e]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Detailed characterization of factors influencing post-periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) outcome could guide treatment offered.

Methods

Using a prospective, multicenter database of PAOs, 61 hips/patients (51 females) with lesser dysplasia (acetabular index < 15° and lateral center-edge angle > 15°) were case-control matched for age, gender, body mass index, Tönnis grade, and joint congruency (P = 0.6-.9) with a "comparison group" of pronounced dysplasia (n = 183), aiming to assess whether severity of acetabular dysplasia has an effect on outcome following PAO and/or the ability to achieve desired acetabular correction.

Results

At 4 ± 1.5 years, no differences in complication or reoperation rates were detected between the groups (P = 0.29). Lesser dysplastic hips had inferior Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, both preoperatively (52 vs 59) and postoperatively (73 vs 78); however, similar improvements were seen. Among the lesser dysplastic hips, those that required a femoral osteochondroplasty at PAO had significantly inferior preoperative Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (48 ± 18). Increased ability to achieve optimum correction was seen (80% vs 59%, P = 0.4) in lesser dysplasia.

Conclusion

A PAO is safe and efficacious in the treatment of lesser dysplasia. Further study on the identification of the optimum treatment modality for the mildly dysplastic hips with cam deformity is required.

### Identifying risk factors for disease progression in developmental dysplasia of the hip using a contralateral hip model [^a3c36240]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) can cause pain and premature osteoarthritis. The risk factors and timing for disease progression in adolescents and young adults have not been fully defined. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for contralateral hip pain and surgery after periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) on a dysplastic hip.

Methods

Patients undergoing unilateral PAO for DDH were followed for at least 2 years and categorized into contralateral pain and no-pain groups and contralateral surgery and no-surgery groups. Pain was defined with the modified Harris hip score. Univariate analysis tested group differences in demographics, radiographic measures, and range of motion. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess pain development and surgery in the contralateral hip over time. Multivariable regression identified risk factors for contralateral pain and surgery. Contralateral pain and surgery predictors were secondarily assessed after categorization of the contralateral hips as dysplastic, borderline, and non-dysplastic and in subgroups based on the lateral center-edge angle (LCEA) and acetabular inclination (AI) in 5° increments.

Results

One hundred and eighty-four patients were followed for a mean of 4.6 ± 1.6 years (range, 2.0 to 8.8 years), during which 51% (93) reported contralateral hip pain and 33% (60) underwent contralateral surgery. Kaplan-Meier analysis predicted 5-year survivorship of 49% with contralateral pain development as the end point and 66% with contralateral surgery as the end point. Painful hips exhibited more severe dysplasia compared with no-pain hips (LCEA = 16.5° versus 20.3°, p < 0.001; AI = 13.2° versus 10.0°, p < 0.001). AI was the sole predictor of pain, with every 1° increase in the AI raising the risk by 11%. Surgically treated hips also had more severe dysplasia (LCEA = 14.9° versus 20.0°, p < 0.001; AI = 14.7° versus 10.2°, p < 0.001) and were in younger patients (21.6 versus 24.1 years, p = 0.022). AI and a maximum alpha angle of ≥ 55° were predictors of contralateral surgery.

Conclusions

At 5 years after hip PAO, approximately 50% of contralateral hips will have pain and approximately 35% can be expected to need surgery. More severe dysplasia, based on the LCEA and AI, increases the risk of contralateral hip pain and surgery, with AI being a predictor of both outcomes. Knowing these risks can inform patient counseling and treatment planning.

### Closed reduction for developmental dysplasia of the hip: early-term results from a prospective, multicenter cohort [^ba41f65c]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2019). Medium credibility.

Encompassing a spectrum from mild dysplasia to frank dislocation, developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is one of the most common developmental deformities of the lower extremities and one of the leading causes of future osteoarthritis and hip arthroplasty. The goal of treatment is to achieve a stable, concentric reduction to facilitate normal femoral head development and continued acetabular growth and remodeling.–For those infants who fail initial nonsurgical management, or those who present late, treatment often involves closed reduction (CR) and spica casting. Although this procedure is generally successful, concerns persist about the risk for iatrogenic avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head and its associated impact on long-term outcomes and function.–Other adverse outcomes may include redislocation and the need for further corrective surgery to address residual dysplasia.

Although a variety of demographic and baseline characteristics have been proposed to influence outcomes, conflicting reports have often been described for each. Because of the mixed results following a failure of reduction, as well as the long-term negative impact of AVN, the role of CR in the management of DDH is increasingly being questioned. There is, however, a relative dearth of prospectively collected data guiding such decision-making. Therefore, the purpose of this multicenter study group was to establish a representative cohort of dislocated hips that may be followed prospectively to ascertain accurate long-term success and complications rates following CR for infantile DDH. For this investigation, the authors sought to determine early-term outcomes following CR, as well as potential risk factors for failure of therapy and the future development of AVN.

### Management of developmental dysplasia of the hip in young adults: current concepts [^5a39abab]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The term developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) describes a spectrum of disorders that results in abnormal development of the hip joint. If not treated successfully in childhood, these patients may go on to develop hip symptoms and/or secondary osteoarthritis in adulthood. In this review we describe the altered anatomy encountered in adults with DDH along with the management options, and the challenges associated with hip arthroscopy, osteotomies and arthroplasty for the treatment of DDH in young adults.

### A rare case report of tuberculous infection in a previously neglected dysplastic hip of a young woman [^92090bca]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Developmental dysplasia of hip encompasses a wide spectrum of anatomic hip abnormalities that affect the development and stability of the hip. These abnormalities can range from subtle acetabular dysplasia to complete subluxation or dislocation of the femoral head. Developing countries do offer the other end of spectrum of this disease for a dislocated hip, many presenting after the walking age. Presentation in the periadolescent age group is also not infrequently found. The aim of treatment usually in cases presenting early is to achieve a stable and concentrically-located joint and satisfactory development of the hip which is achieved surgically. It is assumed that the outcome of treatment is inversely related to the age at presentation. Left untreated, these dysplastic hips lead to an abnormal gait pattern and osteoarthritis by early adulthood. Surgical intervention at old age is met with other sets of difficulties like extensive soft-tissue contractures, high riding femoral head, and a dysplastic acetabulum added to the risk of complications including osteonecrosis of femoral head and uncertainty about the radiological and clinical outcome of the procedure. Many of these hips even if left untreated function well, especially bilateral cases, for another 2 to 3 decades before developing changes of osteoarthritis. Few authors suggest to avoid surgical intervention beyond the age of 8 to 10 years and to follow the policy of wilful neglect and continued observation owing to the poor remodeling potential of the acetabulum. However, there are others who suggest treatment by open reduction adequate shortening (up to 5 cm) with derotation, and limited varization if needed, tight capsulorrhaphy, and appropriate pelvic reconstruction (Salter or triple acetabular osteotomy) with an average age at operation around 10.6 years (range 8 to 18 years) reporting good results in 79% cases. They offer that older children presenting with unilateral or bilateral dislocation of the hip should be treated, unless there is an underlying systemic disorder contraindicating the operation. Addition of TB to this already existing controversy further complicates the matter and limits the treatment options to few. The pain, loss of movement, and progressive development of deformity results in the loss of function of an already compromised hip with a poor overall function. Early diagnosis is of paramount importance in the treatment of TB and its outcome. In the past 3 decades, extensive research was performed on the diagnosis and management of TB. Besides clinical features, serological, radiological and molecular diagnostic methods including polymerase chain reaction are available easily. Osteoarticular TB still comprises a significant number of patients among the total TB burden in our country. The cases of multidrug-resistant TB is also on a rise secondary to inappropriate antitubercular chemotherapy without drug testing. Synovial TB is primarily considered to be a medical disease and surgical intervention is reserved for advanced joint destruction. In this case, surgical options regarding reconstruction of the hip were not available owing to a previously dysplastic state, and hence, more stress was given to the medical mode of treatment. The morphological classification proposed by Shanmugasundaramfor tuberculous hips cannot be effectively used in this case because the dislocation is not secondary to TB but an independent preexisting anomaly. Early institution of appropriate chemotherapy is of paramount importance in the management of joint TB to prevent irreversible destruction and deformities. The patient was counseled regarding the future possible courses of the current state and development of osteoarthritis that may require surgical intervention in the form of complex arthroplasty or arthrodesis in single or multiple settings. The parents were also counseled regarding the guarded outcomes of arthroplasty in these cases and that one procedure might not be the best in that case.

### Editorial commentary: hip arthroscopy evolution and causes of failure [^04aef161]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Hip arthroscopy use has grown as a result of expanding indications; improved imaging including higher resolution magnetic resonance imaging with stronger magnetic fields and the advent of 3-dimensional computed tomography revealing the nuances of hip joint morphology; increased specialized training; improvements in instruments and implants; a record of successful outcomes; and increased understanding of microinstability, focal acetabular undercoverage or occult dysplasia, indications for labral reconstruction and capsular plication, and, most of all, femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, the leading diagnosis for which hip arthroscopy is performed, in the orthopaedic community as well as the general medical and athletic communities. We now know that labral repair results in better outcomes than labral debridement, and evidence suggests that capsule closure leads to better long-term success. Osteoarthritis and its correlate, advanced age, result in inferior survivorship after hip arthroscopy, which is unsurprising; hip preservation surgery is not designed to treat irreparable cartilage damage. Association of female sex with hip arthroscopy failure requires additional investigation. More females undergo hip arthroscopy than males, and females initially present with greater disability. Females tend to have smaller alpha angles, greater femoral and acetabular anteversion, and lower center edge angles than males, consistent with increased prevalence of hip dysplasia. Thus surgeons indicating females for hip arthroscopy should be aware of atypical locations of cam lesions, borderline dysplasia, or ligamentous laxity, all of which must be appropriately respected at the time of surgery. With all of the improvements we have made in techniques, patient diagnosis and surgical indications, and our overall understanding of complex anatomy and a technically challenging surgery, we can speculate that our long-term survivorship will only improve. I await with interest the long-term outcomes we will see 10 years from today, with the addition of insight from patient-reported outcome measures to answer these questions with greater certainty.

Hip osteoarthritis (OA) risk factors — Age is emphasized as the most common predisposing factor: the condition primarily affects middle-aged and elderly people, most often those over 60 years, and in one study age was associated with hip OA with adjusted odds ratio of 1.30 (95% CI: 0.60–2.81) for ages 60 to 64 years, 2.38 (95% CI: 0.83–3.44) for ages 65 to 69 years, and 2.38 (95% CI: 1.15–4.92) for ages 70 to 74 years. The majority of the evidence also shows that dysplasia of the femur and the acetabulum is associated with hip OA, and studies of non-Caucasian populations including Asian, African, and East Indian populations indicate a very low prevalence of primary hip OA when compared to that of Caucasians of European ancestry.

Stable hip with ultrasound imaging abnormalities — limited evidence supports observation without a brace for infants with a clinically stable hip with morphologic ultrasound imaging abnormalities, with Strength of Recommendation: Limited. For an infant with a normal physical examination and ultrasound abnormalities, there is limited evidence to support observation without treatment with serial ultrasound evaluation up to 6 weeks of age. One low-strength study in at-risk patients evaluated by ultrasound between two and six weeks of age with clinically stable hips and ultrasonographic abnormalities randomized patients to treatment with Pavlik harness or observation. The two primary outcome measures were the acetabular coverage on ultrasound and acetabular index on radiograph, and while acetabular coverage improved in both groups and was statistically better in the splinted group at the final three-month follow-up, there was no difference in acetabular index. The risk of implementing this recommendation is that necessary treatment could be delayed.

Natural history of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in infancy — most DDH detected in the newborn period appear to represent hip laxity and immaturity, and many early abnormalities resolve without treatment, with approximately 60%–80% of abnormalities identified by physical examination and more than 90% identified by ultrasound (US) appearing to resolve spontaneously in early infancy. The long‑term course relates to type and severity, as mild dysplasia may never manifest clinically or become apparent until adult life, whereas severe dysplasia can present clinically with functional limitations during childhood.

### Patient selection criteria for periacetabular osteotomy or rotational acetabular osteotomy [^9321edde]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hip dysplasia is the most common cause of secondary osteoarthritis (OA). Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) or rotational acetabular osteotomy (RAO) has been used as a joint-preserving procedure. However, the patient selection criteria are not clearly defined.

Questions/Purposes

Based on a systematic review, we identified reported patient selection criteria for PAO or RAO.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of RAO and 18 studies met our inclusion criteria. For the PAO, the systemic review performed by Clohisy et al. was used. WHERE ARE WE NOW? For patients with symptomatic hip dysplasia, lateral center-edge angle less than 10° to 30°, radiographic pre- or early OA, mean age at the time of surgery of 18 to 45 years, and improvement in joint congruency on AP radiograph with hip abduction, radiographic deformity correction consistently improved hip function in all studies. Radiographic OA progression was noted in 5% to 33% at 3.2 to 20 years postoperatively. Clinical score and prevention of radiographic OA progression of patients 50 years or older or with advanced stage were worse in younger patients or those with early stage. WHERE DO WE NEED TO GO? The key challenges are (1) preoperative evaluation of articular cartilage; (2) indication for older patients; (3) prevention of secondary femoroacetabular impingement; and (4) intraarticular treatment combined with PAO or RAO. HOW DO WE GET THERE? Future prospective, longitudinal cohort studies need to determine optimal patient selection criteria, risk factors for clinical failure, optimal deformity correction parameters, and the role of adjunctive surgical procedures.

### Acetabular considerations during total hip arthroplasty for hip dysplasia [^3eb1dbdf]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The wide spectrum of anatomic abnormalities that characterize hip dysplasia dictate the need for different reconstructive techniques when hip replacement is required. Multiple factors such as young age and high activity level of this patient population, coupled with the increased complexity of surgery, explain the somewhat elevated historical failure rate of hip arthroplasty in DDH and emphasize the need for careful analysis of each case and selection of the most appropriate reconstruction options. One particular problem specific to acetabular reconstruction is the deficient bone stock that may limit the ability to place the component fully on native bone at the true acetabular region. When standard techniques of reconstruction leave a significant portion of the component uncovered, the alternatives include acetabular augmentation with bone autograft, intentional high placement of the component, or medialization of the component with or without medial wall osteotomy. Uncemented sockets have provided promising midterm results with supplemental bone augmentation and are the authors' preferred method of treatment for hips with moderate dysplasia and anterolateral acetabular bone deficiency.

### Are there sex-dependent differences in acetabular dysplasia characteristics? [^802819bf]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients who undergo periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) for symptomatic acetabular dysplasia experience decreased pain and improved function, yet some experience inadequate clinical improvement. The etiologies of treatment failure have not been completely defined, and sex-dependent disease characteristics that may be associated with less pain relief are not understood.

Question/Purposes

We sought to determine whether there were clinically important sex-specific differences between male and female patients undergoing PAO for acetabular dysplasia in terms of (1) clinical parameters (anthropomorphic traits and hip scores), (2) radiographic findings, and (3) intraoperative findings at the time of PAO, in particular findings potentially associated with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) such as chondromalacia at the head-neck junction, impingement trough, or reduced head-neck offset.

Methods

Between 2007 and 2012 we treated 245 patients (270 hips) with a PAO for symptomatic acetabular dysplasia. Of those, 16 patients (16 hips; 6%) had insufficient documentation for review in the medical record and another 49 patients (51 hips; 19%) met prespecified exclusion criteria, leaving 180 patients (203 hips; 75%) for analysis in this retrospective study. One hundred thirty-nine patients were females and 41 were males. Clinical data including patient demographics, physical examination, patient self-reported outcome scores, radiographic morphologic features, and intraoperative findings were collected prospectively as part of an institutional registry. Statistical analysis was performed with univariate and multivariate analyses.

Results

Mean age was similar among sexes; however, BMI was greater in males compared with females (26 versus 24 kg/m(2); p = 0.002). Males had less hip ROM including internal rotation at 90° flexion (14° ± 13.8° versus 25° ± 16.2°; p = 0.001). Males had higher preoperative UCLA (7 ± 2, versus 6 ± 2; p = 0.02) and Harris hip scores (63 ± 15 versus 58 ± 16; p = 0.04). Radiographically, a crossover sign (88% versus 39%; p < 0.001) and posterior wall sign (92% versus 63%; p < 0.001) were more common in males. Males had greater alpha angles on the frog lateral (63° ± 15.3° versus 58° ± 16°; p = 0.04) and Dunn radiograph views (64° ± 15.5° versus 56° ± 14.8°; p = 0.02). The incidence of femoral head-neck chondromalacia (62% versus 82%; p = 0.03) and an impingement trough observed at surgery was greater in males (35% versus 17%; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed differences between the sexes for reduced internal rotation in flexion, a higher Dunn alpha angle, increased incidence of a crossover sign, and a lower anterior center-edge angle.

Conclusions

There are sex-dependent, disease characteristic differences in patients with symptomatic acetabular dysplasia. Most notably, male patients have a greater prevalence of clinical, radiographic, and intraarticular findings consistent with concurrent FAI and instability and potentially a heightened risk of secondary FAI after PAO, however postoperative and long-term followup are needed to confirm these findings and it remains unclear which patients need surgical correction of the impingement and instability. Preoperative evaluation of acetabular dysplasia in males should at least include careful attention to factors associated with symptomatic FAI; however, further studies are needed to determine when surgical correction is needed.

Potential benefits, harms, and contraindications related to developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) screening and early intervention — most treatments carry known risks, and potential harms include over diagnosis leading to unnecessary evaluation and treatment and under diagnosis leading to late diagnosis with progression of deformity; clinician input based upon experience decreases the probability of harms in both scenarios.

### Surgical treatment of hip dysplasia in children and adolescents [^fc3df20a]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Residual hip dysplasia (a relatively common condition in young children and adolescents) left undetected or partially treated, almost certainly leads to further progression of deformity, eventually ending in a nonfunctional, painful hip joint. Therefore, every effort should be made to identify and treat hip dysplasia early. The use of 3D imaging, including CT and MRI assessment, has enhanced the diagnosis and treatment of patients with dysplasia because they facilitate proper identification of important pathomorphologic anatomy and cartilage degeneration. Future studies should take these novel imaging modalities into consideration with the attempt to (re-) evaluate optimal selection criteria for surgery, risk factors for clinical failure and optimal deformity correction. Treatment of residual hip dysplasia requires corrective surgery. The goal of surgical treatment is to normalize joint loading by increasing the contact area and improving the level arm of the hip to forestall the development of OA. Proper selection and performance of a correction osteotomy and adjunctive procedures are prerequisites for a good clinical outcome and high survivorship of the reconstructed hip. Augmentation procedures, such as the Chiari osteotomy or the shelf procedure described by Staheli, remain as a salvage option in cases when irreversible cartilage damage is present or when reorientation is not feasible.

### Optimizing early hip maturation strategies in neonatal hip immaturity and dysplasia: a cohort study and network meta-analysis [^a1401a89]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) represents the predominant musculoskeletal condition in early childhood, with significant global health and economic impact. Early detection and non-operative treatment within six months of life, when acetabular remodeling potential peaks, yields optimal outcomes. Delayed or inadequate management can lead to premature osteoarthritis and early total hip arthroplasty.

Non-operative DDH management options include active surveillance, positioning techniques (double diapering), and bracing approaches (dynamic Pavlik harness, static orthoses). Controversy further exists regarding post-treatment protocols, particularly the role of harness weaning. Current American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) guidelines provide limited-strength recommendations for treatment decisions, notably lacking strong evidence for brace treatment in stable dysplastic hips. This uncertainty necessitates careful shared decision-making between practitioners and families.

Despite multiple trials, and systematic reviews, significant evidence gaps persist regarding comparative treatment effectiveness, particularly in early ultrasonographic progression and long-term radiographic outcomes. The sole existing meta-analysis on hip flexion splinting methods focused primarily on radiographic outcomes and treatment failure rates. To address these limitations, we developed a dual-methodology study comprising: (1) a prospectively-designed retrospective cohort analysis comparing dynamic splinting versus more conservative approaches (double diapering and active surveillance), with particular emphasis on evaluating dynamic splinting efficacy in stable hip immaturity - a clinical scenario where optimal management remains controversial, and understudied, and (2) a network meta-analysis synthesizing current evidence on non-operative management of hip immaturity and dysplasia. This comprehensive approach integrates new primary data addressing specific questions about hip maturation trajectories with contemporary evidence synthesis, aiming to provide clinicians with updated, evidence-based guidance for optimizing early hip maturation management.

### Detection and nonoperative management of pediatric developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants up to six months of age [^64d1d6f3]. AAOS (2022). High credibility.

Detection and nonoperative management of pediatric developmental dysplasia of the hip — study selection criteria for evidence synthesis exclude biomechanical and cadaver studies, require adequate sample size and follow-up, and restrict low-quality case series. Specifically, studies should have 10 or more patients per group, all study follow up durations are included, study results must be quantitatively presented, and for any given follow-up time point there must be ≥ 50% patient follow-up. Retrospective non-comparative case series, medical records review, meeting abstracts, historical articles, editorials, letters, and commentaries are excluded, as are case series that give patients the treatment of interest AND another treatment, those with non-consecutive enrollment, and all studies of "Very Low" strength of evidence.

### What is the impact of center variability in a multicenter international prospective observational study on developmental dysplasia of the hip? [^f311a57b]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Little information exists concerning the variability of presentation and differences in treatment methods for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in children < 18 months. The inherent advantages of prospective multicenter studies are well documented, but data from different centers may differ in terms of important variables such as patient demographics, diagnoses, and treatment or management decisions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a difference in baseline data among the nine centers in five countries affiliated with the International Hip Dysplasia Institute to establish the need to consider the center as a key variable in multicenter studies.

Questions/Purposes

(1) How do patient demographics differ across participating centers at presentation? (2) How do patient diagnoses (severity and laterality) differ across centers? (3) How do initial treatment approaches differ across participating centers?

Methods

A multicenter prospective hip dysplasia study database was analyzed from 2010 to April 2015. Patients younger than 6 months of age at diagnosis were included if at least one hip was completely dislocated, whereas patients between 6 and 18 months of age at diagnosis were included with any form of DDH. Participating centers (academic, urban, tertiary care hospitals) span five countries across three continents. Baseline data (patient demographics, diagnosis, swaddling history, baseline International Hip Dysplasia Institute classification, and initial treatment) were compared among all nine centers. A total of 496 patients were enrolled with site enrolment ranging from 10 to 117. The proportion of eligible patients who were enrolled and followed at the nine participating centers was 98%. Patient enrollment rates were similar across all sites, and data collection/completeness for relevant variables at initial presentation was comparable.

Results

In total, 83% of all patients were female (410 of 496), and the median age at presentation was 2.2 months (range, 0–18 months). Breech presentation occurred more often in younger (< 6 months) than in older (6–18 months at diagnosis) patients (30% [96 of 318] versus 9% [15 of 161]; odds ratio [OR], 4.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3–7.5; p < 0.001). The Australia site was underrepresented in breech presentation in comparison to the other centers (8% [five of 66] versus 23% [111 of 479]; OR, 0.3, 95% CI, 0.1–0.7; p = 0.034). The largest diagnostic category was < 6 months, dislocated reducible (51% [253 of 496 patients]); however, the Australia and Boston sites had more irreducible dislocations compared with the other sites (ORs, 2.1 and 1.9; 95% CIs, 1.2–3.6 and 1.1–3.4; p = 0.02 and 0.015, respectively). Bilaterality was seen less often in older compared with younger patients (8% [seven of 93] versus 26% [85 of 328]; p < 0.001). The most common diagnostic group was Grade 3 (by International Hip Dysplasia Institute classification), which included 58% (51 of 88) of all classified dislocated hips. Splintage was the primary initial treatment of choice at 80% (395 of 496), but was far more likely in younger compared with older patients (94% [309 of 328] versus 18% [17 of 93]; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

With the lack of strong prognostic indicators for DDH identified to date, the center is an important variable to include as a potential predictor of treatment success or failure.

### Magnetic resonance imaging follow-up can screen for soft tissue changes and evaluate the short-term prognosis of patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip after closed reduction [^7b5c783d]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can show the architecture of the hip joint clearly and has been increasingly used in developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) confirmation and follow-up. In this study, MRI was used to observe changes in the hip joints before and after closed reduction (CR) and to explore risk factors of residual acetabular dysplasia (RAD).

Methods

This is a prospective analysis of unilateral DDH patients with CR and spica cast in our hospital from October 2012 to July 2018. MRI and pelvic plain radiography were performed before and after CR. The labro-chondral complex (LCC) of the hip was divided into four types on MRI images. The variation in the thickening rate of the ligamentum teres, transverse ligaments, and pulvinar during MRI follow-up was analyzed, and the difference in cartilaginous acetabular head index was evaluated. The "complete relocation" rate of the femoral head was analyzed when the cast was changed for the last time, and the necrotic rate of the femoral head was evaluated after 18months or more after CR. Lastly, the risk factors of RAD were analyzed.

Results

A total of 63 patients with DDH and CR were included. The LCC was everted before CR and inverted after CR, and the ligamentum teres, transverse ligaments, and pulvinar were hypertrophic before and after CR, and then gradually returned to normal shape. The cartilaginous acetabular head index gradually increased to normal values. Complete relocation was observed in 58.7% of femoral heads, while 8.6% had necrosis. The abnormalities in LCC was related to RAD (OR: 4.35, P = 0.03), and the rate of type 3 LCC in the RAD group was higher. However, the IHDI classification (P = 0.09); the "complete relocation" of femoral heads (P = 0.61); and hypertrophy of the ligamentum teres (P = 1.00), transverse ligaments (P = 1.00), and pulvinar (P = 1.00) were not related to RAD.

Conclusions

In this study, MRI can observe the variations of the abnormal soft tissue structures of the diseased hips after CR and spica casting, and can evaluate which hips will have RAD after CR. Therefore, we can utilize MRI in DDH patients appropriately.

### Hip pain and mobility deficits-hip osteoarthritis: revision 2017 [^69788ba6]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis natural history and deformity-related risk — The natural history of hip OA is not completely understood; arthritic changes occur both inside and outside of the hip joint, resulting in loss of joint space, development of osteophytes, and subchondral sclerosis and cysts, and joint range of motion (ROM) is reduced with muscle weakness developing around the joint as OA progresses. Degenerative hip changes develop more frequently in those with developmental dysplasia, those with cam deformities develop hip OA more rapidly, and cam deformities that develop after slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) are related to early hip OA. Evidence updates note that degenerative hip changes occur most rapidly in those with developmental dysplasia of the hip, and in 121 patients with stable SCFE, 96 had signs of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and all 121 had some radiographic signs of hip OA.

### Screening strategies for hip dysplasia: long-term outcome of a randomized controlled trial [^a4800acf]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Screening for hip dysplasia is controversial. A previous randomized controlled trial revealed that adding universal or selective ultrasound to routine clinical examination gave a nonsignificant reduction in rates of late presenting cases, but with higher treatment rates. This study assesses differences in outcome at skeletal maturity for the 3 newborn screening strategies in terms of radiographic markers of acetabular dysplasia and early degenerative change and avascular necrosis (AVN) secondary to neonatal treatment.

Methods

From the initial trial including 11925 newborns, a population-based sample of 3935 adolescents was invited for follow-up at age 18 to 20 years. A standardized weight-bearing anteroposterior view was obtained. The outcomes evaluated were the radiographic findings of dysplasia (center-edge angle, femoral head extrusion-index, acetabular depth-width ratio, Sharp's angle, subjective evaluation of dysplasia) and degenerative change (joint-space width). Signs of AVN were documented.

Results

Of the 3935 subjects invited, 2038 (51.8%) attended the maturity review, of which 2011 (58.2% female patients) were included: 551, 665, and 795 subjects from the universal, selective, and clinical groups, respectively. Rates per group of positive radiographic findings associated with dysplasia or degenerative change varied depending on radiographic marker used. No statistically significant differences were detected between groups. No AVN was seen.

Conclusions

Although both selective and universal ultrasound screenings gave a nonsignificant reduction in rates of late cases when compared with expert clinical programs, we were unable to demonstrate any additional reduction in the rates of radiographic findings associated with acetabular dysplasia or degenerative change at maturity. Increased treatment rates were not associated with AVN.

### A 30-year follow-up study of rotational acetabular osteotomy for pre-and early-stage osteoarthritis secondary to dysplasia of the hip [^e7f638d8]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

The objective of this study was to present the outcomes of rotational acetabular osteotomy (RAO) over a 30-year period for osteoarthritis (OA) secondary to dysplasia of the hip in pre- or early-stage OA.

Methods

Between September 1987 and December 1994, we provided treatment to 47 patients (55 hips) with RAO for the management of pre- or early-stage OA due to developmental hip dysplasia. Of those, eight patients (11 hips) with pre-OA (follow-up rate 79%) and 27 patients (32 hips) with early-stage OA (follow-up rate 78%), totalling 35 patients (43 hips) (follow-up rate 78%), were available at a minimum of 28 years after surgery.

Results

In the pre-OA group, the mean Merle d'Aubigné score improved significantly from 14.5 points (SD 0.7) preoperatively to 17.4 points at final follow-up (SD 1.2; p = 0.004) and in the early-stage group, the mean score did not improve significantly from 14.0 (SD 0.3) to 14.6 (SD 2.4; p = 0.280). Radiologically, the centre-edge angle, acetabular roof angle, and head lateralization index were significantly improved postoperatively in both groups. Radiological progression of OA was observed in two patients (two hips) in the pre-OA group and 17 patients (18 hips) in the early-stage group. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, with radiological progression of OA as the primary outcome, projected a 30-year survival rate of 81.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.00) for the pre-OA group and 42.2% (95% CI 0.244 to 0.600) for the early-stage group. In all cases, the overall survival rate stood at 51.5% (95% CI 0.365 to 0.674) over a 30-year period, and when the endpoint was conversion to total hip arthroplasty, the survival rate was 74.0% (95% CI 0.608 to 0.873).

Conclusion

For younger patients with pre-OA, joint preservation of over 30 years can be expected after RAO.
