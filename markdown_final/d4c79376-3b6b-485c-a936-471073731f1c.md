## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to compile a list of muscle relaxants and outline the advantages and disadvantages of each. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the therapeutic categories and their indications. Then, I should review comparative efficacy and the quality of evidence for acute versus chronic low back pain. Next, I will examine individual agents' profiles and key drug–drug interactions. After that, I need to assess special populations and adverse event patterns. Finally, I will integrate these into practical prescribing guidance and close with a concise conclusion, while continuously verifying claims against the cited literature and correcting any overstatements I might make along the way.

> Let me first confirm the therapeutic categories and indications because conflating antispasmodics for musculoskeletal spasm with antispastics for upper motor neuron spasticity can lead to misprescribing; non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics are mainly for acute musculoskeletal conditions, whereas antispastics such as baclofen, tizanidine, and dantrolene are used for spasticity from disorders like multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury, and benzodiazepines form a separate class with limited roles due to harms and weak efficacy signals in these contexts [^117RKLed] [^115buLq2] [^111caYm8].

> I need to check the strength of evidence for non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics in acute low back pain because this often drives ED and primary care decisions; contemporary systematic reviews show small, short-term pain reductions that may not reach clinical importance, coupled with increased non-serious adverse events, and guideline bodies variably endorse their use as adjuncts when NSAIDs or acetaminophen are inadequate, whereas benefits in chronic low back pain are not demonstrated, so we should avoid assuming long-term efficacy here [^11697pkW] [^113ikMoi] [^115ChXYr] [^1135RyFH] [^114aKFE8] [^115Zh4py].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "the best" antispasmodic; head-to-head emergency department data do not show clinically meaningful differences in short-term functional improvement among commonly used agents versus placebo when all patients also receive NSAIDs, reinforcing that selection should be driven by safety, tolerability, comorbidities, and interactions rather than presumed superior efficacy of a particular drug [^117KEJds] [^117RKLed].

> Now, regarding cyclobenzaprine, I should confirm its evidence base and tradeoffs; it is the most studied antispasmodic for acute musculoskeletal pain with consistent short-term benefits and sedation that may help patients with spasms and insomnia, but it has no proven benefit in chronic low back pain and mixed signals in myofascial pain trials, including an orofacial myofascial pain RCT with no advantage over placebo and earlier small RCTs showing short-term benefit, so I need to present that heterogeneity transparently [^117RKLed] [^1135RyFH] [^1133CcKW] [^1176YjyV].

> Wait, let me verify the serotonin syndrome statement for cyclobenzaprine; my initial impulse is to say it is "contraindicated" with serotonergic drugs, but that overstates the labeling across the class — what is strongly supported is that concomitant use with serotonergic agents raises the risk of serotonin syndrome, warranting avoidance or stringent caution and monitoring, particularly when combined with opioids or other CNS depressants that elevate the risks of respiratory depression and sedation [^11614HwU] [^115rovcJ].

> For metaxalone, let me consider both dosing and real-world tolerability; it is generally less sedating than cyclobenzaprine or tizanidine and dosed at 800 mg every six to eight hours, yet robust efficacy data are limited and, like other non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics, there is an increased risk of non-serious adverse events versus control and a theoretical serotonergic risk in combinations, so I should emphasize caution with polypharmacy and expectation management about benefits [^117RKLed] [^1123PXHW] [^11697pkW] [^11614HwU].

> Let me review carisoprodol carefully because misuse risk is clinically important; it is FDA-indicated for acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions but explicitly limited to short courses of two to three weeks due to lack of longer-term efficacy data, it has notable misuse and dependency concerns leading to withdrawal in several countries, and it offers no superiority over safer alternatives, so I should urge strong stewardship if it is used at all [^114U3zQ5] [^114VZcZD] [^117RKLed].

> I should double-check methocarbamol and orphenadrine; methocarbamol is often less sedating but has limited evidence for effectiveness and showed the smallest functional improvement in one ED comparative analysis, while orphenadrine did not demonstrate advantage in acute low back pain in similar analyses, reminding me not to over-interpret anecdotal impressions of benefit [^117RKLed] [^117KEJds].

> Shifting to antispastics, I will now examine baclofen, tizanidine, and dantrolene for spasticity due to upper motor neuron lesions; guidelines provide Level A recommendations for these agents in MS-related spasticity, with baclofen available intrathecally for refractory disease, although sedation often limits oral titration and intrathecal delivery carries both pharmacologic and mechanical complication risks that must be weighed carefully in shared decision-making [^111caYm8] [^115buLq2] [^115kHsWp] [^116Lock5].

> But wait, what about safety in vulnerable populations using antispastics; older adults prescribed baclofen or tizanidine have higher observed risks of serious injuries compared with cyclobenzaprine in retrospective cohorts, and hemodialysis patients exposed to muscle relaxants experience increased altered mental status and falls, so I should flag renal impairment and geriatric risk as red flags for conservative dosing, closer monitoring, or alternative strategies [^115HEzmN] [^112RQL8w].

> Next, I should review a critical drug–drug interaction for tizanidine; concomitant ciprofloxacin, a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor, raises tizanidine plasma concentrations and significantly increases the odds of hypotension in observational cohorts, so I need to explicitly advise avoiding this combination or choosing an alternative antibiotic when feasible and to titrate tizanidine slowly because of sedation and blood pressure effects despite its relatively rapid onset [^1147vWyf] [^117RKLed].

> Regarding dantrolene, let me reconsider the safety profile; efficacy for spasticity is supported in comparative reviews and guidelines, but I should acknowledge that while hepatotoxicity is a well-known clinical concern, detailed incidence data were not provided in the materials here, so I will emphasize periodic liver function assessment and individualized risk–benefit discussions without overstating unprovided figures [^111caYm8] [^115buLq2].

> I need to check where benzodiazepines fit; in MS spasticity, guidelines advise against benzodiazepines due to insufficient efficacy and frequent adverse events, and broader pain literature highlights addiction potential and lack of meaningful benefit, with cohort data suggesting slower recovery in acute back pain when benzodiazepines are used, so they should generally be avoided for these indications [^113jKonH] [^1144YDEh].

> Let me synthesize general principles across all muscle relaxants; they can offer short-term pain relief for acute low back pain when first-line agents fail or are not tolerated, but the magnitude of benefit is small, adverse events like drowsiness and dizziness are common, treatment discontinuation is not consistently increased, and there is no proven benefit in chronic low back pain, so expectations and durations should be conservative with transparent patient counseling about uncertainty and tradeoffs [^114aKFE8] [^11697pkW] [^113ikMoi] [^1135RyFH] [^117RKLed].

> Hold on, I should verify duration guidance; while I initially thought all antispasmodics are "restricted" to two to three weeks, that exact limitation is explicit for carisoprodol's label and more generally reflected as a short-term strategy in reviews and guidelines rather than a universal labeling rule, so a pragmatic approach is to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest feasible course and avoid chronic use absent a spasticity indication [^114U3zQ5] [^117RKLed] [^113ikMoi].

> I need to ensure key safety advisories are front and center; combining muscle relaxants with opioids, benzodiazepines, alcohol, or other CNS depressants increases risks of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death, and serotonergic combinations raise the risk of serotonin syndrome with agents like cyclobenzaprine or metaxalone, so clinicians should avoid high-risk coprescribing, limit doses and durations, consider naloxone where warranted, and vigilantly monitor for toxicity, while also remembering the tizanidine–ciprofloxacin interaction [^11614HwU] [^115rovcJ] [^1147vWyf].

> Let me translate this into a practical selection strategy without overpromising; for acute musculoskeletal spasm, start with nonpharmacologic care and NSAIDs or acetaminophen, consider a short course of a non-benzodiazepine antispasmodic if needed, choose the agent based on patient-specific sedation tolerance, comorbidities, renal function, and interaction profile rather than presumed superior efficacy, and avoid benzodiazepines; for spasticity due to MS or other upper motor neuron causes, consider baclofen, tizanidine, or dantrolene per guidelines, titrate carefully, and reserve intrathecal baclofen for refractory cases with full counseling on device and pharmacologic risks [^117KEJds] [^117RKLed] [^111caYm8] [^113ikMoi].

> In conclusion, I should double-check that the bottom line is balanced: there is no clear winner among antispasmodics for acute low back pain, benefits are modest and short-term, harms are common but usually non-serious, chronic low back pain lacks supportive evidence for these drugs, and safety concerns loom larger in older adults, renally impaired patients, and those on interacting regimens; prescribing should therefore be indication-driven, cautious, and time-limited, with explicit avoidance of high-risk combinations and careful monitoring when used [^117KEJds] [^11697pkW] [^1135RyFH] [^112RQL8w] [^11614HwU].

Muscle relaxants are indicated for acute musculoskeletal pain [^114aKFE8] and spasticity [^111caYm8]; however, **short-term use only** is recommended because of the risks of sedation, falls, and dependence. Avoid use for **chronic pain** [^1135RyFH] and in **older adults** [^113f563n] when possible, and select agents based on patient **comorbidities** and **adverse-effect profiles** [^117RKLed].

| **Drug** | **Indications** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Cyclobenzaprine | Acute musculoskeletal spasm | Effective short-term; improves sleep [^117RKLed] | Sedation, anticholinergic effects, serotonin syndrome risk [^11614HwU], avoid in elderly [^113f563n] |
| Methocarbamol | Acute musculoskeletal spasm | Less sedation; fewer anticholinergic effects [^117RKLed] | Dizziness, drowsiness, GI upset, caution in renal impairment |
| Metaxalone | Acute musculoskeletal spasm | Minimal sedation; fewer cognitive effects [^117RKLed] | Hepatotoxicity, serotonin syndrome risk [^11614HwU], expensive |
| Carisoprodol | Acute musculoskeletal spasm | Rapid onset | High abuse potential, sedation, dependence, short-term use only [^114U3zQ5] |
| Baclofen | Spasticity (MS, SCI) | Effective for spasticity [^111caYm8] | Sedation, dizziness, withdrawal seizures, caution in elderly [^115HEzmN] [^113f563n] |
| Tizanidine | Spasticity (MS, SCI) | Effective for spasticity [^111caYm8] | Sedation, hypotension [^1147vWyf], hepatotoxicity, CYP1A2 interactions [^1147vWyf] |
| Diazepam | Acute spasm, anxiety | Anxiolytic, rapid onset | Sedation, dependence, respiratory depression [^notfound], avoid in elderly |
| Dantrolene | Malignant hyperthermia, spasticity | Effective for malignant hyperthermia | Hepatotoxicity [^115buLq2], muscle weakness, sedation |
| Orphenadrine | Acute musculoskeletal spasm | Anticholinergic analgesic effects | Sedation, anticholinergic effects, confusion in elderly [^117RKLed] |
| Chlorzoxazone | Acute musculoskeletal spasm | Mild sedation | Hepatotoxicity [^117RKLed], dizziness, GI upset |

For **clinical guidance**, **limit use to acute pain** [^114aKFE8]; avoid use for chronic pain [^1135RyFH] and in older adults when possible [^113f563n]; and monitor for sedation, falls, and dependence.

### Association of skeletal muscle relaxers and antihistamines on mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits in elderly patients: A nationwide retrospective cohort study [^1154RKAM]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

High-risk medication exposure in the elderly is common and associated with increased mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department (ED) visits. Skeletal muscle relaxants and antihistamines are high-risk medications commonly prescribed in elderly patients. The objective of this study was to determine the association between skeletal muscle relaxants or antihistamines and mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits.

- **Methods**: This study used a new-user, retrospective cohort design using national Veteran Affairs (VA) data from 128 hospitals. Veterans aged ≥ 65 years on October 1, 2005, who received VA inpatient/outpatient care at least once in each of fiscal year (FY) 2005 and FY 2006 were included. Exposure to skeletal muscle relaxants and antihistamines was defined by the National Committee for Quality Assurance Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set measures for high-risk medications in the elderly. Primary outcomes identified within one year of exposure were death, ED visit, or hospitalization. ED visits or hospitalizations due to falls and fractures were also assessed. Propensity score matching (1 to 1 match) was used to balance covariates between exposed patients and non-exposed patients.

- **Results**: In this cohort of 1,807,404 patients, 55,566 patients were included in the propensity-matched cohort for skeletal muscle relaxants, and 60,058 patients were included in the propensity-matched cohort for antihistamines. Mortality was lower in skeletal muscle relaxants-exposed patients (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.81–0.9).

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen [^11614HwU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Due to additive pharmacologic effects, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. These CNS depressants include:

- **Benzodiazepines and sedative hypnotics**: benzodiazepines, other sedative hypnotics
- **Anxiolytics and tranquilizers**: anxiolytics, tranquilizers
- **Muscle relaxants and anesthetics**: muscle relaxants, general anesthetics
- **Antipsychotics and opioids**: antipsychotics, other opioids
- **Other substances**: alcohol

Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required and follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see WARNINGS].

- **Serotonergic drugs**: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system can result in serotonin syndrome. These drugs include:
	- **Antidepressants and related medications**: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)
	- **Migraine and emesis drugs**: triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists
	- **Other serotonergic drugs**: drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g. mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol)
	- **Muscle relaxants**: certain muscle relaxants (i.e. cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone)
	- **MAO inhibitors**: monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors — including those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue

If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during initial stages of treatment [see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers].

### Choosing a skeletal muscle relaxant [^117RKLed]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Skeletal muscle relaxants are widely used in treating musculoskeletal conditions. However, evidence of their effectiveness consists mainly of studies with poor methodological design. In addition, these drugs have not been proven to be superior to acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for low back pain. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses support using skeletal muscle relaxants for short-term relief of acute low back pain when nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen are not effective or tolerated. Comparison studies have not shown one skeletal muscle relaxant to be superior to another.

Cyclobenzaprine is the most heavily studied and has been shown to be effective for various musculoskeletal conditions. The sedative properties of tizanidine and cyclobenzaprine may benefit patients with insomnia caused by severe muscle spasms. Methocarbamol and metaxalone are less sedating, although evidence of their effectiveness is limited. Adverse effects, particularly dizziness and drowsiness, are consistently reported with all skeletal muscle relaxants. The potential adverse effects should be communicated clearly to the patient. Because of limited comparable effectiveness data, the choice of agent should be based on side-effect profile, patient preference, abuse potential, and possible drug interactions.

### Soma [^114U3zQ5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

SOMA is indicated for the relief of discomfort associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in adults. It is a muscle relaxant used specifically for these conditions.

- **Limitation of use**: SOMA should only be used for short periods, up to two or three weeks, because adequate evidence of effectiveness for more prolonged use has not been established and because acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions are generally of short duration [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

### Risk of tizanidine-induced adverse events after concomitant exposure to ciprofloxacin: A cohort study in the U.S [^1147vWyf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Tizanidine's potent muscle relaxant properties and short onset of action make it desirable for pain management. However, concomitant use of tizanidine with ciprofloxacin, a strong inhibitor of the P450-CYP1A2 cytochrome metabolic pathway of tizanidine, can result in increased tizanidine plasma levels and associated adverse outcomes, particularly hypotension. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of hypotension with coadministration of tizanidine and ciprofloxacin.

- **Methods**: An observational nested cohort study of patients 18 years or older on tizanidine was conducted using data from electronic health records from 2000 to 2018 in the U.S. We estimated the prevalence and risk of hypotension associated with the DDI between tizanidine and ciprofloxacin using multivariable logistic regression models.

- **Results**: Our analysis included 70,110 encounters of patients on tizanidine across 221 hospitals. Most encounters included females (65.7%), whites (82.4%), with an average age of 56 years (SD 14.9) and an Elixhauser comorbidity index mean of 1.6 (SD 2.3). Ciprofloxacin was co-administered with tizanidine in 2487 encounters (3.6%). Compared to patients who did not receive ciprofloxacin, co-administration of tizanidine and ciprofloxacin was associated with an increased likelihood of hypotension (adjusted odds ratio: 1.43, 95% confidence intervals: 1.25–1.63, p-value < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that the concomitant use of tizanidine and ciprofloxacin is associated with an elevated risk of hypotension. The prevalence of co-administration of drugs with a likelihood of severe adverse events should prompt caution in clinical settings.

### Efficacy, acceptability, and safety of muscle relaxants for adults with non-specific low back pain: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^11697pkW]. BMJ (2021). High credibility.

- **Effect of muscle relaxants on pain intensity**: Fig 2 presents the effect of muscle relaxants compared to control on pain intensity (0–100 scale) at the immediate term (≤ 2 weeks) post-randomization for adults with low back pain. Negative values for mean differences indicate that effects favor muscle relaxants compared with control, whereas negative values for trial observations indicate change from baseline.

- **Summary of findings**: Table 2 shows the summary of findings and the certainty of evidence for low back pain in association with muscle relaxants. Data are mean differences for pain intensity on a 0 to 100 scale. Negative values for mean differences indicate that effects favor muscle relaxant medicines compared to control.

- **Disability and muscle relaxants**: Table 3 provides a summary of findings and the certainty of evidence for disability from low back pain in association with muscle relaxants. Data are mean differences for disability on a 0 to 100 scale. Again, negative values for mean differences indicate that effects favor muscle relaxant medicines compared to control.

- **Acceptability of muscle relaxants**: Table 4 summarizes findings and the certainty of evidence for the acceptability of muscle relaxants for low back pain.

Subacute low back pain was addressed in one trial, which determined the efficacy of muscle relaxants on pain intensity at short-term follow-up for subacute low back pain. Miscellaneous muscle relaxants (such as botulinum toxin) were not associated with a reduction in pain intensity compared with control (−19.0, −41.9 to 3.9; one trial, 28 participants; very low certainty evidence) as shown in table 2 and supplementary file 11.

Chronic low back pain was assessed in two trials (three comparisons) that determined the efficacy of muscle relaxants on pain intensity at short-term follow-up.

### Morphine sulfate [^115rovcJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**:

	- **Central nervous system (CNS) depressants**: May increase the risk of respiratory depression. Morphine should be administered cautiously to avoid additive effects when other CNS depressants, including other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, antiemetics, and alcohol, are given concomitantly. The risks of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, and coma are increased.

	- **Muscle relaxants**: May enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.

	- **Mixed agonist/antagonist opioid analgesics**: Do not administer mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e. pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) to patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic, such as morphine sulfate injection. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

	- **Cimetidine**: May increase respiratory and CNS depression.

	- **Anticholinergics**: May increase the risk of urinary retention, severe constipation, or paralytic ileus.

### The use of muscle relaxant medications in acute low back pain [^116NuNLS]. Spine (2004). Low credibility.

This prospective cohort study aimed to determine the characteristics of patients who take muscle relaxants for back pain after seeking care and to assess the relationship of muscle relaxant use with recovery from acute low back pain.

Low back pain is a common condition with a generally favorable short-term prognosis, and physicians in acute settings commonly prescribe muscle relaxants, though the indications for use and outcomes remain unclear. For this study, a secondary data analysis was conducted on a cohort of 1,633 patients seeking care for low back pain from various practitioners, including primary care physicians, chiropractors, orthopedic surgeons, and Health Maintenance Organizations. Patients were enrolled in the physician's office and interviewed at baseline, and then at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks to assess pain, functional status, medication use, health care utilization, and satisfaction with care.

- **Results**: Muscle relaxants were used by 49% of patients overall, and among those who sought care from doctors, 64% used muscle relaxants. Users of muscle relaxants were more impaired at baseline. Over time, patients with greater functional status impairment (Roland disability score > 12) at baseline who used muscle relaxants experienced somewhat slower recovery from the episode of back pain. This finding persisted even after controlling for baseline functional status, age, worker's compensation status, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.

- **Conclusions**: The use of muscle relaxants was very common among patients with acute low back pain, although muscle relaxant use was not associated with improved recovery outcomes.

### Association of skeletal muscle relaxers and antihistamines on mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits in elderly patients: a nationwide retrospective cohort study [^112ktMwq]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Our study has important limitations. First, variables not collected for this study may lead to unmeasured confounding. Our study did not include data, such as functional status, that are not available in the VA datasets. Propensity score matching was performed to balance covariates and control for important clinical comorbidities that are risk factors for mortality, hospitalizations, ED visits, falls, and fractures. Second, the over-the-counter status of many antihistamines may have led to an underestimation or misclassification of exposure. Moreover, other antihistamines (e.g. doxylamine and scopolamine) and skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. baclofen and tizanidine) not listed as HEDIS HRME may have been used by both exposed and non-exposed patients. A non-differential misclassification of antihistamine and skeletal muscle relaxant exposure produces a bias towards the null, potentially making our interpretation of increased risk of events more conservative. Third, the analysis did not account for exposure time or time to event. Skeletal muscle relaxants and antihistamines can be used "as needed" for symptoms rather than scheduled daily like many chronic medications listed as HEDIS HRME. Moreover, this study determined events within one year from exposure, which may strengthen the association compared to choosing a more distal time-point. Fourth, we did not collect data on drug-specific outcome associations. It is unknown whether a specific drug within either class predominantly contributed to the observed association. However, the hypothesis was to determine if drug exposure…

### Safety of baclofen and tizanidine in older adults: A retrospective cohort study in a large integrated health care system [^115HEzmN]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Low credibility.

The AGS 2023 updated Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults recommends avoidance of skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs) for musculoskeletal complaints. Two SMRs, baclofen and tizanidine, are excluded from this criterion. Clinicians may therefore consider baclofen or tizanidine as options for older adult patients with musculoskeletal complaints; however, evidence for this conclusion is lacking.

- **Purpose**: To investigate injury events associated with baclofen and tizanidine in older adults compared to cyclobenzaprine, an SMR included in the Beers Criteria.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) in patients aged 65 to 99 years. Participants were identified as KPSC members dispensed a study SMR between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2018. Serious injury events were identified in the electronic medical record using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for the following: fracture, fall leading to fracture, brain injury, and dislocation injury. Findings were adjusted for numerous demographic and clinical covariates. Secondary analyses investigated injury-free probabilities based on the type of injury event.

- **Results**: From a population of 87,896 participants, 118,426 study medication episodes were identified. Compared with cyclobenzaprine, baclofen demonstrated a 69% greater risk (adjusted Hazard Ratio [aHR] 1.69, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.51–1.88), and tizanidine carried a 34% greater risk (aHR 1.34, 95% CI 1.11–1.62) for composite injury outcomes. Both baclofen and tizanidine demonstrate increased risk factors for injuries in the studied demographic.

### Association of skeletal muscle relaxers and antihistamines on mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits in elderly patients: A nationwide retrospective cohort study [^113f563n]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

This study demonstrates that skeletal muscle relaxants and antihistamines, as listed in the NCQA HEDIS HRME, are associated with adverse events in elderly patients, adding further evidence for the validity of the classification of "high-risk" for these drug classes. Further interventions need to be developed to identify patients at high risk for events and reduce exposure to these medications while still providing acceptable substitutes for patients.

### Efficacy, acceptability, and safety of muscle relaxants for adults with non-specific low back pain: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^117LTsVx]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

Two independent reviewers appraised the study-level risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and recommendations from Furlan et al. Thirteen criteria were assessed across the risk of bias domains: selection, performance, attrition, detection, reporting, and other sources of bias. Because recommendations were not available from Furlan et al, we used previously published criteria to determine the overall study risk of bias for each trial. Two reviewers independently determined the certainty of the evidence for each analysis using the GRADE system. Certainty of the evidence is best considered as the certainty that the true effect lies within a particular range.

We downgraded the certainty of evidence if a serious flaw was present in the domains of risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, and publication bias (see supplementary file 5). The certainty of evidence was initially classified as high, then as moderate, low, or very low certainty.

- **High certainty**: We were very confident that the true effect was close to that of the estimate of the effect.
- **Moderate certainty**: We were moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect was likely to be close to the estimate of the effect but with a possibility of being substantially different.
- **Low certainty**: We had limited confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect might be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
- **Very low certainty**: We had very little confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect was likely to be substantially different.

### Efficacy, acceptability, and safety of muscle relaxants for adults with non-specific low back pain: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ikMoi]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

- **Implications for clinical practice and policy**: International clinical practice guidelines provide conflicting recommendations for the use of muscle relaxants. Of 15 clinical practice guidelines, six recommend muscle relaxants to manage low back pain, five do not recommend them, and four do not offer a recommendation. Our review shows uncertainty of evidence for the efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants. Although non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics might reduce pain intensity at two weeks or less for acute low back pain, the effect is unlikely to be considered clinically important. In addition, non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics could increase the risk of an adverse event being reported (commonly, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, and nausea), but might have little to no effect on treatment discontinuation, suggesting the treatment and increased risk of adverse events are acceptable. The low to very low certainty of evidence does not, however, allow any firm recommendations. We would encourage clinicians to discuss this uncertainty in the efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants with patients, sharing information about the possibility for a worthwhile benefit in pain reduction but increased risk of experiencing a non-serious adverse event, to allow them to make informed treatment decisions.

- **Unanswered questions and future research**: Large, definitive, placebo-controlled trials are urgently needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of muscle relaxants. New trials should follow the core outcome set for non-specific low back pain and the recommendations of the Initiative on Methods.

### Muscle relaxant use among hemodialysis patients: Prevalence, clinical indications, and adverse outcomes [^112RQL8w]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Muscle relaxants are often used to treat musculoskeletal pain or cramping, which are commonly experienced by hemodialysis patients. However, the extent to which muscle relaxants are prescribed in this population and the risks associated with their use have not been characterized.

- **Study design**: Observational cohort study.

- **Setting & participants**: 140,899 Medicare-covered adults receiving hemodialysis in 2011, identified in the US Renal Data System.

- **Exposure**: Time-varying muscle relaxant exposure.

- **Outcomes**: Primary outcomes were time to first emergency department visit or hospitalization for altered mental status, fall, or fracture. Secondary outcomes were death and composites of death with each of the primary outcomes.

- **Analytical approach**: Multivariable Cox regression analysis.

- **Results**:
	10% of patients received muscle relaxants in 2011. 11%, 6%, 3%, and 13% had an episode of altered mental status, fall, fracture, and death, respectively. Muscle relaxant use was associated with higher risk for altered mental status (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.29–1.51) and fall (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05–1.33) compared to no use. Muscle relaxant use was not statistically significantly associated with higher risk for fracture (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.98–1.39). Muscle relaxant use was associated with lower hazard of death (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76–0.94). However, hazards were higher for altered mental status or death (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.10–1.25), fall or death (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06–1.22), and fracture or death (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01–1.20).

### Efficacy, acceptability, and safety of muscle relaxants for adults with non-specific low back pain: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^114VZcZD]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

Our review updates the evidence for the use of muscle relaxants in adults with low back pain. We included 31 trials involving 6,505 participants in the quantitative analysis, compared to 15 trials with 3,362 participants in the most recent systematic review. Although previous systematic reviews and three clinical practice guidelines endorse non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics as an effective treatment for acute low back pain, we found considerable uncertainty in their clinical effectiveness and safety.

We pooled data for all non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics according to their shared clinical utility in managing acute low back pain. The choice of muscle relaxant and frequency of prescription by a general practitioner varies between countries. For example, carisoprodol, commonly prescribed in the US, is no longer marketed in several European countries or the UK due to an increased risk of misuse and dependency. We repeated the primary analyses after excluding trials that investigated carisoprodol and found that effects were comparable.

Although the observed effect of non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics in reducing pain compared to control at two weeks or less was statistically significant, the magnitude of the effect was too small to be considered clinically important. The upper limits of the confidence interval do not exclude a clinically meaningful effect on pain intensity. The modest overall effect is reported at the group level, suggesting that some individuals, but not all, may gain a meaningful benefit.

### Muscle relaxants in neurosurgical anaesthesia: a critical appraisal [^116zd5bB]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Use of muscle relaxants, considered until recently as common practice in neurosurgical anaesthesia protocols, has become increasingly questionable. This shift is due to the evolution of neurosurgery, including the advent of new surgical techniques. Additionally, advancements in anaesthesia, such as the development of new drugs and devices, have influenced this perspective. The rationale for using muscle relaxants must be carefully balanced against their potential side effects and possible pharmacodynamic alterations in neurosurgical patients.

### A systematic review on the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for chronic non-specific low-back pain [^116WPYvC]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants, antidepressants, and opioids, for non-specific chronic low-back pain.

### Efficacy, acceptability, and safety of muscle relaxants for adults with non-specific low back pain: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111y2xu5]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

We found very low certainty evidence that non-benzodiazepine antispasmodic drugs might reduce pain intensity at two weeks or less for patients with acute low back pain. This effect is small — less than 8 points on a 0–100 point scale — and does not meet common thresholds to be clinically meaningful. Non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics might have little to no effect on pain intensity at 3–13 weeks or on disability at all follow-up time points; however, the certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. No trials evaluated the effect of muscle relaxants on long-term outcomes. Low and very low certainty evidence showed that non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics might increase the risk of adverse events and might have little to no effect on treatment discontinuation, respectively. The number of trials investigating other muscle relaxants was small. The certainty of evidence was reduced because a large number of trials were at high risk of bias.

- **Strengths and weaknesses of this review**: This systematic review was prospectively registered and reported in line with PRISMA. We included a broad scope of licensed muscle relaxants evaluated in randomized controlled trials as they provide the best evidence on the efficacy and safety of currently used muscle relaxants in clinical practice. We included findings from 49 trials of muscle relaxants for low back pain published up until 23 February 2021. To assess study-level risk of bias we used the Cochrane risk of bias tool and published recommendations from the Cochrane Back and Neck Group, and we evaluated the certainty of the evidence.

### Efficacy, acceptability, and safety of muscle relaxants for adults with non-specific low back pain: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^116au1AB]. BMJ (2021). High credibility.

Low back pain is a major global public health problem, placing a burden on individuals, healthcare, and society. It has been the leading cause of disability worldwide for the past 30 years. In the United States, low back pain is responsible for the highest total expenditure on healthcare, estimated to be $134.5 billion (£95.0 billion; €110.5 billion) in 2016 (95% confidence interval $122.4 billion to $146.9 billion). Low back pain is a common reason to visit a general practitioner, where patients are often prescribed analgesics to manage their symptoms.

Muscle relaxants, a broad class of drugs that include non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics and antispastics, are frequently prescribed in the UK and US. In 2020, prescriptions in England exceeded 1.3 million, and in the US, more than 30 million prescriptions of muscle relaxants were recorded for ambulatory care visits in 2016. Muscle relaxants are the third most commonly prescribed drug for low back pain. Recommendations for the use of muscle relaxants have, however, conflicted between international clinical practice guidelines for low back pain. For example, the US guideline recommends non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics as the drug of choice for acute low back pain, the Belgian guideline discourages such use, and the UK guideline does not make a recommendation.

A systematic review that included five randomized controlled trials (n = 497 participants) published up to the end of October 2015 provides the most recent evidence that muscle relaxants produce a clinically meaningful effect.

### Association of skeletal muscle relaxers and antihistamines on mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits in elderly patients: A nationwide retrospective cohort study [^116tSybZ]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, South Texas Veterans Health Care System, and the Bedford Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. Relevant permissions were obtained to access patient data.

- **Study design, patients, and setting**: This study was a new-user, retrospective cohort design using national VA administrative data. Veterans were included if they were aged 65 years or older on October 1, 2005, and received VA inpatient or outpatient care at least once in fiscal year 2005 (FY 2005) and FY 2006 (October 1, 2004, through September 30, 2006). Patients were excluded if they were in a VA nursing home or transitional care unit for more than 60 days in FY 2005 or FY 2006, had been exposed to skeletal muscle relaxants or antihistamines prior to FY 2006, or had a subsequent new skeletal muscle relaxant or antihistamine exposure in FY 2007. Each patient was used only once as either a control or drug-exposed subject.

- **Data sources**: We used inpatient and outpatient demographic, utilization, and comorbidity data from the VA Medical SAS Datasets. Pharmacy data were extracted from the Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) dataset. Prescription data in the VA PBM included prescription start date, generic drug name, and day supply for each drug dispensed. Mortality information was obtained from the VA Vital Status file, which has a sensitivity of approximately 98% for veterans' deaths. Unique patient identifiers linked information across these databases.

### Percocet [^116B7iwA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Percocet is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.

- **Limitations of use**: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration [see warnings], reserve Percocet for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g. non-opioid analgesics):
	- Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated
	- Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia

Percocet should not be used for an extended period unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate.

### Opioid coprescribing with sedatives after implant-based breast reconstruction [^1177mYTz]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Skeletal muscle relaxants and benzodiazepines are thought to mitigate against postoperative muscle contraction. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration warn against coprescribing them with opioids because of increased risks of overdose and death. The authors evaluated the frequency of coprescribing opioids with skeletal muscle relaxants or benzodiazepines after implant-based reconstruction.

- **Methods**: The authors examined health care claims to identify women (18 to 64 years old) who underwent implant-based breast reconstruction between January 2008 and June 2019. They aimed to determine the frequency of coprescribing, factors associated with coprescribing opioids and skeletal muscle relaxants or benzodiazepines, and the impact on opioid refills within 90 days of reconstruction.

- **Results**: A total of 86.7 percent of women (n = 7574) who had implant-based breast reconstruction filled an opioid prescription perioperatively. Of these, 27.7 percent of women filled prescriptions for opioids and benzodiazepines, 14.4 percent for opioids and skeletal muscle relaxants, and 2.4 percent for opioids, benzodiazepines, and skeletal muscle relaxants. Risk factors for coprescribing opioids and benzodiazepines included the use of acellular dermal matrix, immediate reconstruction, and a history of anxiety. Women who filled prescriptions for opioids and skeletal muscle relaxants, opioids and benzodiazepines, and opioids with skeletal muscle relaxants and benzodiazepines were significantly more likely to refill opioid prescriptions.

### Multinational evidence-based recommendations for pain management by pharmacotherapy in inflammatory arthritis: Integrating systematic literature research and expert opinion of a broad panel of rheumatologists in the 3e initiative [^113d68CK]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the use of a broad definition of neuromodulators as 'substances that alter nerve transmission' in the initial literature search, data regarding the use of these drugs in this population was scarce. Pooled analysis of two short-term trials of the centrally acting non-opioid analgesic nefopam in RA demonstrated a significant reduction in pain at 2 weeks compared with placebo, but the risk of adverse effects (AEs) was also significantly increased. One study of topical capsaicin for knee pain in RA suggested a benefit at 2 weeks, although local skin irritation was a frequent occurrence. There are no data regarding the use of anti-convulsants as analgesics in IA, although both pregabalin and gabapentin have been shown to reduce pain in patients with FM syndrome. The experts agreed that although the evidence regarding neuromodulators in IA is very limited, these drugs, including nefopam and topical capsaicin, and potentially the newer anticonvulsants, may be considered as adjuvant therapies in individual patients.

Benzodiazepines are hypnotic and anxiolytic agents that have some muscle relaxant properties. In six short-term RCTs, no improvement in pain outcomes was seen in those taking muscle relaxants compared with placebo, and both benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine muscle relaxants were associated with a significant increase in the risk of AEs. Given this lack of evidence for benefit and the potential for harm (including addiction), the experts recommended against the use of benzodiazepines as analgesics. The paucity of evidence regarding non-benzodiazepine muscle relaxants prevented experts from fully endorsing their use as well.

### Efficacy, acceptability, and safety of muscle relaxants for adults with non-specific low back pain: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^116dvQ64]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

Mixed low back pain — Two trials (two comparisons) evaluated the efficacy of muscle relaxants at immediate-term follow-up, and one trial assessed short-term follow-up for mixed low back pain. Non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics were linked to a reduction in pain intensity at two weeks or less compared with control (−4.4, −6.9 to −1.9; 2 trials, 617 participants; low certainty) but not at 3–13 weeks (−5.8, −13.8 to 2.2; 1 trial, 329 participants; very low certainty evidence). Non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics were also associated with a reduction in disability at two weeks or less compared with control (−19.2, −27.7 to −10.7; 1 trial, 329 participants; low certainty evidence).

### Uterine muscle relaxant drugs for threatened miscarriage [^115Cnhc4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before the fetus is viable. Uterine muscle relaxant drugs have been used for women at risk of miscarriage with the belief that they relax uterine muscle and hence reduce the risk of miscarriage.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of uterine muscle relaxant drugs on the woman and her baby when used for threatened miscarriage.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register on 4 May 2004 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2004).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials were included, and quasi-randomised trials were excluded. The participants were women with a pregnancy of less than 20 weeks' gestation who were experiencing a threatened miscarriage. The interventions were any uterine muscle relaxing drugs (including tocolytic and antispasmodic agents) compared with either placebo or no drug. Primary outcomes for the review were miscarriage (defined as spontaneous pregnancy loss before fetal viability), baby death (stillbirth or neonatal death), and maternal death.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Both review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and trial quality, and extracted data.

- **Main results**: One poor-quality trial (170 women) was included. This trial compared a beta-agonist with a placebo. There was a lower risk of intrauterine death associated with the use of a beta-agonist (relative risk [RR] 0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12 to 0.51). Preterm birth was the only other outcome reported (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.63 to 4.38).

### Ketalar [^1154w3nn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

**Indications and usage**: KETALAR (ketamine hydrochloride) injection is indicated as the sole anesthetic agent for diagnostic and surgical procedures that do not require skeletal muscle relaxation. It is also used for the induction of anesthesia prior to the administration of other general anesthetic agents and as a supplement to other anesthetic agents. KETALAR serves as a general anesthetic in scenarios where such precise conditions are required.

### Safety application of muscle relaxants and the traditional low-frequency ventilation during the flexible or rigid bronchoscopy in patients with central airway obstruction: a retrospective observational study [^113BGYxC]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

The assessment of traditional low-frequency ventilation in patients with central airway obstruction (CAO) was distinct from high or low-frequency jet ventilation. This study utilized traditional low-frequency ventilation for all patients with CAO. End-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO₂) and partial pressure of carbon dioxide in artery blood (PaCO₂) were investigated to evaluate the adequacy of ventilation and gas exchange (see Fig. 1).

The level of EtCO₂ in patients after both flexible and rigid bronchoscopy increased — 35.76 ± 7.71 mmHg to 40.19 ± 6.04 mmHg for flexible bronchoscopy and 31.72 ± 6.32 mmHg to 37.88 ± 6.15 mmHg for rigid bronchoscopy, with p < 0.05. However, the increase was not considered significant (Fig. 1a). The EtCO₂ level in the blood gas collected immediately after the procedure also rose compared to before the operation in both groups — 42.25 ± 10.54 mmHg to 55.35 ± 17.54 mmHg for flexible bronchoscopy and 43.93 ± 13.70 mmHg to 59.50 ± 24.24 mmHg for rigid bronchoscopy, respectively, with p < 0.05 — indicating most patients experienced hypercapnia during the procedure. Importantly, the occurrence of hypercapnia was not correlated with the duration of the operation in either flexible or rigid bronchoscopy for patients with CAO (Fig. 2).

- **Figure 1**: Change in EtCO₂ and PaCO₂ before and after therapy in patients with CAO.
	- **A**: Change in EtCO₂ before and after the procedure (n = 100 in flexible group and n = 57 in rigid group recorded in the anesthesia note).
	- **B**: Change in PaCO₂ before anesthesia and after the procedure (n = 18 in flexible group and n = 17 in rigid group recorded in the anesthesia note). Paired t-test used for these data, ✱ p < 0.05.

- **Flexible**: flexible bronchoscopy treatment; **Rigid**: rigid bronchoscopy treatment.

### Tracheal intubation in routine practice with and without muscular relaxation: an observational study [^117U4Gsu]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

The ease of endotracheal intubation has been recently shown to affect the incidence of laryngeal injury. There remains controversy as to whether a muscle relaxant is routinely required for tracheal intubation. This study examined conditions of intubation in our routine practice, which employs a relaxant-sparing approach.

- **Methods**: All adult patients scheduled for surgery with general anaesthesia were prospectively included. A muscle relaxant was used to facilitate intubation when it was required for the surgical procedure and/or otherwise regarded as necessary by the anaesthesiologist. In the remaining patients, a relaxant-free intubation was performed. Intubating conditions were evaluated in all patients, as well as the post-intubation laryngeal symptoms.

- **Results**: Between March and July 2003, 612 patients were consecutively included. A muscle relaxant was used in 32% of patients and not in the remaining 68%. Clinically acceptable intubating scores were observed in 98.4% overall, with no significant difference between the two groups. Excellent conditions occurred more frequently in the relaxant group compared to the relaxant-free group (87% vs. 72%, P = 0.005). Laryngeal symptoms occurred in 184 (33%) patients, with no difference between the two groups.

- **Conclusions**: Our relaxant-sparing approach did not increase the incidence of poor conditions of intubation nor laryngeal symptoms. However, excellent conditions occurred more frequently in the relaxant group. A more flexible approach to the issue of the need for neuromuscular blockage in intubation may be beneficial.

### Development of evidence-based recommendations for procedure-specific pain management: PROSPECT methodology [^115MoSM2]. Anaesthesia (2019). Low credibility.

Effective dynamic peri-operative pain management is a prerequisite for optimal recovery after surgery. Several professional associations have published evidence-based guidelines that provide excellent information regarding available analgesic options and an overview of peri-operative pain management strategies. However, they have had a limited impact on the overall incidence of inadequate and inappropriate postoperative pain management, which continues to be a major challenge. Although the reasons for the failure of these guidelines are not precisely known, it may be because they are too broad and generalized.

Interestingly, a joint clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Society, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, and the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) suggests 'considering' almost every analgesic that was included in the analyses. This included acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) specific inhibitors, and analgesic adjuncts (e.g. ketamine and gabapentinoids).

The possible reasons for such universal recommendations may be related to the methodology used to analyze and interpret the available evidence. Conventional guidelines have predominantly reviewed single-analgesic interventions compared with placebo, although it is well recognized that the ideal approach to pain management is to combine analgesics (i.e. a multimodal approach). Additionally, because the evidence from different surgical procedures is generally pooled together, conventional guideline methodologies may not adequately address procedure-specific pain management needs.

### Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^114b6psT]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms, as well as on response/remission for people with schizophrenia.

- **Methods**: Randomized controlled trials were considered if they investigated progressive muscle relaxation in patients with schizophrenia. Databases such as EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, CINAHL, PEDro, and Cochrane Library were searched. The selection of studies, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers.

- **Results**: Three randomized controlled trials involving 146 patients met the inclusion criteria. Progressive muscle relaxation can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for progressive muscle relaxation as an add-on treatment for general psychopathology and for positive or negative symptoms. Also, no studies assessed the value of progressive muscle relaxation in longer-term treatment and for relapse prevention. There were no data to draw any conclusions about progressive muscle relaxation in comparison with other treatment modalities. None of the studies encountered adverse events. Dose-response relationships could not be determined.

- **Conclusion**: Progressive muscle relaxation might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia.

### Association of skeletal muscle relaxers and antihistamines on mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits in elderly patients: A nationwide retrospective cohort study [^113hhxvm]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Antihistamine exposure

There were 30,031 (1.7%) patients exposed to antihistamines in FY 2006. Table 4 shows the unadjusted odds ratios for the primary and secondary endpoints for all patients included in the study.

- **Association of antihistamine exposure with outcomes**: For the propensity-matched cohort, we included a total of 60,058 patients; 30,029 patients exposed to antihistamines and 30,029 unexposed. Table 2 shows the balance among key covariates between antihistamine-exposed patients and unexposed after propensity matching. After propensity matching, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups.

Results for the propensity-matched cohort for the primary and secondary outcomes are displayed in Table 4. The primary composite outcome at one year was significantly higher in patients exposed to antihistamines (AOR 2.60, 95% CI 2.51–2.69). Mortality (AOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.82–2.04), ED visits (AOR 2.35, 95% CI 2.27–2.43), and hospitalizations (AOR 2.21, 95% CI 2.11–2.32) at one year were significantly higher in the antihistamine-exposed group. Fall and fracture-related ED visits (AOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.51–2.11) and hospitalizations (AOR 1.95, 95% CI 1.41–2.69) were also significantly higher at one year in the antihistamine-exposed group.

### Efficacy, acceptability, and safety of muscle relaxants for adults with non-specific low back pain: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1163X91z]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

- **Safety: Acute low back pain**: Twenty-two trials (28 comparisons) determined the safety of muscle relaxants for acute low back pain. The type and reporting of adverse and serious adverse events varied across trials. Compared with control, non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics were associated with an increase in the risk of an adverse event (relative risk 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.0; 16 trials, 3404 participants; low certainty evidence) but not a serious adverse event (2.3, 0.3 to 20.8; 2 trials, 830 participants; very low certainty evidence). Antispastic drugs were also associated with an increase in the risk of an adverse event (2.0, 1.1 to 3.8; 2 trials, 290 participants; moderate certainty evidence), whereas benzodiazepines were not (1.8, 0.9 to 3.6; 2 trials, 159 participants; low certainty evidence). Participants receiving antispastics were more likely to discontinue treatment owing to an adverse event (34.6, 2.1 to 568.0; 1 trial, 195 participants; very low certainty evidence), whereas participants receiving non-benzodiazepine antispasmodics were not (1.5, 0.6 to 3.5; 5 trials, 1641 participants; very low certainty evidence).

- **Safety: Chronic low back pain**: Two trials (two comparisons) determined the safety of muscle relaxants for chronic low back pain. Compared with control, no difference was found in the risk of experiencing an adverse event.

### Utilization patterns of skeletal muscle relaxants among commercially insured adults in the United States from 2006 to 2018 [^112MFpdV]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The objective was to examine the prevalence and duration of skeletal muscle relaxant (SMR) treatment among commercially insured adults in the United States.

Methods involved using the MarketScan Research Database to identify a cohort of adults aged 18 to 64 years with ≥ 2-year continuous enrollment between 2005 and 2018. The prevalence of SMR treatment was estimated using a repeated cross-sectional design, and treatment duration was derived using the Kaplan-Meier method. Analyses were stratified by age group, sex, geographic region, individual SMR agent, and musculoskeletal disorder.

Results showed 48.7 million individuals were included. Treatment prevalence ranged from 61.5 to 68.3 per 1,000. Approximately one-third of users did not have a preceding musculoskeletal disorder diagnosis. Cyclobenzaprine was the dominant agent, accounting for over 50% of prescriptions. There was considerable growth in the use of baclofen, tizanidine, and methocarbamol, paralleled by a decline in carisoprodol and metaxalone use. Prevalence was highest in the South and lowest in the Northeast. The median treatment duration was 14 days, with 4.0%, 1.9%, and 1.0% of individuals using SMRs for more than 90, 180, and 365 days, respectively. Compared with cyclobenzaprine, patients initiating baclofen, tizanidine, and carisoprodol had longer treatment durations.

Conclusions indicate that SMRs are widely used in the United States. Their use slightly increased in recent years, but trends varied among individual agents, patient groups, and geographic regions. Despite limited evidence to support efficacy, a sizable number of U.S. adults used SMRs for long-term treatment.

### Pharmacological treatments for low back pain in adults: An overview of Cochrane reviews [^115ChXYr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Pharmacological interventions are the most commonly used treatment for low back pain (LBP). However, the use of evidence from systematic reviews of these interventions, as published in the Cochrane Library, is limited due to the lack of a comprehensive overview.

- **Objectives**: To summarize the evidence from Cochrane Reviews regarding the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of systemic pharmacological interventions for adults with non-specific LBP.

- **Methods**: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched from inception to 3 June 2021 to identify reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated systemic pharmacological interventions for adults with non-specific LBP. Two authors independently assessed eligibility, extracted data, and evaluated the quality of the reviews and the certainty of the evidence using the AMSTAR 2 and GRADE tools. The review focused on placebo comparisons, with main outcomes being pain intensity, function, and safety.

- **Main results**: Seven Cochrane Reviews, encompassing 103 studies with 22,238 participants, were included. There is high confidence in the findings of five reviews, moderate confidence in one, and low confidence in the findings of another. The reviews reported data on six medications or classes of medicine: paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, opioids, and antidepressants. Three reviews included participants with acute or sub-acute LBP, while five reviews included participants with chronic LBP.

High-certainty evidence was found indicating paracetamol did not demonstrate efficacy for acute LBP.

### Muscle relaxants for non-specific low back pain [^115iXv2e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Use of muscle relaxants in the management of non-specific low back pain is controversial. It is unclear if they are effective, and concerns have been raised about the potential adverse effects involved.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this review was to determine if muscle relaxants are effective in the treatment of non-specific low back pain.

- **Search strategy**: A computer-assisted search of the Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 up to October 2001) and EMBASE (1988 up to October 2001) was conducted. These databases were searched using the algorithm recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group. References cited in the identified articles and other relevant literature were screened.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised and/or double-blinded controlled trials involving patients diagnosed with non-specific low back pain, treated with muscle relaxants as monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutic modalities, were included for review.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently conducted the methodological quality assessment and data extraction of the trials. The analysis included both a quantitative analysis (statistical pooling) and a qualitative analysis ("best evidence synthesis"). This involved appraising the strength of evidence for various conclusions using a rating system based on the quality and outcomes of the studies included. Evidence was classified as "strong", "moderate", "limited", "conflicting", or "no" evidence.

- **Main results**: Thirty trials met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-three trials (77%) were identified as…

### Medications for treating low back pain in adults. Evidence for the use of paracetamol, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, muscle relaxants, antibiotics, and antidepressants: An overview for musculoskeletal clinicians [^117XoF56]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Because pharmacological therapies may play an important role in managing musculoskeletal pain, the appropriate use of medicines for common conditions like low back pain (LBP) is critical. New evidence on the effects and safety of paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioid analgesics, muscle relaxants, antibiotics, and antidepressants for LBP warrants an updated overview for musculoskeletal clinicians on this topic.

- **Clinical question**: How effective and safe are paracetamol, NSAIDs, opioid analgesics, muscle relaxants, antibiotics, and antidepressants compared with placebo for treating LBP?

- **Key results**: For acute LBP (12 weeks), NSAIDs, antidepressants, and opioids may be superior to placebo for reducing pain, but opioids have an established profile of harms. Antibiotics may also reduce pain for people with chronic LBP with Modic type 1 changes, although the risks may outweigh their benefits. The effects of paracetamol and muscle relaxants for chronic LBP were unclear.

- **Clinical application**: NSAIDs may have a role in managing acute and chronic LBP, with cautious use in people who may be at greater risk of experiencing adverse events. Paracetamol, opioid analgesics, antibiotics, muscle relaxants, and antidepressants should only be prescribed following a discussion between the treating clinician and the patient.

### Muscle energy technique for non-specific low-back pain [^116SQbC9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Low-back pain (LBP) is responsible for considerable personal suffering due to pain and reduced function, as well as the societal burden due to healthcare costs and lost work productivity. For the vast majority of people with LBP, no specific anatomical cause can be reliably identified. For these people with non-specific LBP, there are numerous treatment options, few of which have been shown to be effective in reducing pain and disability. The muscle energy technique (MET) is a treatment used predominantly by osteopaths, physiotherapists, and chiropractors, involving alternating periods of resisted muscle contractions and assisted stretching. At the time of writing, it is unclear whether MET is effective in reducing pain and improving function in people with LBP.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effectiveness of MET in the treatment of people with non-specific LBP compared with control interventions, with particular emphasis on subjective pain and disability outcomes.

- **Search methods**: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, five other databases, and two trials registers were searched from inception to May and June 2014, together with reference checking and citation searching of relevant systematic reviews.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials assessing the effect of MET on pain or disability in patients with non-specific LBP were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. Meta-analysis was performed where clinical homogeneity was sufficient. The quality of the evidence for each comparison was assessed.

### Systemic pharmacologic therapies for low back pain: A systematic review for an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^111RERYy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

A 2007 American College of Physicians guideline addressed pharmacologic options for low back pain. New evidence and medications have now become available.

- **Purpose**: To review the evidence on systemic pharmacologic therapies for acute or chronic nonradicular or radicular low back pain.

- **Data sources**: Ovid MEDLINE (January 2008 through November 2016), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and reference lists.

- **Study selection**: Randomized trials that reported pain, function, or harms of systemic medications versus placebo or another intervention.

- **Data extraction**: One investigator abstracted data, and a second verified accuracy; two investigators independently assessed study quality.

- **Data synthesis**: The number of trials ranged from nine (benzodiazepines) to seventy (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). New evidence found that acetaminophen was ineffective for acute low back pain; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had smaller benefits for chronic low back pain than previously observed. Duloxetine was effective for chronic low back pain, and benzodiazepines were ineffective for radiculopathy. For opioids, evidence remains limited to short-term trials showing modest effects for chronic low back pain; trials were not designed to assess serious harms. Skeletal muscle relaxants are effective for short-term pain relief in acute low back pain but caused sedation. Systemic corticosteroids do not seem to be effective. For effective interventions, pain relief was small to moderate and generally short-term.

### Ketamine and esketamine in clinical trials: FDA-approved and emerging indications, trial trends with putative mechanistic explanations [^116GbGvd]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

In high doses, ketamine produces anesthesia and is suitable for diagnostic and surgical procedures that do not require the application of muscle relaxants. Low-dose ketamine as a supplement to other anesthetic drugs (general anesthetics, benzodiazepines, and propofol) can prolong their action and reduce the dose of opioids required in the postoperative period. The main advantage of ketamine application in anesthesia is its ability to maintain heart rate and cardiac output, increase blood pressure, provide bronchodilation, and preserve pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes without respiratory depression. In sub-anesthetic doses, ketamine is used along with opioids to treat cancer pain, particularly breakthrough pain; chronic pain, including chronic neuropathic pain, phantom and ischemic limb pain, postherpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, fibromyalgia, and chronic regional pain syndromes; and acute perioperative pain.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of skeletal muscle relaxants for spasticity and musculoskeletal conditions: a systematic review [^115buLq2]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

Skeletal muscle relaxants are a heterogeneous group of medications used to treat two different types of underlying conditions: spasticity from upper motor neuron syndromes and muscular pain or spasms from peripheral musculoskeletal conditions. Although widely used for these indications, gaps exist in our understanding of the comparative efficacy and safety of different skeletal muscle relaxants.

This systematic review summarizes and assesses the evidence for the comparative efficacy and safety of skeletal muscle relaxants for spasticity and musculoskeletal conditions. Randomized trials (for comparative efficacy and adverse events) and observational studies (for adverse events only) that included oral medications classified as skeletal muscle relaxants by the FDA were sought using electronic databases, reference lists, and pharmaceutical company submissions. Searches were performed through January 2003. The validity of each included study was assessed using a data abstraction form and predefined criteria. An overall grade was allocated for the body of evidence for each key question.

A total of 101 randomized trials were included in this review. No randomized trial was rated good quality, and there was little evidence of rigorous adverse event assessment in included trials or observational studies. There is fair evidence that baclofen, tizanidine, and dantrolene are effective compared to placebo in patients with spasticity (primarily multiple sclerosis). There is fair evidence that baclofen and tizanidine are roughly equivalent for efficacy in patients with spasticity.

### Cyclobenzaprine for the treatment of myofascial pain in adults [^1176YjyV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Myofascial pain (MP) is a painful condition characterized by pain originating from trigger points (TP) within myofascial structures in the muscles, either locally or distantly from the pain. TPs can produce a distinct pattern of referred pain or autonomic symptoms when stimulated. Cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant that suppresses muscle spasm without interfering with muscle function, is used in the clinical management of MP to improve the quality of sleep and reduce pain.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of cyclobenzaprine in treating MP.

- **Search strategy**: The Pain, Palliative, and Supportive Care Review Group's Specialised Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; LILACS; and Scielo were searched in February 2009.

- **Selection criteria**: All RCTs and quasi-RCTs reporting the use of cyclobenzaprine for treating MP with pain assessment as a primary or secondary outcome were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened identified studies, extracted data, assessed trial quality, and analyzed results.

- **Main results**: We identified two studies with a total of 79 participants. One study, with 41 participants, compared cyclobenzaprine with clonazepam and placebo. Participants taking cyclobenzaprine showed some improvement in pain intensity compared to those on clonazepam, with a mean difference (MD) of -0.25 (95% CI, -0.41 to -0.09; P value 0.002) and placebo, MD -0.25 (95% CI, 0.41 to -0.09; P value 0.002). The other study, with 38 participants, compared cyclobenzaprine with lidocaine infiltration. Thirty days after treatment, there were statistically non-significant differences.

### EAN guideline on palliative care of people with severe, progressive multiple sclerosis [^1144YDEh]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for multiple sclerosis, particularly the management of spasticity with skeletal muscle relaxants, the EAN 2020 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of benzodiazepines to reduce spasticity in patients with severe MS due to insufficient evidence for efficacy and frequent adverse events.

### Association of skeletal muscle relaxers and antihistamines on mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits in elderly patients: A nationwide retrospective cohort study [^111jUuGo]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

High-risk medication exposure in the elderly is common and associated with increased mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department (ED) visits. Skeletal muscle relaxants and antihistamines are high-risk medications commonly prescribed for elderly patients. The objective of this study was to determine the association between skeletal muscle relaxants or antihistamines and mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits.

- **Methods**: This study used a new-user, retrospective cohort design utilizing national Veteran Affairs (VA) data from 128 hospitals. Veterans aged ≥ 65 years on October 1, 2005, who received VA inpatient or outpatient care at least once in each of fiscal years (FY) 2005 and 2006 were included. Exposure to skeletal muscle relaxants and antihistamines was defined by the National Committee for Quality Assurance Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set measures for high-risk medications in the elderly. Primary outcomes identified within one year of exposure were death, ED visit, or hospitalization; ED visits or hospitalizations due to falls and fracture were also assessed. Propensity score matching (1-to-1 match) was used to balance covariates between exposed patients and non-exposed patients.

- **Results**: In this cohort of 1,807,404 patients, 55,566 patients were included in the propensity-matched cohort for skeletal muscle relaxants, and 60,058 patients were included in the propensity-matched cohort for antihistamines. Mortality was lower in skeletal muscle relaxants-exposed patients (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.81–0.9).

### The relative efficacy of seven skeletal muscle relaxants. An analysis of data from randomized studies [^117KEJds]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) causes 2.6 million visits to U.S. emergency departments (EDs) annually, and these patients are often treated with skeletal muscle relaxants (SMRs).

- **Objectives**: The goal of this study was to determine whether the efficacy of SMRs is associated with age, sex, or baseline LBP severity.

- **Methods**: This was a planned analysis of data from four randomized studies of patients with acute nonradicular LBP. Patients were enrolled during an ED visit and followed up one week later. The primary outcome was improvement in the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) between ED discharge and the one-week follow-up. We compared the change in RMDQ among eight groups: placebo, baclofen, metaxalone, tizanidine, diazepam, orphenadrine, methocarbamol, and cyclobenzaprine. All patients also received a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. We performed analysis of variance to determine statistically significant differences between medications and linear regression to determine the association of age, sex, and baseline severity with the primary outcome.

- **Results**: The mean improvement in RMDQ per group was 10.5 for placebo (95% CI 9.5–11.5), 10.6 (95% CI 8.6–12.7) for baclofen, 10.3 (95% CI 8.1–12.4) for metaxalone, 11.5 (95% CI 9.5–13.4) for tizanidine, 11.1 (95% CI 9–13.2) for diazepam, 9.5 (95% CI 7.4–11.5) for orphenadrine, 8.1 (95% CI 6.1–10.1) for methocarbamol, and 10.1 (95% CI 8.3–12) for cyclobenzaprine. The between-group differences were not statistically significant. Results were similar regardless of age, sex, and baseline severity. Higher baseline RMDQ was associated.

### Myofascial pain syndrome: An update on clinical characteristics, etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment [^1133CcKW]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

- **Pharmacological treatment**:

	- Several muscle relaxants have been investigated for their effectiveness in treating myofascial pain syndrome (MPS), including cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine, baclofen, and thiocolchicoside. These medications act on the central nervous system to reduce muscle tone and disrupt reflexes that contribute to muscle contraction, thereby providing pain relief and improving functional mobility. While muscle relaxants are well-studied in populations with general musculoskeletal pain, evidence specific to their use in MPS patients is limited.

	- **Muscle relaxants**:

		- **Cyclobenzaprine**: Cyclobenzaprine is a centrally acting muscle relaxant structurally related to tricyclic antidepressants. It is used to relieve skeletal muscle spasms without impairing muscle function. One Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to support the use of cyclobenzaprine for the treatment of MPS. One randomized controlled trial (RCT) on orofacial MPS included in this review reported that cyclobenzaprine significantly improved short-term pain compared to clonazepam and placebo, but not sleep quality. Conversely, a more recent RCT on orofacial MPS found no significant differences between cyclobenzaprine and placebo for both pain and sleep quality. Cyclobenzaprine may provide potential benefits for short-term MPS-related pain; however, the evidence is insufficient compared to placebo and alternative therapies.

		- **Tizanidine**: Tizanidine is a centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with both antispastic and antispasmodic properties. One RCT on orofacial MPS reported no significant improvement with tizanidine.

### Association of skeletal muscle relaxers and antihistamines on mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits in elderly patients: A nationwide retrospective cohort study [^116zkR9f]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Our study demonstrated that exposure to either skeletal muscle relaxants or antihistamines in the elderly was associated with a greater than two-fold increase in ED visits and/or hospitalizations. Antihistamines were associated with a 93% increase in mortality. Furthermore, our study found that exposure to either of these agents increased fall and/or fracture-related ED visits and hospitalizations.

Interestingly, exposure to skeletal muscle relaxants was associated with a 13% reduction in death. We believe this finding may be explained by unmeasured confounding due to the "healthy worker" bias. As an example, physicians use information such as functional status that is not readily measured in the medical record or captured in administrative claims data when prescribing potentially dangerous medications. Although speculative, it is possible that the elderly patients prescribed skeletal muscle relaxants were healthier than those not exposed in unmeasured ways. Moreover, these healthier, more active patients may have experienced more musculoskeletal injuries that would require long-term care or closer monitoring by the clinician. Chronic diseases such as hypertension or diabetes may have been better controlled under these more closely monitored conditions, leading to reduced mortality.

Despite the fact that these medications are listed as inappropriate to use in elderly patients, we found the incidence of antihistamine exposure to be 1.7% and skeletal muscle relaxant exposure to be 1.5%.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^116Lock5]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy for Other Symptoms in Chronic CRPS

Dystonia, a common movement disorder in CRPS, often requires independent treatment. Dystonia is itself painful and can also worsen pain by impeding tissue perfusion. Treatment is complicated because prolonged tonic postures can allow tendons to shorten into fixed contractures that require painful, complicating orthopedic procedures including tendon release or serial casting (see rehabilitation section). Standard treatments for dystonia are usually also prescribed in CRPS, although the mechanisms of dystonia in CRPS and other post-traumatic dystonias are distinct from the dystonias mediated by basal-ganglia dysfunction.

Although trihexylphenidate can be considered, baclofen is the first-line option (level 4). It should be prescribed orally at first; however, it is sedating, and many patients do not tolerate the high oral doses effective for dystonia. If baclofen is effective but poorly tolerated, administration by intrathecal pump is sometimes considered. Pharmacological and mechanical complications are common, and the research group that had originally evaluated this intervention has largely abandoned it now (personal communication). Long-term use of muscle relaxants in CRPS, such as benzodiazepines or cyclobenzaprine, is empirically ineffective in the long term and poorly tolerated (level 4).

Rare CRPS patients have severe edema in an arm or leg that can painfully distort their tissues and compromise tissue oxygenation and nutrition, potentially leading to skin ulceration and infection.

### Efficacy, acceptability, and safety of muscle relaxants for adults with non-specific low back pain: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111YikjB]. BMJ (2021). High credibility.

The review team independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified records in duplicate. We retrieved full-length records of those deemed eligible and screened these again to confirm inclusion. The full-length record of a trial registration was defined as the primary web page and all subsidiary pages and files located on the trial registry. Disagreements were resolved through discussion among the team (AGC, MAW, MDJ, MCF, HBL, RRNR) or, when necessary, consultation of a third independent reviewer (MKB or JHM). When further information was required to confirm eligibility, we contacted authors up to three times within a six-week period.

In instances where a trial was linked to multiple record sources, we used an established hierarchy, giving preference to the main published trial report, followed by other published records of the trial (e.g. conference abstracts), and, lastly, the trial registry record. When no evidence of publication was found, we classified the trial registry record as the primary record.

- **Outcomes**: The choice of outcomes was based on the core outcome domains for clinical trials in low back pain and those of other reviews of analgesics for low back pain. The primary outcomes were pain intensity and acceptability, measured by the number of patients who discontinued treatment for any reason. Secondary outcomes were disability, adverse events (as defined by each study), serious adverse events (as defined by each study), and withdrawal from treatment because of adverse effects (tolerability).

### Is there evidence for pelvic floor muscle relaxation training in nonneurogenic female bladder outlet obstruction? - A narrative review [^116GAmJq]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: A search on PubMed was conducted on February 16, 2023. This was an open search using the terms "bladder outlet obstruction" AND "female" AND ("pelvic floor muscles" OR "Kegel"). In addition, references from the EAU Guidelines on Management of Nonneurogenic Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS), a systematic review on tone and overactivity of the PFM in pelvic health conditions (mostly pain conditions), references listed in the retrieved articles, and a suggested list of similar articles from PubMed were searched. The results include experimental studies measuring the immediate effect of a single PFM contraction or maneuvers to relax the PFM, in addition to exercise training interventions over time with the aim to relax the PFM and improve female BOO symptoms.

The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) rating scale was used to assess the risk of bias (internal validity) for included RCTs. The total number is determined by counting the number of satisfied criteria, except the "eligibility criteria specified", which is a score on external validity. The total score of internal validity is 10. A total PEDro score of less than four is considered poor, four to five fair, six to eight good, and nine to 10 excellent. The PEDro scale has been found to be a reliable and valid tool to evaluate methodological quality in clinical trials.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of ibuprofen plus metaxalone, tizanidine, or baclofen for acute low back pain [^116QSvB7]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Patients with low back pain are often treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and skeletal muscle relaxants. The study compares functional outcomes and pain among patients with acute low back pain who were randomized to a one-week course of ibuprofen plus placebo versus ibuprofen plus one of three skeletal muscle relaxants: baclofen, metaxalone, and tizanidine.

This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, four-arm study conducted in two urban emergency departments (EDs). Patients with nonradicular low back pain for less than or equal to two weeks were eligible if they had a score greater than five on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, a 24-item inventory of functional impairment caused by low back pain. All participants received 21 tablets of ibuprofen 600 mg, to be taken three times a day as needed. Additionally, they were randomized to baclofen 10 mg, metaxalone 400 mg, tizanidine 2 mg, or placebo. Participants were instructed to take one or two of these capsules three times a day as needed. All participants received a 10-minute educational session. The primary outcome was improvement on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire between ED discharge and one week later. Secondary outcomes included pain intensity one week after ED discharge (severe, moderate, mild, or none).

Three hundred twenty patients were randomized. One week later, the mean Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire score of patients randomized to placebo improved by 11.1 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.0 to 13.3), baclofen by 10.6 points (95% CI 8.6 to 12.7), metaxalone by 10.

### The demographics of chronic pain management [^112sTeAH]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

Pain is the most common symptom for which patients seek care. The management of pain advanced considerably with the development of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitors (coxibs). The clinical usefulness of nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is often limited by the occurrence of adverse effects, such as gastric toxicity and bleeding complications, which have been attributed to the inhibition of COX-1. By targeting only COX-2 at the recommended dosage, coxibs offer patients anti-inflammatory and analgesic relief with reduced gastrotoxicity compared with traditional NSAIDs. Individualization of therapy based on a careful assessment of risks versus benefits of different agents is an important consideration in pain management. This review summarizes clinical evidence of the comparable efficacy but improved tolerability of the coxibs compared with conventional NSAIDs. Important patient considerations and risk factors involved in the selection of appropriate analgesic/anti-inflammatory treatments are highlighted.
