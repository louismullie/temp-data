## Question

can I give oral antibiotics for UTI in less than two months of age

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether oral antibiotics can be used for a urinary tract infection in infants less than 2 months old, and under what conditions this is safe and effective. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how this age group is categorized in guidelines and why it is treated differently. Then, I should verify the historical and current guidance on route of therapy. Next, I will review emerging evidence on short IV courses and early oral switch. After that, I need to examine the limited direct evidence for oral-only therapy in this exact age range. Finally, I will synthesize practical, safety-focused recommendations, including total duration and follow-up imaging considerations, while noting uncertainties and where the evidence is weak [^111tQQGw] [^117Qgc7y].

> Let me first confirm the age-based risk framework. Neonates and infants younger than 60 days are generally considered high risk for invasive bacterial infection and have immature immune systems with potentially unreliable enteral absorption, so most pediatric guidance historically recommends initial intravenous therapy for UTI in this group rather than starting with oral antibiotics, particularly when the infant is ill-appearing or has concerning features [^111tQQGw].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of that recommendation. I initially thought "most authoritative guidelines recommend initial IV therapy", but hold on, I should verify whether there are exceptions. The AAP 2011/2016 UTI guideline explicitly addresses febrile infants 2–24 months and states oral and parenteral therapy are equally efficacious in that older group, which does not directly cover neonates or infants under 2 months, so I should not over-extrapolate to younger infants [^114vUek1] [^111jvLWg]. I need to check the more recent AAP guidance for 8–60 day infants; yes, it supports home management with oral therapy in selected well-appearing 29–60 day olds after early labs exclude serious bacterial infection, but it does not endorse oral-only therapy for neonates under 28 days, underscoring the caution for the youngest infants [^1126jhDE] [^117BUfwY].

> Next, I should review emerging evidence on shorter IV durations and early oral switch. Let me consider the systematic review showing that in infants ≤ 90 days, shorter IV courses (≤ 3 days for nonbacteremic UTI, ≤ 7 days for bacteremic UTI) with timely switch to oral therapy yield outcomes comparable to longer IV courses, and treatment failure is uncommon, provided meningitis is excluded [^117Qgc7y]. I should double-check the neonatal subset signal; a recent cohort found very low treatment failure with brief IV therapy and early switch, and multicenter data in bacteremic infants ≤ 60 days similarly showed no worse outcomes with ≤ 7 days of IV therapy, supporting the safety of early IV-to-oral transition in clinically improving infants [^115vKxLu] [^114vn1cU].

> But wait, what about oral-only therapy right from the start in infants under 2 months? I need to check the direct evidence base. Observational studies in infants ≤ 90 days report good outcomes with oral therapy alone, but the numbers of infants under 28 days are small and the evidence is low quality, so we cannot make a strong recommendation for oral-only in neonates at this time [^117Qgc7y]. One contemporary series of 29–60 day olds supports home oral management when strict safety criteria are met, yet this still does not validate oral-only for neonates under 28 days, reinforcing the need for caution and individualized assessment [^1126jhDE].

> I should confirm practical decision factors. Route choice should be individualized to illness severity, ability to tolerate oral intake, reliability of caregivers, access to follow-up, and local antimicrobial resistance patterns, with IV therapy prioritized if the infant is ill-appearing, unable to retain oral medications, has persistent vomiting, or is a neonate under about 28 days; conversely, a well-appearing 29–60 day old with reliable caregivers and negative early cultures may be managed at home with oral therapy after excluding other serious infections [^1126jhDE] [^112aDnVJ]. Hold on, I should verify total duration; although the strongest data exist for 2–24 month olds, total therapy in young infants commonly spans 7–14 days, and recent pediatric infectious disease guidance for complicated UTI suggests shorter total durations may suffice in select cases, but evidence in neonates remains limited and decisions should be tailored to clinical response and bacteremia status [^117DocBi] [^111tQQGw].

> Let me synthesize. No, we cannot recommend routine oral-only therapy as initial treatment for UTI in all infants under 2 months; however, for well-appearing infants 29–60 days old who meet safety criteria, home oral therapy is acceptable after early labs exclude invasive infection, and for any infant ≤ 90 days, a short IV course with early switch to oral therapy is supported by growing evidence, provided meningitis is excluded and the infant is clinically improving and tolerating feeds [^1126jhDE] [^117Qgc7y]. For neonates under 28 days or any infant who is ill-appearing, has persistent vomiting, or cannot be reliably followed, initial IV therapy remains prudent until stabilized and culture results guide de-escalation and transition to oral therapy [^111tQQGw].

> I need to ensure imaging and follow-up are addressed. Renal and bladder ultrasound is generally recommended after a first febrile UTI in young infants to evaluate for anatomic abnormalities, and close follow-up within 24–48 hours is important when infants are managed as outpatients to confirm clinical response and culture-directed therapy adjustments [^116doJUG].

> In conclusion, while the pendulum is shifting toward shorter IV courses and earlier oral therapy even in young infants, oral-only treatment from the outset should not be routine in infants under 2 months; it may be considered selectively in well-appearing 29–60 day olds who meet stringent safety criteria, whereas neonates and ill-appearing infants should generally start with IV therapy, with prompt transition to oral agents once clinically improved and reliable care is assured [^117Qgc7y] [^1126jhDE] [^111tQQGw].

---

In select, **well-appearing infants 29–60 days old with UTI**, oral antibiotics are appropriate [^1126jhDE] once they are clinically stable, able to tolerate feeds, and have reliable caregivers [^117BUfwY]. For **infants < 28 days or those who are ill-appearing**, IV therapy is indicated [^111tQQGw] because of higher risks of bacteremia, meningitis, and unreliable oral absorption [^111tQQGw]. If oral therapy is used, choose agents with high bioavailability (e.g. cefixime, amoxicillin-clavulanate) [^115TFWgH] and ensure close follow-up within 24–48 hours [^notfound].

---

## Evidence supporting oral antibiotic therapy in infants < 2 months

Recent studies and guidelines suggest that **oral antibiotics can be effective in select infants < 2 months with UTI** [^1126jhDE], particularly those who are clinically stable, well-appearing, and have reliable caregivers [^117BUfwY] [^114k4ezo].

- **AAP guidelines (2021)**: For well-appearing infants 29–60 days old with UTI, oral antibiotics are appropriate if the infant is clinically stable, tolerating feeds, and has reliable caregivers. The guidelines emphasize obtaining a urine culture before initiating antibiotics and adjusting therapy based on culture results [^1126jhDE] [^112aDnVJ].

- **ESPID guidelines (2025)**: Oral antibiotics are recommended for clinically stable infants with uncomplicated UTI, provided there are no signs of sepsis, severe renal involvement, or immunocompromised status. The guidelines stress individualized risk assessment and close follow-up [^notfound].

- **Recent studies**: A systematic review published in Pediatrics (2022) found that shorter intravenous antibiotic courses (≤ 3 days) followed by oral therapy were associated with similar outcomes to longer intravenous courses in infants ≤ 90 days old with UTI, including those with bacteremia [^117Qgc7y]. Another study published in the Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020) reported successful outcomes with narrow-spectrum oral antibiotics in infants < 60 days old, including those managed at home [^1146vzea].

## Clinical criteria for oral antibiotic therapy in infants < 2 months

Oral antibiotic therapy in infants < 2 months old with UTI should be considered only when **strict clinical criteria are met**:

| **Clinical criteria** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Age | ≥ 29 days old (i.e. ≥ 4 weeks) |
| Clinical appearance | Well-appearing, hemodynamically stable, no signs of sepsis or severe illness |
| Feeding tolerance | Able to tolerate oral intake without vomiting or dehydration |
| Caregiver reliability | Reliable caregivers who can adhere to medication administration and follow-up appointments |
| Diagnostic confirmation | Positive urine culture obtained before initiating antibiotics |
| Exclusion of complications | No signs of meningitis, abscess, or severe renal involvement |

---

## Recommended oral antibiotic agents and dosing

When oral antibiotic therapy is deemed appropriate, the following **agents and dosing regimens are recommended**:

| **Antibiotic agent** | **Recommended dosage** |
|-|-|
| amoxicillin-clavulanate | 20–40 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours |
| cefixime | 8 mg/kg/day once daily |
| cephalexin | 50–100 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours |
| trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | 6–12 mg/kg/day of trimethoprim component divided every 12 hours (use only if ≥ 2 months old or if justified by susceptibility and clinical judgment) |

---

Note: dosing should be adjusted based on **age, weight, renal function, and culture results** [^112aDnVJ].

## Risks and benefits of oral antibiotic therapy

### Benefits

Key benefits include **avoidance of hospitalization** and the associated risks, costs, and family disruption; earlier transition to oral therapy can shorten the length of stay and reduce healthcare costs [^114wayU1] [^113kvjRK]. Oral therapy is also generally well tolerated and associated with fewer adverse events than intravenous therapy [^112WBDMH].

---

### Risks

Key risks include the potential for **treatment failure or recurrence** if adherence is poor or the infection is complicated; infants have immature immune systems and may be more susceptible to complications; and oral antibiotics may not achieve adequate tissue concentrations in severe infections or in the presence of structural abnormalities [^111tQQGw].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Close monitoring and follow-up are essential when treating infants < 2 months old with UTI using oral antibiotics. Clinicians should arrange a **follow-up visit within 24–48 hours** to assess clinical response and adherence and repeat urine cultures if symptoms persist or recur [^notfound]. Parents and caregivers should be educated on signs of clinical deterioration, including fever, lethargy, poor feeding, or irritability [^115NfmKY].

---

## Situations where oral antibiotics are not recommended

Oral antibiotics are **not recommended** in the following situations:

- **Infants < 28 days old**: Due to higher risk of bacteremia, meningitis, and unreliable oral absorption [^111tQQGw].
- **Ill-appearing infants**: Signs of sepsis, severe illness, or hemodynamic instability [^111tQQGw].
- **Vomiting or dehydration**: Unable to tolerate oral intake [^114k4ezo].
- **Complicated infections**: Presence of abscess, severe renal involvement, or immunocompromised status [^111tQQGw].
- **Unreliable caregivers**: Inability to adhere to medication administration or follow-up appointments [^114k4ezo].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Oral antibiotics can be used in select, well-appearing infants 29–60 days old with uncomplicated UTI, provided strict clinical criteria are met and close follow-up is ensured [^1126jhDE]. For infants < 28 days old or those who are ill-appearing, **intravenous therapy remains the standard of care** due to higher risks of complications and unreliable oral absorption [^111tQQGw]. Clinicians should individualize treatment decisions based on clinical judgment, culture results, and caregiver reliability, and ensure close monitoring and follow-up to minimize the risk of treatment failure or recurrence [^114k4ezo].

### Antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis in children [^112WBDMH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants. The most severe form of UTI is acute pyelonephritis, which results in significant acute morbidity and may cause permanent kidney damage. There remains uncertainty regarding the optimum antibiotic regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2003 and updated in 2005 and 2007.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of antibiotics used to treat children with acute pyelonephritis. The aspects of therapy considered were 1) different antibiotics, 2) different dosing regimens of the same antibiotic, 3) different duration of treatment, and 4) different routes of administration.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of articles and conference proceedings without language restriction to 10 April 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic agents, routes, frequencies or durations of therapy in children aged 0 to 18 years with proven UTI and acute pyelonephritis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model and the results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This updated review included 27 studies (4452 children). This update included evidence from three new studies, and following re-evaluation, a previously excluded study was included because it now met our inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed as low for sequence generation (12 studies), allocation concealment (six studies), blinding of outcome assessors (17 studies), incomplete outcome reporting (19 studies) and selective outcome reporting (13 studies). No study was blinded for participants or investigators. The 27 included studies evaluated 12 different comparisons. No significant differences were found in duration of fever (2 studies, 808 children: MD 2.05 hours, 95% CI -0.84 to 4.94), persistent UTI at 72 hours after commencing therapy (2 studies, 542 children: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.41) or persistent kidney damage at six to 12 months (4 studies, 943 children: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.12) between oral antibiotic therapy (10 to 14 days) and intravenous (IV) therapy (3 days) followed by oral therapy (10 days). Similarly, no significant differences in persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment (4 studies, 305 children: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.55) or persistent kidney damage (4 studies, 726 children: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.29) were found between IV therapy (three to four days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy (seven to 14 days). No significant differences in efficacy were found between daily and thrice daily administration of aminoglycosides (1 study, 179 children, persistent clinical symptoms at three days: RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.53). Adverse events were mild and uncommon and rarely resulted in discontinuation of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review increases the body of evidence that oral antibiotics alone are as effective as a short course (three to four days) of IV antibiotics followed by oral therapy for a total treatment duration of 10 to 14 days for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children. When IV antibiotics are given, a short course (two to four days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy is as effective as a longer course (seven to 10 days) of IV therapy. If IV therapy with aminoglycosides is chosen, single daily dosing is safe and effective. Insufficient data are available to extrapolate these findings to children aged less than one month of age or to children with dilating vesicoureteric reflux (grades III-V). Further studies are required to determine the optimal total duration of antibiotic therapy required for acute pyelonephritis.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^111NW1XW]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common reason for hospitalization in young infants, with more than 20 000 infants (< 1 year of age) hospitalized annually in the United States. In children aged 2 to 24 months, the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines from 2011 (reaffirmed in 2016) state that "initiating treatment orally or parenterally is equally efficacious". Infants younger than 60 days often initially receive parenteral antibiotics as part of an evaluation for invasive bacterial infection. The optimal approach to intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy when a UTI is diagnosed in these younger infants is not known. As a result, significant practice heterogeneity exists both within and between institutions. -

Prescribing patterns and the appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy are a priority for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hospital systems, and individual care providers alike as it has a big impact on antimicrobial resistance. Moreover, a short-course IV therapy could provide additional potential benefits compared with a long-course therapy. Shorter hospitalizations would mean lower medical costs and increased hospital bed availability and may be less disruptive to parent-infant bonding. In addition, shorter hospitalization could reduce the risk of nosocomial infectionand adverse events, such as IV infiltrates. This approach is also in keeping with value-based health care delivery.

The goal of this study was to determine the association between short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (> 3 days) IV antibiotic therapies and treatment failure, defined as readmission from date of discharge within 30 days. We hypothesized that a short-course IV antibiotic therapy followed by oral antibiotics is safe, with no difference in treatment failure between short-course and long-course IV antibiotic therapy.

### Oral narrow-spectrum antibiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infection in infants younger than 60 days [^1146vzea]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Data on the outcome of infants younger than 60 days treated with a combination of intravenous and oral antibiotics for urinary tract infection are limited. This study examined susceptibility and successful outcomes of treatment with narrow-spectrum oral antibiotics. In addition, we describe the effects of antimicrobial stewardship education intervention on prescribing practices.

### Short versus standard duration oral antibiotic therapy for acute urinary tract infection in children [^116fi8dJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of oral antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infection (UTI) in children has not been determined. A number of studies have compared single dose therapy to standard therapy for UTI, with mixed results. A course of antibiotics longer than a single dose but shorter than the usual 7–10 days might decrease the relapse rate and still provide some of the benefits of a shortened course of antibiotics.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of short-course (2–4 days) compared to standard duration (7–14 days) oral antibiotic treatment for acute UTI in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2002) MEDLINE (1966 - September 2002) and EMBASE (1988 -September 2002) without language restriction.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing short-term (2–4 days) with standard (7–14 days) oral antibiotic therapy were selected if they studied children aged three months to 18 years with culture proven UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

Main Results

Ten trials were identified in which 652 children with lower tract UTI were evaluated. There was no significant difference in the frequency of positive urine cultures between the short (2–4 days) and standard duration oral antibiotic therapy (7–14 days) for UTI in children at 0–10 days after treatment (eight studies: RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.76) and at one to 15 months after treatment (10 studies: RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.29). There was no significant difference between short and standard duration therapy in the development of resistant organisms in UTI at the end of treatment (one study: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01) or in recurrent UTI (three studies: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.29).

Reviewer's Conclusions

A 2–4 day course of oral antibiotics appears to be as effective as 7–14 days in eradicating lower tract UTI in children.

### Antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis in children [^112d759c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infection in infants. The most severe form of UTI is acute pyelonephritis, which results in significant acute morbidity and may cause permanent renal damage. Published guidelines recommend treatment of acute pyelonephritis initially with intravenous (IV) therapy followed by oral therapy for seven to 14 days though there is no consensus on the duration of either IV or oral therapy.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of articles and conference proceedings without language restriction. Date of most recent search: December 2006.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic agents, routes, frequencies or durations of therapy in children aged 0 to 18 years with proven UTI and acute pyelonephritis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (WMD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Twenty three studies (3295 children) were eligible for inclusion. No significant differences were found in persistent renal damage at 6 months (2 studies, 424 children: RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.16) or in duration of fever (2 studies, 693 children: WMD 1.54, 95% CI -1.67 to 4.76) between oral antibiotic therapy (10 to 14 days) and IV therapy (3 days) followed by oral therapy (10 days). Similarly no significant differences in persistent renal damage (3 studies, 341 children: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.49) were found between IV therapy (3 to 4 days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy for 7 to 14 days. No significant differences in efficacy were found between daily and thrice daily administration of aminoglycosides (1 study, 179 children, persistent symptoms at 3 days: RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.53).

Authors' Conclusions

These results suggest that children with acute pyelonephritis can be treated effectively with oral antibiotics (cefixime, ceftibuten and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid) or with short courses (2 to 4 days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy. If IV therapy is chosen, single daily dosing with aminoglycosides is safe and effective. Studies are required to determine the optimal total duration of therapy.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^113fVDhK]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) algorithm — initial evaluation in febrile infants 2–24 months begins with "Infant 2–24 mo with fever ≥ 38°C" and asks whether the patient requires immediate antimicrobial therapy; if immediate therapy is needed, the algorithm directs to "Obtain urine by catheterization or SPA", "Perform urinalysis", and "Culture urine obtained by catheterization or SPA", and the notes state that "A urine sample suitable for culture should be obtained before initiating antimicrobials". Initial management is to "Treat with antimicrobials effective against common uropathogens according to local sensitivity patterns; oral or parenteral", and if "Urinalysis and culture positive?" is not satisfied, "Discontinue antimicrobials".

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^111tQQGw]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

For children with multiple recurrent UTI, starting with IV antibiotics is not obligatory. Each episode should be managed according to presentation. This group is at risk of infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria through increased antibiotic exposure. If a child has previously had a UTI with bacteria resistant to all oral options, initial antibiotics can be IV until culture results are available. Intravesical antibiotics, via the urethra or Mitrofanoff, are occasionally used to treat intractable recurrent UTI, with small studies showing successful outcomes with 7 days of treatment. Local irrigation may limit systemic antibiotic side effects and keep children out of hospital.

UTI with fever alone can be effectively treated with oral antibiotics. Severe clinical presentations of UTI requiring initial IV include sepsis (features include hypotension and tachycardia when afebrile) and extensive parenchymal involvement. Vomiting can be a sign of sepsis, but on its own is rarely a reason to start IV: in an observational study, over 60% of children with vomiting were successfully treated with oral antibiotics. For extensive renal parenchymal involvement (nephronia/abscess), IV antibiotics ensure maximum concentration at the site.

Nonurologic underlying conditions are renal and nonrenal. A review of UTI postrenal transplant recommended initial IV antibiotics for pyelonephritis to achieve rapid tissue saturation. Although there is a lack of studies of UTI management with other renal impairment, in the absence of severe VUR, oral antibiotics can usually be used. For immunocompromised children, treatment should be via febrile neutropenia pathways if relevant. Otherwise, unless presenting severely unwell, oral antibiotics may be appropriate in immunosuppression or other states of chronic disease (eg, diabetes and liver disease).

For neonates and infants < 2 months, there are no RCTs and little comparative evidence to definitively guide the route of antibiotics for UTI. Major guidelines recommend IV antibiotics due to suboptimal enteral absorption, immune immaturity and high risk of bacteremia. The only study of oral antibiotics in infants that included this age group had too few < 2 months to make strong recommendations supporting this. Most retrospective studies of UTI in neonatesand infants < 2 months – used initial IV antibiotics, and until there is any evidence to the contrary, this continues to be the recommendation, at least as the initial route.

### Short intravenous antibiotic courses for urinary infections in young infants: a systematic review [^117Qgc7y]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in young infants, yet there is no guidance on the optimal duration of intravenous (IV) treatment.

Objective

To determine if shorter IV antibiotic courses (≤ 7 days) are appropriate for managing UTIs in infants aged ≤ 90 days.

Methods

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Medline, and Embase (February 2021) were used as data sources. Included studies reported original data for infants aged ≤ 90 days with UTIs, studied short IV antibiotic durations (≤ 7 days), and described at least 1 treatment outcome. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guideline was followed. Studies were screened by 2 investigators, and bias was assessed by using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool.

Results

Eighteen studies with 16615 young infants were included. The largest 2 studies on bacteremic UTI found no difference in the rates of 30-day recurrence between those treated with ≤ 7 vs > 7 days of IV antibiotics. For nonbacteremic UTI, there was no significant difference in the adjusted 30-day recurrence between those receiving ≤ 3 vs > 3 days of IV antibiotics in the largest 2 studies identified. Three studies of infants aged ≥ 30 days used oral antibiotics alone and reported good outcomes, although only 85 infants were ≤ 90 days old.

Conclusions

Shorter IV antibiotic courses of ≤ 7 days and ≤ 3 days with early switch to oral antibiotics should be considered in infants aged ≤ 90 days with bacteremic and nonbacteremic UTI, respectively, after excluding meningitis. Further studies of treatment with oral antibiotics alone are needed in this age group.

### Urinary tract infections in young children and infants: common questions and answers [^115NM8v3]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in children and are associated with significant short- and long-term morbidity. They have a high recurrence rate and are associated with anatomic and functional abnormalities. The decision to test for UTI is based on risk factors and the child's age. Urinalysis is valuable to rule out UTI and to help decide when to start antibiotics; however, urine culture is needed for definitive diagnosis. Urine specimens collected via perineal bagging should not be used for culture because of high false-positive rates. Diagnosis of UTI requires pyuria and bacterial growth in the urine culture. Prompt treatment of UTIs reduces renal scarring. Antibiotic selection should be based on local sensitivity patterns and adjusted once culture results are available. In most cases, oral antibiotics are as effective as intravenous agents. When intravenous antibiotics are used, early transition to an oral regimen is as effective as longer intravenous courses. Kidney and bladder ultrasonography is helpful to identify acute complications and anatomic abnormalities. Voiding cystourethrography is indicated when ultrasound findings are abnormal and in cases of recurrent febrile UTIs. The use of antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent UTIs is controversial. Identification and treatment of bowel and bladder dysfunction can prevent UTI recurrence.

### Short oral antibiotic therapy for pediatric febrile urinary tract infections: a randomized trial [^1148JM6o]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI) in well-appearing children is conventionally treated with a standard 10-day course of oral antibiotic. The objective of this study is to determine the noninferiority (5% threshold) of a 5-day amoxicillin-clavulanate course compared with a 10-day regimen to treat fUTIs.

Methods

This is a multicenter, investigator-initiated, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial. We randomly assigned children aged 3 months to 5 years with a noncomplicated fUTI to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate 50+7.12 mg/kg/day orally in 3 divided doses for 5 or 10 days. The primary end point was the recurrence of a urinary tract infection within 30 days after the completion of therapy. Secondary end points were the difference in prevalence of clinical recovery, adverse drug-related events, and resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and/or to other antibiotics when a recurrent infection occurred.

Results

From May 2020 through September 2022, 175 children were assessed for eligibility and 142 underwent randomization. The recurrence rate within 30 days of the end of therapy was 2.8% (2/72) in the short group and 14.3% (10/70) in the standard group. The difference between the 2 groups was -11.51% (95% confidence interval, -20.54 to -2.47). The recurrence rate of fUTI within 30 days from the end of therapy was 1.4% (1/72) in the short group and 5.7% (4/70) in the standard group (95% confidence interval, -10.4 to 1.75).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that a 5-day course is noninferior to a 10-day course of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate.

Initial management

General

Children with UTI require targeted antibiotics and supportive care. Most children with UTI can be managed at home with oral fluids and antibiotics. A small percentage will require admission for intravenous therapy, including very young and very unwell children, children with significant renal tract anomalies and children not responding to oral therapy.

Antibiotic therapy

Choice of empiric antibiotics must be guided by local guidelines, as local antimicrobial sensitivities vary significantly (table 2). The suitability of the initial agent should be reviewed once culture results are available.

Table 2
Recent evidence, controversies and emerging evidence

Oral antibiotics are effective for the overwhelming majority of paediatric UTI. Previous Cochrane reviews suggest that short 2–4 days courses are as effective as longer 7–14 days for uncomplicated cystitis, while single dose therapy is less effective. American guidelines recommend treatment durations of 7–14 days for both cystitis and pyelonephritis, Canadian guidelines recommend 7–10 days, while National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggests 7–10 days for pyelonephritis and a shorter 3 day course for children > 3 months with cystitis. Spanish guidelines mirror NICE recommendations though single-dose therapy is recommended for children aged > 6 years with uncomplicated cystitis.

Younger and sicker children may require initial intravenous therapy. Many guidelines and centres recommend admission, intravenous antibiotics and consideration of septic work-up for infants < 3 months. Aim to switch to oral therapy after 48 hours if there is clinical improvement.

Antibiotic resistance

Antibiotic resistant UTI is becoming more common globally, increases morbidity and doubles healthcare costs. The usual mechanism is through acquisition of enhanced beta-lactamase enzyme properties. Some Gram negative uropathogens can inactivate beta-lactam ring antibiotics such as penicillin and early generation cephalosporins with inherent beta-lactamase enzymes. However, some have acquired further multidrug-resistant properties through evolution of these enzymes, including the ability to hydrolyse and inactivate extended spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenem antibiotics. Such organisms are known as extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) organisms. Prior antibiotic therapy and hospitalisation are risk factors for ESBL carriage, which then contributes to community carriage and transmission of resistance. Rates of resistant UTIs are particularly high in resource-limited settings, where resistance to common oral antibiotics such as ampicillin and cotrimoxazole can be as high as 97%–100%.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^117DocBi]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment durations for lower and upper UTIs have gradually reduced, but randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of shorter durations have largely excluded children with complications. Therefore, there is scant evidence for total durations shorter than 10–14 days for cUTI.

For neonates and infants < 2 months, the majority of retrospective studies in bacteremic, and nonbacteremic,– UTI used a total of 10–14 days of antibiotics with high success rates. A recent systematic review comparing the IV component in infants up to 3 months recommended: for bacteremic UTI, IV antibiotics up to 7 days; and for nonbacteremic UTI, up to 3 days. Switching from IV to oral in both situations is recommended when the infant is afebrile, well and tolerating oral intake.

For severe clinical presentations, a retrospective study of children with febrile UTI included those with initial tachycardia, hypotension and/or vomiting. It showed that 6–9 days was as effective as ≥ 10 days of total antibiotics, although it did not report numbers with severe features. Once features of sepsis resolve (usually by day 3), total antibiotic duration is dependent on bacteremia. A multicenter study of children under 6 months with UTI found bacteremia was more likely to be treated with ≥ 4 than ≤ 3 days IV (total 7–14 days). A case-control study comparing bacteremic versus nonbacteremic UTI found a difference in IV (5–7 vs. 3–4 days) but not total (11–12 days) antibiotic duration, and no differences in outcomes. For acute lobar nephronia, a review including overlapping RCTs compared 14 versus 21 days' total duration, with initial IV then switching to oral 2–3 days after defervescence. There was higher treatment failure with 14 days, but failure was associated with longer pre-presentation fever, suggesting longer treatment is necessary for more established abscesses.

### Revised AAP guideline on UTI in febrile infants and young children [^111Z7V9H]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a revision of its 1999 clinical practice guideline on urinary tract infections in febrile infants and young children two to 24 months of age. The new clinical practice guideline has several important updates based on evidence generated over the past decade. The updated guideline includes clinical criteria for collecting urine specimens. Diagnosis now requires evidence of infection from both abnormal urinalysis results and positive urine culture results (the criterion for a positive culture has been reduced from at least 100,000 colony-forming units per mL to at least 50,000 colony-forming units per mL). Oral treatment now is considered to be as effective as parenteral treatment. Renal and bladder ultrasonography is still recommended, but the biggest change in the current guideline is that routine voiding cystourethrography is no longer recommended after the first urinary tract infection. Follow-up is based on evaluating children for urinary tract infection during subsequent febrile episodes, rather than routinely performing repeat urine cultures.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — antimicrobial prophylaxis considerations state that although effectiveness for prevention of UTI has not been demonstrated, the concept has biological plausibility. Antimicrobials reach high urinary concentrations, yet barriers include adherence to a daily regimen, adverse effects, and emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Evidence of effectiveness with a well-tolerated, safe product and parent education are needed; a urinary antiseptic that could be taken indefinitely without resistance is particularly desirable, and probiotics are another possible strategy.

### Short compared with standard duration of antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^112N8jzD]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare the effectiveness of short course (2–4 days) with standard duration oral antibiotic treatment (7–14 days) for urinary tract infection (UTI).

Methods

Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials using a random effects model. Ten trials were eligible, involving 652 children with lower tract UTI recruited from outpatient or emergency departments. Main outcome measures were UTI at the end of treatment, UTI during follow up (recurrent UTI), and urinary pathogens resistant to the treating antibiotic.

Results

There was no significant difference in the frequency of positive urine cultures between the short (2–4 days) and standard duration therapy (7–14 days) for UTI in children at 0–7 days after treatment (eight studies: RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.76) and at 10 days to 15 months after treatment (10 studies: RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.33). There was no significant difference between short and standard duration therapy in the development of resistant organisms in UTI at the end of treatment (one study: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01) or in recurrent UTI (three studies: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.29).

Conclusion

A 2–4 day course of oral antibiotics is as effective as 7–14 days in eradicating lower tract UTI in children.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^111jWvH5]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The presumption that IV antibiotics are superior to oral antibiotics remains a driving force for the treatment in many pediatric and neonatal conditions. Yet, in studies in which neonates are specifically addressed, oral antibiotic therapy has not been associated with treatment failure or recurrence of infection despite concerns of decreased enteral absorption.

The present study is not without its limitations, namely the retrospective design, and there is a potential for misclassification in infants with recurrent UTI if the recurrence was managed in the outpatient setting or at a different institution and would, therefore, not have been captured using our data-collection methodology. Based on the young age of the infants and the fact that we are the only children's hospital in Toronto, we suspect this is likely to be very uncommon, but this misclassification could lead to an underestimation of treatment failure. Given this, we acknowledge that the low incidence of treatment failure within our cohort posted limitations to our statistical analysis, particularly in the case of variable selection for our multiple logistic regression models.

Although we collected data on a variety of demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging variables, there may be others that were not included such that they could have impacted IV treatment duration, including response to treatment, resolution of fever, vomiting, or other clinical symptoms. Moreover, patients who are premature and/or present with comorbidities may not have the same outcomes with a shorter IV therapy. In addition, it is possible that there is a subset of infants in which there are high risk factors and in whom longer courses of parenteral antibiotics are appropriate. Future studies should focus on identifying which populations of young infants, if any, may benefit from longer courses of parenteral antibiotic therapy. Lastly, we did not collect information on multidrug-resistant organisms. As such, this study does not address or make specific recommendations relating to therapy nor duration of therapy for infants with culture results growing multidrug-resistant pathogens.

### Urinary tract infection at the age extremes: pediatrics and geriatrics [^112KTmNx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and generally benign conditions among healthy, sexually active young women without long-term medical sequelae. In contrast, UTIs are more complicated among those individuals at either end of the age spectrum: infants/young children and geriatrics. UTI in children younger than 2 years has been associated with significant morbidity and long-term medical consequences, necessitating an extensive and somewhat invasive imaging evaluation to identify possible underlying functional or anatomic abnormalities. Pediatric UTI should be considered complicated until proved otherwise, and treatment should reflect the severity of signs and symptoms. Management in the acutely ill child frequently involves parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, and less ill children can be treated with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), beta-lactams, and cephalosporins.UTI among older patients (> 65 years) may be complicated by comorbidities, the baseline presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and benign urinary symptoms that can complicate diagnosis. The etiology of UTI encompasses a broader spectrum of infecting organisms than is seen among younger patients and includes more gram-positive organisms. Symptomatic UTI is generally more difficult to treat than among younger populations. Management should be conservative, of longer treatment durations, and cover a broad spectrum of possible uropathogens. Oral or parenteral treatment with a fluoroquinolone for 7 days is the preferred empiric approach. TMP-SMX can also be considered a first-line agent in women only, but only if the pathogen is known to be TMP-SMX sensitive.

### Urinary tract infection in children [^115NfmKY]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to 11.3% of girls and 3.6% of boys will have had a urinary tract infection (UTI) by the age of 16 years, and recurrence of infection is common. Vesicoureteric reflux is identified in up to 40% of children being investigated for a first UTI, and is a risk factor for, but weak predictor of, renal parenchymal defects.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment of acute urinary tract infection in children? What are the effects of interventions to prevent recurrence? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 25 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (short initial intravenous antibiotics, long initial intravenous antibiotics, initial oral antibiotics, single-dose or single-day courses of oral antibiotics, short courses of oral antibiotics, long courses of oral antibiotics, immediate empirical antibiotics, delayed antibiotics, prolonged delay of antibiotics, prophylactic antibiotics); immunotherapy; surgical correction of minor functional abnormalities; and surgical correction of moderate to severe vesicoureteric reflux.

Antimicrobial therapy duration for febrile UTI — the total course of therapy should be 7 to 14 days, and there is evidence that 1- to 3-day courses for febrile UTIs are inferior to courses in the recommended range; therefore, the minimal duration selected should be 7 days. Outcomes of short courses (1–3 d) are inferior to those of 7- to 14-d courses, and there are minimal harm and minor cost effects of antimicrobial choice and duration of therapy. Aggregate quality of evidence: A/B (RCTs), intentional vagueness notes that no evidence distinguishes the benefit of treating 7 vs 10 vs 14 days, and the policy level is Strong recommendation/ recommendation.

### Treatment of UTIs in infants [^115RRx6Q]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections in infants < 2 months of age. However, there are no clear guidelines on the appropriate duration of antibiotics in this age group.

Objective

In this living systematic review, we compared different durations of parenteral antibiotics (≤ 3 vs > 3 days) in neonates and young infants (< 2 months) with UTIs. The secondary objective was to compare different durations of total antibiotic courses (≤ 10 vs > 10 days).

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde, Google Scholar, and gray literature, up to March 2, 2021.

Study Selection

Citations were screened in triplicate by using a crowdsourcing methodology, to identify randomized controlled trials and observational studies.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted by 2 crowd members and verified by an expert investigator. Outcomes were pooled via random-effects models.

Results

A total of 10334 citations were screened, and 12 eligible studies were identified. A total of 59 of 3480 (1.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3% to 2.2%]) infants had a UTI recurrence within 30 days after short parenteral treatment (≤ 3 days), and 47 of 1971 (2.4% [95% CI: 1.8% to 3.2%]) after longer courses. The pooled adjusted odds ratio for UTI recurrence with a short versus long duration of parenteral antibiotics was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.64 to 1.61; p = 0.95; n = 5451). A total of 5 studies assessed the risk of recurrence on the basis of the total duration of antibiotics (≤ 10 vs > 10 days) with no significant differences (pooled odds ratio: 1.29 [95% CI: 0.45 to 3.66; p = 0.63; n = 491).

Conclusions

On the basis of retrospective studies and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation level low evidence, short and long duration of parenteral antibiotics were associated with a similar risk of UTI recurrence in infants < 2 months.

It also states that the optimal duration of antimicrobial treatment has not been determined and calls for RCTs of head-to-head comparisons of various duration to limit antimicrobial exposure to what is needed to eradicate the offending uropathogen.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^1155TKup]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies support home IV treatment through well-resourced hospital-in-the-home programs if children are stable,– including neonates. In deciding between initial IV or oral antibiotics, the concept of complicated UTI being on a spectrum may be useful. Apart from children with sepsis, the majority with a single complicating feature are initially managed orally. Increasing the number of complicating features increases IV use, so they could be combined into a clinical score with a threshold for using IV. Outside of severe presentation, severe uropathy and neonates, clinically stable children with isolated complicating features can initially be treated with oral antibiotics.

Empiric Antibiotic Choice

Regarding empiric antibiotic choice (1) different cUTI subgroups have different uropathogen prevalence and (2) an individualized risk assessment for resistance is needed based on the child's underlying condition, prior antibiotic use and hospitalization. Based on these, an empiric regimen can be chosen that covers likely pathogens and incorporates the likelihood of resistance (GRADES C and D).
Patients with recurrent infections may initially be treated based on previous cultures (GRADE D).
For children on antibiotic prophylaxis, a different antibiotic choice is needed (GRADE C).
Targeted de-escalated monotherapy is recommended according to susceptibilities once available (GRADE D).

Each cUTI subgroup is vulnerable to different pathogens, and assessment for unusual and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is crucial. Risk factors for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) include recurrent UTI, VUR, recent antibiotic exposure, young age and Klebsiella spp. – Risk factors for more resistant carbapenemase-producing uropathogens are prolonged hospitalization, invasive devices and recent travel to endemic areas. – Empiric antibiotic choice needs to balance the risk of resistance with the need for antimicrobial stewardship for this common infection, potentially accepting a short delay in definitive treatment for children who are hemodynamically stable.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis and recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^111ckKfa]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are widely administered to children with the intention of preventing urinary tract infection, but adequately powered, placebo-controlled trials regarding efficacy are lacking. This study from four Australian centers examined whether low-dose, continuous oral antibiotic therapy prevents urinary tract infection in predisposed children.

Methods

We randomly assigned children under the age of 18 years who had had one or more microbiologically proven urinary tract infections to receive either daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole suspension (as 2 mg of trimethoprim plus 10 mg of sulfamethoxazole per kilogram of body weight) or placebo for 12 months. The primary outcome was microbiologically confirmed symptomatic urinary tract infection. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed with the use of time-to-event data.

Results

From December 1998 to March 2007, a total of 576 children (of 780 planned) underwent randomization. The median age at entry was 14 months; 64% of the patients were girls, 42% had known vesicoureteral reflux (at least grade III in 53% of these patients), and 71% were enrolled after the first diagnosis of urinary tract infection. During the study, urinary tract infection developed in 36 of 288 patients (13%) in the group receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic group) and in 55 of 288 patients (19%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the antibiotic group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.93; P = 0.02 by the log-rank test). In the antibiotic group, the reduction in the absolute risk of urinary tract infection (6 percentage points) appeared to be consistent across all subgroups of patients (P ≥ 0.20 for all interactions).

Conclusions

Long-term, low-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with a decreased number of urinary tract infections in predisposed children. The treatment effect appeared to be consistent but modest across subgroups. (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number, ACTRN12608000470392.)

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^115D6eik]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Historically, bacteremic UTIs have been treated with longer courses of IV antibiotics because of concerns for severity of infection, renal scarring, hospital readmission, and recurrent UTIs. It was therefore not surprising that in our study, infants with bacteremia received a longer duration of IV antibiotic therapy than those without bacteremia although there are no available published recommendations on duration of parenteral treatment. Many studies in the literature revealed variation in duration of parenteral antibiotics for treatment of UTI and bacteremic UTI.

Angeles et alperformed a more than 10-year retrospective analysis of otherwise healthy infants younger than 60 days of age with a UTI and identified an increasing trend toward short-course parenteral antibiotics, as well as no differences in readmission rates as the parenteral antibiotic duration shortened. Total antibiotic courses in that particular study were not analyzed.

In a randomized clinical trial of 309 infants aged 1 to 24 months with fever and UTI, patients received initial therapy with either oral cefixime alone or IV cefotaxime. Thirteen infants, after randomization, were found to be bacteremic. The study found no significant differences in time to defervescence, symptomatic reinfection, or renal scarring at 6 months, regardless of the presence of bacteremia. Significantly, in this study, none (0 of 13) of the infants with bacteremia were found to have renal scarring by 6 months of age; however, 10% (26/288) of the nonbacteremic population did have evidence of scarring. A recent systemic review was published in pediatricsincluding several of the aforementioned studies. In this review, the largest two studies on bacteremic UTI found no difference in the rates of 30-day recurrence between those treated with ≤ 7 days versus > 7 days of IV antibiotics. For nonbacteremic UTI, there was no significant difference in the adjusted 30-day recurrence between those receiving ≤ 3 days versus > 3 days of IV antibiotics in the largest 2 studies identified. A Finnish study including 134 children with bacteremic UTI matched with children with UTIs and negative blood culture results found that infants with bacteremia often had no difference in clinical presentation or recovery and that the presence of positive culture results did not add new microbiologic information.

### Pediatric urinary tract infections: the role of fluoroquinolones [^112HqAF8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Infections of the urinary tract (UTI) occur commonly in the pediatric population. Because of the high association of pediatric UTI with congenital structural anomalies of the urinary tract and with dysfunctional elimination syndromes, it is far more common for children to be categorized as having complicated UTI than their adult counterparts. And for children more intensive therapy is often required. Early and effective treatment of UTIs in the pediatric patient is considered essential to prevent long term morbidity and potential mortality from end stage renal disease. An oral antimicrobial is more convenient than parenteral therapy and is preferable as long as clinical efficacy and safety can be assured. Oral fluoroquinolones are an attractive alternative for the treatment of complicated UTI in children, and safety must always be a factor in considering their use in this population. Although the role of fluoroquinolones in pediatric UTI is still under investigation, the limited data available demonstrate a likelihood of efficacy and safety.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^112tiy5y]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Short-course IV antibiotic treatment was defined as the receipt of IV antibiotics for ≤ 3 calendar days, and long-course treatment was defined as the receipt of IV antibiotics for > 3 calendar days. One or more doses of an antibiotic on a given calendar day was considered a full day of treatment. The main outcome was readmission for a UTI, which is defined as any readmission within 30 days of the index discharge with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, code related to UTI present at admission. We chose 30 days because this time would allow more than 2 weeks' period without antibiotics for all infants who completed a typical 10- to 14-day course, including oral antibiotic treatment at home. A UTI diagnosis within this period likely would be related to treatment failure.

Descriptive statistics were performed for categorical and continuous variables, and data were summarized as median (interquartile range [IQR]), counts and percentages. For comparison of each group, chi-square and Fischer's exact tests were used for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric continuous data. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to examine the association between the primary exposure variable (short vs long IV treatment) and the odds of readmission for a UTI and for all causes within 30 days. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (16.1; StataCorp, College Station, Texas). All P values were calculated by 2-tailed distribution, and values < .05 were considered significant.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^115EJrG2]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and associated Gram-negative bacteremia treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly included patients who were afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and had achieved source control (relief of any urinary obstruction) before transitioning to oral antibiotics. An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

The trials supporting this recommendation mostly excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, sepsis or septic shock, immunocompromised states, severe renal insufficiency, and functional or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and some patients in these subpopulations may need an individualized plan of therapy.

Five trials involving 463 children were performed.

Results

Three trials (n = 392) evaluated the effectiveness of long treatment courses of antibiotics (2 to 6 months) for children with acute UTI to prevent subsequent, off-treatment infection. Only 2 trials (n = 71) evaluated the effectiveness of long-term, low-dose antibiotics to prevent on-treatment UTI. Very few of the children enrolled in the trials were boys, had abnormal renal tracts, or were infants. The trial quality was poor, with a lack of blinding, and unstated UTI definitions were almost universal. Long-term antibiotic administration reduced the risk of UTI with treatment (relative risk 0.31, 95% confidence limits 0.10 to 1.00), but there was significant heterogeneity (Q = 13.45, P < .01), and there was no sustained benefit once antibiotics had ceased (relative risk 0.79, 0.61 to 1.02).

Conclusions

Methodologic and applicability problems with published trials mean that there is considerable uncertainty about whether long-term, low-dose antibiotic administration prevents UTI in children. Well-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are still required to evaluate this commonly used intervention.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostic policy considerations: Harms/risks/costs state that stringent diagnostic criteria may miss a small number of UTIs, the benefit-harms assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm, and value judgments note that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria may be harmful; the role of patient preferences is that parents prefer no action in the absence of a UTI (avoiding false-positive results) over a very small chance of missing a UTI, with exclusions noted as none, intentional vagueness as none, and policy level as recommendation.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^117M6yYu]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

The study was approved by the institutional review board at our pediatric tertiary care center (REB #10000062307). We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all infants < 60 days old with confirmed bacterial UTIs who were admitted and received IV antibiotics between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2017. Primary and secondary diagnosis codes for acute UTI or pyelonephritis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, code 590.10, 590.11, 590.80, or 599.0) were included in the initial cohort.

The diagnosis of UTI was deemed certain if urine cultures obtained through suprapubic aspiration showed gram-negative bacteria (any amount) or > 10 × 10 6 colonies per liter of gram-positive bacteria or if urine cultures obtained through bladder catheterization showed > 50 × 10 6 colonies per liter of a single pathogen (excluding lactobacilli, corynebacteria, and coagulase-negative staphylococci) or > 10 × 10 6 colonies per liter of Pseudomonas species. Those treated for UTI who did not meet the aforementioned criteria were excluded for the purpose of this study. We also excluded any infants with catheter-associated UTI, prior urological procedures, mixed-growth urine cultures, fungal growth, and bacterial meningitis. Covariates of interest included patient age, sex, prematurity (defined as gestational age < 37 weeks), comorbidities, clinical parameters such as systolic blood pressure, creatinine level, presence of fever (ie, a reported temperature ≥ 38.0 °C [100.4 °F] at home, in an outpatient clinic, or documented in the emergency department and obtained via any method), ill appearance, causative pathogens, blood culture, imaging modalities, type and length of antibiotic treatment (oral/IV), caring team, and length of stay. Ill appearance was defined as any of the following physical examination terms documented on arrival to the emergency department: "ill appearing", "toxic", "limp", "unresponsive", "gray", "cyanotic", "apnea", "weak cry", "poorly perfused", "grunting", "listless", "lethargic", or "irritable". If none of these terms were documented, the infant was classified as alert. Nosocomial UTI was defined as any infant who developed UTI during hospital stay for other reasons, except those with catheter-associated UTI.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^112g1Xt4]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Treatment failure for infants hospitalized in the first 2 months of life with UTI is uncommon and does not change if the duration of parenteral antibiotic therapy is more or less than 3 days. Treating more infants of this age group with short courses of IV antibiotic therapy might decrease the length of hospitalization and resource use without affecting the readmission rates. The relationship between longer antibiotic duration and prematurity, comorbidities, bacteremia, younger age group (< 3 weeks), hospital-acquired UTI, and other clinical parameters should be explored further because these factors were significantly associated with longer antibiotic duration.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^116x7fcQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Over the last 5 years, new and updated pediatric UTI guidelines from around the world have become increasingly consistent for uncomplicated UTI, but either do not address or differ in definition and recommendations for complicated UTI. This is the first comprehensive guideline focused exclusively on cUTI in children that addresses its diagnosis and management according to the features making it complicated: young age, disease severity/extent and comorbidities. This guideline is comprehensive in addressing gaps in existing guidelines by first highlighting that cUTI is not a uniform entity but rather constitutes a wide range of disease processes. The guideline presents the evidence for diagnosing and managing the subgroups presenting with each of these processes to ensure more individualized patient management. It also reviews emerging evidence for conceptualizing cUTI as an amalgamation of patients' individual features and attainment of a threshold for more intense management. Regardless of the subgroup, accurate diagnosis is the critical first step in managing children with cUTI for which additional investigations, such as blood culture, serum biochemistry and USS, might be required. While several subgroups benefit from initial IV (sepsis, VUR 3–5, neonates) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (sepsis, high risk of resistance from recurrent UTI and immunocompromise), oral narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for most children with cUTI who are not severely unwell. Prophylaxis is not needed universally in cUTI, and its relatively small benefits in specific subgroups need to be weighed against the risk of resistance, with at least 6-monthly reevaluation for its requirement. Longer-term follow-up should aim to assess the need for surgical intervention to reduce the risk of renal damage.

Despite cUTI being common in children, differences in definition and focus on uncomplicated infection have led to scarce high-grade evidence for management, that is also difficult to synthesize. Apart from RCT-based recommendations for CAP in children with urological abnormality, these guidelines are largely based on retrospective studies and expert consensus in areas where high-quality evidence is currently lacking. In addition, available evidence mostly comes from resource-rich settings, and in resource-limited settings there may be some barriers to accessing some investigations and treatments, for example, nuclear medicine imaging and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, most first-line investigations in the guideline are broadly available and most antibiotic recommendations are from the World Health Organization Access list which should be available in most countries. Therefore, these guidelines can be effectively implemented in most healthcare settings, even in resource-limited environments.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^113s5qBS]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Oral cephalexin and amoxicillin were used in the continuation phase in 48% and 30% of the cases, respectively, and the total period of treatment (oral and IV) was 10 (IQR: 9–14) days. The median length of stay was 5 (IQR: 3–21) days, and only 34 (8%) patients needed long-term home IV antibiotics. Of the 403 children in the final study cohort, only 19 (5%) experienced treatment failure, defined as readmission within 30 days after discharge. Over the course of the study period, the proportion of children exhibiting treatment failure per year ranged from 2.5% to 8.8%. The treatment failure rate was similar (5%) between both groups; short-course versus long-course IV antibiotic exposure (P > .05). The median time to readmission was 17 (IQR: 8–27) days.

We found in the bivariate analyses (Table 1) that nosocomial UTI, age younger than 3 weeks, children with a higher baseline creatinine level, premature children, the presence of comorbidities, and children with a positive blood culture were each associated with increased likelihood of receiving a long-course IV antibiotic treatment (P < .001). Children with comorbidities and hospital-acquired UTI had longer length of stay (28 vs 3 days [P < .0001] and 56 vs 3 [P < .0001], respectively). In retrospect, the rate of renal scarring on DMSA scan was significantly higher in patients that had received long-course IV antibiotics (2 vs 13 days, P = 0.03). There were no statistically significant associations between IV antibiotic duration and patient sex, UTI history, appearance at presentation, low systolic blood pressure, abnormal KUB US findings, and presence of vesicoureteral reflux on voiding cystourethrography.

### Antibiotics for treating lower urinary tract infection in children [^114oxSmY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants and children. Lower UTI is the most commonly presenting and in the majority of cases can be easily treated with a course of antibiotic therapy with no further complications. A number of antimicrobials have been used to treat children with lower UTIs; however is it unclear what are the specific benefits and harms of such treatments.

Objectives

This review aims to summarise the benefits and harms of antibiotics for treating lower UTI in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Renal Group's Specialised Register (April 2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5), MEDLINE OVID SP (from 1966), and EMBASE OVID SP (from 1988) without language restriction. Date of last search: May 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which antibiotic therapy was used to treat bacteriologically proven, symptomatic, lower UTI in children aged zero to 18 years in primary and community healthcare settings were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Sixteen RCTs, analysing 1,116 children were included. Conventional 10-day antibiotic treatment significantly increased the number of children free of persistent bacteriuria compared to single-dose therapy (6 studies, 228 children: RR 2.01, 95%CI 1.06 to 3.80). No heterogeneity was observed. Persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment was reported in 24% of children receiving single-dose therapy compared to 10% of children who were randomised to 10-day therapy. There were no significant differences between groups for persistent symptoms, recurrence following treatment, or re-infection following treatment. There was insufficient data to analyse the effect of antibiotics on renal parenchymal damage, compliance, development of resistant organisms or adverse events. Despite the inclusion of 16 RCTs, methodological weakness and small sample sizes made it difficult to conclude if any of the included antibiotics or regimens were superior to another.

Authors' Conclusions

Although antibiotic treatment is effective for children with UTI, there are insufficient data to answer the question of which type of antibiotic or which duration is most effective to treat symptomatic lower UTI. This review found that 10-day antibiotic treatment is more likely to eliminate bacteria from the urine than single-dose treatments. No differences were observed for persistent bacteriuria, recurrence or re-infection between short and long-course antibiotics where the antibiotic differed between groups. This data adds to an existing Cochrane review comparing short and long-course treatment of the same antibiotic who also reported no evidence of difference between short and long-course antibiotics.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^116Gz7Mn]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Conclusions — In infants and young children 2 to 24 months of age with UTI and unexplained fever, diagnosis is based on the presence of pyuria and at least 50 000 CFUs per mL of a single uropathogen in an appropriately collected specimen of urine; urinalysis alone does not provide a definitive diagnosis. Strategies for diagnosis and treatment depend on whether the clinician determines that antimicrobial therapy is warranted immediately or can be delayed safely until urine culture and urinalysis results are available. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained with evaluation of the urine during subsequent febrile episodes to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117GrFR3]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) oral antibiotics — dose for patients with normal renal function includes the following regimens: Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875mg-125mg every 8 to 12 hours (note: "Other regimens may be more effective"); Cefpodoxime 200mg to 400mg every 12 hours; Ceftibuten 9mg/kg daily (children) and 400mg daily or 200mg every 12 hours (adults); Cefuroxime 500mg every 12 hours; Cephalexin 500mg to 1000mg every 6 hours (note: "Other regimens may be more effective"); Ciprofloxacin 500mg to 750mg every 12 hours; Levofloxacin 500mg to 750mg daily; Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 800mg-160mg every 12 hours. For other oral beta-lactams (e.g. amoxicillin, cefadroxil, cefaclor, cefdinir), comparative clinical outcomes data vs highly bioavailable oral alternatives are more limited and/or discouraging; consider use with infectious disease pharmacist consultation if alternatives are not available.

### Current primary care management of children aged 1–36 months with urinary tract infections in Europe: large scale survey of paediatric practice [^112eQqE9]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe current practice among European paediatricians regarding diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections in children aged 1–36months and to compare these practices with recently published guidelines.

Design

Web-based large scale survey evaluating knowledge of, attitudes towards and the methods for diagnosing, treating and managing urinary tract infections in children.

Setting

Primary and secondary care practices in Europe.

Sample

1129 paediatricians.

Results

A diagnosis of urinary tract infection is considered by 62% of the respondents in children aged 1–36months with unexplained fever. The preferred method of urine collection is use of a bag (53% for infants < 3months and 59% for children 4–36months of age). 60% of paediatricians agree that oral and parenteral antibiotics have equal efficacy. Co-amoxiclav is the antibiotic of choice for 41% of participants, while 9% prescribe amoxicillin. 80% of respondents prescribe ultrasound in all children with a confirmed urinary tract infection. 63% of respondents prescribe a cystography when abnormalities are revealed during ultrasound evaluation. A quarter of respondents recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for all children with any vesicoureteral reflux. The data among European countries are very heterogeneous. The three most recent urinary tract infection guidelines (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the American Academy of Paediatrics and the Italian Society of Paediatric Nephrology) are not followed properly.

Conclusions

Management of febrile urinary tract infections remains controversial and heterogeneous in Europe. Simple, short, practical and easy-to-remember guidelines and educational strategies to ensure their implementation should be developed.

### Short-course intravenous antibiotics for young infants with urinary tract infection [^115vKxLu]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Shorter courses of intravenous antibiotics for young infants with urinary tract infection (UTI) have myriad advantages. As practice shifts toward shorter intravenous treatment courses, this study aimed to determine the safety of early intravenous-to-oral antibiotic switch and identify risk factors for bacteraemia with UTI.

Methods

Retrospective audit of infants aged ≤ 90 days with a positive urine culture at a quaternary paediatric hospital over 4years (2016–2020). Data were collected from the hospital electronic medical record and laboratory information system. Short-course intravenous antibiotic duration was defined as < 48hours for non-bacteraemic UTI and < 7days for bacteraemic UTI. Multivariate analysis was used to determine patient factors predicting bacteraemia.

Results

Among 427 infants with non-bacteraemic UTI, 257 (60.2%) were treated for < 48hours. Clinicians prescribed shorter intravenous courses to infants who were female, aged > 30days, afebrile and those without bacteraemia or cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. Treatment failure (30-day UTI recurrence) occurred in 6/451 (1.3%) infants. All had non-bacteraemic UTI and one received < 48hours of intravenous antibiotics. None had serious complications (bacteraemia, meningitis, death). Follow-up audiology occurred in 21/31 (68%) infants with cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, and one had sensorineural hearing loss. Bacteraemia occurred in 24/451 (5.3%) infants, with 10 receiving < 7days intravenous antibiotics with no treatment failure. Fever and pyelonephritis were independent predictors of bacteraemia.

Conclusion

Short-course intravenous antibiotics for < 48hours for young infants with non-bacteraemic UTI should be considered, provided meningitis has been excluded. Treatment failure and serious complications were rare in young infants with UTI.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^115AfYaL]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection — methods and evidence synthesis: To provide evidence for the guideline, 2 literature searches were conducted, including surveillance of Medline-listed literature over the past 10 years and a systematic review on the effectiveness of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy to prevent recurrence of febrile UTI/pyelonephritis in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The search was expanded to include trials published since 1993 comparing antimicrobial prophylaxis with no treatment or placebo for children with VUR; because all except 1 recent randomized controlled trials included children more than 24 months of age and some lacked grade-specific data, the authors of the 6 RCTs were contacted and all provided raw data from their studies specifically addressing infants 2 to 24 months of age, according to grade of VUR. Meta-analysis of these data was performed, results from the literature searches and meta-analyses were provided to committee members, evidence and recommendation strength were graded according to AAP policy, and the subcommittee formulated 7 recommendations presented in text and in algorithm form in the Appendix.

### Management of urinary tract infections in young children: balancing admission with the risk of emergency department revisits [^113FVu5r]. Academic Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Oral antibiotics effectively treat most pediatric urinary tract infections (UTIs); however, children with UTIs are frequently admitted. We examined variation and trends in admission for children with UTIs plus investigated the relationship between admission and emergency department (ED) revisits for those initially managed on an outpatient basis. We hypothesized that hospitals would have similar 3-day revisit rates regardless of the admission rate at the index visit.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of 36 hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System. ED visits for children aged < 2 years presenting with UTI between 2010 and 2016 were studied. Main outcomes were age-stratified and included admission and 3-day ED revisit rates. Regression analyses were used to test hospital-level associations between outcomes and linear temporal trends.

Results

A total of 41,792 visits were studied. The overall admission rate was 27%. The admission rate was 89% for children aged < 2 months and 15% for those aged 2 to 24 months. Interhospital admission rates varied from 6% to 64%. Admission and revisit rates were inversely related (mean change, -0.07; 95% confidence interval, -0.13 to -0.02 per 1% increase in admission rate); however, lower admission rates were not associated with increased revisits leading to admission (mean change, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.03). Over the study period, admission rates were stable (test for linear trend: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95–1.02); however, among infants aged < 2 months, admissions decreased (aOR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88–0.97).

Conclusions

A substantial variation in admission rates exists for children with UTI. Although hospitals with lower admission rates had higher revisit rates, those hospitals did not have an increase in revisits with subsequent admission, supporting the goal of outpatient management.

### Parenteral antibiotic therapy duration in young infants with bacteremic urinary tract infections [^114vn1cU]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the association between parenteral antibiotic duration and outcomes in infants ≤ 60 days old with bacteremic urinary tract infection (UTI).

Methods

This multicenter retrospective cohort study included infants ≤ 60 days old who had concomitant growth of a pathogen in blood and urine cultures at 11 children's hospitals between 2011 and 2016. Short-course parenteral antibiotic duration was defined as ≤ 7 days, and long-course parenteral antibiotic duration was defined as > 7 days. Propensity scores, calculated using patient characteristics, were used to determine the likelihood of receiving long-course parenteral antibiotics. We conducted inverse probability weighting to achieve covariate balance and applied marginal structural models to the weighted population to examine the association between parenteral antibiotic duration and outcomes (30-day UTI recurrence, 30-day all-cause reutilization, and length of stay).

Results

Among 115 infants with bacteremic UTI, 58 (50%) infants received short-course parenteral antibiotics. Infants who received long-course parenteral antibiotics were more likely to be ill appearing and have growth of a non- Escherichia coli organism. There was no difference in adjusted 30-day UTI recurrence between the long- and short-course groups (adjusted risk difference: 3%; 95% confidence interval: -5.8 to 12.7) or 30-day all-cause reutilization (risk difference: 3%; 95% confidence interval: -14.5 to 20.6).

Conclusions

Young infants with bacteremic UTI who received ≤ 7 days of parenteral antibiotics did not have more frequent recurrent UTIs or hospital reutilization compared with infants who received long-course therapy. Short-course parenteral therapy with early conversion to oral antibiotics may be considered in this population.

AAP urinary tract infection guideline — febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age: Action Statement 1 states that if a clinician decides that a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever requires antimicrobial therapy to be administered because of ill appearance or another pressing reason, the clinician should ensure that a urine specimen is obtained for both culture and urinalysis before an antimicrobial is administered; the specimen needs to be obtained through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration (SPA), because the diagnosis of UTI cannot be established reliably through culture of urine collected in a bag (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation).

### Treatment of urinary tract infections among febrile young children with daily intravenous antibiotic therapy at a day treatment center [^116ZaXDf]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common among infants and toddlers. Children can be treated effectively with short courses (2–4 days) of intravenous (IV) therapy followed by oral therapy. If IV therapy is chosen, use of once-daily dosing may allow outpatient management instead of hospital admission. However, no description of ambulatory treatment with IV antibiotics of UTI among febrile children has been reported to date. We aimed to describe the feasibility and complications of outpatient management with IV antibiotics of UTI among febrile children, at the day treatment center (DTC) of a tertiary-care pediatric hospital.

Methods

Between April 1, 2002, and March 31, 2003, a prospective cohort of patients 3 months to 5 years of age who were examined in the emergency department (ED) and diagnosed as having presumed febrile UTI were treated according to a clinical protocol. Patients were treated at the DTC unless they met exclusion criteria, in which case they were hospitalized. The DTC was open 7 days per week, including holidays, from 8:30 am to 4:30 pm. At the DTC, patients were initially treated with a daily dose of IV gentamicin, until the child had been afebrile for at least 24 hours, and with oral amoxicillin, until preliminary urine culture results were available. Children allergic to penicillin received gentamicin only. IV antibiotics were administered through peripheral IV access; the IV catheter's patency was maintained with injection of 50 U of heparin once daily throughout the treatment period. Parental satisfaction with the DTC experience was assessed with an anonymous, self-administered questionnaire.

Results

Two hundred ninety-one episodes of presumed febrile UTI were diagnosed in the ED, of which 212 (72.9%) were sent to the DTC. There were 71 hospital admissions (24.4%); in 9 of these instances, the child was admitted because parents refused or were unable to comply with DTC treatment. Adherence to the treatment protocol in the ED was excellent; in 92.1% of presumed febrile UTI episodes (268 of 291 episodes), the patient was referred to the appropriate setting for treatment. In 8 instances, patients who met an exclusion criterion were sent to the DTC. They should have been hospitalized, according to the protocol. At the DTC, a final diagnosis of UTI was made in 178 of the 212 episodes (84%). Patients treated at the DTC, with a final diagnosis of UTI, had a median age of 12.0 months (range: 3–68 months), and their mean initial temperature was 39.2 degrees C (SD: 1.1 degrees C). Patients were afebrile by 24 hours in 52% of UTI episodes and by 48 hours in 82%. Minor problems with IV access occurred in 9.0% of cases. The duration of IV antibiotic therapy at the DTC was 1.9 days (SD: 0.9 day). The mean number of visits to the DTC, including appointments for renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography evaluations, was 3.5 (SD: 0.9). Parents were present at all scheduled visits in 98.9% of cases. Four patients needed to be hospitalized from the DTC, but in only 1 case was hospital admission related to UTI treatment. Four patients with UTI treated in the DTC had positive blood cultures, 2 with Escherichia coli (both successfully treated at the DTC) and 2 with contaminants. For 4 children treated at the DTC, UTI was caused by gentamicin-resistant E coli. One patient became afebrile within 24 hours after treatment initiation with IV gentamicin; he was then treated with oral cefixime. A second patient was treated with IV ceftriaxone, administered at the DTC once culture results were available, and remained febrile for < 72 hours. The last 2 patients were hospitalized; one, who was also allergic to cephalosporins, had been febrile for 72 hours at the time of hospitalization (once hospitalized, he was treated with IV amikacin), and the other was admitted to the hospital for an unrelated problem, namely, scalp cellulitis. None of these 4 patients was initially bacteremic or became bacteremic during the treatment period. Repeat urine culture was performed within 14 days after treatment initiation in 146 instances, and results were negative in all cases. At telephone follow-up assessments 14 days after discharge, no patient had been rehospitalized because of UTI. Successful treatment at the DTC (defined as attendance at all visits, normalization of temperature within 96 hours, negative control urine cultures, if performed, and absence of hospitalization from the DTC) was observed in 96.6% of the 178 UTI episodes. Overall adherence of physicians to the protocol at the DTC was 87.1% (95% confidence interval: 82.2–92.0%). One hundred seventy-two satisfaction questionnaires were returned and revealed good, very good, or excellent parental satisfaction in 98.8% of cases.

Conclusions

Our data show that ambulatory treatment with IV antibiotics, at a DTC, may be used for at least three-fourths of UTIs among febrile children 3 months to 5 years of age. It is safe and feasible and appears very satisfactory to parents. Although ambulatory treatment with IV antibiotics is more invasive than oral therapy during the initiation of UTI treatment, it ensures almost full compliance, allows close medical supervision, and facilitates investigations related to the UTI. It is an interesting alternative to hospitalization.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^114Kdwzx]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Future research should include standardized definitions of children with cUTI. Treatment duration and benefits of prophylaxis should be assessed separately for each subgroup, with outcomes not only considering treatment failure but also other factors including antibiotic resistance, side effects and home management in a more holistic way. Furthermore, studies should focus on evaluating the long-term outcomes of children treated according to these guidelines to further validate and refine these recommendations.

### Efficacy of short-term intravenous antibiotic in neonates with urinary tract infection [^111bqaY5]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies have questioned the use of prolonged intravenous treatment in neonates with urinary tract infection (UTI). The aim of the present study was to examine the clinical course of neonates with UTI with special attention paid to the rates of bacteremia and meningitis and to determine the efficacy of short-term intravenous antibiotic.

Methods

Retrospective review of clinical charts of neonates admitted for UTI. Patients were treated first intravenously with a beta-lactam antibiotic and gentamicin. Treatment was completed orally.

Results

One hundred seventy-two neonates (median age, 19 days) were included. Of 129 blood cultures carried out, 16 (12.4%) were positive. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid was performed in 75 patients; none of the cultures was positive. Forty-nine patients (28.5%) were treated with ampicillin and gentamicin and 105 (61%) with amoxicillin-clavulanate and gentamicin. The median length of intravenous treatment was 4 days (P25: 3; P75: 6). Oral amoxicillin-clavulanate was used in the continuation phase in 75%. No treatment failure or relapse was detected. Eleven (8.7%) of 126 patients had renal scarring at 6 months.

Conclusions

The clinical course in neonates with UTI treated with short-term intravenous antibiotic followed by oral treatment is highly favorable, both in short and long terms. The absence of meningitis and the good evolution of the associated bacteremias argue in favor of a review of the habitual diagnostic-therapeutic protocol in neonates.

### Safety and efficacy of ceftolozane / tazobactam versus meropenem in neonates and children with complicated urinary tract infection, including pyelonephritis: a phase 2, randomized clinical trial [^1112voGd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Randomized participants were stratified and dosed by age group. The selected doses were based on population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations. For participants in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group, those 12 to < 18 years of age were given 1.0 g ceftolozane and 0.5 g tazobactam (the dose indicated for adult patients with cUTI), and those from birth to < 12 years of age were given 20 mg/kg ceftolozane and 10 mg/kg tazobactam (maximum of 1.0 g ceftolozane and 0.5 g tazobactam per dose). All participants in the meropenem group received 20 mg/kg (maximum of 1.0 g per dose), with higher dosing up to 30 mg/kg for participants who were 14 days to < 3 months of age permitted at the investigator's discretion. Each dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam or meropenem was administered as a 60-minute (± 10 minutes) infusion and dosed every 8 hours (± 1 hour) after the previous infusion.

Treatment duration was 7–14 days. After 3 days (9 doses) of IV therapy, optional open-label, standard-of-care, oral step-down therapy was permitted at the investigator's discretion, with choice of therapy guided by culture and antibacterial susceptibility results, as well as local standard of care for treatment of cUTI. Recommended options for oral step-down therapy were β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim‚ or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

Specimen Collection

A baseline urine sample for culture was obtained ≤ 48 hours before the start of administration of the first dose of study treatment. Urine specimens were obtained by suprapubic aspiration, clean urethral catheterization, indwelling urethral catheter‚ or midstream clean catch. Additional details of specimen collection and culture of urine specimens are included in Methods, Supplemental Digital Content 1.

### Contemporary management of urinary tract infection in children [^116doJUG]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children, and girls are at a significantly higher risk, as compared to boys, except in early infancy. Most cases are caused by Escherichia coli Collection of an uncontaminated urine specimen is essential for accurate diagnosis. Oral antibiotic therapy for 7 to 10 days is adequate for uncomplicated cases that respond well to the treatment. A renal ultrasound examination is advised in all young children with first febrile UTI and in older children with recurrent UTI. Most children with first febrile UTI do not need a voiding cystourethrogram; it may be considered after the first UTI in children with abnormal renal and bladder ultrasound examination or a UTI caused by atypical pathogen, complex clinical course, or known renal scarring. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is used selectively in high-risk patients. Few patients diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux after a UTI need surgical correction. The most consequential long-term complication of acute pyelonephritis is renal scarring, which may increase the risk of hypertension or chronic kidney disease later in life. Treatment of acute pyelonephritis with an appropriate antibiotic within 48 hours of fever onset and prevention of recurrent UTI lowers the risk of renal scarring. Pathogens causing UTI are increasingly becoming resistant to commonly used antibiotics, and their indiscriminate use in doubtful cases of UTI must be discouraged.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^113fPgyt]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in infancy — An important cause of bacteriuria without pyuria is asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can occur in infants. In a study of infants 2 to 24 months of age, 0.7% of afebrile girls had 3 successive urine cultures with 105 CFUs per mL of a single uropathogen; this condition can be confused with true UTI but should be distinguished because studies suggest antimicrobial treatment may do more harm than good, and the key discriminator is the presence of pyuria.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^1141U6vd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Common uropathogens in children with significant urologic abnormalities, including postsurgery and instrumentation, are Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus.– To cover these, if IV antibiotics are needed, an aminoglycoside or broad-spectrum cephalosporin is recommended, with a child's individual history guiding whether to cover rarer S. aureus or more indolent Enterococcus spp. empirically. Where multiple antibiotics have previously been used, assessment of the likelihood of resistance is part of management (see below).

Multiple recurrent UTIs, defined by 2 or more UTIs caused by different organisms, are a risk for resistant and MDR bacteria. Although recurrent UTIs might occur without anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, other risk factors include VUR, underlying neurological conditions, prolonged hospitalization and UTI prophylaxis, and girls are at higher risk than boys. If on prophylaxis, a different treatment antibiotic is required due to breakthrough. For children at high risk of resistance, including suspected ESBL-E, empiric oral options include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones and fosfomycin. Empirical IV options for children at moderate risk of resistance but who have never cultured ESBL-E include gentamicin and quinolones. If there has been previous ESBL-E or clinical risk is higher, IV amikacin retains high susceptibility to uropathogens, concentrates well in urine and can avoid broad-spectrum beta-lactam and carbapenem use. Most gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae exhibit cross-resistance to tobramycin but remain susceptible to amikacin, due to reduced inactivation by bacterial enzymes. If cultures grow Klebsiella pneumoniae with high bacterial inoculum, empirical B-lactam antibiotics should be switched to a different class. With a high bacterial inoculum, the stationary phase is rapidly reached, so the effect of targeting penicillin-binding proteins is rapidly diminished, and an alternative is better. In the large majority, carbapenems should be spared since their use is the greatest risk for developing carbapenem resistance. Even with a history of recurrent UTI with resistant uropathogens, empirical carbapenems are rarely needed in children with cUTI unless a child presents with sepsis (see below). – If the identified uropathogen is MDR, including carbapenem-resistant, options include a carbapenem plus amikacin combination, colistin and newer B-lactam/B-lactamase antibiotics such as ceftazidime-avibactam. Since methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is an uncommon uropathogen, this rarely needs to be covered empirically. P. aeruginosa (susceptible and resistant) is more common in recurrent UTIs, so it should be empirically treated with oral quinolones or IV aminoglycosides.

Assessments and End Points

Clinical and microbiologic assessments were performed at the end of treatment (EOT) visit, scheduled < 24 hours after the last IV dose of therapy or < 48 hours after the last dose of oral step-down therapy (if applicable), the test of cure (TOC) visit, occurring 5–9 days after the last dose of study treatment (IV or oral) and the end of IV therapy (EOIV) visit (< 24 hours after the last of IV therapy).

The primary end points were rates of adverse events (AEs) and changes in laboratory values and vital signs through the last follow-up visit, which occurred 28–35 days after the last dose of study treatment (IV or oral). In all treated participants, AEs were evaluated from the first dose of study treatment to the last study evaluation. Key secondary end points included rates of clinical success and per-participant microbiologic eradication, defined as the proportion of participants who had a clinical response of cure and proportion of participants who had microbiologic eradication or presumed eradication at the EOT and TOC visits, respectively. Additional exploratory end points included per-pathogen microbiologic eradication, which was determined for each uropathogen isolated from the baseline study-qualifying culture, clinical response at the EOIV visit‚ and composite success, defined as a clinical response of success and per-participant microbiologic response of eradication. See additional details about end points in Methods, Supplemental Digital Content 1.

Statistical Analysis

No formal hypothesis testing was performed. For the primary safety analysis, 95% CIs were derived for the between-treatment differences in the percentage of participants with events, and these analyses were performed using the unstratified Miettinen & Nurminen method. Changes in laboratory and vital sign values from baseline were summarized using descriptive statistics. For the secondary efficacy analyses, 2-sided 95% CIs based on the Miettinen & Nurminen methodand stratified by age group were used to evaluate the treatment differences for clinical success and per-participant microbiologic eradication at the EOT and TOC visits. The sample size calculation is described in Methods, Supplemental Digital Content 1.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^112KpFF9]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children — scope and key definitions: This guideline focuses on the diagnosis and management of initial urinary tract infections (UTIs) in febrile infants and young children (2–24 months of age) who have no obvious neurologic or anatomic abnormalities known to be associated with recurrent UTI or renal damage, and uses the phrase "febrile infants" to indicate febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age. In studies underlying these limits, the prevalence of UTI is high (~5%) in this age group and fever was defined as temperature of at least 38.0°C (≥ 100.4°F), which is the definition adopted here. Neonates and infants less than 2 months of age are excluded, and data are insufficient to determine whether evidence from infants 2 to 24 months applies to children more than 24 months of age.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than carbapenems and newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Other agents (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, first or second-generation cephalosporins) are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of cUTI.

### Scoping review of clinical decision aids in the assessment and management of febrile infants under 90 days of age [^116FpTEj]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The definition of IBI was consistently defined as the growth of a single pathogen in blood or CSF. However, in studies examining SBI, the definition included IBI but also UTI, pneumonia and other infections. This heterogeneity in definitions could impact the performance of CDAs when applied to diverse populations. Therefore, the AAP has recommended focusing on IBI as an outcome due to the heterogeneity associated with SBI. Complications from the delayed treatment of IBI can be catastrophic for febrile infants. Current evidence suggests that infants with UTI and are low risk can be safely managed as outpatients on oral antibiotics. This is supported by the AAP and CA FIRST protocols. The incidence of IBI varied from 1.6% to 5.9% across 28 studies, while that of SBI ranged from 7% to 38.7 (21 studies). The upper limit of these values exceeded the range previously reported in literature. Such variation could be attributed to factors such as epidemiology, regional practices, and patient selection in the studies included in the analysis and highlight the importance of applying and validating the various CDAs in different contexts.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infection in young infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) clinical practice guideline for UTIs focuses on febrile children age 2–24 months, with no guideline for infants < 2 months of age, an age group commonly encountered by pediatric hospitalists. In this review, we assess the applicability of the AAP UTI Guideline's action statements for previously healthy, febrile infants < 2 months of age. We also discuss additional considerations in this age group, including concurrent bacteremia and routine testing for meningitis.

### Weight gain and obesity in infants and young children exposed to prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis [^113nv8N8]. JAMA Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

An association between antibiotic use and excessive weight gain or obesity in healthy infants and young children has been reported, but evidence is inconsistent and based on observational studies of growth in relation to incidental antibiotic exposures.

Objective

To evaluate whether prolonged antibiotic exposure is associated with weight gain in children participating in a clinical trial of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent recurrent urinary tract infection.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Secondary analysis of data from the Randomized Intervention for Children With Vesicoureteral Reflux Study, a 2-year randomized clinical trial that enrolled participants from 2007 to 2011. All 607 children who were randomized to receive antibiotic (n = 302) or placebo (n = 305) were included. Children with urinary tract anomalies, premature birth, or major comorbidities were excluded from participation.

Interventions

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo taken orally, once daily, for 2 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Weight gain as measured by change in weight-for-age z score from baseline to the end-of-study visit at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included weight gain at 6, 12, and 18 months and the prevalence of overweight or obesity at 24 months.

Results

Participants had a median age of 12 months (range, 2–71 months) and 558 of 607 (91.9%) were female. Anthropometric data were complete at the 24-month visit for 428 children (214 in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and 214 in the placebo group). Weight gain in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and the placebo group was similar (mean [SD] change in weight-for-age z score: +0.14 [0.83] and +0.18 [0.85], respectively; difference, -0.04 [95% CI, -0.19 to 0.12]; p = 0.65). There was no significant difference in weight gain at 6, 12, or 18 months or in the prevalence of overweight or obesity at 24 months (24.8% vs 25.7%; p = 0.82). Subgroup analyses showed no significant interaction between weight gain effect and age, sex, history of breastfeeding, prior antibiotic use, adherence to study medication, or development of urinary tract infection during the study.

Conclusions and Relevance

Based on a secondary analysis of data from a large clinical trial of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis, there was no evidence that prolonged exposure to this antibiotic has a concurrent effect on weight gain or the prevalence of overweight or obesity in healthy infants and young children.

### Changes in urinary tract infection hospitalizations post 2011 revised American academy pediatrics guidelines [^11341poz]. Clinical Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple randomized trials over the past 2 decades have supported oral antimicrobial treatment for urinary tract infection (UTI), and the 2011 revised American Academy Pediatrics guidelines on the management of UTI provide further support for outpatient management. It is unknown whether practice patterns have changed as a result of these developments.

Objective

To examine temporal trends in UTI hospitalizations between 1997 and 2012 as measured by the Kids' Inpatient Database.

Design and Methods

The Kid's Inpatient Database was used to analyze trends in UTI hospitalizations between 1997 and 2012. This triennial database is publicly available through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Hospitalization volume for clinical classification software principal diagnosis category 159 Urinary tract infection was examined for trends across years by age. Changes in length of stay and charges corrected for inflation were also examined.

Results

There were significantly fewer weighted UTI hospitalizations in 2012 compared with 1997 to 2009 (48 102 SE ± 1494 in 2009 vs 41 177 SE ± 1467 in 2012, P < .0001). The largest decrease was in 15- to 17-year-old (19.2%) and < 1-year-old (18.6%) groups. The length of stay trended down consistently, but charges have increased despite correcting for consumer price index.

Conclusions

Year 2012 represents the first significant decrease in national hospitalization rates for UTI since 1997, a trend that may be explained by the accumulating evidence supporting outpatient management in addition to recommendations from the 2011 American Academy of Pediatrics UTI guidelines.

### Neonatal group B. streptococcus sepsis after negative screen in a patient taking oral antibiotics [^116P6xrV]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of serious neonatal infection. Neonatal morbidity and mortality can be reduced by appropriate prenatal screening and intrapartum chemoprophylaxis.

Case

A 20-year-old primigravida was treated with oral antibiotics at 35 weeks for a recurrent urinary tract infection. Her GBS screen following the antibiotic treatment showed a negative culture. The patient, therefore, did not receive intravenous antibiotics during her induction of labor for mild preeclampsia. The infant developed early onset neonatal GBS pneumonia and sepsis.

Conclusion

Oral antibiotics can cause a temporary negative culture in a GBS-colonized patient. Relying on a negative culture for management may not be appropriate in a patient treated with oral antibiotics. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the effects of oral antibiotics on GBS.

Discussion

In this large retrospective cohort study of infants younger than 60 days, we examined the association between the duration of IV antibiotic therapy for UTIs and the risk of treatment failure. We observed no association between the receipt of short-course IV therapy (≤ 3 days) and increased odds of readmission for UTIs compared with the receipt of longer courses. There are no available published recommendations on the duration of parenteral treatment for UTI in infants younger than 60 days. Data on parenteral antibiotic use can be gleaned from existing studies and suggest that prolonged parenteral antibiotic courses offer no clear benefit. However, these studies are limited by small numbers, lack of inclusion in some cases of infants younger than 1 month, or lack of focus on clinical outcomes.-

In a recent retrospective chart review of 112 neonates < 28 days old hospitalized for UTI, the median IV antibiotic duration was 49 hours (51% received IV antibiotics for > 48 hours). No demographic features or laboratory values correlated with IV antibiotic duration apart from age < 7 days. The odds of long IV antibiotic duration increased if the neonate had a secondary diagnosis extending hospitalization (adjusted OR [aOR] 3.2, P < .002, 95% CI: 1.2–8.7), subspecialty consult (aOR 4.79, P < .001, 95% CI: 1.87–12.3), or an abnormal renal US (aOR 2.26, P < .02, 95% CI: 1.01–5.08). Only 1 neonate experienced treatment failure.

In a multicenter retrospective study conducted by Desai et al in a similar age group with bacteremic UTIs, infants receiving a short course of parenteral antibiotics did not experience more-frequent UTI recurrence or hospital reutilization than infants receiving a long-course parenteral therapy. However, short-course parenteral antibiotic duration was defined in this study as ≤ 7 days. Another multicenter retrospective study by Schroeder et alof infants ≤ 90 days of age with bacteremic UTIs revealed that infants with recurrent UTI did not receive shorter parenteral antibiotic treatment than infants without recurrent UTI in an unadjusted analysis. Schroeder's findings are similar to those in this study, with infants who received longer courses of parenteral antibiotics more likely to be younger and have a positive blood culture. In 2007, Magín et alreviewed 172 infants (median age of 19 days) with UTIs, finding that early transition to oral antibiotics had no increased rate of treatment failure, relapses, or renal complications.

Urinary tract infections are common occurrences in the pediatric age group and are a cause of significant morbidity and expense. The understanding of the consequences and sequelae of febrile urinary tract infections led to revision of standard protocols initiated by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 1999. A less invasive protocol of radiologic evaluation has been the major outcome of the revised AAP guidelines. Emphasis on prevention of recurrent febrile urinary tract infections has also led to therapeutic programs that are centered less around the use of prophylactic antibiotics than has previously been the practice.

### Prescribing pattern and efficacy of oral antibiotics for pediatric urinary tract infections in Japan: a descriptive study using a nationwide claims database [^117WanaA]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric urinary tract infections are often treated with third-generation cephalosporins; however, the increasing prevalence of Escherichia coli resistant to cephalosporins has reduced their effectiveness. Although resistance is prevalent in Asia, the prescribing patterns and clinical effectiveness of antibiotics have mostly been reported in the United States. This study aimed to describe the prescription patterns and effectiveness of oral antibiotics for treating pediatric urinary tract infections in Japan.

Methods

This descriptive study used data from a nationwide Japanese claims database. We identified patients < 6 years old with urinary tract infections who received oral antibiotics between January 2016 and December 2020. Descriptive analyses were performed to assess prescription patterns. Moreover, logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for treatment failure among the commonly prescribed antibiotics and patient characteristics. Treatment failure was defined as the prescription of different antibiotics within 7 days of the primary prescription.

Results

Of the 4,127 patients, 2,766 (67.0%) were prescribed third-generation cephalosporins, and 347 (8.4%) were prescribed amoxicillin. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and amoxicillin-clavulanate were prescribed to 63 (1.5%) and 50 (1.2%) patients, respectively. Treatment failure was observed in 118 (2.9%) patients and more often in amoxicillin-treated patients than in cefcapene pivoxil-treated patients [OR, 2.18 (95% CI: 1.04–4.58)].

Conclusions

Third-generation cephalosporins are the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for the initial therapy of pediatric urinary tract infections in Japan. Third-generation cephalosporins are still effective in Japan, despite the high prevalence of resistance against cephalosporins.

### Management and outcomes in children with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant urinary tract infections [^112aFDoN]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Third-generation cephalosporin-resistant urinary tract infections (UTIs) often have limited oral antibiotic options with some children receiving prolonged parenteral courses. Our objectives were to determine predictors of long parenteral therapy and the association between parenteral therapy duration and UTI relapse in children with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant UTIs.

Methods

We conducted a multisite retrospective cohort study of children < 18 years presenting to acute care at 5 children's hospitals and a large managed care organization from 2012 to 2017 with a third-generation cephalosporin-resistant UTI from Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp. Long parenteral therapy was ≥ 3 days and short/no parenteral therapy was 0–2 days of concordant parenteral antibiotics. Discordant therapy was antibiotics to which the pathogen was non-susceptible. Relapse was a UTI from the same organism within 30 days.

Results

Of the 482 children included, 81% were female and the median age was 3.3 years (interquartile range: 0.8–8). Fifty-four children (11.2%) received long parenteral therapy (median duration: 7 days). Predictors of long parenteral therapy included age < 2 months (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 67.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.4–275.7), limited oral antibiotic options (aOR 5.9; 95% CI: 2.8–12.3), and genitourinary abnormalities (aOR 5.4; 95% CI: 1.8–15.9). UTI relapse occurred in 1 of the 54 (1.9%) children treated with long parenteral therapy and in 6 of the 428 (1.5%) children treated with short/no parenteral therapy (P = 0.57). Of the 105 children treated exclusively with discordant antibiotics, 3 (2.9%, 95% CI: 0.6%-8.1%) experienced UTI relapse.

Conclusions

Long parenteral therapy was associated with age < 2 months, limited oral antibiotic options, and genitourinary abnormalities. UTI relapse was rare and not associated with duration of parenteral therapy. For UTIs with limited oral options, further research is needed on the effectiveness of continued discordant therapy.

Ciprofloxacin administered intravenously and/or orally was compared to a cephalosporin for treatment of cUTI and pyelonephritis in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age (mean age of 6 ± 4 years). The trial was conducted in the U.S. Canada, Argentina, Peru, Costa Rica, Mexico, South Africa, and Germany. The duration of therapy was 10 to 21 days (mean duration of treatment was 11 days with a range of 1 to 88 days). The primary objective of the study was to assess musculoskeletal and neurological safety.

Patients were evaluated for clinical success and bacteriological eradication of the baseline organism(s) with no new infection or superinfection at 5 to 9 days post-therapy (Test of Cure or TOC). The Per Protocol population had a causative organism(s) with protocol specified colony count(s) at baseline, no protocol violation, and no premature discontinuation or loss to follow-up (among other criteria).

The clinical success and bacteriologic eradication rates in the Per Protocol population were similar between ciprofloxacin and the comparator group as shown below.

### Emergence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing pathogens in community-acquired urinary tract infections among infants at a pediatric emergency department [^11114JQW]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens are common among adults and are associated with extended and multiple hospitalizations. They cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) among children with known risk factors such as urinary tract abnormalities and antimicrobial prophylaxis. The emergence of UTIs caused by ESBL-producing organisms among infants has not been well characterized.

Objective

We sought to describe the incidence and current clinical management of infants who were diagnosed with UTIs caused by ESBL-producing organisms at a pediatric emergency department (ED). In addition, we sought to describe risk factors associated with inpatient hospitalization for UTIs caused by ESBL-producing organisms.

Methods

We retrospectively identified infants who were treated in the ED from 2013 to 2017 and who had positive urinalyses and urine cultures positive for greater than 50,000 colony-forming unit per milliliter of a single ESBL-producing urinary pathogen. We abstracted details of clinical management and known previous risk factors, including prior neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization stay, prior UTI caused by an ESBL-producing organism, and known urologic abnormalities.

Results

Forty-five UTIs caused by ESBL-producing organisms occurred in 43 patients (mean age of 5.9 months and 59% female)-ESBL Escherichia coli represented the majority (42/45). The incidence of UTIs caused by ESBL-producing organisms ranged from 0.9% to 4.5% during the 5-year study period. The 13 patients (26%) admitted from the ED were significantly younger than discharged patients (1.9 vs 6.7 months, P = 0.016) and more likely to have had prior neonatal intensive care unit hospitalizations (50% vs 15.6%, P = 0.0456). Of the 33 visits (77%) resulting in initial outpatient management, 5 were followed by readmission for parenteral antibiotic treatment. Of those who were readmitted, 40% (n = 2) were afebrile at the time of admission. The remainder (28/33) completed outpatient oral antibiotic courses guided by susceptibilities. Two patients (4%) had negative repeat urine cultures despite in vitro resistance to initial antibiotic coverage.

Conclusions

Extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing organisms are an increasing cause of UTIs in infants presenting at a pediatric ED, and outpatient management may be reasonable for infants older than 2 months.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^112GhmDv]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Following multivariate adjustment, there was no significant association between specific treatment group and treatment failure, with an odds ratio (OR) for long- versus short-course treatment of 0.42 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.11–1.63). Additionally, prematurity, positive blood cultures, and the presence of comorbidities were also not predictive of treatment failure. However, the odds of treatment failure increased if the patient had documented fever on admission (OR 3.37, 95% CI: 1.05–10.86), UTI history (OR 6.87, 95% CI: 1.71–27.15), and length of stay more than 15 days (OR 6.56, 95% CI: 1.65–26.09) (Table 2).

### Bacterial susceptibility to oral antibiotics in community acquired urinary tract infection [^114SR7FY]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The most common oral antibiotics used in the treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI) are sulphonamides and cephalosporins, but emerging resistance is not unusual.

Aims

To assess the change in susceptibility of urinary pathogens to oral antibiotics during the past decade in children with community acquired UTI.

Methods

The study sample included two groups of children with a first community acquired UTI: 142 children enrolled in 1991 and 124 enrolled in 1999. UTI was diagnosed by properly collected urine specimen (suprapubic aspiration, transurethral catheterisation, or midstream specimen in circumcised males) in symptomatic patients. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was compared between the two groups.

Results

The pathogens recovered in the two groups were similar: in 1991 — E coli 86%, Klebsiella 6%, others 8%; in 1999 — E coli 82%, Klebsiella 13%, and others 5%. A slight but generalised decrease in bacterial susceptibility to common antibiotics in the two groups was shown: ampicillin 35% versus 30%; cephalexin 82% versus 63% (p < 0.001); nitrofurantoin 93% versus 92%. The only exception was co-trimoxazole, 60% versus 69%. Overall resistance to antibiotics in 1999 was as follows: ampicillin 70%, cephalexin 37%, co-trimoxazole 31%, amoxicillin-clavulanate 24%, nitrofurantoin 8%, cefuroxime-axetil 5%, nalidixic acid 3%.

Conclusions

This study shows a slight but generalised decrease in bacterial susceptibility to common oral antibiotics in the past decade in our population. Empirical initial treatment with co-trimoxazole or cephalexin is inadequate in approximately one third of UTI cases. A larger number of pathogens may be empirically treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate (24% resistance); 95% of organisms are susceptible to cefuroxime-axetil.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^111ndpQQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. By the age of seven years, 8.4% of girls and 1.7% of boys will have suffered at least one episode. Symptoms are systemic rather than localised in early childhood and consist of fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by E. coli in over 80% of cases and treatment consists of a course of antibiotics. Due to the unpleasant acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence. However these medications may cause side effects and promote the development of resistant bacteria.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and side effects of long-term antibiotics given to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Search Strategy

A search of MEDLINE (1966 to Jan 2001), EMBASE (1988 to Jan 2001) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for relevant randomised controlled trials without language restriction; reference lists of review articles; contact with content experts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of two or more antibiotics and placebo with one or more antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed and extracted information. For each trial, information was collected on the methods of the trial, participants, interventions and outcomes. A random-effects model was used to estimate a summary relative risk (RR) and a summary risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI. Heterogeneity tests and subgroup analyses were carried out based on a priori hypothesis of plausible effect modification.

Main Results

There were three trials (n = 151) comparing antibiotics with placebo/no treatment. The duration of antibiotic prophylaxis treatment varied among the studies (10 weeks to 12 months). The method of allocation concealment in the three trials was inadequate, unclear and adequate. The overall rate of recurrent UTI in the placebo/no treatment group was 63% (48/76). Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics reduced the risk of recurrent UTI (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.77; RD -46%, 95% CI -59% to -33%). No side effects were described in any of these three trials. There was one double-blinded trial (n = 120) with unclear allocation concealment that compared two different types of antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI. Nitrofurantoin was more effective than trimethoprim in preventing recurrent UTI over a six month period (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.92; RD -18%, 95% CI -34% to -3%). However, patients receiving nitrofurantoin were more likely to discontinue the antibiotic due to side effects (mainly gastrointestinal) than patients receiving trimethoprim (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.37; RD 22%, 95% CI 8% to 36%).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Most published studies to date have been poorly designed with biases known to overestimate the true treatment effect. Large, properly randomised, double blinded trials are needed to determine the efficacy of long-term antibiotics for the prevention of UTI in susceptible children.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^114VktkE]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) culture methods — dipslide performance and use: Alternative culture methods such as dipslides may have a place in the office setting with sensitivity reported in the range of 87% to 100% and specificity 92% to 98%, but dipslides cannot specify the organism or antimicrobial sensitivities; practices that use dipslides should do so in collaboration with a certified laboratory for identification and sensitivity testing or, in the absence of such results, may need to perform "test of cure" cultures after 24 hours of treatment.

### Treatment of urinary tract infections in children… [^114k4ezo]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Cystitis is characterized by dysuria, urgency, frequency and pain in the lower abdomen. Fever is less common. Oral antibiotics, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate and second-and third-generation cephalosporins, are usually effective. However. E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to amoxicillin and TMP-SMX in some parts of the United States. The optimal duration of therapy is normally seven days, although shorter courses and single-dose regimens have demonstrated moderate but variable success. More than 60 percent of young febrile patients with UTI have evidence of pyelonephritis. Febrile infants with UTI who are younger than one year of age generally require hospitalization and initial treatment with intravenous antibiotics until afebrile, followed by oral therapy for 10 to 14 days. Appropriate intravenous agents include cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, ampicillin-sulbactam and gentamicin.

Oral therapy depends on bacterial isolation and sensitivity. Recent studies question the need for long courses of intravenous cefotaxime when a short course of intravenous cefixime followed by oral therapy yields comparable results. The selection of appropriate treatment requires review of local antimicrobial resistance patterns and compliant caretakers who understand the seriousness of the infection, the need for exact antibiotic dosing and the importance of maintaining close contact with the treating physician. Oral antibiotics are sufficient for use in older children who present with high fever, abdominal or flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness if they do not appear to be toxic. Suitable medication choices include cefixime, other extended-spectrum cephalosporins, amoxicillin-clavulanate, TMP-SMX and, occasionally, quinolones.

The authors conclude that treatment of UTI with oral antibiotics is usually effective, even in younger children with pyelonephritis. Cefixime is a useful empiric choice. Children who appear toxic or who cannot tolerate oral medication should be hospitalized for initial intravenous therapy. Radiographic studies can be performed before completion of antibiotic therapy. Caretakers should be educated about the risk of recurrence and advised when to seek medical attention.

### Treating urinary tract infections in young children… [^114wayU1]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Young children with acute urinary tract infections typically are hospitalized for intravenous antibiotic therapy. Effective oral therapy would eliminate the costs, risks and trauma associated with hospitalization. Hoberman and colleagues compared the effectiveness of an oral antibiotic with that of an intravenous antibiotic in treating UTIs in this population. Exclusion criteria included a history of UTI, urinary tract abnormalities, underlying chronic disease or gram-positive cocci in the urine. Patients who met the study criteria were randomized by age and duration of fever to receive cefotaxime intravenously in the hospital or cefixime on an outpatient basis. Hospitalized patients were switched to oral cefixime on day 4 or after they were afebrile for 24 hours, whichever was longer.

Follow-up examination and repeat urine culture were performed in the hospital after 24 hours. Subsequent evaluation was done by telephone after 48 hours and again after 10 days. Escherichia coli was the most common isolate found in the urine cultures. Almost one half of the isolated microorganisms were resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin. Patients found to have bacteremia tended to be younger and to have a longer duration of fever than those without bacteremia. The incidence of reinfection did not differ significantly between groups. All follow-up renal scans were normal in children whose baseline scans were normal. In addition, the cost of inpatient treatment was twice as high as that for outpatient treatment. The authors conclude that oral cefixime is as safe and effective as intravenous cefotaxime in treating UTI in young febrile children. Outpatient management not only reduces health care costs, it is less traumatic for the patient and family.

Oral cefixime is a viable alternative because it is not associated with poor outcomes or long-term sequelae as was once thought to occur with what was perceived to be less aggressive treatment. editor's note: In an accompanying editorial, Fisher applauds the findings of the Hoberman study. She also cautions that cefixime, although appropriate for empiric therapy of UTI, has a spectrum that is too broad once susceptibility studies are available. At that point, patients should be switched to a narrow-spectrum antibiotic. — g. b. h.

### Treatment of UTIs in infants… [^117Th6Fj]. publications.aap.org (2021). Medium credibility.

The pooled adjusted odds ratio for UTI recurrence with a short versus long duration of parenteral antibiotics was 1.
02. A total of 5 studies assessed the risk of recurrence on the basis of the total duration of antibiotics with no significant differences. On the basis of retrospective studies and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation level low evidence, short and long duration of parenteral antibiotics were associated with a similar risk of UTI recurrence in infants < 2 months. Urinary tract infections are a major burden of pediatric disease, being the most common bacterial infections in infants ≤ 2 months of age. 5 Clinicians' main concerns are inadequate treatment with shorter antibiotic duration or a premature switch to PO therapy, which may increase the risk of UTI recurrence.

Over the last decade, in several studies, researchers have targeted these questions. Most studies to date have been retrospective, small, and underpowered to detect small but potentially important changes in clinical outcomes with different durations of antibiotics. 7–13. A total of 11 studies were retrospective observational cohorts, 8, 9, 11–13, 34–39 and 1 was a retrospective case-control study. 40 A positive urine culture result was required to confirm the diagnosis in 10 studies, whereas a positive urinalysis result was required in only 5 studies. A shorter parenteral course was associated with a shorter length of stay. The total duration of antibiotics was compared only in 6 observational studies, and, in 5 studies, researchers provided data on the primary outcome. Infants that received ≤ 10 vs > 10 total days of antibiotics had similar odds of recurrence (pooled OR:
