## Question

86 yo Patient with acute bilateral PE. Elevated Troponin and EKG showing q waves in inferior limb and anterolateral precordial leads. No old EKG available for comparison. Heparin infusion has been started. Patient is hypoxic on RA. On 2L/mnt NC saturating 92%. Should interventional radiology be consulted? What can interventional radiology offer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether interventional radiology should be consulted for an 86-year-old with acute bilateral pulmonary embolism, hypoxia on 2 L/min nasal cannula, elevated troponin, and ECG Q waves, and what interventional radiology can offer in this scenario. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about risk stratification of the PE phenotype. Then, I should verify the prognostic implications of troponin elevation and ECG changes. Next, I will review guideline-directed escalation triggers and the role of systemic thrombolysis versus catheter-based options. After that, I need to check the specific interventional radiology capabilities and their indications. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation tailored to this elderly patient, including monitoring and multidisciplinary coordination, and ensure the plan aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence [^115uSEkd] [^111AdDAo].

> Let me first confirm the risk category. The patient is normotensive, so this is not high-risk PE by hemodynamic criteria; however, the combination of elevated troponin and ECG abnormalities raises concern for intermediate-high risk (submassive) PE, defined by right ventricular dysfunction and/or myocardial injury without sustained hypotension, which carries a meaningful risk of early deterioration and higher mortality compared with low-risk PE [^111Jhqdy] [^111mVPBM].

> Wait, let me verify the prognostic weight of troponin and ECG here. Elevated troponin in PE reflects right ventricular strain and ischemia and correlates with worse short-term outcomes, and ECG changes such as new right bundle branch block, T-wave inversions in V1–V4, S1Q3T3, or Q waves can signal right ventricular strain or infarction; in an older adult, even modest biomarker elevation may portend higher risk of decompensation, so I should not underplay these findings [^1125qe34] [^1139Lg1P].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about immediate thrombolysis. I initially thought "systemic thrombolysis is indicated", but I need to correct that: systemic thrombolysis is indicated for high-risk PE with shock or hypotension, whereas for intermediate-high risk PE without hypotension, routine thrombolysis is not recommended; instead, careful monitoring with readiness to escalate if deterioration occurs is advised, and thrombolysis may be considered selectively if deterioration begins and bleeding risk is acceptable [^115uSEkd] [^113vYhaW] [^111Dkb7b].

> Next, I should review what interventional radiology can offer. Let me consider the spectrum: catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) with low-dose lytics, mechanical thrombectomy (e.g. FlowTriever), and adjuncts such as ECMO for refractory instability; these are generally reserved for massive PE, failed or contraindicated systemic thrombolysis, or selected intermediate-high risk patients with impending hemodynamic collapse, particularly when bleeding risk is high or systemic lysis is undesirable [^111AdDAo] [^111zWskH] [^115aLZmt] [^111Vceww].

> I should double-check the evidence and guideline stance on CDT in submassive PE. The SIR position and ACCP guidance suggest CDT is reasonable in carefully selected intermediate-high risk patients when deterioration is imminent and bleeding risk is high, while acknowledging that routine use in all submassive PE is not supported; observational registries and trials show improvements in RV function and hemodynamics with low-dose CDT, but randomized data remain limited and procedure-related bleeding can occur, so patient selection and center expertise are key [^111AdDAo] [^113QWUJk] [^114Kcj7i] [^111UVvbi].

> Let me think about this specific 86-year-old. Age increases bleeding risk with thrombolysis and may tilt the balance toward catheter-based strategies if deterioration occurs; given the current stability on heparin with modest oxygen needs, the immediate step is not thrombolysis but close monitoring for deterioration, with early PERT activation and IR consultation so that if the patient worsens — developing hypotension, escalating hypoxemia, rising heart rate, worsening RV function, or rising biomarkers — CDT or mechanical thrombectomy can be rapidly pursued without delay [^114bmBSd] [^111AdDAo] [^1145neZ9].

> I will now examine the monitoring and triggers for escalation. Continuous telemetry, frequent vitals, trending troponin and BNP, and repeat echocardiography to assess RV size and function are prudent; any drop in systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg, need for increasing oxygen to maintain saturation, new arrhythmias, or clinical signs of shock should prompt urgent reperfusion therapy, with CDT or thrombectomy favored if systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated or the bleeding risk is high due to age or comorbidity [^114bmBSd] [^111zWskH].

> But wait, what if the ECG Q waves reflect prior infarction rather than acute RV strain? Without an old ECG, I cannot be certain; however, in the context of acute PE with elevated troponin, the safer approach is to treat the acute process as intermediate-high risk PE and avoid anchoring on old MI, while still planning a cardiology evaluation for coronary disease once the acute PE is stabilized, especially if symptoms or biomarkers suggest concurrent ischemia [^112ckbEw].

> Next, I should review adjunctive considerations. If anticoagulation becomes contraindicated due to bleeding, an IVC filter can be considered; in an elderly patient with limited cardiopulmonary reserve, early involvement of critical care and consideration of advanced hemodynamic support, including ECMO if refractory RV failure develops, may be lifesaving while definitive reperfusion is arranged, though this requires institutional capability and PERT coordination [^11137B8M] [^111Vceww] [^1145neZ9].

> Final recommendation: Yes, interventional radiology should be consulted now for an 86-year-old with acute bilateral PE, hypoxia, elevated troponin, and ECG abnormalities, not to perform immediate intervention while stable, but to enable rapid escalation if deterioration occurs; IR can offer CDT with low-dose lytics, mechanical thrombectomy, and ECMO support, which are appropriate rescue options for intermediate-high risk PE when systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated or the patient is too high risk for systemic lysis, aligning with ESC, SIR, and ACCP guidance and contemporary PERT pathways [^114bmBSd] [^111AdDAo] [^111zWskH] [^1145neZ9].

Yes, **consult interventional radiology (IR)** for this 86-year-old with acute bilateral PE, hypoxia, and elevated troponin, as this represents intermediate-high risk PE with right ventricular strain and a significant risk of deterioration [^111AdDAo] [^114cZ7XJ]. IR can provide **catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT)** with low-dose tPA delivered directly to the pulmonary arteries, which reduces clot burden and right ventricular strain while lowering bleeding risk compared to systemic thrombolysis [^112VHkdP] [^111UVvbi]. If CDT is contraindicated or unavailable, IR can perform **mechanical thrombectomy** to rapidly restore pulmonary flow and decompress the right ventricle [^111zWskH] [^116FNFif]. Early IR involvement is essential for timely escalation beyond anticoagulation in this high-risk patient [^114pUEP6].

---

## Indications for interventional radiology consultation

According to the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), **intermediate-high risk PE** is defined by hemodynamic stability with evidence of right ventricular dysfunction (elevated troponin, RV dilation on CT/ECHO) and a substantial risk of deterioration [^111AdDAo] [^1132t65a]. In this setting, **early consultation with IR** is recommended to enable rapid escalation if the patient deteriorates [^113QWUJk] [^114pUEP6].

## Interventional radiology procedures for acute pulmonary embolism

IR offers several **advanced therapies** for acute PE:

| **Procedure** | **Description** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) | Local delivery of low-dose tPA directly into pulmonary arteries | - Intermediate-high risk PE <br/> - Contraindications to systemic thrombolysis <br/> - High bleeding risk [^111AdDAo] [^112VHkdP] |
| Mechanical thrombectomy | Physical removal of clot using aspiration or fragmentation devices | - Massive/high-risk PE <br/> - Contraindications to thrombolysis <br/> - Rapid clot debulking needed [^111zWskH] [^1145aMza] |
| Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement | Prevents embolization of lower-extremity DVT to lungs | - Contraindications to anticoagulation <br/> - Recurrent PE despite anticoagulation [^11137B8M] |

---

## Benefits of interventional radiology procedures

IR procedures offer **several advantages** over systemic thrombolysis:

- **Reduced bleeding risk**: CDT uses lower doses of tPA, reducing major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage compared to systemic thrombolysis [^111UVvbi] [^111AdDAo].

- **Rapid clot removal**: Mechanical thrombectomy provides immediate clot debulking, improving hemodynamics and oxygenation [^111zWskH] [^116FNFif].

- **Improved right ventricular function**: CDT and mechanical thrombectomy reduce RV strain and improve cardiac output [^111UVvbi] [^116FNFif].

---

## Risks and contraindications

While IR procedures are generally safe, **risks include**:

- **Bleeding**: Particularly in elderly patients or those with high bleeding risk [^111UVvbi].

- **Vascular injury**: Rare but possible during catheter manipulation [^notfound].

- **Contrast nephropathy**: Especially in patients with renal impairment [^115xQJ3G].

Contraindications include active bleeding, recent major surgery, severe renal impairment, and severe contrast allergy [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **early IR consultation** for intermediate-high risk PE. The SIR recommends CDT or mechanical thrombectomy for carefully selected patients with massive or submassive PE, particularly when systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated or bleeding risk is high [^1132t65a] [^115aLZmt]. The ESC similarly recommends considering CDT or surgical embolectomy in intermediate-high risk PE patients who deteriorate or have high bleeding risk [^112VHkdP].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Given the patient's age, bilateral PE, hypoxia, and elevated troponin, **early IR consultation is warranted** to assess candidacy for CDT or mechanical thrombectomy. These interventions can rapidly reduce clot burden, improve right ventricular function, and lower the risk of deterioration, with lower bleeding risk than systemic thrombolysis [^111UVvbi] [^116FNFif]. If anticoagulation is contraindicated or fails, IR can also place an IVC filter to prevent recurrent PE [^11137B8M].

The patient returned to the hospital 5 days later with worsening complaints of dyspnea, episodic oxygen desaturation, and a history of a syncopal event 2 days earlier. The patient also described coughing with intermittent hemoptysis. His vital signs were notable for temperature of 97.9 °F (36.6 °C), blood pressure of 87/55 mm Hg, pulse of 65 beats/min, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T level was increased to 51 ng/L (normal 0–14 ng/L), and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide was increased to 2,016 pg/mL (normal adjusted for age and sex < 900 pg/mL). A third follow-up chest CT scan demonstrated similar appearing pulmonary emboli with an evolving pulmonary infarct. The patient was evaluated by the cardiology team for lytic therapy or thrombectomy using the EkoSonic Endovascular System (Boston Scientific), but the decision was made to not perform these interventions because he was out of the therapeutic window.

The patient was admitted to the cardiology floor and was transitioned to intravenous heparin; yet, he continued to suffer from exertional dyspnea with accompanying oxygen desaturation. He was presumed to have a superimposed bacterial or fungal infection, and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics were prescribed. An extensive work-up for microbial respiratory pathogens revealed no positive findings. On the 13th day of admission, the patient developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure with an oxygen saturation of 68% and required urgent intubation. The following day he developed pulseless electrical activity requiring resuscitation. Bedside transthoracic echocardiography showed severe biventricular dysfunction. After a discussion with the patient's family, the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only, and the patient was extubated and died peacefully with family at his bedside.

At autopsy, there was a large 6-cm nodule in the basal portion of the left upper lobe that was found to be a primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma on histology. There was extensive vascular invasion in both lungs, and some of the arteries were completely occluded by a combination of tumor and superimposed thrombus (Figures 2A and 2B), resulting in extensive bilateral parenchymal necrosis and infarction. Examination of the heart revealed severe right ventricular hypertrophy and dilation and acute and healing right ventricular infarction consistent with demand ischemia secondary to the increasing tumor/thrombus burden in the pulmonary circulation.

European Society of Cardiology — management of acute pulmonary embolism: In patients with PE presenting with shock or hypotension, intravenous unfractionated heparin should be administered as the preferred mode of initial anticoagulation, and primary reperfusion treatment, particularly systemic thrombolysis, is the treatment of choice for patients with high-risk PE. If thrombolysis is contraindicated or has failed to improve hemodynamic status, surgical embolectomy is recommended if expertise/resources are available, and percutaneous catheter-directed therapy (CDT) should be considered if on-site expertise/resources are available. For PE without shock or hypotension, treatment escalation is recommended for the intermediate (high)-risk category defined by the presence of RV dysfunction and abnormal cardiac enzyme levels, with RV/LV diameter ratio ≥ 0.9 on CT prompting cardiac troponin testing unless primary reperfusion is not an option. Rescue reperfusion with thrombolysis if clinical signs of hemodynamic decompensation appear, surgical pulmonary embolectomy, or percutaneous CDT may be considered as alternative options to systemic thrombolysis, and surgical pulmonary embolectomy or percutaneous CDT may be considered as alternative rescue procedures when decompensation appears imminent and anticipated bleeding risk under systemic thrombolysis is high.

2 ∣ CASE 1

A 58-year-old man presents to the emergency department with acute onset shortness of breath and mild chest discomfort. His symptoms started 3 hours before. Three weeks ago, he injured his foot and ankle while skiing and has been in a walking boot since that time. He has no history of cancer or cardiopulmonary disease. He denies any loss of consciousness or syncope. His vital signs in the emergency department show a temperature of 37.8 °C, heart rate of 88 beats/min, blood pressure of 136/84 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 18, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Due to an elevated D-dimer level, a PE protocol computed tomography (CT) scan is ordered, showing multiple segmental acute PEs in his right upper and middle lobes without evidence of right ventricular strain. His laboratory tests reveal a normal high-sensitivity troponin T and normal brain natriuretic peptide level. The emergency room providers consider what anticoagulant to initiate and whether the patient may be candidate for outpatient management.

3 ∣ CASE 2

A 38-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain and dyspnea for the past 4 hours. She recently started taking an oral contraceptive pill approximately 4 weeks ago to help with heavy and painful menses. She has a history of obesity (body mass index of 32 kg/m²) and 1 prior pregnancy 4 years ago. Her vital signs in the emergency department are stable (heart rate, 72 beats/min; blood pressure, 118/68 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 23 respirations/min; oxygen saturation, 95% on room air), and her electrocardiogram shows no signs of right ventricular strain. Laboratory tests show a normal high-sensitivity troponin T but an elevated D-dimer level. Renal and liver function test results along with her blood counts are all normal. PE protocol CT scan shows bilateral acute pulmonary emboli in the main and lobar branches associated with a right lower lobe pulmonary infarct. The patient has only mild pain that is not requiring any pain medications currently.

### Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) causing pulmonary emboli during coronary intervention [^114iyLWA]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

Thrombotic complications of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) can be devastating if not recognized and treated promptly. We describe an unusual case of rapid-onset HIT resulting in massive-bilateral pulmonary emboli in a 70 year-old man who developed chest pain during elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The diagnosis was made the following day after persistent chest pain and laboratory work demonstrating a new thrombocytopenia, a mildly elevated troponin, and positive DIC panel led to confirmatory imaging tests. HIT-related thrombosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain in patients undergoing PCI.

### Acute myocardial infarction caused by paradoxical embolism with concomitant pulmonary embolism [^113JvESX]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

An 86-year-old lady presented with an acute inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction. The coronary angiogram showed a thrombotic occlusion of the right coronary artery, which was aspirated, but there was no underlying lesion to stent. The patient remained very hypoxic on the ward with clear lung fields and was found to also have multiple pulmonary emboli on CT pulmonary angiogram. Paradoxical embolism was suspected as the cause of myocardial infarction and subsequent echocardiography studies indeed confirmed the presence of a patent foramen ovale. Although rare, this mechanism should be considered in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes without significant underlying coronary artery disease.

### Interventional therapies for acute pulmonary embolism [^114pUEP6]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the third leading cause of cardiovascular mortality in the United States. Unfortunately, significant gaps exist in outcome data around many interventional therapies, a fact that is reflected in the low strength of management recommendations found in consensus major society guidelines. In addition to careful risk stratification, therapeutic anticoagulation generally should be an early part of PE management in all cases. For patients presenting with acute high-risk PE or intermediate-risk PE with higher risk features, consideration should be given to systemic thrombolysis after careful evaluation for potential bleeding complications. In patients with contraindications to systemic thrombolysis, failure of this therapy, or significant ongoing cardiopulmonary distress, consideration should be given to interventional therapies like catheter-directed lysis, catheter-directed embolectomy, surgical embolectomy, and mechanical circulatory support. Until more robust comparative outcome data are put forward, pulmonary embolism response teams (PERT) should be considered for multi-disciplinary patient evaluation and management.

Acute pulmonary embolism — massive/high-risk definition and initial management positioning — massive or high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) is characterized by sustained systemic arterial hypotension defined by a systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg for at least 15 minutes or requiring inotropic support, with a mortality risk of 25%–65%. There is a current consensus that aggressive clot removal strategies be considered, including systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed therapy (CDT), and/or surgical embolectomy in select patients based on risk/benefit assessment, contraindications, and local expertise.

### 'STEMI-like' acute pulmonary embolism, an unusual presentation [^1123vFTS]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

We present the case of a 65-year-old man with an atypical presentation of pulmonary embolism (PE) as ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with high troponin. He presented with acute exertional dyspnoea without chest pain. Since the initial ECG showed ST elevation anteroseptal (V1-V4) with concomitant deep Q waves, a delayed STEMI with probable left ventricular aneurysm was the working diagnosis and was treated accordingly. Nevertheless, his coronary angiography was normal and it was then that PE was suspected. D-dimer was found to be elevated and CT pulmonary angiography confirmed bilateral PE with a large thrombus within the right main pulmonary artery. The patient made good clinical recovery and his ST elevation resolved with anticoagulation. The source was found to be a deep vein thrombosis in his right leg. The treatment was not compromised by the delayed diagnosis as he received timely anticoagulation as part of STEMI management.

### Massive pulmonary embolism and thrombophilia [^115gnFx3]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old man presented overnight to the accident and emergency unit with mild breathlessness on exertion. He was found to be hypoxic on room air and his chest x-ray revealed areas of patchy lung consolidation. He was given intravenous antibiotics for presumed community-acquired pneumonia. Unfortunately his condition deteriorated and he remained significantly hypoxic despite high-flow oxygen with ECG evidence of right heart strain. Further questioning revealed a history of protein S deficiency and a strong family history of venous thromboembolic disease. An urgent CT pulmonary angiogram showed an evidence of massive pulmonary embolism and the patient was successfully thrombolysed.

### Interventional treatment of pulmonary embolism [^116wA52s]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a serious and prevalent cause of vascular disease. Nevertheless, optimal treatment for many phenotypes of PE remains uncertain. Treating PE requires appropriate risk stratification as a first step. For the highest-risk PE, presenting as shock or arrest, emergent systemic thrombolysis or embolectomy is reasonable, while for low-risk PE, anticoagulation alone is often chosen. Normotensive patients with PE but with indicia of right heart dysfunction (by biomarkers or imaging) constitute an intermediate-risk group for whom there is controversy on therapeutic strategy. Some intermediate-risk patients with PE may require urgent stabilization, and ≈10% will decompensate hemodynamically and suffer high mortality, though identifying these specific patients remains challenging. Systemic thrombolysis is a consideration, but its risks of major and intracranial hemorrhages rival overall harms from intermediate PE. Multiple hybrid pharmacomechanical approaches have been devised to capture the benefits of thrombolysis while reducing its risks, but there is limited aggregate clinical experience with such novel interventional strategies. One method to counteract uncertainty and generate a consensus multidisciplinary prognostic and therapeutic plan is through a Pulmonary Embolism Response Team, which combines expertise from interventional cardiology, interventional radiology, cardiac surgery, cardiac imaging, and critical care. Such a team can help determine which intervention-catheter-directed fibrinolysis, ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis, percutaneous mechanical thrombus fragmentation, or percutaneous or surgical embolectomy-is best suited to a particular patient. This article reviews these various modalities and the background for each.

### A 17-year-old with chest pain [^112hd7qK]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

A 17-year-old male subject with a history of deep venous thrombosis presented with acute unilateral severe chest pain. His examination was nonspecific, and vital signs were normal. His initial laboratory evaluation revealed mild thrombocytopenia, elevated troponin levels, and critically elevated activated partial thromboplastin time. A computed tomography angiogram of the chest revealed a pulmonary embolus, and anticoagulation therapy was initiated. His course was complicated by the development of multiple thrombi and respiratory failure. Extensive evaluation revealed a rare, underlying diagnosis in time for life-saving treatment to be initiated.

American College of Chest Physicians — systemic thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism: In patients with acute PE associated with hypotension (eg, systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg) and without a high bleeding risk, systemically administered thrombolytic therapy is recommended over no such therapy (grade 2B). In most patients with acute PE not associated with hypotension, the American College of Chest Physicians recommends against systemically administered thrombolytic therapy (grade 1B). In selected patients with acute PE whose condition deteriorates after starting anticoagulant therapy but without hypotension and with a low bleeding risk, systemically administered thrombolytic therapy is suggested over no such therapy (grade 2C).

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on catheter-directed therapy for acute pulmonary embolism [^112VHkdP]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Guideline positioning for catheter-directed therapy and systemic thrombolysis — despite limitations of available evidence, CDT is considered an acceptable treatment option for highly selected patients with massive PE. For intermediate-risk presentations, expert bodies use conditional language: the American Heart Association states that "Systemic Fibrinolysis may be considered for patients with submassive acute PE judged to have clinical evidence of adverse prognosis", the European Society of Cardiology states that "Surgical pulmonary embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment may be considered as 'alternative, 'rescue' procedures for patients with intermediate/high-risk PE, in whom hemodynamic decompensation appears imminent and the anticipated bleeding risk under systemic thrombolysis is high", and the American College of Chest Physicians states, "In selected patients with acute PE who deteriorate after starting anticoagulant therapy but have yet to develop hypotension and who have a low bleeding risk, we suggest systemically administered thrombolytic therapy over no such therapy", and "Patients who have a higher risk of bleeding with systemic thrombolytic therapy and who have access to the expertise and resources required to do CDT are likely to benefit from CDT over systemic thrombolytic therapy". Consistent with bleeding risk concerns, "current guidelines have tempered the indication for use of systemic thrombolysis for intermediate-risk PE, suggesting that it be used only when there is cardiac enzyme leak and/or impending hemodynamic collapse", and "CDT cannot be firmly recommended for these patient groups at present", pending further prospective studies.

### Chest pain with raised troponin, ECG changes but normal coronary arteries [^114kXQxH]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 65-year-old woman presented to A&E department, with acute onset central chest pain and dyspnoea. ECG showed dynamic T wave changes while 12 h troponin was elevated. A diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome was made and she underwent an inpatient coronary angiogram. Although her coronary arteries were normal, symptoms persisted and D-dimers were found to be elevated. This led to a CT pulmonary angiogram, which ruled out pulmonary embolism, but uncovered a large ascending aortic aneurysm with a contained leak. She was immediately transferred to regional cardiothoracic unit for urgent surgical intervention. This case report illustrates the importance of a good clinical history, physical examination and timely investigations. It also emphasises that not all chest pain events with elevated troponin level are due to acute coronary syndrome and that alternative diagnoses should still be considered.

### Acute pulmonary embolism: with an emphasis on an interventional approach [^115BB6ph]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Compared with recent advances in treatment of serious cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, the treatment and outcome of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) have remained relatively unchanged over the last few decades. This has prompted several experts to call for the formation of multidisciplinary PE response teams with a more proactive approach to the treatment of PE. In the current document, we discuss the formation of such teams and describe the available treatment options beyond anticoagulation, with a focus on the interventional approach. Acknowledging the paucity of data to support widespread adoption of such techniques, we call for the collection of outcomes data in multicenter registries and support for randomized trials to evaluate interventional treatments in patients with high-risk PE.

### Acute pulmonary embolism: a paradigm shift in interventional treatment and interdisciplinary care? [^114WCCbs]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Catheter-based recanalization procedures have long been standard of care in treating myocardial infarction and stroke. Interventional treatments for pulmonary embolism (PE), however, have only been performed occasionally as second-line strategies until recently. Current guidelines still recommend systemic thrombolysis, which may halve the mortality risk in patients with high-risk pulmonary embolism but is underused outside experienced centers. Novel devices for thrombectomy have significantly changed clinical practice and potentially fill a treatment gap in intermediate and high-risk pulmonary embolism. Observational data are encouraging and randomized controlled trials are underway to prove safety and efficacy, which requires the adaptation of current treatment paradigms. Interdisciplinary pulmonary embolism response teams are needed to provide individualized care, and interventional radiologists are suited to play a pivotal role given their expertise in both diagnostic imaging and invasive procedures. To live up to this challenge, interventional radiologists must familiarize themselves with both the pathophysiology of acute PE as well as with the principles of care provided by other team members. KEY POINTS: Question The recommended treatment of high-risk pulmonary embolism is systemic thrombolysis. New devices for percutaneous aspiration thrombectomy aim to change treatment paradigms and need critical review. Findings Observational data suggests both safety and efficacy of novel thrombectomy devices, randomized controlled trials are underway. The added value of catheter-directed thrombolysis is unclear. Clinical relevance Systemic thrombolysis reduces mortality in patients with high-risk pulmonary embolism but is disproportionately rarely used outside of experienced centers. Percutaneous large-bore pulmonary thrombectomy holds great potential for filling a treatment gap in intermediate and high-risk pulmonary embolism and changing guidelines.

### Pulmonary embolism: care standards in 2018 [^113cidmW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

Patients with pulmonary embolism who are in hemodynamically unstable condition present a special challenge to the interventionalist. When treating such patients, extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) can help to stabilize these patients' condition; however, specific criteria for its use do not exist. Two patients are presented here to familiarize the reader with the use of ECMO and to demonstrate its utility for the interventional radiologist.

An 89-year-old woman came with symptoms of progressively worsening dyspnoea at rest over the preceding week. She was normotensive, had elevated jugular venous pressure and clear lungs. ECG revealed atrial fibrillation with the rapid ventricular rate. Labs were significant for markedly elevated pro-brain natriuretic peptide of 43,000 pg/mL and troponin-T of 1 ng/mL. An urgent 2D echocardiogram was obtained, which revealed the severely dilated right atrium and a large linear mobile mass in the right atrium consistent with a thrombus. An emergent CT scan revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli. She received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. Repeat echocardiogram performed 6 h later showed no evidence of the right atrial thrombus. She was subsequently maintained on intravenous heparin and transitioned to Coumadin. Early recognition of this rare but potentially fatal complication is important as prompt treatment measures can help in preventing life-threatening complications of the right atrial thrombus.

### Mechanical thrombectomy for pulmonary embolism in patients with patent foramen ovale [^116YNK3J]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Nine patients, five male and four female, had acute PE with concurrent PFO identified on echocardiographic evaluation, and underwent MT. These patients were all on anticoagulation without evidence of improvement and were deteriorating clinically.

The mean age of patients was 67.4 ± 18.6 years. Two patients had prior history of PE and were on anticoagulation. All except one inpatient case first presented to the emergency medicine department. The inpatient had already undergone coronary angiogram on day 1 of admission, after presenting with an altered mental status, chest pain, EKG changes, elevated troponins and concern for myocardial infarction. Her mental status unfortunately continued to deteriorate, and she was deemed a poor surgical and thrombolysis candidate for a newly diagnosed high-risk PE. PE was provoked in 5 patients. Clinical presentation of the patients is listed in Table 1.

Table 1
Patient clinical presentations prior to mechanical thrombectomy

AMS altered mental status, PE pulmonary embolism

Of these 9 patients, 3 had high-risk PE and the rest had intermediate-high-risk PE. All patients had elevated troponin level, mean and standard deviation of 0.4 ± 0.7 ng/ml. All patients had right heart strain on preprocedural bedside echocardiography. The right-to-left ventricle ratio on CTA was increased in 8 patients, with mean right to left ventricle (RV/LV) ratio of 1.5 ± 0.3. CTA showed bilateral PE in all patients, with a saddle PE in one patient. Eight patients had confirmed deep venous thrombosis (DVT), while one patient's status was unknown. All patients with lower extremity DVT had an IVC filter placed at the end of the MT procedure.

### Massive pulmonary embolus with hemodynamic compromise: therapeutic options [^116nmcYj]. Emergency Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Recent advances in pharmacotherapeutics and interventional techniques have resulted in resurgence in interest regarding the optimal means of management of hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolic disease. However, these various techniques have many associated disadvantages, and it is of paramount importance that the responsible physician has a detailed understanding of each of these so that the appropriate intervention be requested and performed. By way of background discussion and relevant cases in point, we consider each of these management options in turn, with particular reference to the advantages, disadvantages, and application of each.

### Pulmonary embolism severity assessment and prognostication [^114cZ7XJ]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

For patients who have acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE), risk of short-term death and adverse outcomes should drive the initial treatment decisions. Practice guidelines recommend that patients who have a high-risk of PE-related death and adverse outcomes, determined by the presence of haemodynamic instability (i.e., shock or hypotension), should receive systemically administered thrombolytic therapy. Intermediate-high risk patients might benefit from close observation, and some should undergo escalation of therapy beyond standard anticoagulation, particularly if haemodynamic deterioration occurs. Low-risk for adverse outcomes should lead to early hospital discharge or full treatment at home. Validated prognostic tools (i.e., clinical prognostic scoring systems, imaging studies, and cardiac laboratory biomarkers) assist with risk classification of patients who have acute symptomatic PE.

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on catheter-directed therapy for acute pulmonary embolism [^111zWskH]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association — catheter embolectomy and fragmentation for acute pulmonary embolism: Depending on local expertise, catheter embolectomy and fragmentation or surgical embolectomy is reasonable for patients with massive PE and contraindications to fibrinolysis (class IIa; level of evidence C), and is reasonable for those who remain in unstable condition after receiving fibrinolysis (class IIa; level of evidence C). For massive PE patients who cannot receive fibrinolysis or remain unstable after fibrinolysis, it is reasonable to consider transfer to an institution experienced in catheter embolectomy or surgical embolectomy if these procedures are not available locally and safe transfer can be achieved (class IIa; level of evidence C). Catheter embolectomy or surgical embolectomy may be considered for submassive acute PE with clinical evidence of adverse prognosis (class IIb; level of evidence C). Catheter embolectomy and surgical thrombectomy are not recommended for low-risk PE or for submassive acute PE with minor RV dysfunction, minor myocardial necrosis, and no clinical worsening (class III; level of evidence C).

Non-thrombotic PE does not represent a distinct clinical syndrome. It may be due to a variety of embolic materials and result in a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, making the diagnosis difficult. With the exception of severe air and fat embolism, the haemodynamic consequences of non-thrombotic emboli are usually mild. Treatment is mostly supportive but may differ according to the type of embolic material and clinical severity.

### A case of simultaneous pulmonary embolism and acute myocardial infarction secondary to a previously undiagnosed patent foramen ovale [^112Lx6vk]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

We describe a 79-year-old male with recurrent high-grade liposarcoma who developed postoperative chest pain, dyspnea, and hypoxia suspicious for acute pulmonary embolism (PE). However, electrocardiogram (ECG) was suggestive of an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI). Heparin was initiated and emergent coronary angiography was performed, which demonstrated a "cutoff sign" in the distal left anterior descending artery (LAD) consistent with coronary embolism. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) and bilateral pulmonary emboli were subsequently identified. It was concluded that the patient had suffered an acute PE, with a portion of clot traversing the PFO and entering the LAD, resulting in a simultaneous acute ST-elevation MI. While the case described is rare, the underlying anatomical variant is common and may have practical significance. We discuss the literature regarding PFO with acute PE and paradoxical emboli.

### Changing biventricular mechanics during thrombectomy for intermediate high-risk pulmonary embolism [^116FNFif]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

A 49-year-old female with recent intracranial bleeding was admitted after an unwitnessed syncope. On hospital admission, oxygen saturation was 97% on room air, heart rate was ≥ 100 beats/min, and blood pressure was 121/52 mmHg. Pulmonary embolism (PE) was confirmed by computed tomography, affecting bilateral central and subsegmental branches (Panel C). Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a dilated right ventricle (RV) with flattened interventricular septum (see Supplementary material online, Video S1). Troponin-T level was 133 ng/L (reference: < 14 ng/L). Despite heparin therapy, blood pressure decreased upon minor mobilization. Endovascular thrombectomy was performed using the 24Fr Flowtriever (Inari Medical, Basel, Switzerland) with concomitant invasive biventricular pressure–volume (PV) loop monitoring to appraise immediate changes in cardiomechanics. Heart rate immediately fell from 105 to 85 beats/min. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure dropped from 42 to 19 mmHg. A prompt left-shift of the RV PV loop indicated direct RV unloading (Panel A). Biventricular PV area (PVA) decreased with higher stroke work/PVA ratio, suggesting improved cardiomechanics leading to enhanced myocardial metabolic demand (Panels A, B, and D, Supplementary material online, Table S1). Arterial elastance (E a) decreased for both ventricles. Right ventricle PV loop morphology transformed from notched to quadratic throughout thrombectomy (Panel A). Ventricular–vascular coupling (E es / E a ratio) improved for both ventricles in the presence of stable load-independent contractility (the end-systolic elastance, E es). The patient could mobilize within hours after thrombectomy and was discharged home the next day. These observations underscore the immediate favourable effects of restored pulmonary flow on biventricular cardiomechanics in the setting of intermediate high-risk PE. The patient provided informed consent for publication.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^113GPby9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

While the new assays can provide more accurate, rapid detection of myocardial necrosis, they do not indicate the cause of cell death. Improved assay performance will have to be accompanied by improved clinical evaluation of patients to effectively interpret the results and apply them in clinical practice. The universal definition of MI(Table 3) was a broad consensus developed by representatives from the American College of Cardiology Foundation, European Society of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and World Heart Federation that provided increased structure and clarity around the diagnosis of MI in the era of a troponin gold standard. Importantly, it firmly established the importance of clinical symptoms in conjunction with elevated troponin levels occurring with a characteristic rise and/or fall to establish type 1 MI. It also allowed for diagnosis in the setting of sudden cardiac death, as well as enhanced categorization for periprocedural MIs. As sensitivity and precision of troponin assays have improved, false‐positive results due to assay imprecision are becoming less of a problem. However, the pressure on clinical perspective in interpretation of positive troponin results has increased, given that there is a large differential diagnosis generated by a positive troponin assay (Figure).

### Bilateral pulmonary embolism with right heart strain in a patient with immune thrombocytopenia – A case report and review of the literature [^114ViDEp]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Patients with immune thrombocytopenia are at risk of both bleeding complications and venous thromboembolism. There is no standard to treating life-threatening pulmonary embolism in this population. This case illustrates the difficulty of treating significant thromboembolism in pediatric patients who have reduced clotting capacity.

Case

This case focuses on a 16-year-old pediatric patient with a history of immune thrombocytopenia presenting with mild chest discomfort and dyspnea on exertion. The d-dimer was mildly elevated, and the subsequent computed tomography angiogram revealed bilateral pulmonary embolisms with right ventricular strain.

Conclusions

The patient underwent thromboembolectomy by interventional radiology with subsequent administration of intravenous immunoglobulin, high-dose steroids, and enoxaparin therapy. There is no standard of care for patients with life-threatening pulmonary embolism in this population. Several authors suggest medical therapy options, but do not include patients with potential hemodynamic instability.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111A6oSs]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

PE without hypotension — Consistent with AT9, we recommend that most patients with acute PE who do not have hypotension are not treated with thrombolytic therapy. At the mild end of the spectrum are those who have minimal symptoms and minimal cardiopulmonary impairment, and many of these patients can be treated entirely at home or can be discharged after a brief admission. At the severe end of the spectrum are those with severe symptoms and more marked cardiopulmonary impairment (even though systolic BP is > 90 mm Hg). In addition to clinical features of cardiopulmonary impairment, they may have evidence of right ventricular dysfunction on their CT pulmonary angiogram or an echocardiograph, or evidence of myocardial damage as reflected by increases in cardiac biomarkers (eg, troponins, brain natriuretic peptide).

An asymptomatic 26-year-old woman with repaired tetralogy of Fallot and a bioprosthetic pulmonary valve presented with a large thrombosis occluding most of her right ventricular outflow tract and main pulmonary arteries. Our pulmonary embolism response team was emergently consulted, resulting in considerable discussion regarding the treatment modality given the large size and high-risk nature of the thrombosis. Ultimately, she was started on a heparin infusion until she could undergo open thrombectomy and pulmonary valve repeat replacement. The patient's asymptomatic presentation, despite the considerable clot burden, complicated our approach to management but ultimately led to a measured and timely intervention.

### Aortic dissection with pseudoaneurysm formation masquerading as pulmonary embolism after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^111Jv8uj]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

On presentation 19 days later, the patient reported worsening dyspnea and intermittent chest pain. Initial vitals showed a blood pressure of 130/61 mmHg, heart rate of 66 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 73% on room air. Supplemental oxygen was started via high‐flow nasal cannula set at 15 L/min and 40% FiO2. The D‐dimer was elevated at 6531 ng/mL, high‐sensitivity troponin was 49 ng/L, and repeat troponin was stable (Table 1). An electrocardiogram showed ventricular pacing without ischemic ST‐segment changes. Chest X‐ray showed a small to moderate right pleural effusion. The patient's recent immobilization and age indicated a low‐to‐moderate pretest probability for pulmonary embolism using the revised Geneva Score and Wells' Criteria. A lung ventilation‐perfusion scan was performed which demonstrated significantly reduced perfusion of the right lung relative to ventilation, findings concerning for a large pulmonary embolism. Given the previous history of multiple renal transplants, further imaging with CT angiography of the thorax was deferred.

Table 1
Initial laboratory results on admission.

The patient's home anticoagulation was then switched to intravenous heparin to treat for suspected pulmonary embolism and possible non‐ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction. The next day, the chest pain resolved, though the patient continued to feel dyspneic. At the time, these symptoms were attributed to the suspected pulmonary embolism and bilateral pleural effusions. To further evaluate the persistent dyspnea and bilateral pleural effusions, a CT scan of the thorax without contrast was performed the following day which showed a dilated aorta at the level of the proximal arch measuring up to 4.5 cm in diameter, a large right pleural effusion, and smaller left pleural effusion. A thoracentesis yielded 500 mL of serosanguinous fluid from the right pleural space with some improvement in dyspnea. Concurrently, the patient's hemoglobin started to trend downward with no clear signs of bleeding such as vascular access site bleeding or hematoma, hemoptysis, hematemesis, or melena. The presence of acute‐onset anemia and continued respiratory distress despite therapeutic anticoagulation and thoracentesis suggested the possibility that another diagnosis was driving the patient's presentation rather than the initial suspicion of pulmonary embolism.

### Revised paradigm for acute pulmonary embolism prognostication and treatment [^1137gdrS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

- What is the optimal timing for assessing outcomes after a diagnosis of acute PE?

Early assessment for adverse outcomes might improve decision making regarding outpatient therapy of PE and escalated PE-associated monitoring and therapy.

- What kind of relationship should prognostic outcomes have to the therapeutic and monitoring options?

Prognostication should accurately estimate all-cause mortality in patients undergoing consideration for outpatient therapy. Alternatively, prognostication should accurately estimate PE-related mortality and PE-related decompensation in patients undergoing consideration for disease-specific therapy.

- What is the operational definition of PE-associated deterioration?

PE-associated adverse outcomes include death, recurrent PE, RV dysfunction, end-organ hypoperfusion, respiratory failure, and hypotension (and tachycardia).

- For patients with acute PE, how should clinicians accurately estimate the individual risk of patients for adverse outcomes?

Calculators could provide individual risk estimations that help guide the choice of available therapeutic options. Retrospective analyses of large registries' data could assist with the rapid development of new risk calculators. Prospective studies could assist with the development, validation, and revision of these tools and schemas at a slower pace and at a greater cost.

- What predictor variables should physicians consider and/or which prognostic tools should be included?

New risk calculators should include variables associated with medical history and physical examination, laboratory testing, and tests that assess for the presence and the degree of hypoxemia, RV dysfunction, myocardial injury, clot burden, organ perfusion, and systemic inflammation.

- Which intervention(s) has or have the best risk/benefit ratio for distinct subgroups of patients with acute PE?

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112ckbEw]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism — epidemiology, symptoms, and diagnostic evaluation in acute chest pain: The incidence of PE is estimated at 65 cases per 100000, one-third of deaths are sudden, and 60% are undiagnosed before death; risk factors include inherited hypercoagulable states and acquired risk factors such as recent surgery, trauma, immobilization, malignancy, smoking, obesity, and oral contraception, and dyspnea followed by pleuritic chest pain is the most common presenting symptom with signs of deep venous thrombosis possibly present on examination. CTA using PE protocol is the diagnostic modality of choice in stable patients, ventilation-perfusion scanning is a second-line alternative in the acute setting, and use of clinical prediction rules to select patients for imaging can decrease radiation exposure and cost; troponin and brain natriuretic peptide can be elevated, echocardiography may reveal acute right ventricular strain consequent to large PEs, and troponin and brain natriuretic peptide are both markers for higher mortality rate. Recognition of PE is important because prompt anticoagulation improves outcomes, and diagnostic evaluation depends on clinical assessment of pretest probability; D-dimers are highly sensitive but not very specific for PE in emergency department patients, and measurement of D-dimers using age- and sex-specific cutoffs may be useful in patients at low to intermediate pretest probability such that those with negative D-dimers can probably be discharged without further testing whereas those with positive values should be considered for CTA.

### Risk factors for adverse short-term outcome in patients with pulmonary embolism [^1164cHgW]. Thrombosis Research (2001). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially fatal disease. Death usually occurs before hospital admission or in the initial in-hospital phase. A number of clinical and instrumental findings have been associated with a high risk of adverse short-term clinical outcomes in patients with PE. Advanced age, concomitant cardiopulmonary disease, and haemodynamic instability, as well as large perfusion defects at lung scanning and acute right heart dysfunction as assessed by echocardiography, are associated with adverse in-hospital outcome. Elevated serum levels of troponin I have been recently demonstrated to be associated with severe right ventricular dysfunction and adverse in-hospital outcome in patients with PE. Early recurrence of PE is associated with a high mortality rate. Right heart dysfunction, as assessed by echocardiography and an acute fall in platelet count, have been suggested as risk factors for recurrence of PE. A reduction in mortality in the subgroup of patients with a poor prognosis might be achieved by using more aggressive treatments such as thrombolysis and surgical or interventional procedures. However, such treatments are invariably associated with bleeding and other procedural complications.

Suspected pulmonary embolism — diagnostic approach and risk stratification: CTA using PE protocol is the diagnostic modality of choice in stable patients, and ventilation-perfusion scanning is a second-line alternative in the acute setting; use of clinical prediction rules to select patients for imaging can decrease radiation exposure and cost. Troponin and brain natriuretic peptide can be elevated, echocardiography may reveal acute right ventricular strain consequent to large PEs, and both biomarkers are markers for higher mortality rate. Recognition of PE is important because prompt anticoagulation improves outcomes; clinical assessment combined with pretest risk stratification can help select patients appropriate for diagnostic imaging, and in the absence of shock, diagnostic evaluation depends on the clinical assessment of pretest probability. D-dimers are highly sensitive but not very specific for the diagnosis of PE in emergency department (ED) patients; measurement of D-dimers using age- and sex-specific cutoffs may be useful in patients at low to intermediate pretest probability, those with negative D-dimers can probably be discharged without further testing, whereas those with positive values should be considered for CTA. The incidence of PE is estimated at 65 cases per 100000, one-third of deaths are sudden and 60% are undiagnosed before death, dyspnea followed by chest pain is the most common presenting symptom, and signs of deep venous thrombosis may be present on examination.

### Association of race, ethnicity and insurance status with outcomes for patients with acute pulmonary embolism treated by PERT: a retrospective observational study [^1145neZ9]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

PERT was implemented at our institution (Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, NY) beginning in 2018. The PERT consisted of the on-call pulmonologist, intensivist, cardiologist, cardiothoracic surgeon and interventional radiologist. The racial and ethnic makeup of the PERT was diverse. Clinicians included in the PERT were of different races including White, Black, Asian, Native American and Pacific Islander; a few clinicians of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity were also present. No community members were involved in the activities of PERT hitherto. Activation of a PERT consult was at the discretion of the primary attending (emergency physician, hospitalist or intensivist) taking care of the patient. The general criteria for activation of a PERT consult was the diagnosis of an acute PE, typically intermediate- or high-risk. In some cases, PERT consultation was also requested for patients with low-risk acute PE at the discretion of the treating physician. For each PERT consult, a management plan was formulated based on mutual discussion amongst all members of the PERT and the patient's treating physician. The European Society of Cardiology 2019 guidelines were used as the cornerstone of management for patients with acute PE as well as for risk stratification. Based on these guidelines, patient with hemodynamic instability were defined as high risk. Patients with both evidence of right heart strain (by echocardiography or computed tomography) and positive biomarkers (troponin and/or brain natriuretic peptide), but without any hemodynamic compromise, were defined as intermediate-high risk. Patients with either positive biomarkers or signs of right heart strain — but not both — in the absence of hemodynamic compromise — were defined as intermediate-low risk. Patients who were hemodynamically stable with normal biomarkers and no echocardiographic evidence of right heart strain were deemed low risk. The on-call interventional radiologist and the on-call cardiothoracic surgeon were available at all times of the day — and during all days of the week — to perform urgent or emergent reperfusion procedures as needed. Advanced reperfusion therapies offered to patients included catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), catheter-directed embolectomy and surgical embolectomy. For administering CDT, percutaneous central venous access was established and bilateral pulmonary artery catheters were placed. Alteplase bolus was administered through the catheters followed by a slow continuous infusion of alteplase over 16–24 h. Fibrinogen levels were used to titrate the rate of alteplase infusion. After completion of CDT, pulmonary angiography was performed to assess if CDT was successful. Catheter-directed embolectomy was performed using the FlowTriever® (Inari Medical, Irvine, CA) device — an over-the-wire mechanical thrombectomy device — after percutaneous central venous access. Surgical embolectomy was performed via a midline sternotomy and entailed direct removal of clots from the pulmonary trunk after total cardiopulmonary bypass. General indications for surgical embolectomy were failed CDT, failed catheter-directed embolectomy, hemodynamic instability precluding percutaneous intervention and radiographic signs of probable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^111hJdis]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion

The suggested approaches are based on a non-systematic review of the guidelines and literature, and expert consensus. Management in an individual patient should be based on clinical risk–benefit assessment, careful management of coagulation status and effective physician–patient communication. Structured follow-up post-acute PE is important to improve patient outcomes, including diagnosing CTEPH. How best to deliver such care and how best to structure follow-up PE clinics requires further evaluation.

### High-risk pulmonary embolism during Labor: JACC patient care pathways [^112Dm3NY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

While in labor, a 37-year-old woman developed acute dyspnea, hypoxemia, and tachycardia. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated severe right ventricular dilation and dysfunction, raising the suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism. The patient indeed had bilateral pulmonary embolism, necessitating percutaneous thrombectomy. Her course was complicated by another saddle pulmonary embolus, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and COVID-19 infection. This clinical case illustrates the importance of prompt diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism in a peripartum female patient, the multidisciplinary approach of management, and how to approach clinical complications such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

### Impending paradoxical embolism presenting as a pulmonary embolism, transient ischemic attack, and myocardial infarction [^111V5fXb]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

A 25-year-old man presented with complaints of nonpleuritic, substernal chest pain, dyspnea, and decreasing exercise tolerance. His vital signs were normal, with the exception of an oxygen saturation level of 93% while breathing room air. During his assessment, he developed transient left facial droop, left arm and leg weakness, and an ataxic gait, which lasted 15 min then resolved spontaneously. Cardiac enzyme levels were elevated, and an ECG revealed T-wave inversion in leads III, aVF, V1, and V2 with evolving ST-segment elevation in leads V3 through V5. The findings of a CT scan and MRI of the head were negative; a Doppler ultrasound of the right lower extremity revealed a thrombus extending from the common femoral vein to the popliteal vein. Cardiac catheterization revealed no evidence of epicardial coronary artery disease. CT pulmonary angiography revealed bilateral pulmonary emboli. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed a 4-cm, dumbbell-shaped mass lodged in a patent foramen ovale, confirming the diagnosis of an impending paradoxical embolism. The patient was started on therapy with unfractionated heparin, and his thrombus resolved spontaneously by hospital day 5. An impending paradoxical embolism is rare but should be suspected in anyone presenting with evidence of both venous and arterial emboli. The therapeutic options include anticoagulation, thrombolysis, and surgical embolectomy. We would propose that initial treatment with anticoagulation therapy and following with serial TEEs may be appropriate therapy in an otherwise stable patient, with surgical embolectomy or thrombolysis reserved for the treatment of thrombi that do not resolve with anticoagulation therapy or for patients with clinical deterioration.

### Pulmonary embolism [^113gaDHB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

PE is one of the great challenges in medicine. It is a disease that carries with it a high mortality rate, yet no historical piece of information, physical examination finding, or diagnostic modality is perfect at excluding its possibility. Emergency physicians must be vigilant about considering PE in the differential diagnosis of a variety of presenting complaints and must use a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic options as they manage patients with suspected or confirmed PE. The diagnostic options range from bedside diagnostic tests to highly specialized imaging available at only specialized institutions. Knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each of the diagnostic modalities assists the physician in employing the best test. Therapeutic options also vary widely and include anticoagulation, vena caval interruption, systemic thrombolysis, embolectomy, and other therapeutic adjuncts, such as ECMO and inhaled nitric oxide. Similarly, awareness of the indications and contraindications to the varied therapeutic agents ensures appropriate therapy when the diagnosis is made.

Biomarkers

Overall, 709 cases (86.8%) had at least 1 troponin level measured as part of the ED evaluation. We performed a parallel analysis (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1), defining low-risk as PESI class I to II with reference-range biomarker levels and high-risk as PESI class III to V with abnormal troponin levels. This produced similar findings, with no major differences in clinical outcomes or patterns of hospitalization or resource utilization across the risk groups (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1).

Acute pulmonary embolism — overuse and harms: Well-validated decision rules have found that the risk for PE in patients who do not meet their criteria for additional testing is very low, and despite a significant increase in diagnoses of PE, mortality has remained unchanged, suggesting that we are overdiagnosing PE that are not clinically significant. Harms of imaging include radiation exposure, contrast-induced nephropathy and contrast allergy, cost, overdiagnosis and resultant overtreatment with anticoagulants, and detection and work-up of incidental findings.

Iatrogenic pulmonary air embolism is a fairly common and sometimes deadly complication of i.v. contrast injection.

Case Report

We present the case of a 33-year-old man with a symptomatic iatrogenic injection air embolism and resolution within 5 h. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Given the importance of computed tomography imaging in emergency medicine, clinicians should be aware of the risk for injection air embolism from i.v. contrast injection.

### An unexpected case of recurrence of pulmonary embolism in a patient recovered from COVID19 in full regimen dose of direct oral anticoagulant drug [^114RzAQ5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Laboratory investigation revealed an increase of high-sensitive troponin (90 ng/L, normal range < 54 ng/L), an elevated D-Dimer (3499 ng/ml), an increase of the white blood cell count (26,000), and a normal C-reactive protein (0.2 mg/L). Chest x-ray showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates with accentuation of the vascular plot, in the absence of pleural effusion (Fig. 1). Arterial blood gas at the time of the onset of dyspnea showed PH 7.38, PaCO₂ 22 mmHg, PaO₂ 48 mmHg, and bicarbonate 20 mmol/L. A reservoir 15 l/min was placed. On 70% FiO₂, arterial blood gas showed PH 7.44, PaCO₂ 37.8 mmHg, PaO₂ 151 mmHg, and bicarbonate 16 mmol/L. An ECG showed a tachycardia, with a new onset right bundle branch block, S1, and Q3. At the transthoracic echocardiography, right-sided chambers were severely dilated. Due to the sudden clinical deterioration, thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was immediately performed in the suspicion of recurrent PE. The patient had a rapid beneficial effect with restoration of stable hemodynamic parameters.

After infusion of tPA, a computed tomography angiogram was performed, which documented marked defect of endoluminal filling of the right and left pulmonary artery with extension to their main branches referable to acute PE, more extensive than the previous one (Fig. 2). The patient was than admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and UFH was started intravenously. During the in-hospital stay, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, in sinus rhythm, and apyretic. His COVID19 swab test resulted negative. To exclude venous thromboembolism (VTE), a venous echo-Doppler ultrasound was performed, which resulted negative. After collegial discussion, it was decided to continue for one month with LMWH and then, if there will be more clearer data on the matter, to start warfarin.

### Cardiothoracic CT: one-stop-shop procedure? Impact on the management of acute pulmonary embolism [^1125qe34]. Insights Into Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

Cardiac biomarkers

Cardiac biomarkers are currently used in the diagnostic workup of acute chest pain and dyspnea. However, there is increasing evidence that they may also be relevant in PE risk stratification. Cardiac biomarkers can be subdivided into two major groups: markers of RVD, particularly brain natriuretic peptides, and markers of myocardial injury, of which troponins are the most important representatives.

Brain natriuretic peptides

Brain natriuretic peptides (BNP) or N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) are cardiac biomarkers released with increased myocardial stretch. There is increasing evidence that the BNP and NT-proBNP levels are directly related to the severity of RVD. In a systematic review, Sanchez et al. found a relative risk for predicting 30-day mortality of 9.5 for BNP and 5.7 for pro-BNP in patients with proven PE. Although the negative predictive value (NPV) of BNP/NT-proBNP is very high (94–100%), the positive predictive value (PPV) is rather low (12–26%). Consequently, these biomarkers seem especially useful to identify patients with PE who are at low risk of an adverse outcome.

Cardiac troponins

Elevated levels of troponins (either I or T) are found in patients with acute myocardial infarction due to injury of myocardial cells. Troponin-T is released when RV ischemia is present. Elevated troponin T levels were found in 32% of patients with massive and moderate PE, but not in patients with mild PE. Furthermore, Sanchez et al. revealed a strong relationship between elevated troponin T levels and 30-day mortality. Although elevated troponin levels are associated with increased early mortality, the PPV is low (12–44%). In contrast, normal troponin T levels revealed a high NPV of 99–100% for both fatal and non-fatal adverse events. Troponin levels may therefore be useful either as a marker of low risk of an adverse outcome when they are normal or as a marker of high risk when they are elevated.

Society of Interventional Radiology position on catheter-directed therapy (CDT) for acute pulmonary embolism (PE) states that the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) "considers the use of catheter-directed therapy (CDT) or thrombolysis to be an acceptable treatment option for carefully selected patients with massive (ie, high-risk) pulmonary embolism (PE) involving the proximal pulmonary arterial vasculature, in accordance with multidisciplinary guidelines", and "encourages the investigative use of CDT and new endovascular techniques in prospective outcomes studies and clinical trials, with particular attention to patients with acute submassive (ie, intermediate-risk) PE". SIR defines acute proximal PE as "new main or lobar emboli identified on radiographic imaging within 14 days of PE symptoms". Acute PE is "currently classified into three categories: low-risk, submassive (ie, intermediate-risk), and massive (ie, high-risk)". Low-risk PE is "defined by the absence of right heart strain and systemic arterial hypotension", and patients "with low-risk PE (< 1% short-term mortality rate) can be successfully managed with prompt initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation". Submassive or intermediate-risk PE is "the presence of right heart dysfunction in the setting of normal blood pressure", which "represents as many as 25% of all cases of acute PE". In submassive PE, a randomized controlled trial "demonstrated a 5.6% rate of clinical deterioration (ie, death or hemodynamic decompensation) within 7 days and a 30-day mortality rate with anticoagulation alone".

### Interventional therapy for pulmonary embolism [^116mDZ9U]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism is a common cause of death. Acute massive pulmonary embolism (PE) is life-threatening and may require vigorous more invasive treatment. Several risk factors are related to increased incidence of massive PE. Anticoagulation is the most traditional treatment for PE but may not suffice in cases of massive PE. Systemic thrombolytic therapy, catheter-directed thrombolysis, percutaneous embolectomy, and more recently, percutaneous thrombus fragmentation techniques with a multitude of devices are now available to treat the most severe cases of massive PE. Successful treatment of PE includes implementation of a treatment protocol and the use of associated techniques and devices.

Differences in massive and submassive PE

Massive or high-risk and submassive or intermediate-risk PE are divided by hemodynamic presentation (Table 1). Massive PE occurs in about 5% of patients with PE and carries a mortality rate of 18–65%. It is defined as PE with sustained hypotension (systolic BP < 90 for at least 15 min), the need for inotropic support, or persistent bradycardia (HR < 40 bpm with signs or symptoms of shock). Persistent bradycardia may be a result of complete atrioventricular (AV) block due to injury to the right bundle branch that runs superficially in the right ventricular wall and in the intraventricular septum, and is sensitive to acute right ventricular dilatation, in a patient with pre-existing electrical conduction system disease like left bundle branch block (LBBB). Of note, the right bundle branch can also be disturbed during pulmonary catheterization, a technique that may be used by interventional radiologists in diagnosing and treating massive and submassive PE, causing a complete AV block in a patient with existing LBBB. Therefore, a temporary pacemaker placement should be considered in patients with LBBB.

Table 1
PE subtypes, % of patients, clinical definition, and mortality rate

Submassive PE, seen in about 40% of patients with PE, carries a 5–25% mortality rate (Table 1). Patients with submassive PE are systemically normotensive with evidence of myocardial ischemia or dysfunction as demonstrated by elevated troponins and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and/or RV dysfunction demonstrated by decreased motility on echo, increased right ventricle/left ventricle (RV/LV) ratio greater than 0.9 on Echo or CT, elevation of beta natriuretic peptide (BNP) and pro-BNP which mark heart failure, and ECG changes.

The remaining 55% of patients with PE present with nonmassive or low-risk PE, also called uncomplicated PE, with a mortality rate of up to 1% (Table 1). Patients with simple PE are systemically normotensive, without right ventricular dysfunction or myocardial ischemia.

### Non-invasive imaging in coronary syndromes: recommendations of the European association of cardiovascular imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography, in collaboration with the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography, and Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^115dMu4T]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2022). High credibility.

Clinical role of imaging and current guidelines for acute coronary syndromes — Transthoracic echocardiography, using either fully equipped units or point-of-care ultrasound systems, should be available to all emergency rooms and should be performed and interpreted by trained expert operators, in all patients referred for chest pain, except in limited situations such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) where imaging would delay reperfusion. Bedside echocardiography is beneficial when complications are suspected or when an alternative diagnosis is considered, and alternative diagnoses include aortic dissection, pericarditis with or without pericardial effusion, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral valve prolapse, or right ventricular dilatation suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism. In patients with acute chest pain, European guidelines and American appropriate use criteria recognize the value of coronary CTA or functional testing as an alternative to invasive coronary angiography (ICA) for those at very low or low risk for ACS, including patients with indeterminate ECG changes, negative troponins, and no recent chest pain; functional imaging in this situation has higher accuracy and is clearly favored over a stress ECG. This strategy is, however, not recommended in STEMI or NSTE-ACS with high-risk features, where prompt ICA should be pursued, with primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI and within 24 h for NSTE-ACS.

### A unique presentation of four thrombotic events at a time [^116bz97n]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 72-year-old man was referred to our hospital as a case of postcardiac arrest following a long distance air flight. Work-up in the emergency department revealed the presence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), bilateral pulmonary embolism, inferior STEMI (ST elevation myocardial infarction) and ischaemic stroke. He received thrombolysis by recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) following which his haemodynamic status improved, but he developed haemorrhagic transformation of the stroke as a complication. The haemorrhagic lesion gradually resolved with conservative management, leaving behind a residual neurological deficit. His haemodynamic status was stable after the management. Although a diagnosis of right-to-left shunt lesion was highly suggestive in this condition, it could not be confirmed on the transthoracic echocardiogram. Our patient had a unique presentation of multiple thrombi in different organs that caused significant morbidity and haemodynamic instability. There are no well-established guidelines that discuss the acute management of such cases. This situation requires a careful assessment and management of the patient by a multidisciplinary team.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114bmBSd]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism without hypotension — monitoring and triggers for thrombolytic therapy: patients with PE and without hypotension who have severe symptoms or marked cardiopulmonary impairment should be monitored closely for deterioration, and development of hypotension suggests that thrombolytic therapy has become indicated. Deterioration that has not resulted in hypotension may also prompt the use of thrombolytic therapy, with examples including a decrease in systolic BP (which remains > 90 mm Hg), progressive increase in heart rate, increased jugular venous pressure, worsening gas exchange, signs of shock, progressive right heart dysfunction on echocardiography, or an increase in cardiac biomarkers. Echocardiography or cardiac biomarkers are not proposed to be measured routinely in all patients with PE or all with a non–low-risk PESI assessment, but assessment of right ventricular function by echocardiography and/or measurement of cardiac biomarkers is encouraged if, following clinical assessment, there is uncertainty about whether patients require more intensive monitoring or should receive thrombolytic therapy.

### Rituximab induced lung injury [^115N2a5G]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 73-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of DLBCL presented to the emergency department with a four-day history of worsening shortness of breath and hypoxemia 88% on room air requiring 2–3 L supplemental oxygen. Her social history includes a 25-pack year of tobacco smoking which she quit 33 years before her diagnosis. Pertinent family history includes breast cancer in her mother and sister. The patient has received both sars-cov-2 and influenza vaccination for the year.

Two weeks prior to her current presentation, patient had received the first cycle of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (R-CHOP). Her initial infusion was complicated by an episode of lacy, erythematous rash that was attributed to potential hypersensitivity reaction. A week after administration, she was noted to have persistent dyspnea associated with small pleural effusion and lower extremity edema. She was started on a diuretic for concern for possible volume overload with a close follow up in a week. No thoracentesis was done given small size and no safe window.

Upon presentation to the emergency department, she was visibly dyspneic at rest and with minimal exertion. Initial vitals showed a normal temperature of 36.9 °C, blood pressure, 124/75 and heart rate at 100 beats per minute. On physical examination, her pulmonary auscultation revealed diffuse rhonchi with decreased breath sounds at the left lower lung base and 1 + putting edema in the lower extremity.

Initial work up in the emergency room included complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), Troponin, prothrombin (PT) and international normalized ration (INR), Urinalysis, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), electrocardiogram (EKG), chest radiography (chest x-ray), and computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest. EKG showed premature atrial complexes, inferior infarct, and a shortened QT interval. Chest x-ray revealed a left perihilar opacity and a small left pleural effusion. Chest tomography angiogram of the chest revealed no pulmonary embolism, multifocal ground glass opacities (GGO) present in all five lobes, emphysema, and trace left pleural effusion with atelectasis (Fig. 1). Labs demonstrated mildly elevated white blood cell (WBC) count.

### Aortic arch thrombus and pulmonary embolism in a COVID-19 patient [^111s16nF]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with endothelial inflammation and a hypercoagulable state resulting in both venous and arterial thromboembolic complications. We present a case of COVID-19-associated aortic thrombus in an otherwise healthy patient.

Case Report

A 53-year-old woman with no past medical history presented with a 10-day history of dyspnea, fever, and cough. Her pulse oximetry on room air was 84%. She tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and chest radiography revealed moderate patchy bilateral airspace opacities. Serology markers for cytokine storm were significantly elevated, with a serum D-dimer level of 8180 ng/mL (normal < 230 ng/mL). Computed tomography of the chest with i.v. contrast was positive for bilateral ground-glass opacities, scattered filling defects within the bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries, and a large thrombus was present at the aortic arch. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and successfully treated with unfractionated heparin, alteplase 50 mg, and argatroban 2 μg/kg/min. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Mural aortic thrombus is a rare but serious cause of distal embolism and is typically discovered during an evaluation of cryptogenic arterial embolization to the viscera or extremities. Patients with suspected hypercoagulable states, such as that encountered with COVID-19, should be screened for thromboembolism, and when identified, aggressively anticoagulated.
