## Question

Subvlinical hyperthyroid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about subclinical hyperthyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining subclinical hyperthyroidism and confirming the diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify the etiologies and the differential for suppressed TSH. Next, I will review epidemiology and natural history, including progression risks. After that, I need to examine organ-specific risks, especially cardiovascular and skeletal outcomes. Then, I should appraise the quality of evidence and guideline-based treatment thresholds. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise management approach and highlight uncertainties and research gaps, making sure I double-check areas where evidence is mixed or evolving.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic framework. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a biochemical state characterized by a low or undetectable TSH with normal free T4 and normal T3, and it is typically silent or minimally symptomatic, which is why it is often discovered incidentally on routine labs; I should double-check that both free hormones are truly normal before labeling someone as subclinical rather than overt hyperthyroidism. Wait, let me verify the grading that guides risk stratification: many guidelines and reviews distinguish mild suppression (TSH 0.1–0.4 mIU/L) from severe suppression (TSH < 0.1 mIU/L), because the latter correlates with higher risks and stronger treatment indications, so I need to ensure I document the degree of TSH suppression clearly [^116SUZCg] [^117EwFyN].

> Next, I should review etiologies and the differential for a suppressed TSH. Endogenous causes include Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary autonomous nodules, whereas exogenous causes include excessive levothyroxine replacement or suppressive therapy; transient causes include subacute, painless, or postpartum thyroiditis, and non-thyroidal illness or medications can also suppress TSH, so I need to check for these before committing to a diagnosis of persistent subclinical hyperthyroidism [^112XTwhm] [^117KaLMs]. Hold on, I should verify persistence before labeling: repeating TSH (with free T4 and T3) in 3–6 months is prudent to confirm persistence and exclude transient etiologies, especially in younger patients or those with mild suppression, whereas older adults or those with TSH < 0.1 mIU/L warrant expedited evaluation for underlying disease [^115eGybG] [^112XTwhm].

> I will now examine epidemiology and natural history. Prevalence estimates vary by population and assay, but subclinical hyperthyroidism is generally around 1–2% in iodine-replete settings and higher in older adults; importantly, progression to overt hyperthyroidism is more likely when TSH is < 0.1 mIU/L, with estimates ranging from about 8% at 1 year to roughly 26% by 5 years, so I should confirm the degree of suppression when counseling patients about prognosis [^114mrL9g] [^111kErfz]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the prevalence was uniformly 2–5%, but I should correct that: contemporary U.S. data suggest approximately 0.7–1.4% prevalence, with higher rates in older cohorts, so I need to be precise when quoting figures [^114mrL9g] [^1165m5vZ].

> Now, let me consider cardiovascular risks, especially atrial fibrillation. In older adults, subclinical hyperthyroidism approximately doubles the risk of incident atrial fibrillation, and the risk appears to rise with lower TSH, particularly when TSH is < 0.1 mIU/L; I should confirm this association is consistent across cohorts and that confounding is addressed [^1157D6oW] [^116zi9e7]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about broader cardiovascular mortality: some meta-analyses suggest modest increases in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality with subclinical hyperthyroidism, but estimates vary and are sensitive to study quality and adjustment, so I need to communicate uncertainty while acknowledging the signal, especially in those with TSH < 0.1 mIU/L [^113Ni5av] [^115XH3rG]. I should also review mechanistic and interventional hints: diastolic dysfunction has been shown to improve after reversal of exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, and emerging pharmacoepidemiologic data suggest a trend toward lower incident AF with treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism, although randomized evidence is still needed, so I must be cautious in overinterpreting these findings [^114nNzVY] [^115tKe2Y].

> Next, I should review skeletal risks. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with increased bone turnover and fracture risk, particularly in postmenopausal women; pooled analyses show higher risks of hip, nonspine, and any fractures, with the strongest signal when TSH is < 0.1 mIU/L and in endogenous disease, so I need to check menopausal status and baseline fracture risk when advising patients [^112xhF7b] [^113dZPzQ]. Let me verify consistency: multiple cohorts replicate an independent association between suppressed TSH and fractures even after adjustment, reinforcing the clinical relevance of this risk, especially over longer follow-up [^112dTyB1] [^114FPNfM].

> I should also consider neurocognitive and mood effects, but I need to be careful. Observational data suggest a possible association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and depression, though effect sizes are smaller than in overt hyperthyroidism and heterogeneity exists; moreover, when restricted to low-risk-of-bias studies, the association with subclinical disease becomes attenuated, so I should avoid overstating this link in counseling [^117DLEZV] [^1178cQaL]. But wait, what if the patient reports anxiety or mood changes? I should screen and manage mood symptoms while recognizing that causality remains uncertain and that thyroid-directed therapy may not directly modify mood outcomes in subclinical disease [^notfound].

> Now, I need to appraise the evidence base and guideline positions to anchor treatment decisions. High-quality randomized trials demonstrating that treating subclinical hyperthyroidism improves hard outcomes are lacking; most data are observational, and USPSTF highlights insufficient evidence for population screening and limited treatment-outcome data, so shared decision-making is essential [^111kErfz] [^112Q79n9]. Let me verify guideline thresholds: the ATA recommends treating when TSH is persistently < 0.1 mIU/L in adults ≥ 65 years, in patients with cardiac disease or osteoporosis, in postmenopausal women not on estrogen or bisphosphonates, or in those with hyperthyroid symptoms; for TSH 0.1–0.4 mIU/L, treatment is considered in older adults or those with cardiac disease or symptoms, while observation is acceptable in younger, asymptomatic patients without risk factors [^112mMkjF] [^1111b4h5] [^114Zketr]. I should confirm that these recommendations are graded as strong or weak with moderate-quality evidence, reflecting the observational nature of the risk data [^112mMkjF] [^1111b4h5].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach while I double-check each step against guidelines. First, confirm persistence by repeating TSH with free T4 and T3 in 3–6 months, unless the patient is ≥ 65 or has TSH < 0.1 mIU/L, in which case proceed sooner; second, evaluate etiology with history, exam, medication review, and, if endogenous disease is suspected, consider thyroid uptake scan and TSI to distinguish Graves' disease from nodular autonomy; third, stratify risk using age, TSH level, cardiovascular and bone risk factors, and symptoms; fourth, choose management: treat if TSH is persistently < 0.1 mIU/L or if the patient is ≥ 65 with cardiac or skeletal risk, consider treatment for TSH 0.1–0.4 mIU/L if older or with comorbidities, and observe younger, asymptomatic patients with mild suppression; fifth, if treating, tailor therapy to etiology using antithyroid drugs for Graves' disease and radioactive iodine for toxic nodular disease, with beta-blockers for symptom control; sixth, monitor TSH every 3–6 months until stable, then annually, and reassess bone density in postmenopausal women or those on suppressive therapy [^112XTwhm] [^112mMkjF] [^112SS3Re] [^112PqCVC]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overgeneralizing: in selected younger patients with mild suppression, observation alone is reasonable, and spontaneous remission can occur, so I need to ensure follow-up is reliable before deferring therapy [^114Zketr] [^115eGybG].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and edge cases. In differentiated thyroid cancer, TSH suppression is intentional; however, I should balance oncologic benefit against skeletal and cardiovascular risks, especially in older or high-risk patients, and consider less aggressive suppression when disease risk is low and adverse effect risk is high [^116XReNf]. For postmenopausal women with endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, I should have a lower threshold to treat given fracture risk, and I should proactively assess bone mineral density and consider osteoporosis prevention strategies when appropriate [^112xhF7b] [^113dZPzQ]. Let me reconsider one more nuance: exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism from over-replacement is common and reversible; dose reduction is a simple, high-yield intervention that can mitigate both cardiac and skeletal risks without definitive antithyroid therapy [^115xTQQk] [^114Xo7vx].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and research needs so expectations are realistic. We still need large, randomized trials to determine whether treating subclinical hyperthyroidism prevents atrial fibrillation, fractures, and mortality; until then, decisions should be individualized, incorporating patient preferences, comorbidities, and the degree of TSH suppression, with transparent discussion of potential benefits, harms, and the observational nature of risk estimates [^117KaLMs]. I should double-check that my plan aligns with this uncertainty: yes, the approach emphasizes confirmation of persistence, risk stratification, and shared decision-making rather than reflexive treatment, which is consistent with current evidence and guidelines [^112mMkjF] [^111kErfz].

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a **low TSH with normal free T4 and T3** [^111trvZ4], often detected incidentally. It carries **increased risks of atrial fibrillation** [^1157D6oW], cardiovascular events [^116zi9e7], osteoporosis [^113dZPzQ], and progression to overt hyperthyroidism, especially when TSH is < 0.1 mIU/L [^111kErfz] or in older adults [^notfound]. Management is **individualized**: treat when TSH is persistently < 0.1 mIU/L, in patients ≥ 65 years, or in those with cardiac disease, osteoporosis, or symptoms [^112mMkjF]; observe if TSH is 0.1–0.4 mIU/L and the patient is < 65 years, asymptomatic, and without risk factors [^114Zketr]. Therapy follows the underlying cause (radioiodine for nodular disease, antithyroid drugs for Graves') [^112SS3Re], with beta-blockers for symptom control [^1165m5vZ]; monitor TSH every 3–6 months and reassess bone and cardiovascular risk [^112XTwhm].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a **low or undetectable TSH** with normal free T4 and T3 [^111trvZ4]. It is categorized by TSH level: **mild (0.1–0.4 mIU/L)** and **severe (< 0.1 mIU/L)** [^116SUZCg]. Diagnosis requires persistent suppression on repeat testing after excluding transient causes (e.g. recent illness, medications, assay interference) [^113Ak8pJ].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Prevalence is approximately **0.7–1.4%** in the general population [^114mrL9g] and rises with age, particularly in women and in iodine-deficient regions [^116SUZCg] [^113M5vsW] [^1144mHmP]. Risk factors include **age, female sex, iodine deficiency, prior thyroid disease, and exogenous thyroid hormone use** [^116SUZCg] [^113M5vsW] [^1144mHmP] [^114Xo7vx].

---

## Clinical significance and potential complications

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with **clinically meaningful risks**, including:

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Increased atrial fibrillation [^1157D6oW], heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality, especially in older adults or with TSH < 0.1 mIU/L [^116zi9e7] [^115XH3rG].

- **Skeletal effects**: Higher fracture risk [^112xhF7b] and bone loss, particularly in postmenopausal women [^113dZPzQ].

- **Progression**: Risk of overt hyperthyroidism is higher with TSH < 0.1 mIU/L or nodular autonomy [^111kErfz].

- **Neurocognitive effects**: Possible cognitive decline and quality-of-life impairment, though evidence is mixed [^114Xo7vx].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **structured evaluation** is essential:

- **Confirm persistence**: Repeat TSH, free T4, and T3 in 3–6 months [^117EwFyN].

- **Identify etiology**: Use thyroid uptake scan, thyroid scintigraphy, and thyroid antibodies (TRAb, TPOAb) to distinguish Graves' disease, toxic nodular disease, thyroiditis, or exogenous causes [^113vLPEX].

- **Exclude transient causes**: Non-thyroidal illness, medications (glucocorticoids, dopamine agonists), assay interference [^112eGwm3].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **individualized** by TSH level, age, comorbidities, and etiology:

| **Tsh level** | **Patient characteristics** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|-|
| < 0.1 mIU/L | - All ≥ 65 years <br/> - Cardiac disease <br/> - Osteoporosis <br/> - Symptoms | Treat (radioiodine or antithyroid drugs) [^112mMkjF] |
| 0.1–0.4 mIU/L | - < 65 years <br/> - Asymptomatic <br/> - No cardiac/osteoporosis | Observe; monitor TSH every 6–12 months [^114Zketr] |
| Any level | Symptomatic | Beta-blockers for symptom control [^114Zketr] |

---

Treatment selection: **radioiodine for toxic nodular disease** [^112SS3Re]; **antithyroid drugs for Graves' disease** [^111SjHiZ]; **beta-blockers for adrenergic symptoms** [^114Zketr]. Monitoring: reassess TSH every 3–6 months initially, then annually; monitor bone density and cardiovascular status as indicated [^112XTwhm].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Prognosis varies by etiology and TSH level. Progression to overt hyperthyroidism is more likely with **TSH < 0.1 mIU/L** or nodular autonomy [^111kErfz] [^115eGybG]. Cardiovascular and skeletal risks are higher with **persistent TSH suppression**, especially in older adults [^115XH3rG] [^112xhF7b]. Treatment can normalize thyroid function and may reduce cardiovascular and skeletal risks, though randomized trial evidence is limited [^112PqCVC] [^112Q79n9].

---

## Current research and controversies

Key gaps include a **lack of large randomized trials** on treatment benefits and optimal thresholds, uncertainty about long-term cognitive and quality-of-life effects, and debate over screening in asymptomatic adults [^112Q79n9]. Emerging evidence suggests treating subclinical hyperthyroidism may reduce atrial fibrillation, but larger prospective studies are needed [^115tKe2Y].

---

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a biochemical state with **real clinical risks**, especially in older adults or when TSH is < 0.1 mIU/L. Management should be **individualized**, balancing risks and benefits, with treatment for high-risk patients and observation for low-risk patients.

## References

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^117KaLMs]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases — subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism — are common clinical entities that encompass mild degrees of thyroid dysfunction. The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity is uncertain, which has led to controversy over the appropriateness of diagnostic testing and possible treatment. In this Seminar, we discuss the definition, epidemiology, differential diagnoses, risks of progression to overt thyroid disease, potential effects on various health outcomes, and management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment recommendations are based on the degree to which thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations have deviated from normal and underlying comorbidities. Large-scale randomised trials are urgently needed to inform how to best care for individuals with subclinical thyroid disease.

### A stepwise approach to the evaluation and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism [^115eGybG]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review a stepwise approach to the evaluation and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism.

Methods

English-language articles regarding clinical management of subclinical hyperthyroidism published between 2007 and 2012 were reviewed.

Results

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is encountered on a daily basis in clinical practice. When evaluating patients with a suppressed serum thyrotropin value, it is important to exclude other potential etiologies such as overt triiodothyronine toxicosis, drug effect, nonthyroidal illness, and central hypothyroidism. In younger patients with mild thyrotropin suppression, it is acceptable to perform testing again in 3 to 6 months to assess for persistence before performing further diagnostic testing. In older patients or patients with thyrotropin values less than 0.1 mIU/L, diagnostic testing should proceed without delay. Persistence of thyrotropin suppression is more typical of nodular thyroid autonomy, whereas thyroiditis and mild Graves disease frequently resolve spontaneously. The clinical consequences of subclinical hyperthyroidism, such as atrial dysrhythmia, accelerated bone loss, increased fracture rate, and higher rates of cardiovascular mortality, are dependent on age and severity. The decision to treat subclinical hyperthyroidism is directly tied to an assessment of the potential for clinical consequences in untreated disease. Definitive therapy is generally selected for patients with nodular autonomous function, whereas antithyroid drug therapy is more appropriate for mild, persistent Graves disease.

Conclusion

The presented stepwise approach to the care of patients presenting with an isolated suppression of serum thyrotropin focuses on the differential diagnosis, a prediction of the likelihood of persistence, an assessment of potential risks posed to the patient, and, finally, a personalized choice of therapy.

### Association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and fracture risk [^112dTyB1]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the association between endogenous subclinical thyroid dysfunction and fracture risk?

Findings

In this cohort study of 10 946 adults, 93% had euthyroidism, 2.6% had subclinical hyperthyroidism, and 4.4% had subclinical hypothyroidism. Those with subclinical hyperthyroidism had a 34% higher risk of fracture compared with individuals with euthyroidism.

Meaning

This study suggests that subclinical hyperthyroidism was an independent risk factor associated with fracture, highlighting a potential role for more aggressive screening and monitoring of these patients to prevent bone mineral disease.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^111kErfz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — natural history and treatment evidence indicates that subclinical hyperthyroidism is present in about 2% of the U.S. population, one quarter of persons revert to a euthyroid state without medical intervention over time, and an estimated 1% to 2% of persons with TSH levels less than 0.1 mIU/L develop "overt" hyperthyroidism, whereas persons with TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L are unlikely to progress; the USPSTF did not identify any studies evaluating benefits of treating subclinical hyperthyroidism on clinical health outcomes, and except for 1 small (n = 67) nonrandomized study of bone mineral density, no evidence was found on effects of treating "overt" hyperthyroidism.

### Effects of subclinical thyroid dysfunction on the heart [^115xTQQk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Mounting evidence indicates that subclinical thyroid dysfunction has important clinical effects and prognostic implications, supporting the view that it is not a compensated biochemical change sensu strictu.

Purpose

To review clinical information on the effects of subclinical thyroid dysfunction on the heart.

Data Sources

English-language articles identified from files and a MEDLINE search (1970-September 2001), references of relevant articles, textbooks, and meeting abstracts.

Study Selection

Reports on the effects of subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism on the cardiovascular system in humans.

Data Extraction

Data on cardiac structure and performance, arrhythmias, and risk for coronary artery disease were independently assessed by all authors and summarized.

Data Synthesis

Subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with impaired left ventricular diastolic function at rest, systolic dysfunction on effort, and enhanced risk for atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with increased heart rate, atrial arrhythmias, increased left ventricular mass with marginal concentric remodeling, impaired ventricular relaxation, reduced exercise performance, and increased risk for cardiovascular death. All abnormalities were reversed by restoration of euthyroidism (subclinical hypothyroidism) or were blunted by beta-blockade and tailoring of the l -thyroxine dose (subclinical hyperthyroidism).

Conclusion

The heart responds to the minimal but persistent changes in circulating thyroid hormone levels typical of subclinical thyroid dysfunction. Thus, the condition is not a compensated biochemical change sensu strictu, and timely treatment should be considered in an attempt to avoid adverse cardiovascular effects.

### Subclinical thyroid disorders: significance and clinical impact [^115tf2US]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

---

### Update on subclinical hyperthyroidism [^114Xo7vx]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (as in Graves disease or toxic nodular goiter), administration of thyroid hormone for treatment of malignant thyroid disease, or unintentional excessive thyroid hormone therapy. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons who have suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels compared with those who have low but detectable levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in older adults, and with decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women; however, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unknown. There is lesser-quality evidence suggesting an association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and other cardiovascular effects, including increased heart rate and left ventricular mass, and increased bone turnover markers. Possible associations between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality of life parameters, cognition, and increased mortality rates are controversial. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to address the effects of early treatment on potential morbidities to help determine whether screening should be recommended in the asymptomatic general population.

### Meta-analysis: subclinical thyroid dysfunction and the risk for coronary heart disease and mortality [^113Ni5av]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Data on the association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality are conflicting.

Purpose

To summarize prospective evidence about the relationship between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and CHD and mortality.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1950 to January 2008) without language restrictions and reference lists of retrieved articles were searched.

Study Selection

Two reviewers screened and selected cohort studies that measured thyroid function and then followed persons prospectively to assess CHD or mortality.

Data Extraction

By using a standardized protocol and forms, 2 reviewers independently abstracted and assessed studies.

Data Synthesis

Ten of 12 identified studies involved population-based cohorts that included 14 449 participants. All 10 population-based cohort studies examined risks associated with subclinical hypothyroidism (2134 CHD events and 2822 deaths), whereas only 5 examined risks associated with subclinical hyperthyroidism (1392 CHD events and 1993 deaths). In a random-effects model, the relative risk (RR) for subclinical hypothyroidism for CHD was 1.20 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.49; P for heterogeneity = 0.14; I(2) = 33.4%). Risk estimates were lower when higher-quality studies were pooled (RR, 1.02 to 1.08) and were higher among participants younger than 65 years (RR, 1.51 [CI, 1.09 to 2.09] for studies with mean participant age < 65 years and 1.05 [CI, 0.90 to 1.22] for studies with mean participant age ≥ 65 years). The RR was 1.18 (CI, 0.98 to 1.42) for cardiovascular mortality and 1.12 (CI, 0.99 to 1.26) for total mortality. For subclinical hyperthyroidism, the RR was 1.21 (CI, 0.88 to 1.68) for CHD, 1.19 (CI, 0.81 to 1.76) for cardiovascular mortality, and 1.12 (CI, 0.89 to 1.42) for total mortality (P for heterogeneity > 0.50; I(2) = 0% for all studies).

Limitations

Individual studies adjusted for different potential confounders, and 1 study provided only unadjusted data. Publication bias or selective reporting of outcomes could not be excluded.

Conclusion

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism may be associated with a modest increased risk for CHD and mortality, with lower risk estimates when pooling higher-quality studies and larger CIs for subclinical hyperthyroidism.

### The thyroid – too much and too little across the ages. the consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^112BNBRM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Mild thyroid dysfunction is common, and more prevalent than overt hyper- and hypothyroidism. Subclinical (mild) thyroid dysfunction is a biochemical entity characterized by an abnormality of serum TSH associated with normal serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is thus defined as low or suppressed serum TSH with normal serum-free T4 and T3, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH with normal circulating T4. These biochemical abnormalities are part of the much wider spectrum of thyroid dysfunction which includes overt hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism, but by no means always indicate underlying thyroid disease. There is much debate about the significance of mild abnormalities of thyroid function in terms of symptoms and potential associations with long-term morbidity and mortality and hence much debate about whether to screen for these abnormalities, and, once identified, whether to treat or monitor, and if so, how? Our knowledge base has increased significantly in recent years, principally because studies of large cohorts have begun to define the epidemiology and associations of mild thyroid dysfunction (including short-term and long-term outcomes) and a small but increasing number of randomized-controlled intervention studies have been reported. There is, however, much to learn about these disorders and, given their prevalence, their impact on health.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^112mMkjF]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — when to treat (Recommendation 73): When thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is persistently < 0.1 mU/L, treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is recommended in all individuals ≥ 65 years of age; in patients with cardiac risk factors, heart disease or osteoporosis; in postmenopausal women who are not on estrogens or bisphosphonates; and in individuals with hyperthyroid symptoms. Strength is given as strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

### Hyperthyroidism (primary) [^113fcbvn]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperthyroidism is characterised by high levels of serum thyroxine and triiodothyronine, and low levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone. The main causes of hyperthyroidism are Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goitre, and toxic adenoma. About 20 times more women than men have hyperthyroidism.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments for primary hyperthyroidism? What are the effects of surgical treatments for primary hyperthyroidism? What are the effects of treatments for subclinical hyperthyroidism? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 15 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: adding thyroxine to antithyroid drugs (carbimazole, propylthiouracil, and thiamazole), antithyroid drugs (carbimazole, propylthiouracil, and thiamazole), radioactive iodine, and thyroidectomy.

### Screening for subclinical thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant adults: a summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^113M5vsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is a risk factor for developing symptomatic thyroid disease. Advocates of screening argue that early treatment can prevent serious morbidity in individuals who are found to have laboratory evidence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

Purpose

This article focuses on whether it is useful to order a thyroid function test for patients who have no history of thyroid disease and have few or no signs or symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search, supplemented by searches of EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, reference lists, and a local database of thyroid-related articles.

Study Selection

Controlled treatment studies that used thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels as an inclusion criterion and reported quality of life, symptoms, or lipid level outcomes were selected. Observational studies of the prevalence, progression, and consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction were also reviewed.

Data Extraction

The quality of each trial was assessed by using preset criteria, and information about setting, patients, interventions, and outcomes was abstracted.

Data Synthesis

The prevalence of unsuspected thyroid disease is lowest in men and highest in older women. Evidence regarding the efficacy of treatment in patients found by screening to have subclinical thyroid dysfunction is inconclusive. No trials of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism have been done. Several small, randomized trials of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism have been done, but the results are inconclusive except in patients who have a history of treatment of Graves disease, a subgroup that is not a target of screening in the general population. Data on the adverse effects of broader use of L-thyroxine are sparse.

Conclusion

It is uncertain whether treatment will improve quality of life in otherwise healthy patients who have abnormal TSH levels and normal free thyroxine levels.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VuYHN]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis investigating both subclinical and overt hyperthyroidism and its association with clinical depression in the general population. We found a statistically significant association of hyperthyroidism and depression, with small confidence as well as prediction intervals indicating a robust effect. The results are supported by a variety of subgroup as well as sensitivity analyses and by low heterogeneity. Therefore, even though fewer studies have been carried out on hyper- than on hypothyroidism (OR: 1.30 [1.08–1.57]), we consider the evidence of an association with clinical depression and the effect itself marginally stronger in hyperthyroidism (OR 1.67 [1.49–1.87]).

These findings challenge earlier research on hyperthyroidism and depression: Wildisen et al. for example, reported no relevant effect of subclinical hyperthyroidism on BDI-scores. However, they did not analyse patients with overt hyperthyroidism. Of note, more in line with Wildisen and co-authors' study, our results point to a weaker, if any, association of subclinical hyperthyroidism with clinical depression than in overt hyperthyroidism.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — how to treat if chosen (Recommendation 77): If SH is to be treated, the treatment should be based on the etiology of the thyroid dysfunction and follow the same principles as outlined for the treatment of overt hyperthyroidism (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Supporting text notes that the treatment of SH is similar to overt hyperthyroidism, that RAI is appropriate for most patients, especially in older patients when TMNG is a frequent cause of SH, and that there are no data to inform whether elderly patients would benefit from pretreatment with ATDs before RAI, with the risks of ATD therapy potentially outweighing any small benefit.

### Association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and fracture risk [^114FPNfM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study extends the evidence of an independent association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and fracture risk to a community-based, middle-aged cohort of White and Black individuals, identifying a higher-risk group that is relevant to guidelines focused on the screening and monitoring of patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism to prevent bone mineral disease. We also found that, among those with normal free thyroxine levels, those with suppressed thyrotropin levels have a significantly increased risk of fracture-related hospitalization, providing novel epidemiologic evidence that thyrotropin level may play an independent role in bone density and the risk of fracture. Longitudinal studies measuring thyroid function levels at more than 1 time point are needed to further examine the association of the trajectory of thyroid function with subsequent risk of fracture. Clinical trials are needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which subclinical thyroid dysfunction may be associated with fractures and other clinical outcomes.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### Subclinical thyroid dysfunction and the risk for fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111osTcw]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Data on the association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and fractures conflict.

Purpose

To assess the risk for hip and nonspine fractures associated with subclinical thyroid dysfunction among prospective cohorts.

Data Sources

Search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (1946 to 16 March 2014) and reference lists of retrieved articles without language restriction.

Study Selection

Two physicians screened and identified prospective cohorts that measured thyroid function and followed participants to assess fracture outcomes.

Data Extraction

One reviewer extracted data using a standardized protocol, and another verified data. Both reviewers independently assessed methodological quality of the studies.

Data Synthesis

The 7 population-based cohorts of heterogeneous quality included 50,245 participants with 1966 hip and 3281 nonspine fractures. In random-effects models that included the 5 higher-quality studies, the pooled adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of participants with subclinical hyperthyroidism versus euthyrodism were 1.38 (95% CI, 0.92 to 2.07) for hip fractures and 1.20 (CI, 0.83 to 1.72) for nonspine fractures without statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.82 and 0.52, respectively; I2 = 0%). Pooled estimates for the 7 cohorts were 1.26 (CI, 0.96 to 1.65) for hip fractures and 1.16 (CI, 0.95 to 1.42) for nonspine fractures. When thyroxine recipients were excluded, the HRs for participants with subclinical hyperthyroidism were 2.16 (CI, 0.87 to 5.37) for hip fractures and 1.43 (CI, 0.73 to 2.78) for nonspine fractures. For participants with subclinical hypothyroidism, HRs from higher-quality studies were 1.12 (CI, 0.83 to 1.51) for hip fractures and 1.04 (CI, 0.76 to 1.42) for nonspine fractures (P for heterogeneity = 0.69 and 0.88, respectively; I2 = 0%).

Limitations

Selective reporting cannot be excluded. Adjustment for potential common confounders varied and was not adequately done across all studies.

Conclusion

Subclinical hyperthyroidism might be associated with an increased risk for hip and nonspine fractures, but additional large, high-quality studies are needed.

### Hyperthyroidism and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [^116jer86]. Thyroid (2002). Low credibility.

Hyperthyroidism is a common disorder affecting multiple systems in the body. The cardiovascular effects are among the most striking. The availability of effective treatments for hyperthyroidism has led to the widespread perception that it is a reversible disorder without any long-term consequences. Recent evidence suggests, however, that there may be adverse outcomes. Long-term follow-up studies have revealed increased mortality from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in those with a past history of overt hyperthyroidism treated with radioiodine, as well as those with subclinical hyperthyroidism. Thyroid hormones are known to exert direct effects on the myocardium, as well as the systemic vasculature and predispose to dysrhythmias, especially supraventricular. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a recognized complication of overt hyperthyroidism, and subclinical hyperthyroidism is also known to be a risk factor for development of AF. Supraventricular dysrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation, in older patients may account for some of the excess cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality described, especially because AF is known to predispose to embolic phenomena.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — osteoporosis and fracture outcomes: Most studies show decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, but not in men or premenopausal women. In the largest individual study, the hazard rate for all major osteoporotic fractures was 1.13 (confidence intervals 1.014–1.26), with risk increasing over time such that after a median follow-up of 7.5 years, 13.5% with low TSH had at least one major osteoporotic fracture versus 6.9% with normal TSH. A participant-level meta-analysis found hazard ratios of 1.36 for hip fractures (4.9 fractures per 1000 person-years) and 1.28 for any fractures (14.4 vs. 11.2 per 1000 person-years), with risks further increased when TSH was < 0.1 mIU/L compared to 0.1–0.44 mIU/L and for endogenous SH.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism and cardiovascular disease [^116zi9e7]. Thyroid (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: In this narrative review, we assess published data on subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCHyper) and its association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population. Summary: We present data on the risk of SCHyper in relation to CVD outcomes, including atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), major adverse cardiac events (MACE), CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality. Evidence indicates that SCHyper is associated with an elevated risk of AF, heart failure, MACE, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality. SCHyper appears to have little association with stroke risk and has shown conflicting results regarding CHD risk. Regarding the degree of serum TSH suppression, evidence shows a higher risk of CVD in SCHyper individuals with suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mIU/L) compared with those with low TSH (0.1–0.4 mIU/L). Despite evidence that older individuals are inherently at a higher risk for CVD, no studies have yet demonstrated an age-related increase in the relative risk of CVD in SCHyper. Conclusion: The studies indicate that SCHyper is associated with an increased risk of AF, heart failure, MACE, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality. Considering the importance of the degree of serum TSH suppression and age as risk factors for CVD, treatment decisions should be individualized based on their specific risk factors.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: when to consider treatment [^112DJd5K]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (e.g., in Graves disease, toxic nodular goiter, or transient thyroiditis), by administration of thyroid hormone to treat malignant thyroid disease, or by unintentional excessive replacement therapy. The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism in the general population is about 1% to 2%; however, it may be higher in iodinedeficient areas. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels less than 0.1 mIU per L than in persons with low but detectable thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and heart failure in older adults, increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and decreased bone mineral density and increased bone fracture risk in postmenopausal women. However, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unclear. A possible association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality-of-life parameters and cognition is controversial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons. The American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend treating patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels less than 0.1 mIU per L if they are older than 65 years or have comorbidities such as heart disease or osteoporosis.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: a review of the clinical literature [^117EwFyN]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCHyper) is a biochemical diagnosis characterized by a decreased serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and normal serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations. Because SCHyper can be resolved, it is recommended to repeat serum TSH, T3, and T4 concentrations in 3 to 6 months before confirming a diagnosis of SCHyper to consider treatment. Proposed grading systems distinguish between mild (TSH, 0.1–0.4 mIU/L) and severe SCHyper (TSH, < 0.1 mIU/L) and are used alongside patients' age and the presence of risk factors and symptoms to guide treatment. Appropriate evaluation includes an investigation of the underlying cause and assessment of an individual's risk factors to determine the necessity and type of treatment that may be recommended. SCHyper may be associated with increased risks of cardiovascular-related adverse outcomes, bone loss, and in some studies, cognitive decline. Treatment may include observation without therapy, initiation of antithyroid medications, or pursuit of radioiodine therapy or thyroid surgery. Considerations for treatment include the SCHyper etiology, anticipated long-term natural history of the condition, potential benefits of correcting the thyroid dysfunction, and risks and benefits of each treatment option. The purpose of this overview is to provide a guide for clinicians in evaluating and managing SCHyper in the routine clinical practice.

### Subclinical thyroid dysfunction and fracture risk: a meta-analysis [^112xhF7b]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Associations between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and fractures are unclear and clinical trials are lacking.

Objective

To assess the association of subclinical thyroid dysfunction with hip, nonspine, spine, or any fractures.

Data Sources and Study Selection

The databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE (inception to March 26, 2015) were searched without language restrictions for prospective cohort studies with thyroid function data and subsequent fractures.

Data Extraction

Individual participant data were obtained from 13 prospective cohorts in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Japan. Levels of thyroid function were defined as euthyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], 0.45–4.49 mIU/L), subclinical hyperthyroidism (TSH < 0.45 mIU/L), and subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH ≥ 4.50–19.99 mIU/L) with normal thyroxine concentrations.

Main Outcome and Measures

The primary outcome was hip fracture. Any fractures, nonspine fractures, and clinical spine fractures were secondary outcomes.

Results

Among 70,298 participants, 4092 (5.8%) had subclinical hypothyroidism and 2219 (3.2%) had subclinical hyperthyroidism. During 762,401 person-years of follow-up, hip fracture occurred in 2975 participants (4.6%; 12 studies), any fracture in 2528 participants (9.0%; 8 studies), nonspine fracture in 2018 participants (8.4%; 8 studies), and spine fracture in 296 participants (1.3%; 6 studies). In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, the hazard ratio (HR) for subclinical hyperthyroidism vs euthyroidism was 1.36 for hip fracture (95% CI, 1.13–1.64; 146 events in 2082 participants vs 2534 in 56,471); for any fracture, HR was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.06–1.53; 121 events in 888 participants vs 2203 in 25,901); for nonspine fracture, HR was 1.16 (95% CI, 0.95–1.41; 107 events in 946 participants vs 1745 in 21,722); and for spine fracture, HR was 1.51 (95% CI, 0.93–2.45; 17 events in 732 participants vs 255 in 20,328). Lower TSH was associated with higher fracture rates: for TSH of less than 0.10 mIU/L, HR was 1.61 for hip fracture (95% CI, 1.21–2.15; 47 events in 510 participants); for any fracture, HR was 1.98 (95% CI, 1.41–2.78; 44 events in 212 participants); for nonspine fracture, HR was 1.61 (95% CI, 0.96–2.71; 32 events in 185 participants); and for spine fracture, HR was 3.57 (95% CI, 1.88–6.78; 8 events in 162 participants). Risks were similar after adjustment for other fracture risk factors. Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism (excluding thyroid medication users) was associated with HRs of 1.52 (95% CI, 1.19–1.93) for hip fracture, 1.42 (95% CI, 1.16–1.74) for any fracture, and 1.74 (95% CI, 1.01–2.99) for spine fracture. No association was found between subclinical hypothyroidism and fracture risk.

Conclusions and Relevance

Subclinical hyperthyroidism was associated with an increased risk of hip and other fractures, particularly among those with TSH levels of less than 0.10 mIU/L and those with endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism. Further study is needed to determine whether treating subclinical hyperthyroidism can prevent fractures.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^111yYVBa]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — mortality and cardiovascular outcomes show increased risks associated with SH. An individual-level meta-analysis concluded that SH confers a 24% increased risk of overall mortality. Cardiovascular mortality is increased, with hazard ratios of 1.52 and 1.29 from two meta-analyses, and the risk was greater with TSH < 0.1 mU/L compared with 0.1–0.4 mU/L. A large cohort of 26,707 people followed for 12 years also reported increased cardiovascular mortality with SH, and SH subjects appear to be at particular risk for heart failure, especially older subjects and those with lower TSH levels.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114Zketr]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — observation is acceptable for asymptomatic patients under age 65 without cardiac disease or osteoporosis, who can be observed without further investigation of the etiology of the subnormal TSH or treatment (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In this range, treatment should be considered for older subjects, but it is not recommended for subjects < 65 years of age; younger subjects should be monitored at regular 6- to 12-month intervals, and treatment should be considered if the TSH persistently decreases to < 0.1 mU/L. In patients with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, a trial of β-adrenergic blocking agents may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

### Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113F4XUq]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

To account for differences in study settings and methodology we used random effects analyses (DerSimonian & Laird). Statistical heterogeneity is reported as I 2 statistic and Tau (τ). We assessed publication bias in funnel plots and Egger's test and estimated the role of missing studies in trim-and-fill-analyses. Prediction intervals were calculated to account for the heterogeneity between studies. We conducted leave-one-out analyses if forest plots indicated a disproportionate effect of single studies. All calculations have been carried out in Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) Version 3 and R, using the packages meta and metafor.

Primary outcome analysis

The primary outcome is the association of hyperthyroidism and clinical depression. We compared depression prevalence of patients with versus without hyperthyroidism and expressed the results as odds ratio (OR) ± 95% confidence interval (CI). If studies reported effects as risk ratio (RR) or hazard ratio (HR), we transformed these effects into ORs (Supplementary Methods). If studies reported multiple differently adjusted effect sizes, we included those with minimum adjustment to be as coherent as possible with unadjusted or self-calculated effect sizes. The analysis includes all studies reporting results for overt and/or subclinical hyperthyroidism. If a study reported effects for both, only results for overt hyperthyroidism were included to maintain independence. Calculations and formulae are listed in the supplementary information (Supplementary Methods).

Subgroup analyses

We subdivided hyperthyroidism into both its overt and subclinical form, as defined in the studies included, and stratified our primary analyses by gender, risk of bias, intake of thyroid medication, a core group of strictly population-based studies, and assessment of depression. To minimize bias, the subgroup analysis investigating gender-specific effects was conducted only on studies that reported effects for both genders. All of the above stratifications were also repeated in the subgroup analyses of overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism.

Post hoc analyses

We compared studies on older populations (age ≥ 60 years) with studies on subjects of all ages to detect age-specific trends. To compare the effects of hyperthyroidism with those of hypothyroidism, we selected studies reporting an effect for both thyroid disorders and analysed them separately.

### A clinical and therapeutic approach to thyrotoxicosis with thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression only [^116xmsiu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as normal serum free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations and persistently suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. The most common cause of subclinical hyperthyroidism is the use of suppressive doses of L-thyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism or, less commonly, diffuse nontoxic goiter or thyroid carcinoma (exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism). Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism may be caused by a variety of thyroid disorders that result in overproduction and release of thyroid hormones from the gland with normal/high 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake or by inflammation in the thyroid resulting in release of excess thyroid hormones and low 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake. Several groups have investigated whether persistent endogenous or exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, like overt hyperthyroidism, causes symptoms, adverse effects on the cardiovascular and the skeletal systems, and increased mortality, whether endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism evolves to overt thyrotoxicosis, and whether or not it should be treated. The present report reviews the most important and recent studies of subclinical hyperthyroidism and attempts to draw conclusions based upon the literature and the authors' experience.

While this can be understood as a sign for a stronger effect of hyperthyroidism on depression than vice versa, the analysis was only based on three cohort studies and therefore has to be regarded as preliminary.

A key feature of the present study is its focus on clinical depression. As a result, we may have missed subtle changes in psychopathology. However, not only was there no indication of such an effect in Wildisen and co-authors' study, but in searching for differences in low and subclinical score ranges lies the risk of inflating small findings of doubtful clinical relevance. The problem of employing subclinical phenomena works also in thyroid parameters: Williams et al. in their early meta-analysis, took into account the full range of thyroid hormones, physiological and pathological alike. Interestingly, however, even with their very broad approach they arrived at no stronger association than the one in the present study.

At the same time, relying on clinical data derived only from routine examinations in outpatient clinics for mood or metabolism disorders introduces selection bias, hence our restriction to epidemiological studies. In our view, therefore, the OR presented in this study represents a conservative estimate of the association. Since the effect we estimated is moderate it is worth noting that relatively small effect sizes are common in medicine, even in established biomarkers.

With regard to clinical practice, our results suggest that heightened awareness of depression is justified in patients with hyperthyroidism, as is TSH screening among patients with depression. In distinction to our analysis of hypothyroidism and depression — where the observed ORs were 0.71 [0.40–1.25] and 1.48 [1.18–1.85] for men and women respectively — we did not find a clear-cut gender differential, although men with hyperthyroidism were slightly more affected by clinical depression than women. In fact, for women, our results are inconclusive, as the confidence interval includes a null effect. This applies all the more to the findings regarding women with subclinical hyperthyroidism where no association is apparent. Of note, the data were not sufficient for a subgroup analysis on ethnic differences indicating a need for future research.

### Subclinical thyroid dysfunction and cardiovascular diseases: 2016 update [^1145ew69]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction comprises subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo), defined as elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) by normal free thyroxine (FT4), and subclinical hyperthyroidism (SHyper) with decreased or undetectable TSH and normal FT4. Up to 10% of the elderly have SHypo, which is usually asymptomatic. Individual participant data (IPD) analyses of prospective cohort studies from the international Thyroid Studies Collaboration show that SHypo is associated with increased coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1,58 for TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, 95% CI 1.10–2.27), as well as increased risk of stroke, and heart failure (HF) for both higher and lower TSH. Small studies found that SHypo affects carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), diastolic function, peripheral vascular resistance, endothelial function, and lipid profile. SHyper is associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.16–2.43) and CHD events (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.99–1.46). The TSH threshold for initiating treatment is unclear. In the absence of large randomized controlled trials, the best evidence suggests SHypo therapy should be started at TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, and SHyper therapy at TSH < 0.1 mIU/L. Recommendations on screening are discordant, but most guidelines advocate that thyroid function should be checked in those at risk for hypothyroidism, those over 60, and those with known CHD and HF. This review updates current evidence on the association between thyroid dysfunction and cardiovascular disease, as well as on screening and treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

### Thyroid status, cardiovascular risk, and mortality in older adults [^1157D6oW]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Previous studies have suggested that subclinical abnormalities in thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are associated with detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system.

Objective

To determine the relationship between baseline thyroid status and incident atrial fibrillation, incident cardiovascular disease, and mortality in older men and women not taking thyroid medication.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A total of 3233 US community-dwelling individuals aged 65 years or older with baseline serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were enrolled in 1989–1990 in the Cardiovascular Health Study, a large, prospective cohort study.

Main Outcome Measures

Incident atrial fibrillation, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular death, and all-cause death assessed through June 2002. Analyses are reported for 4 groups defined according to thyroid function test results: subclinical hyperthyroidism, euthyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, and overt hypothyroidism.

Results

Individuals with overt thyrotoxicosis (n = 4) were excluded because of small numbers. Eighty-two percent of participants (n = 2639) had normal thyroid function, 15% (n = 496) had subclinical hypothyroidism, 1.6% (n = 51) had overt hypothyroidism, and 1.5% (n = 47) had subclinical hyperthyroidism. After exclusion of those with prevalent atrial fibrillation, individuals with subclinical hyperthyroidism had a greater incidence of atrial fibrillation compared with those with normal thyroid function (67 events vs 31 events per 1000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.29–3.03). No differences were seen between the subclinical hyperthyroidism group and euthyroidism group for incident coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular death, or all-cause death. Likewise, there were no differences between the subclinical hypothyroidism or overt hypothyroidism groups and the euthyroidism group for cardiovascular outcomes or mortality. Specifically, individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism had an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.07 (95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.28) for incident coronary heart disease.

Conclusion

Our data show an association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and development of atrial fibrillation but do not support the hypothesis that unrecognized subclinical hyperthyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with other cardiovascular disorders or mortality.

### Approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism [^116z1K3j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined by normal circulating levels of free T4 and T3 and low levels of TSH, is a common clinical entity and is typically caused by the same conditions that account for the majority of cases of overt hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and mortality, decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, and mild hyperthyroid symptoms. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism remains controversial, given the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials showing clinical benefit with restoration of the euthyroid state. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to treat older individuals whose serum TSH levels are less than 0.1 mU/liter and certain high-risk patients, even when the serum TSH is between 0.1 and the lower limit of the normal range.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112PqCVC]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — management options, monitoring, and goals: The treatment of SH is similar to the treatment of overt hyperthyroidism, with radioactive iodine appropriate for most patients, especially in older patients when TMNG is a frequent cause of SH, while long-term antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy is a reasonable alternative in patients with GD and SH, especially in younger patients. Some patients with SH due to GD may remit spontaneously so observation without therapy is reasonable for younger patients; a small subset of elderly patients with persistently low TSH and no evidence of true thyroid dysfunction can be followed without intervention, particularly when serum FT4 estimate and T3 are in the lower half of normal. Treatment with beta-adrenergic blockade may be sufficient to control cardiovascular-related morbidity, especially atrial fibrillation. Technical remarks state that some patients with SH due to mild GD may be followed without therapy with frequent (every 3 months) monitoring of thyroid function; in select SH due to TMNG with compressive symptoms or concern for malignancy, surgery is also an option; and the goal of therapy for SH is to render the patient euthyroid with a normal TSH. Data cited note stabilization or improvement in bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with SH treated, and reports of improvement in hyperthyroid symptoms with antithyroid drug therapy and after beta-adrenergic blockade.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — causes and retesting guidance indicate that in clinical series, TMNG is the most common cause of SH, especially in older persons, and the second most common cause is Graves' disease (GD), which is more prevalent in younger persons and is also common in those who previously received antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy; other causes include solitary autonomously functioning nodules and various forms of thyroiditis. For monitoring, in patients at high risk of complications from SH, TSH and free T4 should be repeated within 2–6 weeks, and for all other patients the serum TSH should be repeated at 3–6 months prior to initiating therapy.

### Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism and incident atrial fibrillation [^113RGFRm]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Additional limitations include the small sample size and small number of events despite screening over 2000 patients, the single‐centre and retrospective design. Reference ranges for thyroid function tests changed over time, creating heterogeneity, particularly posing challenges with our subgroup analysis based on thyroid function tests. Moreover, given our methodology followed an intention‐to‐treat approach, we did not examine whether and how long after the start of treatment euthyroidism was established in each participant. In clinical practice, those treated for hyperthyroidism or SH may not consistently develop and maintain euthyroidism. Avoiding the exclusion of those with abnormal thyroid function tests mimics the real clinical scenario more closely. Finally, insufficient clinical information was available for 420 of the patients with SH within the hospital EMRs. This may represent a selection bias as patients whose SH might have been addressed outside of the main academic hospitals were excluded.

Our findings though not conclusive, along with similar recently published literature, suggest that treatment of SH to prevent AF should be considered, particularly in those with AF risk factors. We also showed that patients with SH secondary to toxic nodules are more likely to develop AF and, therefore, the aetiology of SH should be considered when deciding on treatment. Finally, TSH and FT4 levels may be factored into decisions regarding SH treatment. Our results support the need for a larger prospective study, ideally a randomized trial, assessing the effect of SH treatment in preventing AF. Additional questions raised by this research include whether early versus delayed approach to treatment of SH would make a difference in the incidence of AF and whether unique patient and disease characteristics would allow for active surveillance of patients with SH with minimal risk of developing AF.

### The effects of thyrotropin-suppressive therapy on bone metabolism in patients with well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma [^114g33Nx]. Thyroid (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) are commonly treated long-term with thyrotropin (TSH)- suppressive thyroxine replacement therapy resolving in a state of subclinical hyperthyroidism. The relationship between subclinical hyperthyroidism and osteoporosis is not clear. In this review, we systematically selected and analyzed 21 studies addressing this issue. Although multiple methodological differences between studies prevented a structured meta-analysis, our data suggest that postmenopausal women with subclinical hyperthyroidism are most at risk, whereas no increased risk was observed in men and premenopausal women. Based on these findings we believe that measurement of bone mineral density is recommended in postmenopausal women with DTC starting TSH suppressive therapy. This should be subsequently regularly measured to enable timely intervention with bone protective agents.

### A deeper understanding of the causal relationships between thyroid function and atrial fibrillation [^114jB992]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

This should be taken into account when weighing potential benefits and drawbacks of treating subclinical variations in thyroid function. Since well-powered randomized controlled trials will require a long follow-up period and a large group of participants to detect the effects of minor variations in thyroid function on long-term complications such as AF risk, the data on causality derived from MR studies are likely to be the only relevant data available in the near future. For the height-independent part of the effects of thyroid function on AF, future studies should clarify whether a certain deviation in thyroid function due to inherited genetic variants (lifetime exposure) has the same effect on AF risk as a similar nongenetically determined (more sudden) shift in thyroid function.

In conclusion, the study by Shi et al. illustrates how a high-quality MR study followed by comprehensive sensitivity analyses and an in-depth critical analysis of findings can be a valuable and effective tool that not only allows to assess causality, but also improves our understanding of underlying modifiable and nonmodifiable pathways, with potential clinical implications. Given the pleiotropic nature of many other hormones, similar robust approaches should also be used in other endocrine fields.

### What is the association of hypothyroidism with risks of cardiovascular events and mortality? A meta-analysis of 55 cohort studies involving 1, 898, 314 participants [^116RDuug]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid hormones have wide effects on the body and play an important role in homeostasis of the cardiovascular system. Abnormal thyroid function has health consequences for the general public. Patients with hypothyroidism have an increased risk of cardiovascular abnormalities, such as accelerated atherosclerosis.

Whether hypothyroidism ("hypothyroidism" refers to the combination of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and overt hypothyroidism (OHypo) in this article), SCH or OHypo, is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events or mortality has conflicting opinions. It is also conflicting whether adults with hypothyroidism and preexisting cardiovascular disease might be at particularly high cardiovascular risk. Although there have been meta-analyses and even individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses on the subject so far, they have been restricted to patients with SCH. Moreover, many additional cohort studies have been published since. Therefore, a comprehensive updated meta-analysis is warranted.

### Association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and fracture risk [^116LKjbJ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this community-based cohort study of more than 10 000 participants, we found a statistically significant association between subclinical hyperthyroidism at baseline and fracture-related hospitalization but no evidence for an association between subclinical hypothyroidism and fracture-related hospitalization. In continuous analyses of thyrotropin levels, we found a significant risk of fracture-related hospitalization for suppressed levels of thyrotropin, even among those with normal free thyroxine levels. This study provides clinical insight into the management of subclinical thyroid dysfunction, for which there is currently insufficient evidence, to our knowledge.

Our observation of an association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and fracture risk is consistent with the literature. In a meta-analysis, Blum et alpooled individual participant data from 13 prospective cohort studies comprising 70 289 participants who had a median age of 64 years, were predominantly White, and had a median follow-up of 12 years. This study reported that subclinical hyperthyroidism was associated with a pooled relative risk of 1.28 (95% CI, 1.06–1.53) for all fractures, after adjustment for age and sex. In addition, no association was found between subclinical hypothyroidism and risk of fracture. Our study extends these findings to a younger, community-based cohort that included both Black and White participants, included extensive adjustment for potential confounders, and had a longer follow-up period (median follow-up of 21 years vs 12 years).

Our study found that suppressed thyrotropin levels were significantly associated with fracture risk among those with normal free thyroxine levels. Fracture-related hospitalization was highest for those with mildly to severely suppressed thyrotropin levels (< 0.56 mIU/L). Further research is needed to confirm our findings and to better understand the biological mechanism by which subclinical thyroid dysfunction is associated with bone health. Those with mildly suppressed thyrotropin levels (0.1 mIU/L to < 0.56 mIU/L) may benefit from being identified as a high-risk group through more aggressive screening. It also supports the existing recommendation, which is to treat all patients 65 years of age or older with subclinical hyperthyroidism when the thyrotropin level is persistently lower than 0.1 mIU/L for the prevention of bone mineral disease. Furthermore, it argues for a potential need for closer monitoring of those with a thyrotropin level between 0.1 and 0.56 mIU/L to prevent bone resorption.

### Associations between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and cardiovascular risk factors according to age and sex [^114VxcjC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction (ScTD) is defined by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside and free thyroxine (fT4) concentrations within their respective reference ranges; women are more likely to have ScTD — especially elevated TSH — than men. Both subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo) and subclinical hyperthyroidism (SHyper) are linked to higher risk of coronary heart disease and associated mortality. Although risk of ScTD and coronary heart disease both increase with age, the excess risk of coronary heart disease in those with ScTD does not increase with advancing age.

SHypo has been associated with several modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia, which may even extend to variations in the euthyroid range, but these associations have been inconsistent in studies using population-based data. SHyper has not been associated with hypertension, but the underlying body of data is scarce. Overall, there is scarcity with regard to clinical trials on ScTD. Robust data on SHypo were published in an analysis focusing on the older population. SHypo is often treated with levothyroxine, but its effect on cardiovascular events and mortality is uncertain, since even the largest randomized controlled trial yet conducted on this topic was underpowered to assess cardiovascular events.

As there have been few large multinational analyses of the association between ScTD and cardiovascular risk factors, we worked within the Thyroid Studies Collaboration to pool individual participant data across large prospective cohort studies on multiple continents. To determine if this population with ScTD was at increased risk of cardiovascular events, we identified the cardiovascular risk factors most prevalent in these patients and then determined whether these associations varied by age, sex, or TSH levels.

### Effect of TSH suppression therapy on bone mineral density in differentiated thyroid cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Ej7Gc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Because subclinical hyperthyroidism increases the risk of osteoporosis and fractures, concerns are growing about the long-term skeletal safety of TSH suppression therapy after total thyroidectomy in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).

Objective

We aimed to determine the effect of TSH suppression therapy on bone mineral density (BMD) in DTC patients.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, and other sources. Eligible observational studies included DTC patients who underwent TSH suppression therapy and BMD measurement. Two independent reviewers extracted data on the studies' characteristics and outcomes and determined their risk of bias. Data were extracted from each study for postmenopausal/premenopausal women's and men's lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), and total hip (TH) BMD and summed using a random-effects meta-analysis model. The weighted mean differences with 95% CIs are expressed for the differences in outcome measurements between groups.

Results

Seventeen studies (739 patients and 1085 controls) were included for quantitative analysis. In postmenopausal women, TSH suppression therapy showed a significant decrease in LS BMD (-0.03; -0.05, -0.02), and a similar trend was seen in TH. In premenopausal women, TSH suppression therapy significantly increased LS BMD (0.04; 0.02, 0.06) and FN BMD (0.02; 0.01, 0.04). In men, there was no significant association between TSH suppression therapy and BMD at any site compared with the controls.

Conclusion

Evidence from observational studies suggests that postmenopausal women treated with TSH suppression therapy are at risk for lower BMD. Attention should be paid to long-term skeletal safety in DTC survivors.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a risk factor for poor functional outcome after ischemic stroke [^116cMcvT]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with adverse cardiovascular events, including stroke and atrial fibrillation. However, its impact on functional outcome after stroke remains unexplored.

Methods

A total of 165 consecutively recruited patients admitted for ischemic stroke were included in this observational prospective study. Blood samples were taken in the morning within 3 days after symptom onset, and patients were divided into the following 3 groups: subclinical hyperthyroidism (0.1 < thyroid-stimulating hormone ≤ 0.44 μU/mL), subclinical hypothyroidism (2.5 ≤ thyroid-stimulating hormone < 20 μU/mL), and euthyroid state (0.44 < thyroid-stimulating hormone < 2.5 μU/mL). Patients with overt thyroid dysfunction were excluded. Follow-up took place 3 months after stroke. Primary outcome was functional disability (modified Rankin Scale), and secondary outcome was level of dependency (Barthel Index). Ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for possible confounders. Variables previously reported to be affected by thyroid function, such as atrial fibrillation, total cholesterol, or body mass index, were included in an additional model.

Results

Nineteen patients (11.5%) had subclinical hyperthyroidism, and 23 patients (13.9%) had subclinical hypothyroidism. Patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism had a substantially increased risk of functional disability 3 months after stroke compared with subjects with euthyroid state (odds ratio, 2.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–6.82, adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and time of blood sampling). The association remained significant, when including the baseline NIHSS, TIA, serum CRP, atrial fibrillation, body mass index, and total cholesterol as additional variables (odds ratio, 3.95; 95% confidence interval, 1.25–12.47), and was confirmed by the secondary outcome (Barthel Index: odds ratio, 9.12; 95% confidence interval, 2.08–39.89).

Conclusions

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a risk factor for poor outcome 3 months after ischemic stroke.

### Prognostic role and relationship of thyroid dysfunction and lipid profile in hospitalized heart failure patients [^1138rHh9]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Both overt and subclinical hypothyroidism are associated with several cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, accelerated atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease, the previous studies aimed to examine the prognostic role of low thyroid hormones in patients hospitalized for HF have produced conflicting results. A meta‐analysis of 21 221 patients with HF from 14 studies demonstrated that subclinical hypothyroidism could increase the risk of both all‐cause mortality and cardiac death and/or hospitality in HF patients. Selmer et al.found reduced all‐cause mortality in subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH levels of 5–10 mLU/L) with no increase in major adverse cardiovascular events, while no effect on all‐cause mortality or cardiovascular events of overt hypothyroidism was observed. A possible explanation of the inconsistent results is the heterogeneity of patients enrolled in terms of HF cause, HF status, sex, age, the level of TSH, and time of thyroid hormone sampling in different studies. In the present study, both overt and subclinical hypothyroidism had independently associated with all‐cause mortality in HF at univariate as well as multivariate analysis, which was in line with a previous study enrolled acute HF with similar baseline characteristics, and this finding was consistent with the recommendations by European Society of Cardiology (ESC) to monitor thyroid hormone levelsand to initiate treatment early in case of overt hypothyroidism. However, the negative effects of subclinical hyperthyroidism were not seen in our study, like previous studies. A possible explanation is that the lower prevalence and the potential positive effects, such as increased contractility and reduced systemic vascular resistance, mitigated the negative effects. Although the negative prognostic effect of overt hyperthyroidism was observed in our study, in consideration of the relatively small samples, further studies with a larger cohort of overt hyperthyroidism in HF patients are urgently needed.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and fracture risk [^114WTUxU]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid dysfunction is a well-established risk factor for bone-related outcomes, including fracture. Elevated levels of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine and thyroxine, in the case of overt hyperthyroidism, accelerate bone resorption without compensatory bone formation, resulting in a net reduction of bone density. Suppressed levels of triiodothyronine and thyroxine, in the case of overt hypothyroidism, are associated with decreased bone resorption and either normal or slightly increased bone mass. It is suggested that the apparent increased risk of fractures for individuals with hypothyroidism could be explained by reduced bone remodeling and renewal, by confounding comorbid conditions, such as obesity or cardiovascular disease, or by neuromuscular complications that are associated with hypothyroidism and could lead to increased risk of bone fracture.

Patients with overt thyroid dysfunction are usually symptomatic, readily diagnosed, and treated according to clinical guidelines: thyroid hormone replacement therapy in the case of overt hypothyroidism and antithyroid medications in the case of overt hyperthyroidism. However, there is no universal agreement on the indications for treating subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

In the general adult population, subclinical hypothyroidism has an estimated prevalence of 12%, whereas subclinical hyperthyroidism is less common, with an estimated prevalence among US adults of approximately 5%. Moreover, subclinical thyroid dysfunction appears to persist as a chronic state for approximately 60% of individuals, and is more prevalent among older adults. The existing literature on the association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and bone-related outcomes has been conflicting. However, a meta-analysis of 13 studies found an independent positive association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and fracture risk. Many of the previous studies have been limited to cohorts of older and predominantly White patients, and they lack information on important confounders and the history of fracture. In addition, several studies included individuals using thyroid medications, thus limiting the literature on endogenous subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

We investigated the association of endogenous subclinical thyroid dysfunction with fracture risk, independent of clinical confounders, in a community-based cohort of middle-aged US adults who self-identified as Black or White. We assessed this association stratified by age, sex, and race.

### Association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and fracture risk [^115CGe1a]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Clinical hyperthyroidism accelerates bone resorption without compensatory bone formation, reducing bone density and increasing the risk of fracture. The association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and fracture risk is less clear.

Objective

To investigate the association of endogenous subclinical thyroid dysfunction and fracture risk, independent of clinical confounders.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included 10 946 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study of community-dwelling individuals conducted from 1987–1989 through December 31, 2019, in Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; and the suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Participants were not taking thyroid medications and had no history of fractures.

Exposures

Thyrotropin and free thyroxine levels were measured at visit 2 (1990–1992). Subclinical hyperthyroidism was defined as a thyrotropin level lower than 0.56 mIU/L, subclinical hypothyroidism as a thyrotropin level higher than 5.1 mIU/L, and euthyroidism as a thyrotropin level of 0.56 to 5.1 mIU/L, with normal free thyroxine levels from 0.85 to 1.4 ng/dL.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incident fracture was ascertained using hospitalization discharge codes through 2019 and linkage to inpatient and outpatient Medicare claims through 2018.

Results

Of 10 946 participants (54.3% women; mean [SD] age, 57 [5.7] years), 93.0% had euthyroidism, 2.6% had subclinical hyperthyroidism, and 4.4% had subclinical hypothyroidism. During a median follow-up of 21 years (IQR, 13.0–27.3 years), there were 3556 incident fractures (167.1 per 10 000 person-years). The adjusted hazard ratios of fracture were 1.34 (95% CI, 1.09–1.65) for those with subclinical hyperthyroidism and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.77–1.05) for those with subclinical hypothyroidism compared with individuals with euthyroidism. Among those with normal free thyroxine levels, thyrotropin levels in the lower-than-normal range were significantly associated with higher fracture-related hospitalization risk; fracture risk was greater among individuals with thyrotropin concentrations below 0.56 mIU/L.

Conclusions and Relevance

This community-based cohort study suggests that subclinical hyperthyroidism was an independent risk factor associated with fracture. The increased risk for fracture among individuals with a thyrotropin level lower than 0.56 mIU/L highlights a potential role for more aggressive screening and monitoring of patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism to prevent bone mineral disease.

### Evaluation of endothelial function in subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism [^116HLt7o]. Thyroid (2004). Low credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are two frequently occurring conditions for which exact therapeutic approaches have not yet been established. The aim of this study was to compare the endothelial function and carotid artery intimae-media thickness (IMT) of these two groups of patients to euthyroid subjects and to assess the effects of these conditions on endothelial function. Study groups comprised of 25 subclinical hypothyroid patients (mean age, 32.28 ± 9.67 years), 13 subclinical hyperthyroid patients (mean age, 35.69 ± 9.67 years), and 23 euthyroid subjects (mean age, 35.87 ± 7.93 years). They were evaluated for flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), and carotid artery IMT. The groups were matched strictly for atherosclerotic risk factors. The subclinical hypothyroid group was found to have significantly lower FMD values. No significant differences were observed between the groups with respect to other vascular parameters. The only discriminative factor between the groups was the state of their thyroid function. Therefore, subclinical hypothyroidism may have adverse effects on endothelial function independent from other well-known atherosclerotic risk factors.

There is limited data concerning the effect of untreated subclinical thyroid disorders on mortality in older adults. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze 5-year overall mortality among participants in the PolSenior study with treated and untreated subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

Design and Methods

The study group consisted of 407 participants with thyroid disorders (305 with hypothyroidism and 102 with hyperthyroidism) and 2776 euthyroid individuals aged 65 years and older. Overall mortality risk factors were assessed with Cox proportional hazard regression. Additionally, overall survival analyses were performed with Kaplan‒Meier estimates stratified by sex and hypo-/hyperthyroidism status.

Results

In women, there was no difference in survival between the euthyroid and hypothyroid groups. Survival was significantly worse in patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism than in euthyroid and treated hyperthyroidism patients. In men, there were no differences in survival between the hyperthyroidism group and the subclinical hypothyroidism or euthyroid group. Notably, survival was better in the treated hypothyroidism group than in the euthyroid group. According to the multivariate models, subclinical hyperthyroidism appeared to be linked to a 30% reduction in survival among women (hazard ratio [HR] for mortality = 1.43; 95% CI = 0.98–2.07, p = 0.06) but not among men.

Conclusions

Our study showed that women with subclinical hyperthyroidism had a higher mortality rate. At the same time, men with treated hypothyroidism had improved survival compared to those in the euthyroid group among participants aged 65 years and older during a 5-year follow-up period. Subclinical hypothyroidism did not influence the survival rates.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^113Ak8pJ]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — treatment of SH should be considered in individuals ≥ 65 years of age and in patients with cardiac disease or symptoms of hyperthyroidism (2/+00). Persistence in this range is defined as a TSH level between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L on repeated measurement over a 3–6-month period; the thyroid disorder underlying SH should be diagnosed to avoid treating transient, functional disorders related to acute illness, drugs, and other causes of low TSH. In symptomatic patients, a trial of beta-adrenergic blockers may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

### Clinical review 142: cardiac dysrhythmias and thyroid dysfunction: the hidden menace? [^112x6Nzh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis is often perceived as a reversible disorder without long-term consequences, perhaps because of the availability of effective treatments, but recent evidence suggests that there may, in fact, be adverse outcomes. Long-term follow-up studies have revealed increased mortality from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in those with a past history of overt hyperthyroidism treated with radioiodine as well as in those with subclinical hyperthyroidism indicated by a low serum TSH concentration. Thyroid hormones exert direct effects on the myocardium as well as the systemic vasculature predisposing to dysrhythmias, especially supraventricular. Effects of thyroid hormones on the autonomic nervous system may also contribute to arrhythmogenesis. Atrial fibrillation is a recognized complication of hyperthyroidism that predisposes to embolic events. Development of atrial fibrillation, together with other supraventricular dysrhythmias (both clinically obvious and those detected only by Holter monitoring) in those with hyperthyroidism may account for increased vascular mortality. Improved detection of supraventricular dysrhythmias and therapeutic intervention (e.g. anticoagulants, antiarrhythmics) may improve the long-term vascular prognosis, but their role remains to be established in large therapeutic trials.

### Reversible diastolic dysfunction after long-term exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism: a randomized, placebo-controlled study [^114nNzVY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been reported to affect systolic and diastolic cardiac function. However, the reversibility of these effects is not well established.

Objective

Our objective was to investigate the presence and reversibility of cardiac abnormalities in patients with long-term exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism.

Design

We conducted a prospective, single-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial of 6 months duration with two parallel groups.

Setting

The study occurred at the Leiden University Medical Center, a tertiary referral center for thyroid carcinoma.

Patients

As a model for subclinical hyperthyroidism, 25 patients with a history of differentiated thyroid carcinoma with more than 10 yr of TSH suppressive therapy with L-T4 were studied.

Interventions

L-T4 dose was replaced by study medication containing L-T4 or placebo. Medication was titrated in a single-blinded fashion to establish continuation of TSH suppression (low-TSH group) or euthyroidism (euthyroid group).

Measurements

We assessed serum levels of free T4 and TSH and used echo Doppler cardiography including tissue Doppler to establish left ventricular (LV) dimensions and function as well as diastolic function. Baseline echocardiography data were compared with 24 controls.

Results

There were no differences in baseline cardiac parameters and TSH levels between the two groups. Although mean LV mass index was increased as compared with 24 controls, only four patients had LV hypertrophy at baseline. This was not improved by restoration of euthyroidism. At baseline, diastolic function was impaired in all patients as indicated by abnormal values for the peak flow of the early filling phase (E, 55.3 ± 9.5 mm/sec), the ratio of E and the peak flow of the atrial filling phase (E/A ratio, 0.87 ± 0.13), the early diastolic velocity obtained by tissue Doppler (E', 5.7 ± 1.3 cm/sec), and the peak atrial filling velocity obtained by tissue Doppler (A', 6.8 ± 1.4 cm/sec), prolonged E deceleration time (234 ± 34 msec), and isovolumetric relaxation time (121 ± 15 msec). After 6 months, significant improvements were observed in the euthyroid group in the E/A ratio (+41%; P < 0.001), E deceleration time (-18%; P = 0.006), isovolumetric relaxation time (-25%; P < 0.001), E' (+31%; P < 0.001), and the E'/A' ratio (+40%; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

We conclude that prolonged subclinical hyperthyroidism is accompanied by diastolic dysfunction that is at least partly reversible after restoration of euthyroidism. Because isolated diastolic dysfunction may be associated with increased mortality, this finding is of clinical significance.

### Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism and incident atrial fibrillation [^117Anuek]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Discussion

We report the first study examining the effect of SH in preventing incident AF. Our findings show an overall trend towards a lower incidence of AF following SH treatment. Despite this trend, no statistical significance was observed. In a subsequent sensitivity analysis, where those diagnosed with AF < 30 days after starting treatment for SH were reassigned to the untreated group, the AF incidence rate was statistically significantly lower in the treated group. The lack of significant difference in the main group was likely related to the small sample size and the influence of new AF on treatment decisions. The respective decrease in AF frequency and incidence from 6.6% to 3.1% and 1.4% to 0.8%/year, following treatment in the main group would be considered clinically important if corroborated by larger studies.

Our results support the previous small studies demonstrating the resolution of AF following the treatment of SH amongst those with pre‐existing AF. Forfar et al. examined four patients with AF and SH, where initial cardioversion did not restore sinus rhythm in three of the patients. However, all four patients converted to and remained in sinus rhythm at a 2‐year follow‐up after treatment of SH and restoration of the euthyroid status. In a cohort study, amongst 78 patients with SH and AF, 15 (19%) of those who achieved biochemical euthyroidism following treatment of SH converted to sinus rhythm. However, this study did not report how many, if any, untreated patients converted to sinus rhythm during the study period. A randomized controlled trial in France aiming to assess the role of treating SH in preventing the rate of AF was terminated due to recruitment difficulties (identifier NCT00213720).

### Clinical aspects of hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroid screening in pregnancy [^1145fDoL]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the peer-reviewed literature on hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroid autoimmunity in pregnancy.

Methods

We review published studies on thyroid autoimmunity and dysfunction in pregnancy, the impact of thyroid disease on pregnancy, and discuss implications for screening.

Results

Overt hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are responsible for adverse obstetric and neonatal events. Several studies of association suggest that either subclinical hypothyroidism or thyroid autoimmunity increase the risk of complications. One randomized controlled trial showed that pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism benefit from treatment in terms of obstetric and neonatal complications, whereas another study demonstrated no benefit in the intelligence quotient of babies born to women with subclinical hypothyroidism. Thyroid autoimmunity has been associated with increased rate of pregnancy loss, recurrent miscarriage, and preterm delivery.

Conclusion

Current guidelines agree that overt hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism need to be promptly treated and that as potential benefits outweigh potential harm, subclinical hypothyroidism also requires substitutive treatment. The chance that women with thyroid autoimmunity may benefit from levothyroxine treatment to improve obstetric outcome is intriguing, but adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed. The issue of universal thyroid screening at the beginning of pregnancy is still a matter of debate, and aggressive case-finding is supported.

### High thyrotropin levels and risk of mortality in the elderly with subclinical hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112HRhAQ]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aims to determine whether elevated endogenous thyrotropin levels contribute to an increased risk of adverse outcomes, such as all-cause mortality in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism.

Methods

Eight electronic databases were searched for relevant articles from inception until March 23, 2022. Cohort studies assessing the association between thyrotropin levels and the risk of mortality among older adults aged ≥ 60 years with subclinical hypothyroidism were eligible. The outcomes of interest were either all-cause or cardiovascular-related mortality. Two independent researchers assessed the eligibility of the studies and collected data through a previously defined data extraction form. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of evidence, and multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) (95% Cl) were collected as the necessary risk estimate for synthesis. Random-effects models were applied for meta-analysis.

Results

Overall, 13 studies involving 44514 participants were included in this meta-analysis. There were no significant differences in the risk of all-cause mortality (pooled HR: 1.18 [95% Cl: 0.95, 1.45], I² = 94%) and cardiovascular-related mortality (pooled HR: 1.08 [95% Cl: 0.94, 1.23], I² = 0%) between euthyroid older adults and older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism. The results remained the same when only older adults with thyrotropin ≥ 10 mIU/L were assessed (pooled HR for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related mortality, respectively: 1.53 [95% Cl: 0.81, 2.88], I² = 22%, 1.35 [95% Cl: 0.63, 2.86], I² = 43%).

Conclusion

High thyrotropin levels are not associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality as well as cardiovascular-related mortality in older adults aged ≥ 60 years with subclinical hypothyroidism, suggesting an unnecessity in initialing treatment.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115nFvNi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — subclinical hyperthyroidism involves TSH below the thyroid reference interval (usually 0.4 mIU/L) with normal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels, and it is further classified as low but detectable (about 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L) or undetectable (< 0.1 mIU/L) TSH levels; despite its name, overt hyperthyroidism does not require symptoms and is defined biochemically by a low or undetectable TSH level and an elevated T4 or T3 level.

### Management aspects of medical therapy in Grave's disease [^114mrL9g]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Subclinical Hyperthyroidism

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCH) is defined with TSH levels below normal range with normal FT4 and FT3. Prevalence of SCH globally is 0.7% to 1.4%. SCH can progress to overt hyperthyroidism in 8% of patients by 1 year and 26% of patients by 5 year. In populations with sufficient iodine intake, GD is the cause of 40% of cases of SCH. Baseline serum level of TSH, not cause of disease, is the best predictor of progression of subclinical hyperthyroidism to overt hyperthyroidism.

Treatment of SCH is recommended when serum thyrotropin levels are < 0.1 mU/L, in persons aged > 65 years and postmenopausal women due to association with adverse outcomes including cardiovascular disease, bone loss, fractures, and dementia.MMI remains an effective and safe choice for SCH due to GD. For asymptomatic individuals aged < 65 years and a TSH level between 0.1 mIU/L and the lower limit of normal, observation is generally appropriate.

Thyroid Storm

Thyroid storm is an acute, life-threatening complication of hyperthyroidism that presents with multisystem involvement and is associated with a significant mortality rate of 8% to 25%. Goals of treatment are to control increased adrenergic tone, achieve euthyroidism quickly and safely by reducing thyroid hormone synthesis, block thyroid hormone release, inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, and reduce enterohepatic recycling of thyroid hormone (Table 4).–

Although all ATDs decrease thyroid hormone synthesis, the current ATA guidelines recommend initiating PTU in patients with thyroid storm as it blocks T4 to T3 conversion. However, recent data suggest no difference in cost, mortality, and adverse events for those treated with PTU versus MMI.

### Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1178cQaL]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

The funnel plot of the primary analysis indicated an asymmetric reporting of effects, with studies missing in the lower right quadrant, indicating the possibility of biased reporting in favour of weaker effects. However, Egger's test was not positive.

Analysing studies with low risk of bias confirmed the results of the primary subgroup analyses on overt hyperthyroidism, while the association of subclinical hyperthyroidism with depression became negligible (1.08 [0.8–1.46]).

In a leave-one-out analysis, study weight was distributed unevenly with two studies carrying almost 80% of the weight. Exclusion of these large register studies by Chen et al. and Thomsen et al. slightly lowered the association (1.61 [1.34–1.93] and 1.58 [1.35–1.85] respectively). In subclinical hyperthyroidism, removal of the study by Engum et al. increased ORs to 1.52 [1.16–1.99].

Similar to the primary analysis, heterogeneity was low or moderate in subgroup and sensitivity analyses, with I ² generally not exceeding 50% (Supplementary Table 2).

Post-hoc analyses on studies on older populations reported effects similar to those of studies on all ages (Supplementary Table 2).

In fourteen studies effects for both, hyper- and hypothyroidism were reported. Thomsen et al. published corresponding data on hypothyroidism in a separate study. Combining studies on overt and subclinical disease resulted in a nominally weaker association of depression with hypothyroidism (1.36 [1.02–1.82]]) than with hyperthyroidism (1.61 [1.34–1.93]). In overt hyperthyroidism (1.66 [1.22–2.26]) associations were similar to those in overt hypothyroidism (1.69 [0.83–3.45]). Subclinical disease showed equal ORs in hyper- (1.36 [1.06–1.74]) and in hypothyroidism (1.35 [1.05–1.73]). After correction for potentially missing studies (Egger's test p -value = 0.003) however, the association of hypothyroidism with depression decreased to an OR of 1.14 [0.88–1.47].

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^116BQ3o2]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

### Study protocol; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism-a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^111brWL6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The primary and secondary outcomes at 12 months will also be analysed in the following subgroups by adding the subgroup variable and its interaction with treatment group:
Sex (Male/Female)
Baseline TSH ○ < 10 / ≥ 10 ○ < 7 / 7–9.99 / ≥ 10

In addition, continuous interactions with age at randomisation and baseline TSH will be analysed analogously.

Study outcome analyses will be repeated on the per protocol population as exploratory analyses.

Patient safety and adverse event recording

We have taken particular care in devising a titration algorithm to avoid any possibility of prolonged periods of thyroid hormone over replacement in those allocated to levothyroxine. This should substantially reduce the risks of adverse effects such as atrial fibrillation or cardiac failure. In epidemiological studies these problems are observed in association with biochemical hyperthyroidism and not with TSH within the reference range. Similarly for those allocated to placebo we have developed an algorithm that is designed to detect those who develop overt hypothyroidism are require to start open-label levothyroxine. These measures are designed to ensure safety of those who are randomised into the trial.

Within ThyPRO we are assessing the domain of hyperthyroid symptoms as a possible adverse effect (recorded at baseline, 6–8 weeks, 12 months and final visit).

Adverse events (AEs) are recorded, notified, assessed, reported, analysed and managed in accordance with the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (as amended). Certain potential adverse events are anticipated or likely as a result of the study and study population. The adverse events detailed below are likely to occur in the context of over replacement of levothyroxine. Our dose titration scheme and study processes of careful monitoring of thyroid function tests are designed to ensure we avoid prolonged periods of thyroid hormone excess.

Full details of all AEs of special interest (new atrial fibrillation, heart failure, fractures, new diagnosis of osteoporosis) including the nature of the event, relationship to study drug and outcome are recorded in the electronic case report form. AEs of special interest are monitored and followed up until satisfactory resolution or stabilization.

### Benefits of thyrotropin suppression versus the risks of adverse effects in differentiated thyroid cancer [^116XReNf]. Thyroid (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Despite clinical practice guidelines for the management of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), there are no recommendations on the optimal serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration to reduce tumor recurrences and improve survival, while ensuring an optimal quality of life with minimal adverse effects. The aim of this review was to provide a risk-adapted management scheme for levothyroxine (L-T4) therapy in patients with DTC. The objective was to establish which patients require complete suppression of serum TSH levels, given their risk of recurrent or metastatic DTC, and how potential adverse effects on the heart and skeleton, induced by subclinical hyperthyroidism, in concert with advanced age and comorbidities, may influence the degree of TSH suppression.

Summary

A risk-stratified approach to predict the rate of recurrence and death from thyroid cancer was based on the recently revised American Thyroid Association guidelines. A stratified approach to predict the risk from the adverse effects of L-T4 was devised, taking into account the age of the patient, as well as the presence of preexisting cardiovascular and skeletal risk factors that might predispose to the development of long-term adverse cardiovascular or skeletal outcomes, particularly increased heart rate and left ventricular mass, atrial fibrillation, and osteoporosis. Nine potential patient categories can be defined, with differing TSH targets for both initial and long-term L-T4 therapy.

Conclusion

Before deciding on the degree of TSH suppression during initial and long-term L-T4 treatment in patients with DTC, it is necessary to consider the aggressiveness of DTC, as well as the potential for adverse effects induced by iatrogenic subclinical hyperthyroidism. More aggressive TSH suppression is indicated in patients with high-risk disease or recurrent tumor, whereas less aggressive TSH suppression is reasonable in low-risk patients. In patients with high-risk DTC and an equally high risk of adverse effects, long-term treatment with L-T4 therapy should be individualized and balanced against the potential for adverse effects. In patients with an intermediate risk for thyroid cancer recurrence and a high risk of adverse effects of therapy, the degree of TSH suppression should be reevaluated during the follow-up period. Normalization of serum TSH is advisable for long-term treatment of disease-free elderly patients with DTC and significant comorbidities.

### Thyroid function effect on cardiac structure, cardiac function, and disease risk: evidence of causal associations in European ancestry [^1123eMcP]. Heart Rhythm (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in cardiovascular physiology. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, but evidence is mixed regarding causality.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential causal relationships of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism with cardiovascular outcomes, including atrial fibrillation (AF), coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and ischemic stroke, as well as their effect on cardiac structure and function assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

Methods

A comprehensive 2-sample Mendelian randomization analysis was performed using summary data from large-scale meta-analyses of European ancestry individuals.

Results

Genetically determined lower TSH levels (odds ratio 0.928; 95% confidence interval 0.884–0.974; p = 0.003) and genetic risk of hyperthyroidism (odds ratio 1.049; 95% confidence interval 1.016–1.083; p = 0.003) were associated with increased AF risk. These associations remained significant even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. Colocalization and multivariable Mendelian randomization revealed height as a key mediator between TSH/hyperthyroidism and AF. These findings were further corroborated in the independent FinnGen cohort. However, no clear evidence was found for relationships between thyroid function and other cardiovascular outcomes and cardiac structure and function.

Conclusion

Our study shows that reduced TSH levels and hyperthyroidism heighten AF risk, with height serving as an important mediator in these associations. The primary focus of thyroid management in cardiovascular health should be on preventing and treating arrhythmias, particularly AF. Our research highlights the importance of routine screening and timely treatment of thyroid dysfunction to optimize the prevention and management of arrhythmias.

### Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism and incident atrial fibrillation [^1144mHmP]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia, with a worldwide prevalence of 59.7 million cases. The lifetime risk of developing AF in Europe and the United States is 25% for those over the age of 55. Overt hyperthyroidism is an established risk factor for AF with a relative risk of 6.0. Treatment of hyperthyroidism prevents the onset of AF (RRR = 31%) and is associated with the resolution of AF (RRR = 80%).

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH), defined as a low TSH with normal free T4 (FT4) and free T3 (FT3), has also been associated with AF in several studies. The prevalence of SH ranges between 1% and 10% worldwide and is highest in iodine‐deficient countries. The mean incidence of AF in those with SH is 1.87%/year. SH is associated with increased P wave duration on electrocardiography (ECG), as well as increased ascending aorta and end‐diastolic ventricular diameters on echocardiogram. P‐wave duration and end‐diastolic left ventricular diameter are also associated with AF.

Very few studies have assessed the effect of treating SH on AF, with the available studies predominantly investigating the role of treating SH in AF resolution as well as in improving ECG and echocardiographic features associated with SH. The objective of our study was to identify whether an association exists between treatment of SH in outpatients and preventing incident AF.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^1165m5vZ]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction — thyrotoxicosis definitions, treatment scope, and U.S. epidemiology: Thyrotoxicosis refers to a clinical state that results from inappropriately high thyroid hormone action in tissues generally due to inappropriately high tissue thyroid hormone levels, and hyperthyroidism is a form of thyrotoxicosis due to inappropriately high synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormone(s) by the thyroid. β-blockers may be used in almost all forms of thyrotoxicosis, whereas antithyroid drugs (ATDs) are useful only in some. In the United States, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is approximately 1.2% (0.5% overt and 0.7% subclinical); the most common causes include Graves' disease (GD), toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG), and toxic adenoma (TA).

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: current concepts and scintigraphic imaging [^113vLPEX]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as normal serum free thyroxine and a free triiodothyronine level, with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and is usually undetectable. Although patients with this diagnosis have no or few signs and symptoms of overt thyrotoxicosis, there is sufficient evidence that it is associated with a relatively higher risk of supraventricular arrhythmias as well as the acceleration or the development of osteoporosis. Consequently, the approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism is controversial, that is, therapeutic intervention versus watchful waiting. Regardless, it is imperative for the referring physician to identify the causative thyroid disorder. This is optimally accomplished by a functional study, namely scintigraphy. Recognition of the scan findings of the various causes of subclinical hyperthyroidism enables the imaging specialist to help in diagnosing the underlying condition causing thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression thereby facilitating the workup and management of this thyroid disorder.

### Autonomic nervous system function in chronic exogenous subclinical thyrotoxicosis and the effect of restoring euthyroidism [^116iw95m]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Knowledge on the relationship between the autonomic nervous system and subclinical hyperthyroidism is mainly based upon cross-sectional studies in heterogeneous patient populations, and the effect of restoration to euthyroidism in subclinical hyperthyroidism has not been studied.

Objective

We investigated the long-term effects of exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism on the autonomic nervous system and the potential effects of restoration of euthyroidism.

Design

This was a prospective single-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial.

Setting

The study was performed at a university hospital.

Patients

A total of 25 patients who were on more than 10-yr TSH suppressive therapy after thyroidectomy was examined.

Intervention

Patients were studied at baseline and subsequently randomized to a 6-month thyroid hormone substitution regimen to obtain either euthyroidism or maintenance of the subclinical hyperthyroid state.

Main Outcome Measures

Urinary excretion of catecholamines and heart rate variability were measured. Baseline data of the subclinical hyperthyroidism patients were compared with data obtained in patients with hyperthyroidism and controls.

Results

Urinary excretion of norepinephrine and vanillylmandelic acid was higher in the subclinical hyperthyroidism patients compared with controls and lower compared with patients with overt hyperthyroidism. Heart rate variability was lower in patients with hyperthyroidism, intermediate in subclinical hyperthyroidism patients, and highest in the healthy controls. No differences were observed after restoration of euthyroidism.

Conclusions

Long-term exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism has effects on the autonomic nervous system measured by heart rate variability and urinary catecholamine excretion. No differences were observed after restoration to euthyroidism. This may indicate the occurrence of irreversible changes or adaptation during long-term exposure to excess thyroid hormone that is not remedied by 6-month euthyroidism.

### Thyroid hormone treatment among pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism: US national assessment [^117NgR1z]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Policy implications

Both clinicians and patients with subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy still face uncertainty about the effect of thyroid hormone treatment on maternal and neonatal outcomes. On the basis of our findings, continuing to offer thyroid hormone treatment to decrease the risk of pregnancy loss in pregnant women with TSH concentrations of 4.1–10.0 mIU/L is reasonable. Owing to the smaller magnitude of effect in the group with TSH concentrations of 2.5–4.0 mIU/L, and in light of the possible increased risk of other adverse events, treatment may need to be withheld in this group and guidelines may need to be revised. In fact, in the 2016 draft Guidelines for Subclinical Hypothyroidism in Pregnancy presented at the 2016 Endocrine Society meeting, levothyroxine treatment is recommended for women positive for thyroid peroxidase antibody if TSH is above 4.0 mIU/L (strong recommendation; moderate quality evidence) and may be considered if TSH is above 2.5 mIU/L (weak recommendation; low quality evidence) or for thyroid peroxidase antibody negative women (weak recommendation; low quality evidence). Moreover, results from large randomized trials such as the TSH study and the pregnancy complication data from the Controlled Antenatal Thyroid Screening study are expected soon and are likely to provide additional scientific rationale for management of subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy.

### Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113XYqtX]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

In regard to therapy, both conditions, hyperthyroidism and depression, demand guideline-oriented treatment. We are not aware of an established treatment that would target the two diseases in one approach.

Hyperthyroidism is not as prevalent as hypothyroidism in the general population. Assuming a population of 332.5 million people in the US, a hyperthyroidism prevalence of 1.3%, and a 12-months depression prevalence of 6.7%, an OR of 1.67 translates into about 484 thousand people with the comorbidity, 194 thousand of those presumably due to hyperthyroidism. Provided that there are 22.3 million people with depression each year, in a model assuming that hyperthyroidism causes depression, hyperthyroidism contributes about 0.9% to the pandemic of depression.

We focussed on population-based studies, but the term leaves some room for debate: For example, a sample of civil servants, such as the one investigated by Benseñor et al. is not population-based in the strict sense. However, while it is likely that prevalence differs contingent on the sample, it seems implausible that the association between hyperthyroidism and depression differs meaningfully in such a large and diverse group of people. Reassuringly, sensitivity analysis restricted to strictly population-based studies yielded no substantially different results (Supplementary Table 2). In the same vein, exclusion of register studies did not substantially change the summary estimate.

In conclusion, there is an association of hyperthyroidism with clinical depression (1.67 [95% CI: 1.49–1.87]), that is stronger in overt than in subclinical hyperthyroidism, pointing to a possibly biological association of both conditions. This should raise awareness in clinicians and researchers alike: Not only hypothyroid but also, and especially, hyperthyroid patients are at higher risk for depressive disorders and should be monitored for signs of clinical depression. How a hyperthyroid metabolism influences mood is not yet explained and, particularly regarding sex, deserves greater attention in the future research of thyroid–brain interactions.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and can be treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have given guidance on how and when to employ thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for the detection of thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction based on a lack of proven benefit and potential harm of treating those with thyroid dysfunction, which is mostly subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, the appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation. The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this White Paper to highlight the important difference between screening and case-based testing in the practice of clinical medicine. We recommend that thyroid dysfunction should be frequently considered as a potential etiology for many of the nonspecific complaints that physicians face daily. The application and success of safe and effective interventions are dependent on an accurate diagnosis. We, therefore, advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach, based on identifying those persons most likely to have thyroid disease that will benefit from its treatment.

### Thyroid function within the normal range, subclinical hypothyroidism, and the risk of atrial fibrillation [^116wk1Mh]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent disorder leading to heart failure, stroke, and death. Enhanced understanding of modifiable risk factors may yield opportunities for prevention. The risk of AF is increased in subclinical hyperthyroidism, but it is uncertain whether variations in thyroid function within the normal range or subclinical hypothyroidism are also associated with AF.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and obtained individual participant data from prospective cohort studies that measured thyroid function at baseline and assessed incident AF. Studies were identified from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to July 27, 2016. The euthyroid state was defined as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.45 to 4.49 mIU/L, and subclinical hypothyroidism as TSH 4.5 to 19.9 mIU/L with free thyroxine (fT4) levels within reference range. The association of TSH levels in the euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroid range with incident AF was examined by using Cox proportional hazards models. In euthyroid participants, we additionally examined the association between fT4 levels and incident AF.

Results

Of 30085 participants from 11 cohorts (278955 person-years of follow-up), 1958 (6.5%) had subclinical hypothyroidism and 2574 individuals (8.6%) developed AF during follow-up. TSH at baseline was not significantly associated with incident AF in euthyroid participants or those with subclinical hypothyroidism. Higher fT4 levels at baseline in euthyroid individuals were associated with increased AF risk in age- and sex-adjusted analyses (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.26–1.66, for the highest quartile versus the lowest quartile of fT4; P for trend ≤ 0.001 across quartiles). Estimates did not substantially differ after further adjustment for preexisting cardiovascular disease.

Conclusions

In euthyroid individuals, higher circulating fT4 levels, but not TSH levels, are associated with increased risk of incident AF.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111CgtxG]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is defined as an abnormal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level (reference range: 0.45 to 4.50 microU per mL) and free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels within their reference ranges. The management of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is controversial. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is about 4 to 8.5 percent, and may be as high as 20 percent in women older than 60 years. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is found in approximately 2 percent of the population. Most national organizations recommend against routine screening of asymptomatic patients, but screening is recommended for high-risk populations. There is good evidence that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with progression to overt disease. Patients with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 microU per mL have a higher incidence of elevated serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations; however, evidence is lacking for other associations. There is insufficient evidence that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is beneficial. A serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level of less than 0.1 microU per mL is associated with progression to overt hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, reduced bone mineral density, and cardiac dysfunction. There is little evidence that early treatment alters the clinical course.

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over… [^116f6aBh]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a common aberrant biochemical finding defined as an elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and normal circulating thyroid hormone level. SCH is associated with multiple health problems in old age ranging from mild non-specific symptoms such as tiredness and emotional susceptibility to coronary heart disease and decreased physical and cognitive functioning.

As 8–18% of those over 65 years are affected and inference from both observational and experimental studies maintain the clinical equipoise whether the merits of levothyroxine treatment outweigh the risks, the Thyroid hormone Replacement for Untreated older adults with Subclinical hypothyroidism randomised placebo controlled Trial (TRUST) was designed to resolve this clinical uncertainty. The outcomes of the TRUST trial provided robust information that for community-dwelling persons of 65 years of age and older with SCH, levothyroxine treatment provides no apparent benefits.

There are ample data to suggest that thyroid function is mediated by age and that the effects of SCH may be profoundly different in octogenarians and older. Older persons generally require different dosages of levothyroxine to achieve euthyroidism than younger counterparts possibly due to changes in body weight, composition or hormonal status and are at higher risk of adverse effects of overtreatment including cardiovascular events, arrhythmias and fractures. In a large-scale, observational follow-up study among 599 community-dwelling participants aged 85 years and over, increasing levels of TSH were associated with prolonged life span. This association, however, could not be confirmed in a later Individual Patient Data meta-analysis investigating mortality information in 4344 participants with SCH aged 80 years and over. In addition, members of families with exceptional longevity are characterized by slightly higher TSH and slightly lower circulating thyroid hormone levels when compared with the general population.

### Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117DLEZV]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Applying the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, 3 cohort and 2 cross-sectional studies were rated as carrying a "low risk of bias".

Full data describing all included studies are presented in the supplementary information (Supplementary Table 1).

Pooled analysis of all studies resulted in an OR estimate of 1.67 [1.49–1.87] of clinical depression in all types of hyperthyroidism relative to euthyroidism (Fig. 2 and Table 2), no relevant heterogeneity was observed (I ² = 6.4%, τ = 0.058; prediction interval: 1.40 to 1.99).

Main results.

Effects are reported as OR and 95% confidence interval. N describes the number of studies included in the analysis. Egger's p -value is reported as two-sided, values < 0.1 indicate potential publication bias. For reasons of power, Egger's test was only carried out if at least 10 studies were included in the analysis.

Additional results can be obtained from the supplementary information.

Subgroup analysis of studies restricted to overt hyperthyroidism resulted in a similar OR of 1.70 [1.49–1.93], and subclinical hyperthyroidism was also associated with depression (1.36 [1.06–1.74], Table 2). Stratification by gender, based on results from three studies, revealed an OR of 1.37 [0.91–2.05] among women and 1.84 [1.34–2.54] in men (p-value between effects: 0.257). Strictly population-based studies as well as studies that allowed for thyroid or anti-thyroid medication reported slightly weaker summary associations with depression. A cohort study design and a DSM- or ICD-conforming diagnosis of depression resulted in moderately stronger effects (Supplementary Table 2.1). Stratifying subgroup analyses in overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism yielded similar effects (Supplementary Table 2.2).

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^111sVXcR]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This article describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspeciality physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Thyroid Association in association with the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. The American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. The task force examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to develop the text and a series of specific recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group.

Results

Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery; Graves' disease in children, adolescents, or pregnant patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism; hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy; and management of other miscellaneous causes of thyrotoxicosis.

Conclusions

One hundred evidence-based recommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with thyrotoxicosis and to share what the task force believes is current, rational, and optimal medical practice.

### Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism and incident atrial fibrillation [^115tKe2Y]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Context

Treating overt hyperthyroidism prevents atrial fibrillation (AF). Though subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) has been associated with AF, it is unknown whether treating SH prevents AF.

Objective

We aimed to identify the association between treating SH and incident AF.

Design

In a pharmacoepidemiologic retrospective cohort study, patients diagnosed with SH between 2000 and 2021 were followed.

Patients

Outpatients ≥ 18 years with biochemical SH and without prior AF, hypothyroidism, thyroid cancer, pituitary disease, or pregnancy were included.

Main Outcomes

The primary outcome was incident AF. Secondary outcomes were ECG and echocardiographic features associated with AF.

Results

Of 2169 patients screened, 360 (131 treated and 229 untreated) were followed up for a mean of 4.27 years. In the treated and untreated groups, AF occurred in 4 (3.1%) and 15 (6.6%) patients (p = 0.15), and AF incidence was 0.8% and 1.4%/year (p = 0.31), respectively. The hazard ratio (HR) for treatment as a time‐dependent variable was 0.60 (95% CI 0.19–1.92; p = 0.39). As some cases of AF were documented nearly simultaneously with SH treatment, a sensitivity analysis was performed reassigning two patients diagnosed with AF < 30 days after starting SH treatment to the untreated group. Here, in the treated and untreated groups, AF occurred in 1.6% and 7.4% (p = 0.02), and AF incidence was 0.4% and 1.8%/year (p = 0.02), respectively. The HR was 0.25 (0.06–1.13; p = 0.07). There were no differences in ECG or echocardiographic features.

Conclusion

There was an overall trend towards lower incidence and prevalence of AF following treatment of SH, supporting the need for larger scale studies.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116e2Ezy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — overdiagnosis and natural history observations note that many persons labeled with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism spontaneously revert to a euthyroid state over time and that this especially includes those with "subclinical" disease who have "mildly elevated" TSH levels of 4.5 to 10.0 mIU/L.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: when to consider treatment… [^114cFDUK]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, with normal free thyroxine. 1–7 Emerging evidence shows the benefits of treating subclinical hyperthyroidism in patients with TSH levels less than 0. 1 mIU per L, particularly in older adults and patients at high risk of cardiovascular events and bone loss.

Etiology and Prevalence Subclinical hyperthyroidism may result from endogenous overproduction of thyroid hormone, administration of thyroid hormone to suppress malignancy, or excessive thyroid hormone replacement therapy in patients with hypothyroidism. Common causes of endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism include Graves disease, autonomous functioning thyroid adenoma, and multinodular toxic goiter. Transient TSH suppression may occur during subacute, painless, or postpartum thyroiditis. 4 and T 3 levels tend to be lower in persons with these conditions, whereas persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism may have free T 4 and T 3 levels in the mid to high reference range. Reassessment of TSH, free T 3, and free T 4 levels is appropriate after two to four months to evaluate whether low TSH is persistent and whether subclinical thyroid disease has progressed to overt hyperthyroidism. A suggested diagnostic approach is outlined in Figure 1.

4 The highest risk was observed in patients with TSH levels less than
0. 1 mIU per L, in men, and in adults older than 65 years. Exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism due to excessive levothyroxine replacement was also associated with increased cardiovascular and overall mortality in patients with fully suppressed TSH levels compared with those with normal TSH levels.
5. Quality of Life and Cognitive Function Physical and mental aspects of quality of life may be affected in patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management… [^112eGwm3]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Patients usually are euthyroid without the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. 10–22 Atrial fibrillation may be the primary manifestation of subclinical hyperthyroidism in elderly patients. 3 Physical examination will not reveal an enlarged thyroid gland in most patients.
5. The pathophysiology of subclinical hyperthyroidism relates to the sensitivity of the pituitary gland to respond to minor elevations in serum or tissue T. The normal range must be considered as a reference, but it is possible to have important pathophysiologic manifestations of altered T 4 or T 3 at the tissue level even though the peripheral serum thyronine levels are considered normal. 1, 6, 25 A suppressed serum TSH level may be related to nonthyroidal illness, steroid or dopamine administration, or pituitary dysfunction; therefore, it is important to exclude these conditions.

1, 6, 7 Abnormalities in the TSH level may presage the development of overt hyperthyroidism, in which case the free T 3 and T 4 levels will gradually rise outside of the normal range, resulting in the development of the classic symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism. 3 and T 4 levels and not to the underlying cause. 1, 3, 6, 27 Most patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism are ambulatory outpatients who are otherwise relatively healthy or have stable, chronic medical conditions. Results of long-term studies suggest that subclinical hyperthyroidism may develop into overt disease at a rate of at least 1 to 3 percent per year. 2, 3, 9–12 Abnormalities in the TSH level may remain for months or years in the absence of overt clinical symptoms, with a potentially increased risk to the patient of developing cardiac and bone density abnormalities.

Patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism may respond to treatment differently than patients with overt Graves' disease and multinodular goiters, although subclinical hyperthyroidism likely represents a form of one or more of these basic disease processes. Unlike patients with overtly symptomatic multinodular goiter, some patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism appear to undergo a sustained remission following a trial of antithyroid agents.

### Update on subclinical hyperthyroidism… [^115z1RjP]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, with normal free thyroxine, postmenopausal women had significantly lower BMD at the level of the femur and lumbar regions, whereas premenopausal women had only a modest decrease in BMD in the femur area compared with matched euthyroid control patients.
