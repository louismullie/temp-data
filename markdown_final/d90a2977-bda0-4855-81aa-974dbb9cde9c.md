## Question

A 8 mm hyperdense lesion within the left renal upper pole may represent a small hemorrhagic/proteinaceous cyst. No

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage an 8 mm hyperdense lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney that may represent a small hemorrhagic or proteinaceous cyst. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the differential diagnosis for a hyperdense renal lesion of this size. Then, I should verify the key imaging features that distinguish hemorrhagic/proteinaceous cysts from solid enhancing masses. Next, I will apply the Bosniak v2019 classification to risk-stratify the cyst. After that, I should review guideline-based management pathways for small hyperdense cysts, including when to observe versus when to pursue further workup. Finally, I will consider special scenarios such as contrast allergy, renal insufficiency, and hereditary risk, and close with a practical follow-up plan and counseling points anchored to AUA and ACR guidance [^113xpUtS] [^111pcXU1] [^111Wem6C].

> Let me first confirm the differential for an 8 mm hyperdense renal lesion. The leading considerations are a hemorrhagic or proteinaceous cyst, a solid enhancing neoplasm such as papillary RCC, an angiomyolipoma with minimal fat, and less commonly a small vascular malformation or calcified granuloma, with hyperdense cysts being common and typically benign when they meet strict nonenhancing criteria [^113xpUtS] [^1138Y1jq] [^114Jozz5].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging features that separate a benign hyperdense cyst from a solid tumor. I need to check for true enhancement, because any unequivocal enhancement beyond a thin wall or septum pushes the lesion out of a benign cyst category; hemorrhagic or proteinaceous cysts are hyperdense on noncontrast CT, often ≥ 70 HU, but they should not enhance on post-contrast series, whereas solid tumors enhance and may be subtle, particularly papillary subtypes that enhance minimally but measurably [^113xpUtS] [^116ybr9M] [^1138Y1jq].

> Hold on, I should verify the Bosniak v2019 classification for this scenario. A homogeneous hyperdense cyst measuring ≥ 70 HU on noncontrast CT without any enhancing septa, nodules, or wall thickening is categorized as Bosniak II and is considered benign, obviating routine follow-up; if the attenuation is 20–69 HU or there are equivocal features, that would be indeterminate and require further characterization, but at 8 mm with homogeneous hyperdensity and no enhancing components, Bosniak II is most appropriate if enhancement is absent [^113xpUtS] [^114Jozz5].

> I need to ensure the imaging protocol was adequate to assess enhancement. Let me first confirm whether a true noncontrast baseline and a dedicated renal mass protocol with nephrographic phase imaging were obtained; pseudoenhancement can artifactually raise attenuation in small renal cysts, so accurate pre- and post-contrast measurements are essential, and if the study was suboptimal, repeating with proper technique is reasonable before committing to a label [^111kGmtL] [^1115c9Mk].

> Next, I should review management implications. If the lesion is a Bosniak II hyperdense cyst, no further imaging or intervention is required; if there is uncertainty about enhancement or attenuation, short-interval cross-sectional imaging in 3–6 months is prudent to document stability and clarify features, with escalation if growth exceeds about 5 mm/year or if new enhancing elements appear, consistent with AUA active surveillance principles for small renal masses and ACR guidance for indeterminate lesions [^111pcXU1] [^111Wem6C] [^113xpUtS].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot receive iodinated contrast due to allergy or renal insufficiency. I should double-check alternatives: contrast-enhanced ultrasound can help detect true vascularity in indeterminate lesions and is endorsed by ACR when CT contrast is contraindicated; MRI with and without gadolinium can also characterize enhancement and fat content, and in some cases dual-energy CT can help distinguish pseudoenhancement from true iodine uptake, though very small lesions remain challenging [^115fEHdb] [^1128SYZX] [^112t59BP].

> Let me consider special populations. If the patient is younger than 46 years or has multifocal or bilateral renal masses or a family history suggestive of hereditary RCC, I should confirm whether genetic counseling is indicated, because hereditary syndromes alter surveillance intensity and thresholds for intervention; NCCN and AUA recommend referral in these scenarios even when individual lesions are small [^111q2xY7] [^111wGBsw].

> I should confirm that routine labs are not mandated for an incidental 8 mm hyperdense cyst in an average-risk patient, but if there are urinary symptoms, hematuria, or systemic features, urinalysis and basic metabolic testing are reasonable; importantly, microhematuria guidelines direct upper tract imaging when risk factors such as family history or genetic predisposition are present, which could intersect with this case if such risks exist [^113QSzZ9].

> Let me synthesize a practical plan. If a dedicated renal mass protocol confirms a homogeneous 8 mm hyperdense lesion ≥ 70 HU with no enhancement, I will classify it as Bosniak II and recommend no further follow-up; if enhancement is equivocal or the protocol was inadequate, I will repeat multiphase CT or MRI in 3–6 months to assess stability and enhancement, and if any solid enhancing component appears or growth exceeds about 5 mm/year, I will pivot to biopsy or definitive management per AUA guidance [^113xpUtS] [^111pcXU1] [^1115c9Mk].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated that all hyperdense cysts are definitively benign; I should correct that. While most homogeneous hyperdense cysts ≥ 70 HU without enhancement are benign and classified Bosniak II, rare solid tumors can mimic this appearance, so the absence of true enhancement remains the critical discriminator; if enhancement is present, even subtly, the lesion is not a simple cyst and warrants further workup or surveillance per risk and patient factors [^113xpUtS] [^1138Y1jq] [^114Jozz5].

> Finally, I need to ensure patient counseling is clear. I will explain that the 8 mm size and hyperdense appearance without enhancement strongly favor a benign hemorrhagic or proteinaceous cyst, that no treatment is needed, and that further testing is only necessary if imaging quality was suboptimal or if new features develop; I will also document shared decision-making if the patient prefers additional reassurance imaging despite a benign classification [^113xpUtS] [^111pcXU1] [^115W8s27].

An 8 mm hyperdense lesion in the left renal upper pole is most likely a **benign hemorrhagic or proteinaceous cyst** if it shows no enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT/MRI and has smooth walls without septations or nodules [^113xpUtS] [^116ybr9M]. If enhancement or solid components are present, consider **solid renal tumors** such as RCC or AML [^1138Y1jq]. Management is guided by imaging features: **no enhancement** warrants no immediate follow-up; **equivocal enhancement** calls for 6–12 month surveillance; and **definite enhancement** requires biopsy or surgical excision [^111pcXU1] [^111Wem6C]. Most small hyperdense cysts are benign, but careful imaging is essential to exclude malignancy [^1138Y1jq].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** for an 8 mm hyperdense renal lesion includes:

- **Hemorrhagic cyst**: Common benign lesion with high attenuation from blood products; no enhancement on contrast-enhanced imaging [^114bhcGY].

- **Proteinaceous cyst**: Benign cyst with high protein content causing hyperdensity; no enhancement on contrast-enhanced imaging [^1138Y1jq].

- **Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)**: Solid enhancing malignancy; may appear hyperdense but shows contrast enhancement [^1138Y1jq].

- **Angiomyolipoma (AML)**: Benign tumor with macroscopic fat; hyperdense without fat may be indistinguishable from RCC on CT [^1138Y1jq].

- **Calcified lesion**: Small calcification or stone may mimic a hyperdense cyst [^112t59BP].

---

## Imaging characteristics and diagnostic criteria

Accurate characterization relies on **imaging features**:

| **Imaging modality** | **Benign hemorrhagic/proteinaceous cyst** | **Solid renal tumor (rcc, aml)** |
|-|-|-|
| Non-contrast CT | Hyperdense (≥ 70 HU), homogeneous, well-defined | Hyperdense, heterogeneous, irregular margins |
| Contrast-enhanced CT/MRI | No enhancement (≤ 10 HU increase) | Enhancement (> 10–15 HU increase) |
| Wall/septations | Thin, smooth, no solid components | Thick, irregular, solid components |
| Fat content | Absent | Present in AML |

---

According to the **Bosniak classification**, a hyperdense cyst without enhancement, septations, or solid components is **Bosniak II** — benign and requiring no further follow-up [^113xpUtS].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines provide clear management pathways:

- **No enhancement**: Benign; no immediate follow-up required [^116ybr9M].

- **Equivocal enhancement**: Surveillance with repeat imaging in 6–12 months [^notfound].

- **Definite enhancement**: Biopsy or surgical excision indicated [^111q1ekj].

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

Benign hyperdense cysts have an **excellent prognosis** with no malignant potential. Solid tumors < 4 cm have low metastatic potential, and active surveillance is acceptable for select patients [^113GMBny] [^1154taUL].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

An 8 mm hyperdense lesion in the left renal upper pole is most likely a **benign hemorrhagic or proteinaceous cyst** if there is no enhancement. Management should be guided by imaging features: no enhancement requires no immediate follow-up; equivocal enhancement warrants surveillance; and definite enhancement necessitates biopsy or surgical excision.

The use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can help to differentiate benign renal lesions and thereby increase the number of lesions that do not need to be followed. In our clinical practice, usually, we face only an enhanced CT with a renal mass measuring more than 20 HU, which is considered indeterminate. CEUS plays an important role in converting these indeterminate CT lesions into benign Bosniak I/II cysts that do not require further examination (Fig. 4). On the other hand, some low-grade RCCs, especially the papillary subtype, show very slight enhancement which may not be clearly detected by CT or MR. CEUS has shown to be an excellent tool in demonstrating blood flow within these hypovascular tumors (Fig. 5).

Management of thyroid nodules on CE-CT has always been challenging. One study found an increase in iodine concentration and Z eff was able to distinguish papillary carcinomas from benign multinodular goiter. We observe significantly more lesions by CE-SCT and can better characterize actual iodine enhancement within them using iodine density and Z eff (Fig. 4). However, the evidence is scarce and will require a study design constructed to distinguish between benign and suspicious lesions.

Fig. 5
Conventional CT shows several hyperdense lesions within the kidney besides the simply cysts. VNC shows differences in several areas, most markedly within one of the two hyperdense lesions (Arrow) in the lateral part of the kidney. Iodine density overlay and Z-effective show a clear enhancement in the area mentioned. Next to this is a hyperdense cyst (arrowhead) with no enhancement and Z-effective values below 8. The diagnosis are most likely renal carcinoma within a polycystic kidney

Incidental renal masses are very common and difficult to assess without a non-contrast CT. Effective atomic number (Z eff) using a cutoff value of 8.36 can be used to distinguish between true enhancing and non-enhancing renal masses. Even though we did not find significantly more enhancing masses in the kidneys on the CE-SCT compared to the CE-CT, the confidence level of our diagnoses of cysts was dramatically increased, therein also minimizing the need for supplementary examinations. In a case of polycystic kidney disease, CE-SCT made the reading markedly easier as it could readily distinguish between true enhancement, calcifications, hyperdense cysts, and simple cysts. CE-SCT showed a hyperdense cyst and a contrast enhancing tumor within the left kidney. CE-CT merely shows two hyperdense lesions (Fig. 5).

### Spectral CT of the abdomen: where are we now? [^114bhcGY]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 4
An incidentally identified hyperdense right renal cyst in a 72-year-old man. Axial TNC image shows a markedly hyperdense cyst, most consistent with a hemorrhagic cyst (a) without enhancement on the portovenous phase image (b). However, iodine overlay maps show suspected mild enhancement (c). The iodine content of the cyst was 1.3 mg/mL, which by accepted thresholds would be considered an enhancing lesion, however, the normalized iodine content was only 0.27 mg/mL, consistent with lack of enhancement seen on conventional images

One of the most important uses for iodine maps in abdominal imaging is characterization of incidentally identified small lesions, the so called "too small to characterize" lesions. Although it is tempting to say iodine maps can be used to determine whether these small lesion are truly non-enhancing, one must remember that these images are still affected by the same partial volume artifacts which prevent us from reliably measuring the density (HU) of a lesion on conventional images. The true size threshold for determining the iodine content of a lesion using iodine maps is unknown.

A 46-year-old woman presented with total painless gross hematuria, an 8-mm polypoid mass that proved to be a lymphangioma was found in the upper pole collecting system of the left kidney. The mass was resected ureteroscopically with holmium laser fulguration of the base. The few reported cases of this rare lesion suggest that rigorous postoperative surveillance is not necessary for this benign condition.

The Study

A 12-year-old boy from a remote community who had a history of latent tuberculosis treated 10 years previously was brought for care of 2 months of painless gross hematuria. His only other exposure history was occasionally playing with local stray dogs. He denied other symptoms. Results of his physical examination were unremarkable aside from a BMI of 35.4 kg/m 2.

Laboratory studies were notable for an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 55 mm/h (reference < 10 mm/h) and detection of erythrocytes and leukocyte esterase in the urine. Serology for HIV was negative, and lymphocyte subset values were within reference ranges. An ultrasound showed a large irregular echogenic lesion within the left kidney measuring ≈10 cm. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed an irregular cystoid mass measuring 8.2 × 8.7 × 12.3 cm, occupying the upper and interpolar regions of the left kidney. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen showed a heterogenous centrally necrotic renal mass exhibiting no notable central enhancement. Mild peripheral enhancement of the renal lesion was seen on MRI, likely corresponding to fibroinflammatory components (Figure 1).

There is a large irregular hypodense left renal lesion (red arrow). A large porto-systemic shunt is partially visualized (white arrow).

CT of the chest and brain demonstrated numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules measuring < 1.2 cm and a few small clustered ring-enhancing lesions in the left frontal lobe measuring < 8 mm. These lesions were further characterized on brain MRI and again demonstrated ring enhancement, along with associated vasogenic edema (Appendix Figure). The patient underwent a biopsy of the renal lesion. CT of the abdomen also demonstrated a rare vascular anomaly of his portal system. The portal veins were diminutive in caliber, and a large caliber portosystemic shunt arose from the superior mesenteric vein, which drained into the right common iliac vein. This anomaly is consistent with a type II congenital portosystemic shunt (Abernethy malformation).

### Imaging of renal pseudotumors in children: a comprehensive review [^112aKG7p]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Renal abscess is a complication of focal pyelonephritis and may be parenchymal or perinephric. In the early stages, abscesses appear as ill-defined hypovascular areas. A mature abscess presents as a well-defined complex cystic lesion with a thick, irregular wall. On US, a typical abscess appears as a heterogeneous mass with posterior acoustic enhancement and absent internal flow on color Doppler. These features can also be seen in necrotic malignant tumors. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are crucial in differential diagnosis. If clinical findings are inconsistent with an abscess, MRI may be useful for confirming the diagnosis. Abscesses appear hypointense on T1- and hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI. They may exhibit perilesional edema and fluid–fluid levels. Pseudocapsules may enhance in the venous phase. Restricted diffusion is typically observed at the center of the abscess, with ADC values lower than focal nephritis or sterile fluid collections. On CT, they appear as round or geographic hypodense lesions with enhancing thick wall (Fig. 6). The wall of Wilms' tumor is typically more irregular and the presence of fat stranding may be particularly helpful in distinguishing between an abscess and a Wilms' tumor.

### Incidental adrenocortical oncocytoma [^117WmVCW]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

A 66-year-old man with a history of hypertension and poor compliance with therapeutic regimens for the past 10 years presented with right renal colic. Sonographic evaluation of the kidneys revealed an incidental left renal upper pole mass. There were no palpitations, headache, weakness or fatigue, and the physical examination was unremarkable. Further evaluation including laboratory tests, abdominal computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a non-functioning left adrenal mass with no malignant characteristic. Laparascopic left adrenalectomy and subsequent pathologic examination demonstrated a 8×6.5×4 cm oncocytoma. Follow-up of the patient for 1 year has revealed no complication or recurrence. Adrenocortical oncocytoma is an exceptionally rare tumour, mainly non-functional and benign, that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of adrenal "incidentalomas".

### Early-onset renal cell carcinoma inharmatoma tumour syndrome [^115zNNi7]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Prior to her visit, the patient had a computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the abdomen at her local hospital due to known vascular malformations and revealed multiple simple cysts within both kidneys but no other pathology. Within 8 months of her initial CTA, the patient experienced painless gross haematuria and a magnetic resonance angiography of the abdomen was performed. This revealed multiple lesions in the kidneys with the largest in the medial aspect of the upper pole of the left kidney measuring 3.2 cm in greatest dimension, suggestive of RCC versus hamartomas. A cystoscopy was performed, and was normal. Within 13 months, a subsequent MRI of the kidneys showed bilateral enhancing renal neoplasms with interval enlargement of the dominant 4.5 cm heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the upper pole of left kidney that demonstrates restricted diffusion, likely papillary subtype RCC (Fig. 2). A left partial nephrectomy was performed and pathology revealed RCC, papillary PHTS-associated type, ISUP grade 3 (see Fig. 3). The tumour extended into the pelvicalyceal system with negative margins of resection. Post-operatively, the patient has been doing well clinically and continues with close monitoring of the other lesions within both kidneys as well as age-appropriate surveillance for the other PHTS-relevant organs.

### Do incidental hyperechoic renal lesions measuring up to 1 CM warrant further imaging? Outcomes of 161 lesions [^116WExAV]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes of hyperechoic renal lesions measuring 1 cm or less at ultrasound examination.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective study included 161 hyperechoic renal lesions measuring 1 cm or less at ultrasound that were evaluated with follow-up ultrasound, CT, or MRI. Follow-up imaging examinations were reviewed to assess for definitive lesion characterization or size stability.

Results

Follow-up included 11 unenhanced CT, 39 contrast-enhanced CT, 52 unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT, two unenhanced MRI, 50 unenhanced and contrast-enhanced MRI, and 87 ultrasound examinations. At CT or MRI 58.4% of lesions were confirmed to be angiomyolipomas. At CT, one lesion represented a stone, and one a hyperdense cyst. At CT or MRI 11.8% of the lesions had no correlate; 3.1% were not visualized at follow-up ultrasound. An additional 23.6% were stable at 2-year follow-up imaging or beyond. Two lesions were evaluated with only contrast-enhanced CT less than 1 month after ultrasound, and the CT images did not show macroscopic fat or calcification or meet the criteria for a simple cyst. These lesions were considered indeterminate. One lesion in a 65-year-old man was imaged with unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT 23 months after ultrasound, and the CT showed an increase in size, solid enhancement, and no macroscopic fat. This lesion was presumed to represent renal cell carcinoma. Overall, the one lesion presumed malignant and the two indeterminate lesions constituted 1.9% of the cohort. The other 98.1% of lesions were considered clinically insignificant.

Conclusion

Most hyperechoic renal lesions measuring 1 cm or smaller were clinically insignificant, suggesting that such lesions may not require additional imaging. Patient demographics, symptoms and risk factors for malignancy may help inform the decision to forgo follow-up imaging of such lesions.

Incidental renal lesions on CT — A taskforce of the ACR recommends no further investigation for renal lesions that are too small to characterize and for homogeneous lesions with attenuation either −10 to 20 HU or > 70 HU. Other lesions (ie, heterogeneous, thick/irregular wall, mural nodule, septations, 21–69 HU) should undergo further imaging, preferably MRI. Lesions that contain fat (< −10 HU) require further investigation if they also contain calcification, are multiple, or are > 4 cm; others do not require investigation.

### Renal cell carcinoma with a tumor thrombus in the ureter: a case report [^1147VMhW]. BMC Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 43-year-old man who had a history of right renal calculus presented to a nearby hospital with a chief complaint of asymptomatic gross hematuria. A left renal tumor was suspected based on plain abdominal CT, and he was referred to our department. Physical examination revealed no abnormality in the chest, the abdomen or the extremities. Laboratory data on admission revealed mild leukocytosis, with leucocyte of 10.5 × 10 3 /μL, mild hypochromic anemia, with hemoglobin of 12.9 g/dL, and mild inflammatory reaction, with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 24 mm at the first hour, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 4.0 mg/dL. Urinalysis revealed erythrocyte count of 50–99/HPF and no pyuria or bacteriuria. Urine cytology was class I and showed no atypical cells. A dynamic CT study revealed a tumor (8 × 7 cm in diameter) in the upper pole of the left kidney (Figures 1A) and which showed contrast enhancement in the early phase (Figures 1B, C and 2A) and extended into the left renal pelvis and the ureter (Figures 1D). There was also contrast enhancement at this site (Figures 2B and 2C). In addition, a nodule with 8 mm in diameter was found in the S5 segment of the left lung (Figure 3A), and para-aortic lymph nodes enlargement were observed (Figure 3B). Cystoscopy revealed no obvious tumorous lesion. The tumor was diagnosed as left RCC (cT3aN2M1), and transabdominal left nephrectomy and hilar lymph node dissection were performed. Also total ureterectomy including cuff resection of bladder wall was additionally performed because intraoperative histopathological examination couldn't rule out urothelial carcinoma.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — intervention prioritization for renal mass: Patients with relatively low co-morbidity and an anticipated life expectancy > 5 years should be prioritized for treatment, particularly when the renal mass is > 3 cm and/or demonstrates median growth of > 5 mm/year. Increasing tumor size correlates with increased incidence of high nuclear grade, less favorable histology, and locally-advanced features, and median growth rates exceeding 5mm/ year are indicative of oncologically-active tumors and have been associated with tumor progression and metastasis.

### Sarcoidosis manifesting as a pseudotumorous renal mass [^114htNe9]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

A 53 year-old African American woman with a three-year history of pulmonary sarcoidosis had a follow-up computed tomographic scan to evaluate the status of her disease and response to treatment. On the scan, an abnormal, hypodense mass on the left renal superior pole, which was not present on previous scans, was incidentally discovered. The initial concern was of carcinoma, despite her lack of any urinary symptoms. She underwent further evaluation with magnetic resonance, and the enhancement pattern and the shape of the mass were more suggestive of lymphoma or infarction than a carcinoma. A review of literature revealed sparse case reports demonstrating sarcoidosis presenting as infiltrative granulomatous masses resembling tumors with nonspecific imaging qualities. This diagnosis was entertained and then proven by biopsy. Pseudotumorous renal sarcoid should be in the differential of renal masses, especially in patients with a history of sarcoidosis, as it alters clinical management.

The patient received intravenous imipenem (1 g every 8 h) and indomethacin. Imipenem was replaced with intravenous meropenem (1 g every 8 h) due to gastrointestinal side effect. Levofloxacin (0.5 g once daily) was added on January 18, 2019. However, fever persisted. PET/CT scan on January 20, 2019 revealed an occupying lesion, approximately 4.7 × 5.7 × 5.1 cm in size, in the upper pole of the left kidney (Fig. 2). The early SUVmax was 14.5 and delayed SUVmax was 21.7. The upper segment of the left ureter was thickened and occluded. Laboratory study on January 26, 2019 showed WBC counts at 14.22 × 10 9 /L, neutrophils 8.45 × 10 9 /L, alanine transferase (ALT) 152 U/L, hsCRP 146.0 mg/L and ESR 121 mm/h. Serum creatinine was 61 μmol/L and BUN was 5.78 mmol/L. Considering inefficacy of antibiotics therapy and elevations in ALT, antibiotics were discontinued. Renal malignancy was considered.

At CT, small arterial bleedings appear as poorly delimited contrast material extravasations, sometimes flame-shaped, usually located in the setting of a perirenal haematoma, that appear hyperdense in the arterial phase and increase in quantity and density in the following phases. Active arterial contrast material extravasation is often associated with high-grade parenchymal lesions, but occasionally it may also occur in low-grade ones. Non-operative management is indicated in haemodynamically stable patients if no other lesions requiring surgery are detected at CT, and digital subtraction angiography with superselective arterial embolisation represents the treatment of choice; angioembolisation might be avoided in patients with small perirenal haematomas and minimal signs of active bleeding. A CT follow-up should be considered after angioembolisation in order to detect eventual complications, such as pseudoaneurysms and large ischaemic events. Fig. 7 a – b Active arterial contrast extravasation from a capsular artery (lesion not included in the AAST classification). On these 3-mm-thick multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) axial images acquired during the arterial (a) and nephrographic (b) phases of the study in the same patient, a large perirenal haematoma (star) determining a ventral dislocation of the kidney is clearly recognisable. No parenchymal lacerations can be observed, but an active contrast material extravasation (arrow) is recognisable within the haematoma during the arterial phase, showing a mild increase in size during the nephrographic phase as a consequence of a capsular artery rupture
Arterial pseudoaneurysm (not included in the AAST classification). Arterial pseudoaneurysm (Fig. 8a–b) appears as a well-delimited ovoid lesion located within the renal parenchyma, enhancing as much as the adjacent arteries during the arterial phase and not increasing in size or density during the subsequent phases in which, indeed, it becomes isoattenuating to the blood pool; these characteristics enable a differential diagnosis with active contrast material extravasation. Digital subtraction angiography (Fig. 8c) with superselective arterial embolisation represents the treatment of choice in order to prevent delayed rupture; surgery may be limited to the few cases in which haemostasis and arterial wall defect repair are required. Fig. 8 a – f Arterial pseudoaneurysm and artero-venous fistula (lesions not included in the AAST classification). On the 3-mm-thick multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) axial images acquired during the arterial (a and d) and nephrographic (b and e) phases of the study in two different patients, a well-delimited oval lesion (arrowheads in the first patient and arrows in the second one) with a density that varies parallel to the density of the arterial vessels is clearly recognisable. Digital subtraction angiography characterised these lesions as an arterial pseudoaneurysm in the first patient (c) and as an artero-venous fistula in the second one (f) in which an early venous output (arrowheads) was recognisable
Artero-venous fistula (not included in the AAST classification). Artero-venous fistulae (Fig. 8d–e) usually have the same CT appearance as arterial pseudoaneurysms. An important finding that enables the differential diagnosis between the two lesions is the identification of a dilated renal vein that enhances early during the arterial phase of the study; anyway, a true arterial phase should be acquired in order to appreciate this finding that might be obscured by the physiological venous return during the corticomedullary phase. Digital subtraction angiography (Fig. 8f) with superselective arterial embolisation represents the treatment of choice in order to prevent delayed rupture and arterial hypertension development.

### Is ultrasound useful for further evaluation of homogeneously hyperattenuating renal lesions detected on CT? [^1125rg3i]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of ultrasound (US) to characterize hyperattenuating cysts detected as indeterminate hyperattenuating renal lesions on unenhanced and single phase enhanced CT.

Materials and Methods

A total of 107 consecutive homogeneously hyperattenuating renal lesions underwent gray-scale and Doppler US at our institution between 2010 and 2013. Two radiologists who were unaware of the final diagnosis retrospectively evaluated US images for visibility and diagnosis (simple cyst, intermediate complexity cyst, cystic or solid mass showing internal flow on Doppler US, or indeterminate). A third radiologist assessed lesion size, location, and distance to skin on CT and US. US visibility was compared using chi-square and independent t tests. Consensus US interpretation was compared with reference standard diagnoses, and accuracy for diagnosis of hyperattenuating cysts was tabulated.

Results

Mean lesion size ± SD was 20 ± 16 mm (range, 6–96 mm) and mean distance to skin on CT was 62 ± 25 mm (range, 18–125 mm). In all, 89.7% (96/107) of the lesions were visible on US, including all lesions that were 15 mm or larger. Nonvisible lesions were smaller than visible ones (10.0 ± 3.6 mm vs 20.7 ± 16.3 mm, p = 0.03) regardless of location (p > 0.05). CT overestimated lesion distance to skin compared with US (46.6 ± 18.6 mm, p < 0.001). Final diagnoses for US visible lesions (n = 96) were hyperattenuating cyst (n = 66), Bosniak IIF cyst (n = 13), and cystic or solid neoplasm (n = 15); two patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 66 hyperattenuating cysts, 54 (81.8%) appeared as simple cysts on US with sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of hyperattenuating cyst of 81.8% (95% CI, 75.6–84.3%) and 92.9% (95% CI, 78.1–98.7%), respectively. The other 12 (18.2%) hyperattenuating cysts appeared complex. Two of the 13 Bosniak IIF lesions were incorrectly classified as simple cysts with US. Including the 11 (10%) nonvisible lesions reduced sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of hyperattenuating cyst to 73.0% (95% CI, 66.9–75.9%) and 89.7% (95% CI, 74.2–97.2%), respectively.

Conclusion

US can further characterize hyperattenuating cysts presenting as indeterminate hyperattenuating renal lesions on CT in the majority of cases.

Investigations

Initial investigations showed a haemaglobin of 87g/L, white cell count of 20.4×10 9 /L, C-reactive protein of 62 and a lactate of 2.23. Urine dipstick showed +3 ketones with no haematuria. A focused obstetric ultrasound showed an intrauterine pregnancy of 17 weeks of gestational age.

An ultrasound of her abdomen and pelvis revealed a 6×7 cm complex mass arriving from the left kidney. An MRI scan of her abdomen showed a large hypervascular exophytic lesion arising from the left renal pole, which contained multiple small pseudoaneurysms and tortuous abnormal-appearing arteries consistent with an angiomyolipoma (figures 1 and 2).

Abstract

A 62-year-old man presented with a huge lesion of left kidney on ultrasound in a health examination 1 month ago. The mass showed hypervascularity on enhanced CT and intense FDG uptake on FDG PET/CT in the lower pole of kidney, which suggested renal malignancy. The histopathological result after surgical resection of the mass confirmed the diagnosis of Castleman disease, the hyaline vascular variant.

### Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma: a case report and literature review [^116KvjqV]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 45-year-old male patient presented a nine-day history of gross hematuria without any symptoms. Physical and laboratory examination revealed no significant abnormalities except for microscopic hematuria. The results of a computed tomography (CT) urogram demonstrated a large non-homogeneous mass of 6.0 × 4.7 cm within the superior pole of the right kidney, (with extension into the renal sinus). The mass is heterogeneous with the peripheral portions being isodense to the normal renal parenchyma and with central hypoattenuating areas suggestive of necrosis. The lesion exhibited mild to moderate enhancement on all three phases of post-contrast imaging (corticomedullary, nephrographic and excretory phases) (Fig. 1). There are several prominent retroperitoneal (left para-aortic) lymph nodes, measuring up to 0.9 cm in short axis diameter. In addition, recommendations for a full body fluorine-18 fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) - computed tomography (CT) scan were made by urology and oncology to assist with diagnosis and the staging of the malignancy. The PET-CT confirmed a large renal mass with intense FDG uptake (SUVmax was up to 8.8) and a single osseous metastatic disease in third thoracic vertebra (T3) (Fig. 2). Several small lymph nodes with slight FDG uptake were also found in prominent retroperitoneal (left para-aortic), and right renal hulum. An initial diagnosis of a space-occupying lesion of the right kidney, retroperitoneal and right renal hulum lymph node metastases and a space-occupying lesion of the T3 was proposed with suspicions of renal cell carcinoma and subtypes or lymphoma. Subsequently, the patient underwent right radical nephrectomy. One mass was revealed in the superior pole of the kidney, which extends locally into the capsule and micrometastasis was found in 10 lymph node of right renal hulum. The renal vein and adrenal gland is normal and free of tumor. Despite the lack of histologic evidence within the biopsied material to determine a specific subtype of RCC, pathologic analysis revealed poorly differentiated renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with rhabdomyosarcomatous sarcomatoid differentiation, extending into the renal sinus and the ureteral (T3N1M1) (Fig. 3). Subsequently, the patient refused any chemoradiotherapy and left the hospital without any obvious symptoms. However, five days later, due to lumbago and weakness, the patient returned to the hospital. The Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) indicated diffuse osseous metastatic disease in the thoracic and lumbar vertebra and multiple retroperitoneal lymph node metastases, which mixed together as masses (Fig. 4). The patient refused any chemoradiotherapy again. The disease progressed quickly to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in half a month. Eventually, the patient died of respiratory failure two days later.

### Common and less-common renal masses and masslike conditions [^113t4NTh]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

As an increasing number of imaging examinations are performed, a greater number of incidental renal lesions are detected. Apart from the usual cysts and solid renal cell carcinomas, a variety of unusual benign and malignant renal lesions exist. Imaging is invaluable in characterizing these lesions and is confirmatory in some benign lesions. Renal cell carcinoma remains the diagnosis of exclusion; however, assessment of the imaging pattern in the appropriate clinical context can improve diagnostic accuracy. The objective of this article is to familiarize the radiologist with the imaging appearance of unusual non-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions and correlate with histopathologic studies when available.

### Low enhancing papillary renal cell carcinoma diagnosed by using dual energy computerized tomography: a case report and review of literature [^111ivgcq]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 66 year-old Caucasian female, with past medical history significant for asthma, presented with an asymptomatic 3.2 cm lesion within the inferior pole of the left kidney. The patient had no family history of kidney cancer and there were no significant findings on examination. The lesion had been diagnosed a few months ago on an abdominal ultrasound as a hypo echoic 2.6 circular abnormality. No significant vascularity was seen in the lesion using doppler ultrasound. A follow-up contrast enhanced CT showed the abnormality to have Hounsfield attenuation units of 63. The attenuation increased to 70 units on the early arterial and delayed phases. A diagnosis of a hyper-attenuating benign renal cyst was consequently made. A follow-up CT scan showed an increase in the size of the lesion to 3.2 cm within 4 months and to have equivocal enhancement of about 10 Hounsfield units on post contrast images. The lesion did not demonstrate significant wall thickening, septations, or mural nodules (Figure 1 a). The patient then presented to our clinic for further management. Fortunately, a DECT scanner was recently installed at an affiliate hospital of the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (St John's Hospital - Springfield, IL), and the Radiology Department at St. John's Hospital had communicated to us the possible benefit of DECT in renal tumors with equivocal enhancement characteristics. A shared decision was made with the patient to proceed with DECT imaging of the kidneys to further characterize her renal lesion. DECT was performed using Siemens 128 dual source dual energy computerized tomography machine, and Siemens Syngo Via software was used to process the images. Iodine was noticed inside the lesion on DECT indicating tissue enhancement that is associated with solid tumors (Figure 1 b). Recommendation was made to the patient for tumor removal and surgery was done robotically with no complications. Intra-operatively, the lesion was found to be a solid tumor emanating from the lower pole of the left kidney (see Additional file 1 for timeline).

### The incidental renal mass-update on characterization and management [^114Jozz5]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Renal masses are commonly encountered on cross-sectional imaging examinations performed for nonrenal indications. Although most can be dismissed as benign cysts, a subset will be either indeterminate or suspicious; in many cases, imaging cannot be used to reliably differentiate between benign and malignant masses. On-going research in defining characteristics of common renal masses on advanced imaging shows promise in offering solutions to this issue. A recent update of the Bosniak classification (used to categorize cystic renal masses) was proposed with the goals of decreasing imaging follow-up in likely benign cystic masses, and therefore avoiding unnecessary surgical resection of such masses.

Case report

A 29-year old man presented on January 7, 2019 with dry cough and fever with shivering accompanied by left flank pain for over 40 days and a left kidney occupying lesion for 10 days. The patient developed dry cough without apparent trigger and fever (temperature 37.7 °C) in the afternoon, with shivering accompanied by left flank pain. On November 30, 2018, blood chemistries at a local hospital showed increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and urinalysis revealed hematuria and proteinuria and he received intravenous metronidazole and penicillin for 3 days without apparent improvement. On December 5, 2018, he received intravenous levofloxacin at a provincial hospital for 2 days; left flank pain was worsened with fever (38.7 °C) with shivering during the treatment. Abdominal MRI scan revealed left kidney enlargement with a hypointense shadow with peripheral enhancement. His symptoms did not abate despite intensive antibiotics with piperacillin plus tazobactam, etimicin, linezolid, voriconazole, biapenem, and sulperazone. No symptomatic improvement occurred. The patient had lost about 5 kg in body weight since his illness.

The patient had a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and received allogeneic stem cell transplantation in 2007. He did not experience an acute kidney injury episode, a renal infarct or any renal disease in the past.

Admission examination revealed a temperature of 37.7 °C and a pulse of 107/min. No other remarkable physical findings were seen. His blood chemistries showed white blood cell (WBC) counts at 12.3 × 10 9 /L with 63.7% neutrophils and hsCRP 125.20 mg/L, ferritin 1421 ng/mL and ESR 104 mm/h. Serum creatinine was 97 μmol/L and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 9.04 mmol/L. Routine urinary tests on six occasions were unremarkable and showed no signs of infection. Doppler flow imaging ultrasonography (CDFI) showed a regular hypoechoic mass with distinct borders in the upper pole of the left kidney, 3.8 × 3.7 cm in size, and dot or strip-like flow signal (Fig. 1). Biopsy pathology on January 11, 2019 showed scant left kidney necrosis. A tentative diagnosis of fever of unknown origin and probable left kidney infection was made.

### Sporadic, classic-type renal angiomyolipoma with renal vein and inferior vena cava extension: an incidental case [^116zL7r4]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) were first described in the early 1900s by Gravitz, but it was not until 1951 that they were named renal AML. These kidney tumours are rare, occurring in 0.13%-0.44% of the population. These mesenchymal tumours are composed of smooth muscle-like, adipocyte-like and epithelioid cells. Depending on the predominant cell population, it can be further subclassified into classic, epithelioid and AML with epithelial cyst. A 32-year-old woman presented with mild, intermittent, epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Abdominal ultrasound revealed an incidental lesion within the inferior vena cava (IVC). A CT scan showed a lesion within the left renal vein extending into the IVC with 40% narrowing and a fat-containing mass in the lower pole of the left kidney of 15mm suggesting an AML. Thrombectomy was performed. The specimen resulted positive for classic variant renal AML. Initial diagnosis is centred on imagining studies, based in fatty tissue concentration. The AML expresses melanocytic markers. This helps differentiate from renal cell carcinoma. Although AML is considered a benign condition, there is evidence of malignant transformation. Active surveillance is recommended for lesions < 4cm. Nephron sparing surgery is the procedure of choice. Nephrectomy is recommended if there is a high probability of malignancy. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors have been proposed to be an alternative treatment.

### Dual-energy CT after radiofrequency ablation of liver, kidney, and lung lesions: a review of features [^113AYtTZ]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The majority of ablation zones are hypodense in nature; however, it is not uncommon to have a variable degree of haemorrhagic necrosis in the necrotic area. This degree of attenuation is not predictive of technique effectiveness (Fig. 6c). Since the quality of the water maps is less compared to the true unenhanced images, spontaneous hyperdensity may be missed by this reconstruction technique (Fig. 6b).

Fig. 6
Renal cell carcinoma. A 40-year-old female is diagnosed with a suspicious lesion in the right kidney on ultrasound. After consulting her urologist, the patient opts for RF ablation. a CECT shows a thick-walled cystic lesion in the right upper pole, graded as a Bosniak 4 cyst. b The true unenhanced polychromatic CT image (left), 24 h post ablation, shows a hyperdense change in the ablation zone (arrow). This finding cannot be confirmed on the water map reconstructions. c The imaging appearance of the ablation zone 24 h (first row), 3 months (second row), and 18 months (third row) after RF ablation. On the 24-h post-ablation series, the delineation of the ablation zone is clearly observable on all reconstructed images; however, the 40 keV image is of superior quality when compared to the 70-keV image (arrowheads). On the iodine-coded images, the internal high attenuation is unexpectedly (no iodine content) still visible within the avascular zone (arrows). No suspicious nodular enhancement is observed at the border of the ablation zone. DECT from 3- and 18-month follow-up depicts an involution of the avascular zone. There is a loss of the internal high-attenuation changes. There is no evidence of local tumour progression

In the contrast to rim enhancement that is commonly found in liver ablations, this phenomenon has only been observed occasionally in ablated renal parenchyma. If present, it resolves quickly and is only marginally visible after 3 months. Post-ablative changes in the perirenal fat are predominantly seen as streaky soft tissue attenuations (Fig. 5a), which resolve to a dominant band or halo over time (Fig. 4d). Long-term follow-up findings include the development of fat between the ablation zone and normal kidney parenchyma (Fig. 4d). The majority of kidney ablations show little to no reduction in size within the first 6 to 12 months; however, earlier shrinkage is not uncommon (Fig. 6c).

### Imaging of solid renal masses [^115hf7G3]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The increase in serendipitous detection of solid renal masses on imaging has not resulted in a reduction in mortality from renal cell carcinoma. Consequently, efforts for improved lesion characterization have been pursued and incorporated into management algorithms for distinguishing clinically significant tumors from those with favorable histology or benign conditions. Although diagnostic imaging strategies have evolved for optimized lesion detection, distinction between benign tumors and both indolent and aggressive malignant neoplasms remain an important diagnostic challenge. Recent advances in cross-sectional imaging have expanded the role of these tests in the noninvasive characterization of solid renal tumors.

Active surveillance entails serial abdomen imaging with timely intervention should the mass demonstrate changes (eg, increasing tumor size, growth rate, infiltrative pattern) indicative of increasing metastatic potential, and active surveillance should include periodic metastatic survey including blood work and chest imaging, particularly if the mass demonstrates growth.

Results

After excluding 8 with cystic disease, 7 of whom had autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, there were 1,948 potential kidney donors (42% men; mean age, 43 years). A cortical, medullary, or parapelvic cyst ≥ 5 mm was present in 12%, 14%, or 2.8%. For ages 19–49 years, 39%, 22%, 7.9%, and 1.6% had a cortical or medullary cyst ≥ 2, ≥ 5, ≥ 10, and ≥ 20 mm in diameter. For ages 50–75 years, 63%, 43%, 22%, and 7.8% had a cortical or medullary cyst ≥ 2, ≥ 5, ≥ 10, and ≥ 20 mm in diameter. The 97.5th percentile for number of cortical and medullary cysts ≥ 5 mm increased with age (10 for men and 4 for women in the 60- to 69-year group). After age and sex adjustment, cortical and medullary cysts ≥ 5 mm were associated with higher 24-hour urine albumin excretion, as well as increased body surface area, hypertension, and higher glomerular filtration rate in some analyses. Angiomyolipomas, hyperdense cysts, and enhancing masses or cysts with concerning features for malignancy occurred in 2.2%, 1.2%, and 0.6% and were associated with older age (P ≤ 0.05 for each).

Limitations

Persons with known chronic kidney disease were excluded.

Conclusions

Renal cysts are common, particularly in older men, and may be a marker of early kidney injury because they associate with albuminuria, hypertension, and hyperfiltration.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^112amoY8]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Renal masses background and United States epidemiology indicates heterogeneity and burden: "Renal masses are a biologically heterogeneous group of tumors ranging from benign masses to cancers that can be indolent or aggressive", and "The true incidence of renal masses (including benign masses) is unknown". Among surgically resected small tumors, "benign masses comprise approximately 15–20 percent of surgically resected tumors < 4 cm", and "The vast majority (greater than 90%) of kidney cancers in the United States are renal cortical tumors known as RCC". For U.S. incidence, "It is estimated there will be over 73,000 new cases of kidney cancer in the United States in 2020", with rates that "has been increasing steadily since the 1970's in part due to more prevalent use of axial imaging (CT and MRI)" and, over the past decade, "approximately 1% per year". The increase has been concentrated in "small, clinically localized renal masses which now represent at least 40 percent of incident tumors".

### MDCT of blunt renal trauma: imaging findings and therapeutic implications [^1145YF91]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Non-operative management: "wait-and-see"

Parenchymal contusion (AAST grade I). Parenchymal contusions (Fig. 1a–b) appear as ill-defined, irregularly shaped areas of decreased and delayed contrast enhancement within the renal parenchyma. On non-enhanced images their density varies according to the time elapsed from the traumatic event, the patient's haematocrit and the coagulation status: typically they appear isoattenuating to the adjacent cortex, but hyperattenuation may also be observed if blood clots are present. The corticomedullary phase is not useful for identifying renal contusions because of the physiological heterogeneity of parenchymal enhancement. On the other hand, in the majority of the cases renal contusions are clearly recognisable during the nephrographic phase in which they usually appear slightly hypodense in comparison to the adjacent parenchyma; however, a substantial isodensity might be found if blood clots are present. On delayed acquisitions, contusions show persistent contrast retention, and this characteristic may be helpful for differentiating them from renal infarctions (Fig. 1c–d) that remain hypodense. A simple "wait-and-see" management is indicated in case of renal contusions, and no follow-up imaging studies are required if the clinical and laboratory data remain stable. Fig. 1 a – d Renal contusion (AAST grade I) (a and b) and renal infarction (AAST grade IV) (c and d). Axial multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) images (1.5 mm thick a and b; 3 mm thick c and d) acquired during the nephrographic phase (a and c) and the 8-min delayed phase (b and d) of the study in two different patients. Renal contusion appears as an ill-defined, irregularly shaped area of reduced contrast enhancement during the nephrographic phase (a, arrowhead) and tends to isodensity in the delayed phase (b, arrowhead), whereas segmental infarction appears as a wedge-shaped, sharply defined area of reduced/absent contrast enhancement during the nephrographic phase (c, arrow) and shows marked hypodensity also in the delayed phase (d, arrow)
Subcapsular haematoma (AAST grade I). Subcapsular haematoma (Fig. 2a–b) appears as a well-delimited, non-enhancing fluid collection located between the renal parenchyma and the renal capsule. Depending on its size, the collection may show a crescent or a biconvex shape; in the latter case, a mass effect is usually exerted on the adjacent parenchyma, which may become flattened or indented. The attenuation of the collection varies according to its age, and hyperdensity may be seen if blood clots are present. To be classified as a grade I lesion, a subcapsular haematoma must not be associated with parenchymal lacerations and no active contrast material extravasation should be observed; indeed, subcapsular haematomas are often associated with higher grade parenchymal lesions. Moreover, if a capsular lesion coexists, the haematoma often extends to the perirenal space (Fig. 2b). A simple "wait-and-see" management is indicated in case of subcapsular haematoma, and no follow-up imaging studies are required if the clinical and laboratory data remain stable. Fig. 2 a – b Subcapsular haematoma (AAST grade I) (a) and perirenal haematoma (AAST grade II) (b). The 3-mm-thick multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) coronal image (a) acquired during the delayed phase of the study shows a well-delimited hypodense biconvex-shaped collection (star), located between the renal parenchyma and renal capsule, which determines the mild mass effect on the adjacent parenchyma (arrowheads), representing subcapsular haematoma. A similar finding may also be observed in the 3-mm-thick multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) axial image (b) acquired during the nephrographic phase in another patient in which, however, an irregularly delimited inhomogenously hypodense collection, representing perirenal haematoma (arrowheads), is appreciable between the renal parenchyma and the Gerota fascia. In both cases neither parenchymal lacerations nor active contrast material extravasations can be observed
Perirenal haematoma (AAST grade II). Perirenal haematoma (Fig. 2b) appears as a poorly delimited, non-enhancing fluid collection located in the fatty area between the renal capsule and Gerota fascia. Its attenuation varies according to the age, appearing inhomogenously hyperattenuating in the acute/subacute stage and becoming progressively iso- or hypoattenuating in the chronic stage. Perirenal haematoma usually does not cause a mass effect on the adjacent renal parenchyma, but large haematomas may displace the kidney and nearby bowel and may also cross the midline, ventrally to the aorta and inferior vena cava, invading the contralateral perirenal space. An extension to the pelvis may also be observed in large perirenal haematomas. Although perirenal haematomas may represent isolated lesions, in most cases they are associated with parenchymal lacerations and the presence of opacified urine extravasation must be accurately ruled out by means of delayed scans. Moreover, particular attention must be paid to collections located medially to the renal hilum: in these cases, the presence of vascular pedicle and uretero-pelvic junction lesions must be ruled out accurately. The tiny perinephric strands that may be observed in patients with impaired renal function should not be misdiagnosed as perirenal haematomas: indeed, these strands are homogeneously hypodense, bilateral and surround the entire kidneys. In case of isolated perirenal haematomas, a simple "wait-and-see" management is indicated and no follow-up imaging studies are required if the clinical and laboratory data remain stable.
Parenchymal laceration not involving the collecting system (AAST grade II-III): Parenchymal lacerations (Fig. 3a–b) appear as irregular or linear clefts of absent contrast enhancement, starting from the renal surface and extending deep into the renal parenchyma, and they are best depicted during the nephrographic phase. Their attenuation varies according to their age and the presence of blood clots, and they are usually associated with perirenal haematomas. If a parenchymal laceration is present, delayed acquisitions should be performed in order to rule out urine extravasation (Fig. 3b). Moreover, it is extremely important to exclude the presence of active contrast material extravasation. The AAST subdivides parenchymal lacerations into grade II if they extend less than 1 cm in depth and grade III if they extend more than 1 cm; in any case, there is no difference in the treatment of grade II and III lesions, which must follow the simple "wait-and-see" management. No follow-up imaging studies are required if the clinical and laboratory data remain stable. Fig. 3 a – b Parenchymal laceration not involving the collecting system (AAST grade II–III). On these 3-mm-thick multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) axial images acquired during the nephrographic (a) and 8-min delayed phase (b) of the study in the same patient, a linear cleft of absent contrast enhancement (arrow) starting from the renal surface and extending deep into the renal parenchyma is clearly appreciable, representing parenchymal laceration. On delayed image (b), no lack of hyperdense urine can be seen, excluding collecting system rupture. A perirenal haematoma (star) coexists posteriorly to the kidney
Segmental infarction (AAST grade IV). Segmental infarctions (Fig. 1c–d) appear as sharply demarcated, wedge-shaped areas of absent contrast enhancement, showing a subcapsular basis and apex directed to the hilum, and are the consequence of dissection and/or thrombosis of segmental vessels. Sharp margins and lack of enhancement during the delayed phase are the characteristics that must be identified in order to perform a differential diagnosis with renal contusions (Fig. 1a–b). The coexistence of multiple infarctions is quite frequent. A simple "wait-and-see" management is indicated in the majority of cases, whereas surgical debridement is indicated in case of infarctions involving more than 50% of the renal parenchyma. No follow-up imaging studies are required if the clinical and laboratory data remain stable, whereas a CT scan is mandatory in case of pain development in order to exclude colliquation or abscess formation, findings that imply surgical exploration.
" Shattered kidney " (AAST grade V). The term "shattered kidney" is used to describe a kidney ruptured in multiple fragments by severe and deep lacerations (Fig. 4a–b). Renal fragments are usually surrounded and subdivided by a fluid collection that occupies the entire renal loggia; some parenchymal fragments may appear devitalised or non-enhancing because of traumatic occlusion of their arterial supply. Particular attention must be paid to excluding the presence of active contrast material extravasation and urine leakage: indeed, if these are ruled out, an increasing number of reports suggest that haemodynamically stable patients can be safely treated conservatively by means of a simple "wait-and-see" treatment, whereas surgical exploration should be reserved for haemodynamically unstable patients and endovascular and/or endourological treatments for patients showing blood and/or urine extravasation. Due to the severity of the injury, follow-up CT studies might represent a reasonable option in these patients, also in case of clinical and laboratory stability, in particular in order to detect vascular complications early, such as pseudoaneurysms and artero-venous fistulae, which might have life-threatening effects in an acute setting. Fig. 4 a – b Shattered kidney (AAST grade V). The 3-mm-thick multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) coronal image (a) acquired during the nephrographic phase of the study shows a large inhomogenously hypodense collection occupying the renal and perirenal spaces with multiple vascularised kidney fragments within, representing a so-called shattered kidney. On the 10-mm-thick para-coronal maximum intensity projection (MIP) of the same series (b), the main branches of the right renal artery (arrowheads) can be accurately delimited and no active contrast material extravasation can be observed

Small and very-small renal masses — natural history and imaging correlates — are characterized by indolent behavior in many cases, with lesions less than 2 cm showing prospective active surveillance (AS) data where 10% or less progress to metastasis; solid tumor architecture is associated with malignancy, increasing tumor complexity correlates with malignancy and aggressive biology, and complex cystic masses such as Bosniak 3 category lesions often show indolent biology with favorable AS outcomes.

Special cases — acute renal colic: In patients with suspected stone-related obstruction, unenhanced helical computed tomography (CT) is described as the "procedure of choice", can ascertain stone size, and "cannot determine the functional status of the kidney"; the correct non‑stone diagnosis "can be made in approximately 50%" of symptomatic patients. Stone size informs management: "calculi smaller than 5 mm generally pass spontaneously", "many calculi between 3 and 8 mm in size are followed up conservatively", and "larger stones (5–8 mm)… can be managed conservatively, whereas some small stones (3–5 mm) do result in high‑grade obstruction and may need more aggressive management". In the emergency room, "obtaining a diuretic renal scan… has been shown to direct patient management", and "one study found that the scan changed the decision to admit or discharge the patient in 30% of cases".

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^116fLQzw]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Active surveillance (AS) imaging — frequency, modalities, and biopsy: Patients with no prior imaging should have surveillance imaging initially every 3 to 6 months to assess for interval growth and other changes in a small renal mass. The preferred modality is not well established, but initial imaging should preferably consist of contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging, after which subsequent imaging may include the same or when appropriate an abdominal ultrasound (US) can be substituted. Abdominal US (as opposed to retroperitoneal US) may have the additional benefit of a survey of the intraabdominal organs for progression, and differences in tumor dimension measurements between these different modalities may be significant and should be interpreted with caution when making treatment decisions. For risk stratification during AS, renal mass biopsy (RMB) can be considered for additional risk stratification for patients with solid masses on AS, whereas for patients with predominantly cystic lesions, RMB should be avoided.

Renal mass biopsy (RMB) counseling and safety emphasize that RMB is generally safe with low risk of significant complications (bleeding) and no reported cases of tumor seeding using contemporary techniques, and that a diagnosis of malignancy or RCC on RMB is highly reliable; potential limitations include that a benign lesion must be distinguished from a non-diagnostic biopsy (renal parenchyma or connective tissues), a benign biopsy may not always correlate with resected histology, grading of tumor from RMB compared with resected tissue is imperfect, oncocytic neoplasms may represent a diagnostic dilemma, and biopsy or aspiration of cystic renal masses is generally not advised due to concerns regarding tumor spillage and a high likelihood of obtaining a non-informative result due to sampling error.

### Imaging features, follow-up, and management of incidentally detected renal lesions [^114WBTXb]. Clinical Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Incidental renal masses are common findings on cross-sectional imaging. Most will be readily identified as simple cysts, but with an inexorable rise in abdominal imaging, [particularly computed tomography (CT)], coupled with a rise in the incidence of renal cancer, the likelihood of detecting a malignant mass is increasing. This review informs the radiologist which lesions can be safely ignored, which will require further imaging for accurate categorization, and which require referral for consideration of treatment. For the small proportion of lesions that are indeterminate, careful attention to imaging technique, and the use of unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in all but a few specific instances will accurately characterize such lesions. The figures have been chosen to illustrate specific imaging features of common renal lesions. Management options for malignant, or presumed malignant, renal masses include active surveillance, percutaneous ablation, laparoscopic or open, partial or total nephrectomy. Biopsy has a role in determining the nature of masses that remain indeterminate on cross-sectional imaging, prior to definitive treatment. Common pitfalls in assessing incidental renal lesions are emphasized; some of these are due to sub-optimal imaging techniques and others to errors in interpretation.

Follow-up after tumor ablation (TA) — Patients undergoing ablative procedures with biopsy that confirmed malignancy or was nondiagnostic should undergo pre- and post-contrast cross-sectional abdominal imaging within 6 months (if not contraindicated), and subsequent follow-up should be according to the recommendations for the IR postoperative protocol (Table 1). This recommendation is based on a 5–10% failure rate of ablative therapy and places a high value on the early detection by CT or MRI scans to direct patient retreatment and successful salvage.

### Controversies in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS): pregnancy, paediatric, abdominal trauma, complex renal cysts, and endovascular aortic repair follow-up [^1112DznR]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Contraindications to the use of CEUS, inadequate visualisation of the target area and the lack of expertise are the main limitations.

Future perspectives

When US visualisation is adequate and local expertise is available, immediate characterisation of incidentally found features and effective follow-up may be accomplished. CEUS permits characterisation of indeterminate lesions at CT or MR imaging, can be used in patients who cannot tolerate CT and MR imaging or when kidney insufficiency is present; CEUS is the most cost-effective technique. The role of CECT in complex renal cyst evaluation and follow-up should diminish.

This raises important questions for the radiologist. Why should predominantly benign cysts be repeatedly examined by CECT over a period of years, using a radiation-intensive procedure, while this is also possible using a less expensive procedure with fewer side effects? MR imaging can be used for Bosniak III cysts and is recommended in Bosniak IV before surgery. CT imaging is better applied for staging malignancies prior to surgery (Fig. 4).

Laparoscopic nephron-sparing surgery

Preoperative assessment

The RENAL (Radius, Exophytic, Nearness, Anterior, Location) nephrometry score (Table 1) was recently introduced as a reproducible means to describe the relevant tumour anatomy, stratify the complexity of renal masses, and objectively compare perioperative and long-term outcomes. The RENAL score includes the five most reproducible features — namely, diameter, exophytic or endophytic growth, proximity to the collecting system, anterior versus posterior location and relationship to the polar lines, which should be assessed on volumetric contrast-enhanced multidetector CT including renal vascular, parenchymal and excretory imaging (Fig. 1). Tumour staging and complexity dictate the urologist's therapeutic choice: increasing RENAL scores were found to be strongly associated with RN and O-PN rather than L-NSS.

Table 1
RENAL nephrometry score (adapted from Parsons et al.)

Fig. 1
Examples of RENAL nephrometry scores. Total body contrast-enhanced multidetector CT (a, b) performed for clinical suspicion of systemic lymphoproliferative disease in a healthy 61-year-old woman led to incidental detection of a 2.5-cm, vascularised, partially (< 50%) exophytic mass at the middle third of the right kidney (arrows), consistent with T1 stage renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Nephrometry resulted 1 + 2 + 2 + p + 3 (8p). The patient underwent laparoscopic nephron-sparing surgery (L-NSS) complicated by haematoma (see Fig. 5). Multiphase CT-urography (c – e) in a 55-year-old man confirmed ultrasound detection of a 43-mm, inhomogeneously enhancing, left-sided RCC. The lesion appeared partially exophytic, crossed the inferior polar line (d) and touched the lower pole calyx (e). Nephrometry score was 2 + 2 + 3 + a + 2 (9a).

Pediatric [99mTc]Tc-DMSA renal cortical scintigraphy — normal examination anatomic variants are outlined: Kidney contours are typically rounded with contrast between the hyperactive cortex and hypoactive central portions; kidney contour can be flat without suggesting a lesion due to splenic impression or triangular shaped kidneys in young children; a rotated kidney can appear as a slender kidney with a short transverse axis on the posterior view; the transverse axis can be shorter at either the upper or lower pole producing a pear-shaped kidney; the renal poles, particularly the upper pole, can appear focally hypointense due to a column of Bertin or attenuation by the adjacent liver and relative hyperintensity in midzone parenchyma can create the illusion of bipolar hypointensity; a linear area of no tracer uptake visible on SPECT imaging only represents an inter-renicular septum and should not be confused with a scar; fetal lobulation or a junctional parenchymal defect are anatomic variants that can be difficult to distinguish from scarring with renal scintigraphy alone, and ultrasound imaging may be required to make the distinction.

Active surveillance (AS) intensity and decision support: It is recognized that not all patients on AS will require the same intensity of surveillance as their tumor biology, risk calculations and tradeoffs, and personal objectives may differ, and some patients may therefore require more intensive AS while others require less intensive AS. The decision as to the frequency and type of imaging modality must therefore be customized and informed by robust communication focusing on goals, risks and triggers for intervention, and RMB can be a helpful adjunct to guide these clinical decisions (see statement 10).

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of contrast-enhanced ultrasound [^1128SYZX]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Renal — Because of the highly vascular nature of the kidney, CEUS can be performed with less than the standard dose, and imaging may be performed continuously or intermittently from contrast injection. Intermittent imaging (viewing for 3–5 seconds every 30–60 seconds) may be performed to evaluate washout, which is helpful to differentiate pseudo-masses from true neoplasms, and lesion characterization often requires comparison to adjacent renal parenchyma; therefore, ensuring a segment of parenchyma is within the field of view during the contrast injection is important for comparison with the target lesion.

### Hyperattenuating renal masses: etiologies, pathogenesis, and imaging evaluation [^1138Y1jq]. Radiographics (2007). Low credibility.

Some renal masses have higher attenuation than the surrounding renal parenchyma at computed tomography (CT). Their hyperattenuation is usually the result of proteinaceous fluid or densely packed cells. Most hyperattenuating renal masses are benign hemorrhagic or proteinaceous cysts. However, solid enhancing hyperattenuating renal masses may have malignant as well as benign causes. Possible malignant causes include renal cell carcinoma and lymphoma; benign causes include angiomyolipoma with minimal fat. It is important to identify the cause of a hyperattenuating renal mass so as to avoid unnecessary surgical resection or ablation. CT may be useful for diagnosing benign hyperattenuating renal cysts, hematomas, and vascular anomalies that appear masslike. However, some solid, enhancing, hyperattenuating masses cannot be diagnosed confidently with CT alone: Small (≤ 3-cm-diameter), homogeneously enhancing, hyperattenuating renal masses depicted on CT images may be either benign angiomyolipomas with minimal fat or renal cell carcinomas. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may be helpful for differentiating between angiomyolipomas with minimal fat and clear cell renal cell carcinomas; however, differentiation between angiomyolipomas with minimal fat and papillary renal cell carcinomas often is not possible on the basis of MR imaging. In such cases, a percutaneous biopsy may be useful for diagnosis. If the results of MR imaging and percutaneous biopsy are not definitive, surgery is warranted.

### Pitfalls in renal mass evaluation and how to avoid them [^111kGmtL]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

Characterization of renal masses with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is usually clear-cut and accurate. However, potential pitfalls exist in diagnosis of renal masses, and it is necessary to understand these pitfalls to avoid misdiagnosis and possibly unnecessary surgery. Although some of the pitfalls are related to technical factors of the CT and MR imaging equipment, others are related to errors in image interpretation. To maximize detection and characterization of renal masses, the study should include images obtained before and after administration of intravenous contrast material, including images obtained during the nephrographic phase of enhancement. One should be aware of the potential unreliability of absolute Hounsfield unit measurements and of the existence of possible CT pseudoenhancement. When CT results are indeterminate, MR imaging may be helpful in demonstrating enhancement in renal masses. Before diagnosing a renal mass as a malignant neoplasm or suggesting surgery for a renal mass, one should consider alternative benign diagnoses; when appropriate, previous images or a supporting history should be obtained.

Presentation and diagnosis of RCC — symptom patterns, incidental detection, and examination findings are characterized: The "classic triad" of symptoms associated with a malignant renal mass includes hematuria, flank pain and abdominal mass, and these symptoms are uncommon in clinically localized disease; in fact, less than 5 percent of patients in contemporary series present with these symptoms and greater than 50 percent of renal masses are diagnosed incidentally during an evaluation for unrelated signs or symptoms; physical examination has a limited role in the diagnosis of clinically localized disease, while paraneoplastic syndromes (i.e., hypertension, polycythemia, hypercalcemia) are present in approximately 10–20 percent of patients with metastatic RCC.

### Active surveillance of small renal masses [^115EATJB]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Indeterminate renal mass by CT in an 82-year-old patient. a Axial unenhanced and (b) enhanced CT showing a renal mass with attenuation greater than 20 HU in unenhanced CT that enhances less than 20 HU after contrast administration, considered indeterminate by CT (arrows). c Unenhanced and (d) contrast-enhanced ultrasound (US) of the same lesion clearly depicting enhancement of this lesion consistent with a solid renal tumor (arrows), thereby allowing an indeterminate CT renal mass to be reliably classified as a solid mass

AS is indicated only in SRMs which are regular in shape since masses with irregular borders are highly suspicious of being an aggressive tumor (Fig. 6). Renal masses with fat attenuation areas by CT or MR (macroscopic renal fat) without associated calcification are consistent with angiomyolipomas and must be managed separately and not by AS.

Fig. 6
Solid renal masses in two elderly patients with regular and irregular borders. a Axial contrast-enhanced CT in the arterial phase shows a hyperdense right renal mass with smooth margins and regular shape (arrow) which, if indicated, can be managed with active surveillance. b Axial contrast-enhanced CT scan in the nephrographic phase depicting a hypodense renal mass with irregular borders (arrow). Active surveillance is not indicated in this case

Localized renal masses mean that the tumor is contained by the capsule, independently of the size. If the tumor invades the capsule, the sinus, the renal vein, and the perirenal fat or has positive lymphatic or hematogenous spread, it is not considered a localized tumor, and AS is not an option.

Laboratory investigations revealed a haemoglobin level of 133 g/L, total leucocyte count of 7.0 x 10 99 /L and platelet counts of 147 x 10 9 /L. Her viral markers were all negativend her coagulation profile was within normal limits. Liver function tests, renal function tests, C reactive protein, plasma and urinary fractionated free metanephrines, anti-citrullinated antibody, rheumatoid factor assay, anti-p-ANCA and anti-c-ANCA were all within the normal range. The patient underwent contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) of the abdomen, which showed a well-defined suprarenal fluid-attenuating lesion (figure 1) measuring 7.7×7.8 cm in the axial plane and 10.4 cm in the craniocaudal extent, with thin marginal calcification at places. The lesion was superior to the upper pole of the left kidney just abutting the left adrenal gland and posterior to the tail of the pancreas. There was no evidence of any obvious enhancing solid component or any regional lymphadenopathy. Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy was done, which showed no abnormality.

Fig. 2
PET/CT scan on reveals an occupying lesion, approximately 4.7 × 5.7 × 5.1 cm in size, in the upper pole of the left kidney. The early SUVmax is 14.5 and the delayed SUVmax is 21.7. The upper segment of the left ureter is thickened and occluded

The patient underwent after laparoscopic radical left nephrectomy under general anesthesia on February 2, 2019. Intraoperatively, a solid mass, 5 cm ╳ 4.5 cm ╳ 2.5 cm in size, was observed in the upper pole of the left kidney. The cut surface appeared beige brown and the tumor margin was 0.5 cm from the renal pelvis. Grossly, the tumor mass invaded the renal capsule. No obviously enlarged lymph nodes were palpitated. The body temperature became normal (36.3) on the first postoperative day and postoperative ALT was 63 U/L. Postoperative pathology suggested renal medullary carcinoma (Fig. 3) and immunohistochemistry revealed CK19 (partially+), PAX-8 (partially+), S-100 (scattered +), HMB45 (−), vimentin (+), CK7(−), AE1/AE3(+), CEA(−), CD10 (weakly +), Ki67 (index 50%), OCT3/4 (−), CAM5.2 (weakly +), and p63 (partially+) (Fig. 3). His serum creatinine was 90 μmol/L and BUN was 6.69 mmol/L on February 9, 2019. The patient was discharged from the hospital on February 11, 2019. The patient was followed up every 3 months and no tumor recurrence or metastasis occurred at the final follow up at 9 months.

### ACR appropriateness criteria indeterminate renal mass [^1154taUL]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Renal masses are increasingly detected in asymptomatic individuals as incidental findings. An indeterminate renal mass is one that cannot be diagnosed confidently as benign or malignant at the time it is discovered. CT, ultrasonography, and MRI of renal masses with fast-scan techniques and intravenous (IV) contrast are the mainstays of evaluation. Dual-energy CT, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, PET/CT, and percutaneous biopsy are all technologies that are gaining traction in the characterization of the indeterminate renal mass. In cases in which IV contrast cannot be used, whether because of IV contrast allergy or renal insufficiency, renal mass classification with CT is markedly limited. In the absence of IV contrast, ultrasonography, MRI, and biopsy have some advantages. Owing to the low malignant and metastatic potential of small renal cell carcinomas (≤ 4 cm in diameter), active surveillance is additionally emerging as a diagnostic strategy for patients who have high surgical risk or limited life expectancy. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 3 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and application by the panel of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### The incidental renal mass [^116m5aTj]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Incidental renal masses are extremely common. Although most represent benign renal cysts, not all incidental renal masses are benign. Most renal cell carcinomas are discovered incidentally when an imaging examination is performed to evaluate a nonrenal complaint. Therefore, differentiating incidental benign renal masses from those that are potentially malignant is important. There are well-established, time-tested, image-based criteria that can be used to diagnose most renal masses definitively. However, some renal masses remain indeterminate even after a thorough evaluation with imaging. This article discusses the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment options of the incidental renal mass.

### Clinical and pathological analysis of primary well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors in the kidney-a case series [^111BnkjU]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Clinical characteristics (Summarized in Table 1)

The four patients were all female with a mean onset age of 55 ± 7.83 years. Two patients were detected with renal masses during routine abdominal ultrasound examinations (one of whom occasionally experienced mild low back pain), one patient was found to have a left renal mass on follow-up abdominal CT after resection of a uterine malignant tumor, and one patient was incidentally discovered with a renal mass during abdominal ultrasound examination for complaints of "palpitations and fatigue". None of the patients had a history of horseshoe kidney.

Imaging Findings: All four patients presented with well-defined renal masses. Two lesions appeared roundish, while the other two exhibited partially irregular contours. Contrast-enhanced imaging demonstrated mild and heterogeneous enhancement in all patients. Notably, one mass contained small calcifications and fat densities, initially raising suspicion for angiomyolipoma (a potential diagnostic pitfall). Additionally, three patients showed small, non-enhancing, round hypodense cysts with sharp margins, consistent with concomitant renal cysts. None of the patients exhibited horseshoe kidney morphology. Radiologic Interpretation: Three masses were radiologically suggestive of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), while one was considered a probable angiomyolipoma (due to fat components). The lesions were located in the right renal parenchyma (3 patients) and left renal parenchyma (1 patient). Tumor sizes ranged from 4 to 8 cm (mean: 6.1 ± 2.2 cm), with three exceeding 5 cm in diameter.

### Bosniak classification of cystic renal masses, version 2019: an update proposal and needs assessment [^113xpUtS]. Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for renal cysts, more specifically with respect to bosniak classification, N/A 2019 guidelines recommend to use the Bosniak classification (2019 version) to classify cystic renal masses on CT:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Class I|- Well-defined, thin (≤ 2 mm) smooth wall <br/> - Homogeneous simple fluid (-9 to 20 HU) <br/> - No septa or calcifications <br/> - The wall may enhance|
|Class II|- Six types, all well-defined with thin (≤ 2 mm) smooth walls <br/> - 1. Cystic masses with thin (≤ 2 mm) and few (1–3) septa, septa and wall may enhance, may have calcification of any type <br/> - 2. Homogeneous hyperattenuating (≥ 70 HU) masses at non-contrast CT <br/> - 3. Homogeneous non-enhancing masses > 20 HU at renal mass protocol CT, may have calcification of any type <br/> - 4. Homogeneous masses -9 to 20 HU at non-contrast CT <br/> - 5. Homogeneous masses 21 to 30 HU at portal venous phase CT <br/> - 6. Homogeneous low-attenuation masses that are too small to characterize|
|Class IIF|- Cystic masses with a smooth minimally thickened (3 mm) enhancing wall, or <br/> - Smooth minimal thickening (3 mm) of ≥ 1 enhancing septa, or <br/> - Many (≥ 4) smooth thin (≤ 2 mm) enhancing septa|
|Class III|- ≥ 1 enhancing thick (≥ 4 mm width) or enhancing irregular (displaying ≤ 3 mm obtusely margined convex protrusions) wall or septa|
|Class IV|- ≥ 1 enhancing nodules (≥ 4 mm convex protrusion with obtuse margins, or a convex protrusion of any size that has acute margins).|

### ACR appropriateness criteria® indeterminate renal mass [^115Fwq3N]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Renal masses are increasingly detected in asymptomatic individuals as incidental findings. CT and MRI with intravenous contrast and a dedicated multiphase protocol are the mainstays of evaluation for indeterminate renal masses. A single-phase postcontrast dual-energy CT can be useful when a dedicated multiphase renal protocol CT is not available. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound with microbubble agents is a useful alternative for characterizing renal masses, especially for patients in whom iodinated CT contrast or gadolinium-based MRI contrast is contraindicated. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### EUS-guided FNA aspiration of kidney masses: a multicenter U.S. experience [^115qnvUM]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Tissue sampling of renal lesions is traditionally performed with percutaneous US or CT guidance. To date, only 3 known cases of EUS-guided FNA (EUS-FNA) of a renal mass have been reported.

Objective

To describe a multicenter experience with the indications, yield, and complications from attempted EUS-FNA of a kidney mass.

Design

Retrospective case series.

Setting

Six tertiary referral hospitals in the United States.

Patients

Consecutive subjects undergoing attempted EUS-FNA of a kidney mass. Endosonographers at 15 other teaching hospitals were contacted regarding EUS findings and follow-up of any EUS-guided renal biopsies previously attempted or considered at that institution.

Interventions

EUS-FNA of a kidney mass.

Main Outcome Measurements

Biopsy indications, yield, diagnosis, and complications.

Results

Fifteen procedures in 15 patients (9 men; median age 67 years) were performed at 6 (37%) of 16 hospitals (Indiana University plus 15 other hospitals). Kidney masses (median diameter 32 mm; range 11–60 mm) were located in the upper (n = 12) and lower (n = 3) poles of the left (n = 10) and right (n = 5) kidneys, respectively. Initial mass detection was by previous imaging in 13 (87%) patients or by EUS in 2 (13%) patients. Results of EUS-FNA (median 3 passes; range 2–4 passes) in 13 (87%) procedures were diagnostic of (n = 7) or highly suspicious for (n = 1) renal cell carcinoma (RCC), atypical cells (n = 2), oncocytoma (n = 1), benign cyst (n = 1), and nondiagnostic (n = 1). No complications were encountered. Surgical resection confirmed RCC in 7 patients in whom preoperative EUS-FNA demonstrated RCC (n = 5) or oncocytoma (n = 1) or was not performed (n = 1).

Limitations

Retrospective series, small number of patients.

Conclusions

EUS-FNA of renal masses is rarely performed at the U.S. teaching hospitals surveyed. This technique appears safe and feasible and should be considered when results would affect patient management.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^1112Ss94]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Imaging techniques — contrast-enhanced axial imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is preferred for diagnosing and staging localized renal masses, confirmation is advised after ultrasound (US) or intravenous pyelography, and a notable fraction of localized masses are benign; contrast-enhanced imaging also characterizes morphology and spread. Pre and post contrast-enhanced axial imaging, either CT or MRI, is the ideal imaging technique for the diagnosis and staging of clinically localized renal masses. Masses initially diagnosed by US or intravenous pyelography should be confirmed with pre/post contrast-enhanced imaging. Depending on tumor size, 20 to 30 percent of clinically localized renal masses may be benign. Contrast-enhanced abdominal imaging (CT or MRI) best characterizes the mass, provides information regarding renal morphology (of the affected and contralateral kidney), assesses extrarenal tumor spread (venous invasion or regional lymphadenopathy) and evaluates the adrenal glands and the abdominal organs for visceral metastases.

### Cystic renal masses: old and new paradigms [^114A9pTK]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Cystic renal masses describe a spectrum of lesions with benign and/or malignant features. Cystic renal masses are most often identified incidentally with the Bosniak classification system stratifying their malignant potential. Solid enhancing components most often represent clear cell renal cell carcinoma yet display an indolent natural history relative to pure solid renal masses. This has led to an increased adoption of active surveillance as a management strategy in those who are poor surgical candidates. This article provides a contemporary overview of historical and emerging clinical paradigms in the diagnosis and management of this distinct clinical entity.

### Cortical thickness: an early morphological marker of atherosclerotic renal disease [^116viR4P]. Kidney International (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Although kidney size is still the most commonly used morphological parameter, it is not sensitive enough for early detection of atherosclerotic renal disease (ARD). The purpose of this work was to evaluate morphological abnormalities on both post-stenotic and contralateral kidneys, by using spiral computed tomography angiography (CTA).

Methods

Spiral CTA was performed in 49 hypertensive patients. Renal diameters, renal length, and cortical thickness were measured in 26 post-stenotic kidneys, 26 contralateral kidneys and 46 control kidneys. Mean cortical thickness, cortical area, and medullary length were calculated.

Results

The right and left control kidneys were of comparable morphology. The post-stenotic kidneys showed significant cortical atrophy. The contralateral kidneys also underwent cortical disease, as judged by comparison with control kidneys. A threshold of 800 mm2 was identified for the cortical area that allowed us to distinguish control kidneys from post-stenotic kidneys. Similarly, a threshold of 8 mm was identified for mean cortical thickness. Renal length was still within normal range in all kidney groups. The measurement of superior pole segments appeared to be more sensitive than measurement at other locations for identifying significant intrarenal lesions. There was no significant correlation between clinical and morphological parameters.

Conclusions

These results suggest that cortical parameters are more sensitive for early diagnosis of ARD than kidney size. Cortical atrophy should be a useful marker for guidance for revascularization.

### Unusual cause of dysphagia [^117XYQtV]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Investigations

As mentioned above, the patient had barium swallow study and oesophageal manometry done during his recent admission in another hospital. The barium swallow study had shown 'bird beak' appearance, which is a key radiological feature of achalasia. He then underwent oesophageal manometry and the following test pressures were recorded:
Lower oesophageal sphincter basal pressure: 8.9 mm Hg, residual pressure: 9.3 mm Hg.
Upper oesophageal sphincter basal pressure: 48.9 mm Hg, residual pressure: 7.5 mm Hg.

Such pressures are not typical of achalasia. The patient was further investigated with gastroscopy, which showed oesophageal dilation and gastritis.

During his admission at our hospital, initial blood investigations on presentation were significant for elevated white cell count (16.2×10 9 /L) and neutrophilia (13.5×10 9 /L). Other blood investigations were unremarkable on admission. Additionally, an erect chest X-ray performed initially was also normal with no evidence of hiatal hernia.

A CT abdomen and pelvis (CTAP) revealed a large left intrarenal multiloculated lesion of simple fluid density measuring 110×201×212 mm which appeared to be arising from the renal pelvis, was compressing and displacing the stomach and other abdominal organs (figure 1). The left distal ureter was not dilated and had no evidence of calcification or mass. There was marked dilation of the oesophagus with air fluid level (figure 2). It was suggested that the large cystic renal mass was most likely secondary to a chronic pelviureteric junction obstruction. Small right-sided renal cysts were also observed. There were no masses external to the ureter seen to suggest external obstruction.

Imaging of renal masses and infection-related defects indicates that space occupying lesions can be detected by functional imaging as parenchymal defects; however, ultrasound, CT and MR imaging are best suited for evaluation of renal masses and should be recommended when regional defects in the parenchyma are detected. Functional imaging may play a role before surgical interventions to predict expected residual renal function after partial or complete unilateral nephrectomy. Infectious/inflammatory diseases may result in reduced parenchymal function, and renal cortical defects may be seen in focal pyelonephritis, renal abscess, and with post pyelonephritic scarring.

### Management of small renal masses: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline… [^112D2Ap2]. ASCO (2017). Low credibility.

1On rare occasions, SRMs may be unusual malignant tumor types, such as lymphoma, sarcoma, or a metastasis to the kidney. More than one imaging modality may be required to confirm that the lesion is solid and/or enhancing. In certain cases, noncontrast computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging can detect macroscopic fat within the mass, which is consistent with an angiomyolipoma — a benign tumor — that, when small, can often be managed conservatively. 89and include benign, indolent, and more aggressive tumors. A large series of surgically resected SRMs concluded that a substantial proportion of these lesions are benign. 90In larger masses, the likelihood of malignancy increases, and radiologic features, branched renal vein tumor extension, and peritumoral infiltration or neovascularity may also indicate a potentially malignant tumor.

Predominantly cystic masses, those originating in the collecting system, or a clinical suspicion for urothelial cancer should not undergo biopsy. In addition to histopathologic characterization, biopsy tissue may provide prognostic information, such as grade, and with further research, biomarker expression may one day guide patient management. Occasionally, a patient who is uncertain whether to undergo definitive treatment of an SRM may elect an RTB, and histopathologic characterization can significantly impact management. If a fat-poor angiomyolipoma is diagnosed, surgery is not indicated, whereas a clear-cell RCC in a young fit patient would more likely lead to intervention. Although helpful, there are challenges with RTB. Nondiagnostic biopsies occur in 10% to 20% of cases, and consideration for repeat biopsy or upfront treatment should be discussed with the patient.

A designation of oncocytic neoplasm can be challenging, as it is not always clear whether the lesion is a benign oncocytoma or a malignant variant. Most SRMs will grow slowly, and for ≤ 40%, no significant growth is documented at > 3 years, even in biopsy-proven RCC. 94, 95Growth alone is not an indication of histology, as both benign and malignant lesions can grow at similar rates or not at all. 95The reported rate of metastasis is 1% to 2% in the first 3 years of surveillance; metastasis is usually preceded by rapid local growth that can be detected early on appropriately compared serial imaging. 17.
