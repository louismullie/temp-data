## Question

When should patients be referred for osteoporosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when patients should be referred for specialist evaluation for osteoporosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial risk assessment and screening thresholds in primary care. Then, I should verify what constitutes a complete primary evaluation, including DXA and lab work. Next, I need to identify "red flag" scenarios that warrant specialist input, including diagnostic complexity, secondary causes, treatment failure, and special populations. After that, I will consider care pathways and urgency, and finally, I should outline the key elements to document for an effective referral package, tying each step to guideline sources for rigor and clarity [^1171zEVi] [^116YNTfa] [^112dWsGE] [^113TBHaJ] [^116SHDPp].

> Let me first confirm the primary care starting point: systematic fracture risk assessment is appropriate for adults aged 50 and older, with formal screening for women ≥ 65 and for postmenopausal women < 65 at increased risk, typically using a validated risk tool such as FRAX to estimate absolute fracture risk before imaging decisions are made [^1171zEVi] [^113TBHaJ] [^116SHDPp] [^116YNTfa].

> I need to check the scope of the initial diagnostic evaluation at the primary care level before jumping to referral. That includes a detailed history and exam for risks and fractures, targeted labs to look for secondary causes, and appropriately indicated bone mineral density testing by DXA at the lumbar spine and hip (with femoral neck reported, and 1/3 radius if indicated), plus vertebral fracture assessment where risk or height loss suggests undiagnosed vertebral fractures, with attention to technical feasibility and alternatives such as forearm DXA when spine/hip interpretation is limited or in hyperparathyroidism [^114TKhem] [^116ZJjaF] [^116ngQh9] [^112dWsGE] [^1131ycLw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — diagnosis must be anchored to standard criteria. I should confirm that osteoporosis is diagnosed by T-score ≤ −2.5 at the spine, femoral neck, total hip, or 1/3 radius, or by the presence of a low-trauma fragility fracture in the absence of other metabolic bone disease, even if the BMD is not osteoporotic; if diagnosis is straightforward and management uncomplicated, primary care can initiate treatment, but if there is uncertainty, that's the fork in the road toward specialist referral [^113169v9] [^113WtQS2]. Wait, I initially thought the next "Step 4" was routine treatment, but I need to correct that — my focus here is on identifying red flags that shift care to a specialist rather than detailing standard treatment paths [^116du3Va].

> Next, I should review how to monitor response and detect treatment failure that triggers referral. Let me verify that serial DXA should be interpreted using site-specific least significant change thresholds and, if bone loss exceeds LSC or new fractures occur despite ≥ 12 months of appropriate therapy and adherence, this constitutes treatment failure; when no obvious, treatable cause explains the failure, specialist evaluation is indicated [^113TdJGi] [^116ngQh9] [^111JP4N6].

> I will now examine diagnostic complexity as a referral driver. Unexpectedly low BMD for age and risk profile, very young age at presentation (premenopausal women, men < 50), discordant or artifact-laden DXA results that impair interpretation, or inability to acquire valid spine/hip measurements due to obesity, arthritis, or hardware should prompt specialist input; I need to ensure DXA quality issues are considered because technical errors can masquerade as clinical deterioration and require expert review [^116du3Va] [^114VFyvg] [^1131ycLw].

> But wait, what if labs are abnormal and suggest a secondary bone disorder? I should confirm that unexplained abnormalities like high or low alkaline phosphatase, abnormal phosphorus, hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia, or other findings pointing to metabolic bone disease warrant referral for targeted evaluation beyond primary care capabilities [^116du3Va] [^113Y72hx].

> Let me consider comorbidities that complicate therapy decisions — this is another classic referral zone. Chronic kidney disease with reduced eGFR, primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, malabsorption states, endocrine disorders like hyperthyroidism, hypogonadism, and Cushing's, chronic liver disease, and complex polypharmacy impacting bone all justify specialist involvement to individualize risk-benefit decisions and sequencing of therapies [^113Y72hx] [^115XBqWG] [^1168P4zw].

> I should double-check treatment-related challenges as explicit triggers for referral. Refractures on therapy, continued bone loss at clinically meaningful rates (for example ≥ 3% per year) despite adherence, significant medication adverse effects, the need to sequence or transition therapies (e.g., bisphosphonate holiday decisions or switching from antiresorptive to anabolic), and osteoporosis diagnosed in the setting of cancer treatment typically exceed routine primary care scope and merit specialist guidance [^111JP4N6] [^111nBGr8] [^115V8szc].

> Now, fragility fracture scenarios deserve special attention. I need to ensure that any patient with a hip fracture gets immediate secondary fracture prevention and consideration of specialty or fracture liaison services; patients with low-trauma fractures despite normal BMD, multiple or recurrent fractures, or vertebral fractures requiring VFA interpretation are also appropriate for referral to optimize secondary prevention and clarify diagnosis [^115nToB8] [^113WtQS2] [^116ngQh9].

> Let me reconsider special populations where thresholds for referral are lower. Men with osteoporosis, particularly when unexplained, and premenopausal women with Z-scores ≤ −2.0 or with fragility fractures should generally be evaluated by specialists to assess secondary causes and nuanced management; substantial height loss (for example > 4 cm) suggesting multiple vertebral fractures or prolonged immobilization and complex endocrine disorders further strengthen the case for specialist assessment and VFA or spine imaging [^11381nMk] [^116du3Va] [^116ngQh9].

> Next, I should review the referral pathways and urgency. Hold on, I should verify that diagnostic uncertainty, suspected secondary causes, or treatment failure point toward referral to an osteoporosis specialist (endocrinology, rheumatology, geriatrics), whereas acute fragility fractures should trigger referral to a fracture liaison service when available; if DXA has not been performed and results would influence management, arrange imaging, but do not delay urgent secondary prevention after hip or multiple new vertebral fractures while waiting on scans [^116du3Va] [^113Y72hx] [^111JP4N6] [^115nToB8] [^116ngQh9].

> I need to ensure the referral is actionable by including the right data. The packet should compile clinical risk factors with a FRAX estimate, complete DXA reports with quality/precision notes and any VFA findings, pertinent labs (including calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D), current and prior osteoporosis medications with adherence assessment, detailed fracture history with imaging, and relevant comorbidities and medications; this supports efficient, targeted specialty care and aligns with guidance to consult experts when risk or treatment uncertainty persists [^115XBqWG] [^114VFyvg] [^1151q9st].

> Finally, let me synthesize the decision logic so I don't miss anything. Adults ≥ 50 undergo risk assessment with clinical tools and indicated DXA; straightforward osteoporosis can be managed in primary care, but I should verify that any red flag — diagnostic complexity, abnormal labs suggesting secondary causes, complicating comorbidities, treatment failure, characteristic fracture scenarios, or special populations — should prompt referral to an osteoporosis specialist or fracture liaison service as appropriate, with urgency calibrated to clinical severity and recency of fractures [^1171zEVi] [^116YNTfa] [^116du3Va] [^112dWsGE] [^115nToB8].

---

Refer to osteoporosis specialists when patients have **fragility fractures, T-score ≤ -2.5**, or **high FRAX risk** (≥ 20% major osteoporotic or ≥ 3% hip). Also refer if there is **continued bone loss or new fractures despite therapy** [^111JP4N6], suspected secondary osteoporosis, complex comorbidities (e.g. CKD, hyperparathyroidism, malabsorption) [^113Y72hx], or adverse effects from pharmacotherapy [^115XBqWG] [^1151q9st]. Additional triggers include unexpectedly low BMD, young age, unexplained lab abnormalities [^116du3Va], or normal BMD with fragility fracture [^113WtQS2]. Use FRAX [^116YNTfa] to guide risk-based referrals and consider VFA [^112dWsGE] or QCT [^111mHFqo] when indicated.

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting referral

### Fragility fractures and low bone mineral density

- **Fragility fractures**: Refer patients with fragility fractures, even with normal BMD, to an osteoporosis specialist or fracture liaison team [^113169v9] [^115nToB8].

- **Low BMD (T-score ≤ -2.5)**: Refer patients with T-score ≤ -2.5 at lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, or 1/3 radius.

- **Osteopenia with high fracture risk**: Refer patients with T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 and elevated FRAX risk (≥ 20% major osteoporotic or ≥ 3% hip).

---

### Continued bone loss or fractures despite therapy

Refer patients with **refractures or continued bone loss**, especially when no obvious treatable cause is identified [^111JP4N6], and those with **unexpectedly low BMD or at a young age**, unexplained DXA artifacts [^114VFyvg], or unexplained laboratory abnormalities (e.g. high/low ALP, low phosphorus) [^116du3Va].

---

### Secondary osteoporosis and complex comorbidities

Refer when **secondary osteoporosis** is suspected or confirmed (e.g. hyperparathyroidism, malabsorption, chronic glucocorticoid use) [^113Y72hx] [^116ZJjaF], and when **complex comorbidities** complicate management (e.g. decreased kidney function, hyperparathyroidism, malabsorption) [^113Y72hx].

---

### Adverse effects or intolerance to pharmacotherapy

Refer patients who experience significant **adverse effects** or intolerance to osteoporosis pharmacotherapy [^113Y72hx] [^115XBqWG].

---

## Diagnostic tools and criteria guiding referral

### Bone mineral density (BMD) testing

DXA is the **primary tool** for diagnosing osteoporosis and assessing fracture risk [^112dWsGE] [^1132QF39]. The **T-score criteria** define osteoporosis as T-score ≤ -2.5 and osteopenia as T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 [^113169v9].

---

### Fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX)

FRAX is the **preferred method** for estimating 10-year fracture risk and guiding referrals [^116YNTfa] [^111xPrfn]. Commonly used **FRAX thresholds** for referral are ≥ 20% major osteoporotic or ≥ 3% hip fracture risk.

---

### Vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) and quantitative CT (QCT)

VFA is used to detect **vertebral fractures** in patients with risk factors or T-score ≤ -1.0 [^112dWsGE], while **QCT** should be considered when DXA is limited by degenerative changes or artifacts [^111mHFqo] [^112dWsGE].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Fragility fracture | Refer to osteoporosis specialist or fracture liaison team [^115nToB8] |
| T-score ≤ -2.5 | Refer to osteoporosis specialist |
| Osteopenia with high FRAX risk | Refer to osteoporosis specialist [^114AoDiS] |
| Continued bone loss or refractures despite therapy | Refer to osteoporosis specialist [^111JP4N6] |
| Secondary osteoporosis or complex comorbidities | Refer to osteoporosis specialist [^113Y72hx] |
| Adverse effects or intolerance to pharmacotherapy | Refer to osteoporosis specialist [^113Y72hx] |

---

## Conclusion

Refer patients to osteoporosis specialists when they have **fragility fractures**, T-score ≤ -2.5, or high **FRAX risk** [^116YNTfa], and when there is continued bone loss or new fractures despite therapy [^111JP4N6], suspected **secondary osteoporosis** [^113Y72hx], complex comorbidities, or adverse effects from pharmacotherapy. Use DXA, FRAX, VFA, and QCT to guide referral decisions [^112dWsGE].

### ACR appropriateness criteria® osteoporosis and bone mineral density: 2022 update [^112dWsGE]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). High credibility.

Osteoporosis constitutes a significant public health risk. An estimated 10.2 million adults in the United States over 50 years of age have osteoporosis, a systemic condition that weakens the bones and increases the susceptibility to fractures. Approximately one-half of women and nearly one-third of men over 50 years of age will sustain an osteoporotic fracture. These fractures are associated with a decrease in quality of life, diminished physical function, and reduced independence.

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the primary imaging modality used to screen for osteoporosis in women over 65 years of age and men over 70 years of age. DXA may also be used in patients under 65 years of age to evaluate bone mass density if there are additional risk factors. In certain situations, vertebral fracture assessment and trabecular bone score may further predict fracture risk, particularly in patients who are not yet osteoporotic but are in the range of osteopenia. Quantitative CT is useful in patients with advanced degenerative changes in the spine.

Given the proven efficacy of pharmacologic therapy, the role of imaging to appropriately identify and monitor high-risk individuals is critical in substantially reducing osteoporosis-associated morbidity and mortality, and reducing the considerable cost to the healthcare system. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed sources.

### Patterns of bone mineral density testing: Current guidelines, testing rates, and interventions [^113jGCcz]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

To identify potential obstacles to bone mineral density (BMD) testing, we performed a structured review of osteoporosis screening guidelines, studies of BMD testing patterns, and interventions to increase BMD testing.

We searched MEDLINE and HealthSTAR from 1992 through 2002 using appropriate search terms. Two authors examined all retrieved articles, and relevant studies were reviewed with a structured data abstraction form.

A total of 235 articles were identified, and 51 met criteria for review: 24 practice guidelines, 22 studies of screening patterns, and 5 interventions designed to increase BMD rates. Of the practice guidelines, almost one half (47%) lacked a formal description of how they were developed, and recommendations for populations to screen varied widely. Screening frequencies among at-risk patients were low, ranging from 1% to 47%.

Only eight studies assessed factors associated with BMD testing. Female patient gender, glucocorticoid dose, and rheumatologist care were positively associated with BMD testing; female physicians, rheumatologists, and physicians caring for more postmenopausal patients were more likely to test patients. Five articles described interventions to increase BMD testing rates, but only two tested for statistical significance and no firm conclusions can be drawn.

This systematic review identified several possible contributors to suboptimal BMD testing rates. Osteoporosis screening guidelines lack uniformity in their development and content.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^115ceMto]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). High credibility.

The latest ISCD 2023 update adds the following:

- **Follow-up BMD testing**: Follow-up BMD testing can aid in monitoring response to therapy. It should be undertaken with clearly defined objectives and when the results are likely to influence patient management. Follow-up BMD testing should be performed if a fracture has occurred or new risk factors have developed but should not delay treatment for secondary fracture prevention. Repeat BMD testing should be used to monitor individuals prior to a temporary cessation of bisphosphonate therapy and during the period of planned interruption of treatment.

- **Repeat BMD testing intervals**: Repeat BMD testing intervals must be individualized considering an individual's age, baseline BMD, the type of pharmacological treatment, and the presence of clinical factors associated with bone loss. Shorter intervals between BMD testing may be indicated in the presence of factors associated with rapid change in bone mineral density. Examples include the use of certain medications such as glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, androgen deprivation therapy, and osteoanabolic therapies; medical disorders such as malabsorption and severe systemic inflammatory diseases; and other conditions such as prolonged immobilization, bariatric surgery, and surgical menopause.

- **Evaluation of changes in BMD**: If changes in BMD are outside the expected range for an individual patient and adequate scan quality has been confirmed, this should prompt consideration for a re-evaluation of the patient and plan of care. A DXA report (baseline and follow-up) should state that a follow-up exam is recommended as long as a valid comparison can be made.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis- 2020 update [^117LyP5D]. Endocrine Practice (2020). High credibility.

The objective of these guidelines, sponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) Board of Directors and the American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Board of Trustees, is to adhere to published AACE protocols for the standardized production of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Recommendations are based on diligent reviews of clinical evidence with transparent incorporation of subjective factors, following the established AACE/ACE guidelines for guideline protocols.

The Executive Summary of this 2020 updated guideline contains 52 recommendations: 21 Grade A (40%), 24 Grade B (46%), 7 Grade C (14%), and no Grade D (0%). These detailed, evidence-based recommendations allow for nuanced clinical decision-making that addresses multiple aspects of real-world patient care.

The evidence base, provided in the Appendix, supports the Executive Summary recommendations with 368 citations, categorized as follows: 123 (33.5%) evidence level (EL) 1 (highest), 132 (36%) EL 2 (intermediate), 20 (5.5%) EL 3 (weak), and 93 (25%) EL 4 (lowest).

New or updated topics in this CPG include clarification of the diagnosis of osteoporosis, stratification of patients according to high-risk and very-high-risk features, a new dual-action therapy option, and transitions from therapeutic options. This guideline serves as a practical tool for endocrinologists, physicians in general, regulatory bodies, health-related organizations, and interested laypersons regarding the diagnosis and evaluation of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

### Fall-related risk factors and osteoporosis in older women referred to an open access bone densitometry service [^115qGnET]. Age and Ageing (2005). Low credibility.

Both falls and low bone density are important in the pathogenesis of osteoporotic fractures. While bone density is routinely measured to assess fracture risk, little attention is given to the assessment of fall risk. In this study, we have determined the prevalence of and explored relationships between fall-related risk factors and osteoporosis in women referred to our open access bone densitometry service.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional study.

- **Setting**: Teaching hospital in south-west London, UK.

- **Subjects**: Older women referred for open access bone densitometry.

- **Measurements**: Bone densitometry by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and fall risk assessment (visual acuity, ability to perform five stand-ups without arm use, and ability to do heel-toe walking).

Data for 558 women seen over an 18-month period were examined. Their mean age was 74.8 years (range 65–93). Fall risk and femoral neck (FN) osteoporosis increased with age, with fall-related risk factors being more prevalent than FN osteoporosis at each tertile of age. Women with both FN osteoporosis and fall-related risk factors ranged from 7% in the youngest tertile to 22% in the oldest tertile. In women with FN osteoporosis, increased fall risk was found in 37% in the youngest tertile, increasing to 63% in the oldest tertile.

Fall-related risk factors are common in older women referred for open access bone densitometry. We recommend that both bone density and fall risk assessment, using simple screening tests for falls, are essential to determine fracture risk in older people referred for bone density evaluation.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^116ZUzhy]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

- **Reference database for BMD reporting**: The ISCD Official Positions recommend the use of a uniform White (non-race adjusted) female reference database for the calculation of T-scores in women and men of all ethnic groups. For the hip, many organizations (e.g. IOF, ESCEO, ISCD, WHO, BHOF) recommend the use of the NHANES III reference database in White women aged 20–29 years. When this database is used, T-scores at the femoral neck and total hip are similar between manufacturers. Of note, the left hip is used in NHANES, on which the normative database for T-score is based. However, for the lumbar spine and other skeletal sites, the database is manufacturer-specific. Clear examples of how they may differ are seen in the age-related curves on the normogram plots for the spine and forearm between GE and Hologic, shown in Figs. 2, 3, and 4.

- **Regional variations**: This may not be followed in all countries, and local application may vary, which will likely result in different T-scores and Z-scores. The T-scores and Z-scores are dependent on the measured BMD, the reference data utilized, the skeletal site being evaluated, as well as the method by which the T-score and Z-scores are derived, which can have a significant impact on the diagnosis.

- **Manufacturer differences**: BMD values cannot be directly compared amongst different manufacturers. If local reference data are available, they may be used to calculate Z-scores. The major DXA manufacturers have incorporated White-based reference peak BMD to calculate T-scores. However, there is considerable variation in the attainment of peak BMD depending…

### Clinical use of bone densitometry: Clinical applications [^1122YLZt]. JAMA (2002). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis represents a difficult problem for physicians because, although many diagnostic tests are available, interpreting their results is not straightforward. As a result, many patients, even those with clear indications such as long-term steroid therapy or vertebral fractures on radiography, do not get screened or treated. Evidence-based guidelines recommend screening for all white women older than 65 years and not already receiving osteoporosis treatment and for many nonwhite women. For postmenopausal women who are younger than 65 years and have strong risk factors for osteoporosis, screening may also be beneficial.

The optimal testing strategy depends on what is available locally. The best role for follow-up testing is still being defined, and interpretation of such testing is tricky. Reports of results can be hard to understand; a randomized controlled trial of clearer reports increased testing and decreased confusion about the meaning of test results. Densitometry might be more effectively used in practice if strategies such as having patients fill out a short questionnaire to assess for risk factors or creating a nurse-based system were used to identify patients.

Clinicians need better approaches for identifying patients most likely to benefit from screening, systems that facilitate their application, and test results that are easy to interpret.

### Management recommendations for osteoporosis in clinical guidelines [^116aJnmH]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Numerous guidelines advise about the management of osteoporosis, but little research has been conducted on their recommendations. We analyzed recommendations on the management of bone health in clinical guidelines. We surveyed recommendations on assessment, treatment, and monitoring of bone health in 78 clinical guidelines. Of these, 22 had a primary focus on osteoporosis, while 56 did not. These guidelines were lodged at the Agency for Health Research and Quality National Guidelines Clearinghouse between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2014.

- **Governance of guidelines**: Only 14% of guidelines discussed fracture risk in the target population.
- **Assessment**: When guidelines discussed assessment, 98% recommended bone mineral density (BMD) measurement, but only 27% recommended estimation of fracture risk.
- **Treatment**: When guidelines discussed treatment, 63–71% recommended calcium and/or vitamin D, while 90% recommended BMD measurements, and only 3% recommended estimation of fracture risk.
- **Monitoring**: About 65% of guidelines that suggested a BMD monitoring interval recommended one of ≤ 3 years. Compared to guidelines with a primary focus on osteoporosis, guidelines whose primary focus was not osteoporosis were less likely to discuss fracture risk in the target population.

### How would you manage this patient with osteoporosis? Grand rounds discussion from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [^113Dhr5S]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone strength that increases the risk for fracture. Approximately 10 million men and women in the United States have osteoporosis, and more than 2 million osteoporosis-related fractures occur annually. In 2016, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists issued the "Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis", and in 2017, the American College of Physicians issued the guideline "Treatment of Low Bone Density or Osteoporosis to Prevent Fracture in Men and Women". Both guidelines agree that patients diagnosed with osteoporosis should be treated with an antiresorptive agent, such as alendronate, which has been shown to reduce hip and vertebral fractures.

However, there is no consensus on how long patients with osteoporosis should be treated and whether bone density should be monitored during and after the treatment period. In this Beyond the Guidelines segment, two experts discuss the management of osteoporosis generally and for a specific patient. They also explore the role of bone density monitoring during and following a 5-year course of alendronate, as well as treatment recommendations for patients whose bone density decreases during or after this period.

### An updated reference for calculating bone mineral density T-scores [^111H4yTW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) T-score references may be updated when the peak BMD of the population is unclear and warrants reevaluation. The objective of this study was to update BMD T-score references using the peak BMD from the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data.

- **Methods**: This cross-sectional study used NHANES data from 2005 to 2014. Non-Hispanic White females between the ages of 10 and 40 years (N = 1549) were our target population to estimate peak BMD (SD). Individuals aged ≥ 50 years (N = 5523) were used to compare the percentages of osteoporosis and low bone mass based on existing and updated BMD T-score references. BMD data within the age at attainment of peak BMD ± 5 years were used to calculate updated BMD T-score references.

- **Results**: The updated average of BMD (SD) for diagnosing osteoporosis at the femoral neck and lumbar spine were 0.888 g/cm² (0.121 g/cm²) and 1.065 g/cm² (0.122 g/cm²), respectively. The percentages of individuals with osteoporosis at the femoral neck and low bone mass at the femoral neck and lumbar spine based on the updated BMD T-score references were higher than the percentages of people designated with these outcomes under the existing guidelines (P < 0.001). However, we observed the opposite pattern for lumbar spine osteoporosis (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: We calculated new BMD T-score references at the femoral neck and lumbar spine. We found significant differences in the percentages of individuals classified as having osteoporosis and low bone mass between the updated and existing BMD T-score references.

### Osteoporosis in men: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^117VhcBz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the management of osteoporosis in men. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe the strength of recommendations and evidence quality.

Consensus was guided by systematic evidence reviews, one in-person meeting, and multiple conference calls and emails. Task Force drafts were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and Clinical Affairs Core Committee; representatives of ASBMR, ECTS, ESE, and ISCD; and members at large. At each stage, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes. The reviewed document was approved by The Endocrine Society Council before submission for peer review.

Osteoporosis in men causes significant morbidity and mortality. We recommend testing higher risk men [aged ≥ 70 and men aged 50–69 who have risk factors (e.g. low body weight, prior fracture as an adult, smoking, etc)] using central dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Laboratory testing should be done to detect contributing causes. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and weight-bearing exercise should be encouraged, while smoking and excessive alcohol consumption should be avoided. Pharmacological treatment is recommended for men aged 50 or older who have had spine or hip fractures, those with T-scores of -2.5 or below, and men at high risk of fracture based on low bone mineral density and/or clinical risk factors. Treatment should be monitored with serial dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry testing.

### Treat-to-target for osteoporosis: Is now the time [^111VUTnZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines identify patients at high risk for fracture who are likely to benefit from pharmacological therapy and suggest ways to monitor for therapy effectiveness. However, there is no clear guidance on when fracture risk has been sufficiently reduced. As a result, some patients at low risk for fracture may be treated longer than necessary, whereas others at high risk may have treatment stopped prematurely, when continuation or a switch to a more potent therapeutic agent might be beneficial. This statement aims to describe the potential clinical utility of developing a "treat-to-target" strategy for managing patients with osteoporosis.

- **Participants**: We recommend a task force of clinicians, clinical investigators, and stakeholders in osteoporosis care explore options, review evidence, and identify additional areas for investigation to establish osteoporosis treatment targets.

- **Evidence**: Data from large, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled registration trials for currently available osteoporosis therapies should be analyzed to find commonalities between easily measured endpoints and fracture risk.

- **Consensus process**: Osteoporosis experts, professional organizations, and patient care advocates should be involved in developing consensus on measurable osteoporosis treatment targets supported by the best available evidence and likely accepted by clinicians and patients.

### Osteoporosis in men: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114TKhem]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for osteoporosis in men, the ES 2012 guidelines recommend a comprehensive approach during history and physical examination. It is advised to inquire about medications, chronic diseases, alcohol or tobacco abuse, falls and/or fractures, and family history of osteoporosis. Additionally, assess the patient's height compared to maximum height, kyphosis, balance, mobility, and overall frailty.

### Management of osteoporosis in survivors of adult cancers with nonmetastatic disease: ASCO clinical practice guideline [^1168P4zw]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for palliative care in patients with cancer, specifically concerning the management of osteoporosis (screening), ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend considering the use of a risk assessment tool, such as the WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool, to quantify the risk estimates for osteoporotic fracture in adult patients with nonmetastatic cancer. Recognize that existing risk assessment tools have not been validated in patients with cancer, and clinical judgment is necessary in interpreting results from these tools.

### Impact of systematic implementation of a clinical case finding strategy on diagnosis and therapy of postmenopausal osteoporosis [^115yj6UH]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2008). Low credibility.

Case finding for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women is advocated in osteoporosis guidelines, but implementation is unsatisfactory. We studied, in daily practice, the impact of systematic implementation of a previously validated clinical decision rule and fracture history on referral for bone densitometry (DXA) and drug prescription for osteoporosis.

- **Materials and methods**: Before-after impact analysis was conducted in 41,478 consecutive consulting postmenopausal women, included by 1,080 general practitioners (GPs) during a two-month period. The osteoporosis self-assessment (OST) index was used, based on age and weight, indicating women at low (LR), moderate (MR), and high risk (HR) for having osteoporosis (T-score < -2.5 in spine and/or hip), along with fracture history. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated between referrals before (n = 6,580) and after intervention (n = 10,379) and between risk subgroups.

- **Results**: The post-intervention RR for referral for DXA was 1.9 (95% CI, 1.8–2.0). Compared with LR women with prior DXA, the RR was 6.3 (95% CI, 6.0–6.6) in MR and 10.7 (95% CI, 10.0–11.4) in HR women without fracture, but was similar in MR and HR women with fracture (11.4 and 11.6, respectively). New cases of osteoporosis were diagnosed in 3,811 women, 96% of whom were prescribed drug treatment. Of HR women, 79% were referred for DXA. The sensitivity of a low OST index to predict osteoporosis was 92%, and specificity was 16%.

- **Conclusions**: The impact of temporary systematic implementation of this case finding strategy on GP practice was high; it nearly tripled referrals for DXA, and 96% of diagnosed cases received treatment.

### A 55-year-old woman with osteopenia [^114Z9bEx]. JAMA (2006). Low credibility.

About half of postmenopausal women have a bone density T score at the femoral neck between -1.0 and -2.5. Bone density in this range was termed "osteopenia" by a World Health Organization working group. Osteopenia is not a disease, and the label can cause unnecessary anxiety. This condition encompasses a wide range of fracture risks; an individual patient's risk can be estimated from her age, bone mineral density, and clinical risk factors. Regardless of bone mineral density, regular exercise and adherence to vitamin D and calcium intake may reduce the risk of hip fracture. Osteopenia by itself is not an indication for treatment. Decisions about pharmacological treatment to prevent fractures should be based on the patient's risk of fractures, evidence about the efficacy and nonskeletal effects of the specific treatment, and the patient's preferences.

### Fracture risk calculation tool enhances dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan referral pathway in cirrhosis patients [^117FjvGb]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Liver cirrhosis is associated with osteoporosis, leading to an increased risk of fractures. We aimed to establish whether a risk stratification strategy using a fracture risk calculation tool (FRAX) to determine which patients should receive a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan is effective in reducing scan rates without compromising sensitivity for detecting osteoporosis.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 252 patients with liver cirrhosis attending hepatoma surveillance clinics. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to assess sensitivity and specificity at 10-year fracture risk thresholds of 5%, 10%, and 15%.

DXA scans were performed among 252 patients, with a mean age of 61.6 ± 10.2 years, of which 53.2% were male. Cirrhosis etiology was largely a result of alcohol excess (33.3%), chronic hepatitis C virus infection (20.2%), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (15.9%). The majority of patients were in good prognostic groups (87.4% Child-Pugh A, 11.3% Child-Pugh B, 1.3% Child-Pugh C). Osteoporosis was present in 19.0% of those who underwent DXA scanning. The optimum 10-year fracture risk threshold was found to be 10% using the FRAX tool, which retained a high sensitivity of 95.8%, specificity of 64.7%, and a negative predictive value of 98.5%. The introduction of a 10% FRAX threshold would result in a reduction of the DXA scanning rate to 46.8%.

A risk stratification strategy for DXA scanning using a fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) and a 10-year fracture risk threshold of 10% leads to a significant reduction in scanning rates while maintaining sensitivity.

### Treatment of low bone density or osteoporosis to prevent fractures in men and women: A clinical practice guideline update from the American College of Physicians [^114ivmQr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

This guideline updates the 2008 American College of Physicians (ACP) recommendations on the treatment of low bone density and osteoporosis to prevent fractures in men and women. It is endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians.

The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized controlled trials; systematic reviews; large observational studies for adverse events; and case reports for rare events that were published between 2 January 2005 and 3 June 2011. The review was updated to July 2016 using a machine-learning method, and a limited update to October 2016 was done. Clinical outcomes evaluated were fractures and adverse events. This guideline focuses on the comparative benefits and risks of short- and long-term pharmacologic treatments for low bone density, including pharmaceutical prescriptions, calcium, vitamin D, and estrogen. Evidence was graded according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and it is intended for men and women with low bone density and osteoporosis.

- **Recommendation 1**: ACP recommends that clinicians offer pharmacologic treatment with alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, or denosumab to reduce the risk for hip and vertebral fractures in women who have known osteoporosis (Grade: strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).

### Osteoporosis screening and treatment guidelines: Are they being followed [^114kfz5c]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine a cohort of women referred for dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) screening to evaluate whether they met the criteria for bone density testing. Additionally, the study aimed to determine whether these women were receiving appropriate interventions based on published guidelines.

Between January 1, 2007, and March 1, 2009, postmenopausal women (aged > 49 years) who were sent for DXA bone density screening were offered enrollment in the study. Risk factors for osteoporosis, demographic information, and DXA results were recorded. The 2006 Osteoporosis Position Statement from The North American Menopause Society was used to guide screening and therapeutic interventions.

Among the 615 women with data, the mean (SD) age was 61.5 (8.3) years. According to the 2006 guidelines of The North American Menopause Society, 41.3% (253 of 612) of the women who underwent DXA testing did not meet the criteria for such screening. Of these women, 25.5% (157 of 615) were not taking calcium, 31.1% (191 of 614) were not taking vitamin D, and 59.8% (343 of 574) were not engaging in at least half an hour of exercise weekly. Among women with approved indications for treatment, 15.7% (16 of 102) were not taking calcium, 18.6% (19 of 102) were not taking vitamin D, 52.7% (49 of 93) were not exercising at least two hours per week, and 35.3% (36 of 102) were not receiving therapy. Conversely, 17.8% (83 of 467) of women without an indication for treatment were receiving bisphosphonate, raloxifene, or calcitonin therapy.

### A retrospective review of the community medicine needs from osteoporosis services in Canada [^111nBGr8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Comprehensive, real-world osteoporosis care has many facets not explicitly addressed in practice guidelines. We sought to determine the areas of knowledge and practice needs in osteoporosis medicine for the purpose of developing an osteoporosis curriculum for specialist trainees and knowledge translation tools for primary care.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective review of referral questions received from primary care and specialists to an academic, multi-disciplinary tertiary osteoporosis and metabolic bone clinic. There were 400 referrals in each of 5 years (2015–2019) selected randomly for review. The primary referral question was elucidated and assigned to one of 16 pre-determined referral topics reflecting questions in the care of osteoporosis and metabolic bone patients. The top 7 referral topics by frequency were determined while recording the referral source.

- **Results**: The majority of referrals (71%) came from urban primary care. The most common specialists to request care included rheumatology, oncology, gastroenterology, and orthopedic surgery (fracture liaison services). Primary care referrals predominantly requested assistance with routine osteoporosis assessments, bisphosphonate holidays, bisphosphonate adverse effects/alternatives, fractures occurring despite therapy, and adverse changes on bone densitometry despite treatment. Specialists most often referred patients with complex secondary bone diseases or cancer. The main study limitation was that knowledge needs of referring physicians were inferred from the referral question rather than tested directly.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis-2020 update [^114PtgL6]. Endocrine Practice (2020). High credibility.

The objective of the development of these guidelines is sponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) Board of Directors and the American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Board of Trustees. It adheres to published AACE protocols for the standardized production of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs).

- **Methods**: Recommendations are based on diligent reviews of clinical evidence with the transparent incorporation of subjective factors, according to established AACE/ACE guidelines for guidelines protocols.

- **Results**: The Executive Summary of this 2020 updated guideline contains 52 recommendations: 21 Grade A (40%), 24 Grade B (46%), 7 Grade C (14%), and no Grade D (0%). These detailed, evidence-based recommendations allow for nuanced clinical decision-making that addresses multiple aspects of real-world patient care. The evidence base presented in the subsequent appendix provides relevant supporting information for the Executive Summary recommendations. This update includes 368 citations: 123 (33.5%) are evidence level (EL) 1 (highest), 132 (36%) EL 2 (intermediate), 20 (5.5%) EL 3 (weak), and 93 (25%) EL 4 (lowest).

New or updated topics in this CPG include clarification of the diagnosis of osteoporosis, stratification of the patient according to high-risk and very-high-risk features, a new dual-action therapy option, and transitions from therapeutic options. This guideline serves as a practical tool for endocrinologists, physicians in general, regulatory bodies, health-related organizations, and interested laypersons regarding the diagnosis and evaluation of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

### Osteoporosis and low bone mass in premenopausal and perimenopausal women [^116wrZwS]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to characterize the historical, clinical, and biochemical features of 111 young women (age < 55 years) referred for evaluation of osteoporosis or low bone mass.

- **Methods**: Women with a bone mineral density T score ≤ -2.0 (N = 111) at one or more anatomic sites (by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) were assessed relative to anthropomorphic and biochemical characteristics and risk factors for osteoporosis.

- **Results**: Of the 111 women with low bone mass or osteoporosis, 73 (66%) had identifiable causes of bone loss, with estrogen deficiency (due to menopause or premenopausal estrogen deficiency) and conditions associated with estrogen deficiency (such as anorexia nervosa and cancer chemotherapy) being the most common. Prolonged use of glucocorticoids was identified as the most common secondary cause of osteoporosis. Among the 38 women with no identifiable cause of bone loss, 21 were premenopausal (mean age 38 ± 10 years [SD]) and 17 were perimenopausal (mean age 50 ± 3 years). The mean lumbar spine T score was -2.18 ± 1.0 in premenopausal women and -2.51 ± 0.6 in perimenopausal women. Nontraumatic fractures were reported by 42% of the premenopausal women and 18% of the perimenopausal women, while a family history of osteoporosis was reported by 71% of the premenopausal and 47% of the perimenopausal women.

- **Conclusion**: Most young women with osteoporosis or low bone mass had either estrogen deficiency or another secondary cause of premature bone loss (or both). However, a subset of premenopausal and perimenopausal women had no identifiable cause of bone loss. A strong family history of osteoporosis was noted in these women.

### Osteoporosis prevention, screening, and diagnosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 1 [^117LQgH8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

The purpose of this guideline is to provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the prevention, screening, and diagnosis of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The target population includes postmenopausal patients without identified risk factors for fracture, low bone mineral density, or secondary osteoporosis related to medication or a medical condition.

This guideline was developed using an a priori protocol with a writing team consisting of two specialists in obstetrics and gynecology appointed by the ACOG Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines-Gynecology, along with one external subject matter expert. AOCG medical librarians executed a comprehensive literature search across several databases including the Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE. Studies that advanced to the full-text screening stage were evaluated by two authors from the writing team using standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria. These studies underwent quality assessment, and a modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) evidence-to-decision framework was applied to translate the evidence into recommendation statements.

- **Recommendations**: This Clinical Practice Guideline includes updated recommendations on:
	- The role of exercise, calcium, and vitamin D in osteoporosis prevention.
	- Osteoporosis screening and diagnosis.
	- Rescreening intervals.
	- Interventions to prevent falls.

Recommendations are classified by strength and evidence quality. Ungraded Good Practice Points are also included.

### Osteoporosis: Part I. Evaluation and assessment [^112FGvX9]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis afflicts 75 million persons in the United States, Europe, and Japan and results in more than 1.3 million fractures annually in the United States. Because osteoporosis is usually asymptomatic until a fracture occurs, family physicians must identify the appropriate timing and methods for screening those at risk. Prevention is the most important step, and women of all ages should be encouraged to take 1,000 to 1,500 mg of supplemental calcium daily, participate in regular weight-bearing exercise, avoid medications known to compromise bone density, institute hormone replacement therapy at menopause unless contraindicated, and avoid tobacco and excessive alcohol intake.

- **Evaluation and recommendations**: All postmenopausal women who present with fractures, as well as younger women who have risk factors, should be evaluated for the disease. Physicians should recommend bone mineral density testing to younger women at risk and postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who have risk factors for osteoporosis other than being postmenopausal. Bone mineral density testing should be recommended to all women 65 years and older regardless of additional risk factors. Bone mineral density screening should be used as an adjunct to clinical judgment only if the results would influence the choice of therapy or convince the patient to take appropriate preventive measures.

### Bone densitometry and the diagnosis of osteoporosis [^1135NFgC]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, bone density scanning has become an essential part of evaluating patients at risk of osteoporosis. Although dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the technique most associated with the recent growth in bone densitometry, several innovative devices for performing measurements at sites in the peripheral skeleton are also available. This article examines whether there is any one method or measurement site that performs better than all others at identifying patients at risk of fracture. Given that it is essential to make greater use of the small, low-cost peripheral devices to identify and treat the many millions of women most at risk, what approaches to the interpretation of bone density scans can be adopted to ensure consistency among different methods? Finally, does it matter if the imperfect correlation among different types of measurement results in different patients being selected for treatment based on different techniques?

Regarding medical management for palliative care in patients with cancer, specifically in the context of osteoporosis management (screening), ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining bone mineral density testing every two years, or more frequently if medically necessary. This applies to patients with nonmetastatic cancer who are prescribed a drug that causes bone loss or whose baseline or subsequent bone mineral density is near the treatment threshold using the WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool. It is advised to avoid obtaining testing more than annually.

### ACR appropriateness criteria osteoporosis and bone mineral density [^111mHFqo]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a considerable public health risk, with 50% of women and 20% of men over 50 years of age experiencing fractures, and mortality rates of 20% within the first year. Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the primary diagnostic modality for screening women over 65 years and men over 70 years for osteoporosis. In postmenopausal women under 65 years with additional fracture risk factors, DXA is recommended. Some patients with bone mineral density above the threshold for treatment may still qualify for treatment based on vertebral body fractures detected through a vertebral fracture assessment scan, a lateral spine equivalent generated from a commercial DXA machine. Quantitative CT is useful for patients with advanced degenerative bony changes in their spines. New technologies such as the trabecular bone score represent an emerging role for qualitative assessment of bone in clinical practice.

It is critical that both radiologists and referring providers consider osteoporosis in their patients, thus reducing substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate.

### Bone health optimization in orthopaedic surgery [^1159Bqqx]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2020). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is associated with adverse orthopaedic surgical outcomes. Bone health optimization is a preoperative intervention intended to reduce the likelihood of postoperative complications. We aimed to characterize a patient cohort referred for bone health optimization to test the hypothesis that poor bone quality is common in orthopaedic surgery and that many such patients meet guidelines for osteoporosis treatment.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study evaluated 124 patients referred for bone health optimization who were ≥ 50 years of age and candidates for arthroplasty or thoracolumbar surgery. The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) risk factors and dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) results were collected. When available, opportunistic computed tomographic (CT) imaging and the trabecular bone score were evaluated. The World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic and National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) treatment guidelines were applied.

- **Results**: All patients were referred by their orthopaedic surgeon; their mean age was 69.2 years, 83% of patients were female, 97% were Caucasian, and 56% had sustained a previous fracture. The mean historical height loss (and standard deviation) was 5.3 ± 3.3 cm for women and 6.0 ± 3.6 cm for men. The mean lowest T-score of the hip, spine, or wrist was -2.43 ± 0.90 points in women and -2.04 ± 0.81 points in men (p < 0.08). Osteoporosis (T-score of ≤ -2.5 points) was present in 45% of women and 20% of men; only 3% of women and 10% of men had normal bone mineral density. Opportunistic CT scans identified 60% of patients as likely to have osteoporosis.

### A retrospective review of the community medicine needs from osteoporosis services in Canada [^114FJAmy]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

We conducted a large review of patient referrals sent to a full-service metabolic bone clinic over five years and found there are seven common sub-groups of primary referral questions pertaining to osteoporosis care, but also complex metabolic bone diseases. This real-world data provides important information to inform guideline writers, knowledge translation groups, and specialty curriculum designers in osteoporosis care. Community-oriented training in osteoporosis is recommended in order to provide optimal support for the care of medical bone disorders in Canada. Primary care providers shoulder the majority of osteoporosis care in Canada and should be offered attractive and clinically useful tools to guide their decision-making across the entire span of osteoporosis care, from screening to therapy end.

### Consensus statement by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology on the quality of DXA scans and reports [^114VFyvg]. Endocrine Practice (2018). High credibility.

High-quality dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans are necessary for accurate diagnosis of osteoporosis and monitoring of therapy; however, DXA scan reports may contain errors that cause confusion about diagnosis and treatment. This American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology consensus statement was generated to draw attention to many common technical problems affecting DXA report conclusions and provide guidance on how to address them to ensure that patients receive appropriate osteoporosis care.

- **Methods**: The DXA Writing Committee developed a consensus based on discussion and evaluation of available literature related to osteoporosis and osteodensitometry.

- **Results**: Technical errors may include errors in scan acquisition and/or analysis, leading to incorrect diagnosis and reporting of change over time. Although the International Society for Clinical Densitometry advocates training for technologists and medical interpreters to help eliminate these problems, many lack skill in this technology. Suspicion that reports are wrong arises when clinical history is not compatible with scan interpretation (e.g. dramatic increase/decrease in a short period of time; declines in previously stable bone density after years of treatment), when different scanners are used, or when inconsistent anatomic sites are used for monitoring the response to therapy. Understanding the concept of least significant change will minimize erroneous conclusions about changes in bone density.

- **Conclusion**: Clinicians must develop the skills to differentiate accurate DXA scan reports from those affected by technical errors to ensure appropriate patient care.

### Evaluation of decision rules for referring women for bone densitometry by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [^1172qFKR]. JAMA (2001). Low credibility.

Identification of women with low bone mineral density (BMD) is an important strategy in reducing the incidence of osteoporotic fractures. However, screening all women is not recommended. To address this, a study aimed to assess the diagnostic properties of four decision rules: Simple Calculated Osteoporosis Risk Estimation (SCORE), Osteoporosis Risk Assessment Instrument (ORAI), Age, Body Size, No Estrogen (ABONE), and the body weight criterion of less than 70 kg. These decision rules are used for selecting women for dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) testing and are compared with recommendations made in the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) practice guidelines.

The research involved an analysis of data from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study, which is a population-based community sample collected from nine study centers across Canada between February 1996 and September 1997. The participants included postmenopausal women aged 45 years or older (N = 2365) without bone disease who had DXA data for the femoral neck. These women met the criteria for selection, were not currently taking estrogens, or had been taking hormone replacement therapy for five or more years.

- **Main outcome measures**: The study evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of each of the four decision rules and the NOF guidelines. This was to identify women with a BMD T score of less than -1.0 SD, less than -2.0 SD, and no more than -2.5 SD at the femoral neck. It also assessed percentages of women recommended for testing, stratified by BMD level and age.

The results provided insights into the percentage of women with a BMD T score less than -1 and less than -2.

### Osteoporosis and asthma [^1163XQ7V]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To summarize the etiology, evaluation, prevention, and management of osteoporosis in a patient with asthma and worsening osteoporosis. This is a problem frequently encountered in an allergy-immunology practice. The focus includes incidence, risk factors, screening guidelines, and recommended prevention and treatment options for this disease.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE was searched for relevant English-language review articles published between January 1993 and March 2006. The search used the keyword "osteoporosis" in combination with "asthma" or "COPD" (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Additional sources and studies cited include relevant references from the official guidelines of national medical associations. Notable sources are the National Osteoporosis Foundation, the American College of Rheumatology, the World Health Organization, and the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Panel on Osteoporosis Prevention, Diagnosis, and Therapy.

- **Study selection**: The authors selected the most relevant and recent sources for inclusion in this review.

- **Results**: As the population ages, the prevalence and severity of osteoporosis continue to increase. Screening rates of patients at risk of osteoporosis are suboptimal. A variety of effective treatment options are available for osteoporosis prevention and therapy.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are at risk of osteoporosis, especially those treated with high doses of corticosteroids. Specialist physicians should be knowledgeable about the screening guidelines, counseling, and therapeutic measures.

### Clinical use of bone densitometry: Scientific review [^1111cxQx]. JAMA (2002). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis causes substantial morbidity and costs $13.8 billion annually in the United States. Measurement of bone mass by densitometry is a primary part of diagnosing osteoporosis and deciding a preventive treatment course. Bone mineral densitometry has become more widely available and commonly used in practice.

- **Objective**: To review evidence about the value of various clinical applications of bone densitometry.

- **Data sources**: A MEDLINE search was performed to update previous meta-analyses of the relationship between various measurements of bone density and risk of vertebral and hip fracture. We used data from the prospective Study of Osteoporotic Fractures to estimate risk of fracture from bone density and age in postmenopausal women.

- **Study selection and data extraction**: When available, meta-analyses and systematic reviews are emphasized in the review.

- **Data synthesis**: Bone mineral density (BMD) predicts fracture and can be used in combination with age to estimate absolute risk of fractures in postmenopausal white women. Hip BMD predicts hip fracture more strongly than other measurements of BMD. There are insufficient data to translate BMD results into risk of fracture for men and nonwhite women. The benefits of treatments to prevent fractures depend on BMD: women with osteoporosis have a greater risk of fractures and greater benefit from treatments than women without osteoporosis.

- **Conclusions**: Guidelines based on systematic reviews and a cost-effectiveness analysis have suggested that it is worthwhile to measure BMD in white women older than 65 years.

### Bone mineral density screening: Assessment of influence on prevention and treatment of osteoporosis [^116JmA8X]. Endocrine Practice (2002). Low credibility.

The objective was to assess the effect of bone mineral density (BMD) screening on the decision to initiate preventive or therapeutic measures for osteoporosis.

- **Methods**: We offered low-cost BMD screening by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry of the lumbar spine and proximal femur in conjunction with National Osteoporosis Week. To assess whether the availability of the BMD measurements resulted in any medical action by the participants of the screening, we conducted a retrospective telephone survey 9 to 12 months after the screening.

- **Results**: In response to a newspaper promotion, 350 subjects underwent BMD screening during a 3- to 4-month period. Of these 332 female and 18 male participants, 83% were Caucasian, 10% were Asian, 5% were Hispanic, and 2% were African American. The mean age was 60 ± 11 years (range, 29 to 93). Osteoporosis (T-score ≥ -2.5) was present in 24% and osteopenia (T-score of -1 to -2.49) in 47% of the subjects. A report was sent to the participant and, if requested, also to a specified physician. Of the 350 participants, 249 (238 women and 11 men) responded to the telephone survey. Among these respondents, 63% had sought medical consultation after the BMD screening. Results of the BMD study led to an increase in calcium intake in 32% of female respondents (48% of those with osteoporosis). After BMD measurement, the use of osteoporosis therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration increased from 38% to 78% of those with osteoporosis.

- **Conclusion**: These results suggest that low-cost BMD screening is highly effective in increasing awareness.

Repeat BMD and VFA measurements, clinical indications

Repeat BMD testing in combination with clinical assessment of fracture risk, bone turnover markers if available, and other factors, including height loss and trabecular bone score, can be used to determine whether treatment should be initiated in untreated individuals. The BMD repeat testing interval depends on overall clinical need as well as the baseline value. For example, a patient taking high-dose glucocorticoids may lose bone much more rapidly, particularly in the setting of cancer and active rheumatoid arthritis. Those with low BMD and rapid bone loss are among those at greatest risk of fracture. On the other hand, less frequent assessments may be appropriate for older individuals.

A US study of almost 5,000 postmenopausal women aged ≥ 67 years demonstrated that the average time to transition to a densitometric diagnosis of osteoporosis (T-score ≤ -2.5) was 17 years for those with a T-score > -1.5, 5 years for women with a T-score between -1.50 and -1.99, and 1 year for women with a T-score between -2.0 and -2.49 for 10% of the total population considered. These data provided some guidance on appropriate intervals for BMD testing in untreated individuals.

### The value of laboratory tests in diagnosing secondary osteoporosis at a fracture and osteoporosis outpatient clinic [^1111kj18]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

As more patients meeting the criteria for osteoporosis are referred to a fracture and osteoporosis outpatient clinic (FO clinic), the laboratory costs to screen for secondary osteoporosis also increase. This study was conducted to determine the value of screening for underlying diseases at an FO clinic by obtaining a standard set of laboratory tests.

- **Methods**: We included all 541 patients aged ≥ 50 years with a fracture referred to our FO clinic during the period from January 2005 to January 2007. The bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and expressed as a T score. A standard set of laboratory tests was obtained to screen for underlying diseases.

- **Results**: Laboratory results were as often abnormal in patients with a normal BMD as in patients with a low BMD. Underlying diseases were infrequently diagnosed. However, the prevalence of secondary osteoporosis in men was quite high, up to 18.2%. The costs to diagnose one patient with an underlying disease varied between €92 and €972, depending on the group of patients described.

- **Conclusion**: Screening all patients referred to an FO clinic for underlying diseases by obtaining a standard set of laboratory tests is probably not useful since laboratory tests are as often abnormal in patients with a normal BMD as in patients with a low BMD. Moreover, the prevalence of secondary osteoporosis is low, while laboratory costs are substantial.

### Clinical characteristics and medication use among premenopausal women with osteoporosis and low BMD: The experience of an osteoporosis referral center [^115thu9o]. Journal of Women's Health (2009). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is uncommon in premenopausal women, and most cases have a secondary cause. Women with osteoporosis and no known secondary cause are said to have idiopathic osteoporosis (IOP). We aimed to estimate the proportion of premenopausal women seen in our referral center with IOP as opposed to secondary osteoporosis, to describe their clinical characteristics, to compare women with a low-trauma fracture history with those with low bone mineral density (BMD) alone, and to estimate the frequency of bisphosphonate use.

We reviewed medical records from all premenopausal women evaluated for osteoporosis or low BMD in our center during 2005. We included premenopausal women diagnosed on the basis of low-trauma fracture, low BMD (Z score ≤ -2.0 or T score ≤ -2.5), or both.

Among these patients (n = 61; mean age 37 ± 8), 57 (93%) were Caucasian, 34 (57%) had a family history of osteoporosis, and 26 (43%) had used bisphosphonates. The most common secondary causes were amenorrhea (34%, n = 21), anorexia nervosa (16%, n = 10), and glucocorticoid exposure (13%, n = 8). After exclusion of secondary causes, 39% (24 of 61) of the entire group and 48% (14 of 29) of the fracture group were thought to have IOP. Women with a known secondary cause had lower BMD Z scores at the spine and hip than those with IOP. Women with low BMD and no fractures had shorter stature and weighed less than those with fractures, but overall differences between the groups were not statistically significant. Bisphosphonates had been prescribed for 38% (11 of 29).

### Frax updates 2012 [^117R1cau]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

There is an increasing recognition that the management of osteoporosis requires the characterization of fracture risk to be based on absolute risk rather than single measures such as bone mineral density (BMD). FRAX, the most widely used tool that incorporates clinical risk factors with or without BMD, was launched in 2008. This brief review addresses the development of FRAX since then and describes some of the issues that continue to be discussed as FRAX plays an increasing role in clinical practice.

- **Recent findings**: FRAX is a platform technology that will continue to develop. High-quality updated epidemiology of fracture and mortality can lead to recalibration of models. The addition of new risk factors is complex as the process requires validation in an international setting as well as a comprehensive assessment of how such new factors interact with the existing FRAX variables. Nonetheless, clinical interpretation can be enhanced by taking into account the potential adjustments of FRAX probabilities and several of these are described.

- **Summary**: FRAX is being incorporated in an increasing number of clinical guidelines, and assessment and intervention thresholds have been provided to instruct clinical decision-making. There is an increasing body of evidence that patients deemed at highest risk of fracture by FRAX, with or without the use of BMD, will overlap significantly with those identified by previous guidelines and will respond to appropriate osteoporosis therapy.

### Approach to the patient with bone fracture: making the first fracture the last [^11568cs8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

The purpose of further FLS-initiated investigations is to assess and estimate future fracture risk. Risk factors for fractures, including advanced age, female sex and postmenopausal status, prevalent fractures, falls, parental history of hip fracture, smoking, corticosteroid use, alcohol excess, and numerous other secondary causes of osteoporosis, should be explored, particularly in patients with DXA Z scores less than −2 SD and multiple previous fractures. These risk factors are incorporated in validated web-based absolute fracture risk calculators such as the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) and the Garvan Fracture Risk Calculator. A targeted physical examination should examine for evidence of vertebral fractures (e.g. thoracic kyphosis, focal vertebral tenderness, increased wall-to-occiput distance > 0 cm, height loss) and causes of secondary osteoporosis (e.g. hyperthyroidism, Cushing syndrome, hypogonadism).

DXA scans should be used for the initial assessment of BMD and subsequent monitoring. These may not be feasible in all patients because of technical issues, such as joint replacements, severe degenerative changes in the measurement area, extremes of body mass index, or the inability to maintain correct positioning for the scan, nor are they necessarily required in patients for whom it would unlikely alter risk assessment or decision for treatment. Quantitative computed tomography may offer a more accurate assessment of BMD than DXA in patients with severe degenerative changes, abdominal aortic calcification, and extremes of body mass.

### A retrospective review of the community medicine needs from osteoporosis services in Canada [^1152BSVN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Comprehensive, real-world osteoporosis care has many facets not explicitly addressed in practice guidelines. We sought to determine the areas of knowledge and practice needs in osteoporosis medicine for the purpose of developing an osteoporosis curriculum for specialist trainees and knowledge translation tools for primary care.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective review of referral questions received from primary care and specialists to an academic, multi-disciplinary tertiary osteoporosis and metabolic bone clinic. There were 400 referrals in each of 5 years (2015–2019) selected randomly for review. The primary referral question was elucidated and assigned to one of 16 pre-determined referral topics reflecting questions in the care of osteoporosis and metabolic bone patients. The top 7 referral topics by frequency were determined while recording the referral source.

- **Results**: The majority of referrals (71%) came from urban primary care. The most common specialists to request care included rheumatology, oncology, gastroenterology, and orthopedic surgery (fracture liaison services). Primary care referrals predominantly requested assistance with routine osteoporosis assessments, bisphosphonate holidays, bisphosphonate adverse effects/alternatives, fractures occurring despite therapy, and adverse changes on bone densitometry despite treatment. Specialists most often referred patients with complex secondary bone diseases or cancer. The main study limitation was that knowledge needs of referring physicians were inferred from the referral question rather than tested directly.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^116ngQh9]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Statements based on IWG consensus:

- **DXA BMD measurement**: DXA BMD measurement should be performed at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and, if indicated, one-third radius.

- **Consider DXA screening**: Consider DXA in all women aged ≥ 65 years, men aged > 70 years, and women and men aged ≥ 50 years with risk factors for osteoporosis [Table 4].

- **Evaluation for vertebral fractures**: Evaluate for prevalent vertebral fractures with VFA or standard radiography in patients aged ≥ 50 years with specific risk factors, or with a T-score > 4 cm, self-reported but undocumented vertebral fracture, or long-term glucocorticoid therapy [Table 5].

- **DXA in younger adults**: Consider DXA in younger adults (premenopausal women and men under 50 years) with specific diseases, and/or medical drugs and/or fracture.

- **Precision error and LSC**: Each DXA facility should determine its precision error and calculate the least significant change (LSC), to be repeated when a new DXA system is installed.

- **Diagnosis of osteoporosis**: In accordance with the established WHO operational definition, osteoporosis is diagnosed based on a T-score of −2.5 or lower in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, or one-third radius. The lowest T-score at any of these measured sites should be used for diagnosis.

- **Presumed diagnosis of osteoporosis**: Some societies presume a diagnosis of osteoporosis in the presence of low-trauma major fractures (hip, spine, forearm, humerus, pelvis).

- **T-score calculation**: The NHANES III reference database is recommended for T-score calculation and depending on the society, based on 20–29 years aged White women or same sex-type.

- **Follow-up DXA**: Recommend follow-up DXA as indicated, depending on clinical circumstances. Follow-up of patients should ideally be conducted in accordance with specific clinical contexts.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of osteoporosis and fracture prevention in Canada: 2023 update [^1151q9st]. CMAJ (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for osteoporosis in men, particularly with respect to indications for referral, the OC 2023 guidelines recommend consulting with a healthcare professional with expertise in osteoporosis (such as a family physician, general internist, endocrinologist, rheumatologist, or geriatrician) when uncertainty exists about fracture risk or treatment. This includes considerations like possible secondary causes of osteoporosis, comorbidities complicating management, and significant adverse effects from pharmacotherapy.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^113TdJGi]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

When using DXA to monitor bone mineral density (BMD) over time at the lumbar spine and total hip, only changes that meet or exceed the least significant change (LSC) should be considered significant and noted as such. The International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) recommends that the maximal acceptable LSC for a technologist is 5.0% for the total hip and 5.3% for the lumbar spine. In clinical practice, the absolute change in BMD in gm/cm² is preferred over percentage change for LSC.

Given the variability in machines and systems from one imaging center to the next, the LSC from the manufacturer should not be used without confirmation. Similarly, a change in BMD between instruments that are not cross-calibrated cannot be reliably reported since it is not possible to determine if BMD has actually changed or if the change is solely due to measurement error in the absence of knowledge of the LSC.

If a patient has a known diagnosis of osteoporosis based on prior imaging, a follow-up scan does not change the original diagnosis. Instead, repeated imaging is used to monitor changes in BMD over time. Even if T-scores improve to greater than -2.5, the diagnosis of osteoporosis is durable. Preferably, patients should return to the same DXA machine that was used to perform their most recent prior study, provided that the facility's in vivo precision and LSC values are known and do not exceed established maximum values. Alternatively, a DXA machine from one manufacturer enables comparison by using a conversion factor for different machines. See also part IV, clinical indications.
