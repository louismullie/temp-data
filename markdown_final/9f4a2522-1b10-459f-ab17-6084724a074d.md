## Question

can domperidone increase prolactin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether domperidone increases prolactin levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanism of domperidone at dopamine D2 receptors. Then, I should verify the physiologic regulation of prolactin and how dopamine antagonism alters it. Next, I will review clinical evidence quantifying prolactin increases in humans. After that, I should examine dose–response and time course. Then, I will consider clinical implications such as lactation effects and hyperprolactinemia symptoms. Finally, I need to assess safety, regulatory status, and monitoring recommendations before synthesizing a concise conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. Domperidone is a peripheral dopamine D2 receptor antagonist that does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, so its prolactin effect is mediated by blocking inhibitory D2 receptors in the anterior pituitary lactotrophs, thereby disinhibiting prolactin release; this is distinct from metoclopramide, which also has central effects and more extrapyramidal adverse effects, and the mechanism is consistently described across pharmacologic and clinical sources [^112HYNNx] [^114X6Szd].

> Wait, let me verify the physiology I'm invoking. Prolactin secretion is tonically inhibited by hypothalamic dopamine via tuberoinfundibular projections; antagonism at pituitary D2 receptors removes that brake and increases prolactin, a principle reflected in both animal and human neuroendocrine studies and in the clinical effects of dopamine antagonists on prolactin [^1131ChVj] [^115SESKP].

> Next, I should review direct clinical evidence of prolactin elevation. In a randomized trial of mothers with lactation insufficiency, domperidone 10 mg three times daily for 14 days increased median prolactin from 72.85 ng/mL to 223.4 ng/mL versus a smaller rise with placebo, indicating a several-fold increase; similarly, in a pharmacodynamic study, a single 20 mg dose raised prolactin from 8.1 to 110.9 ng/mL in non-lactating women, and a controlled trial in preterm mothers showed a 97% rise in prolactin by day 14, supporting a robust, reproducible effect across populations [^114wdZrg] [^1172Awex] [^111QXtxo].

> Hold on, I should verify dose–response and time course. Most lactation trials used 30 mg/day in divided doses, with some exploring 40–60 mg/day; meta-analytic data suggest greater milk output with higher cumulative doses, though the optimal regimen remains uncertain and prolonged benefit beyond 6 weeks is unproven, and prolactin rises are typically detectable within days and reverse after discontinuation, consistent with the pharmacology of D2 blockade [^112HYNNx] [^111v3hee] [^1159xoFg].

> I will now examine clinical implications. The prolactin rise translates into increased milk production in mothers of preterm infants, with randomized and meta-analytic data showing roughly 74–103 mL/day greater milk output versus placebo and superiority to metoclopramide in preterm populations, although effects in term mothers are less consistent and longer-term breastfeeding outcomes remain uncertain; clinically, hyperprolactinemia can manifest as galactorrhea, menstrual irregularities, and hypogonadism, and rare euprolactinemic galactorrhea has been reported with domperidone, so symptom surveillance is prudent [^112HYNNx] [^114jJMNP] [^111v3hee] [^112SvjqX].

> But wait, what about safety and regulation. I need to ensure I separate mechanistic prolactin effects from cardiac risk. The FDA has warned against domperidone for lactation due to risks of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, particularly with IV use or interacting drugs; large postpartum cohorts suggest arrhythmias cluster in women with prior arrhythmias, and gastroenterology guidance recommends baseline and follow-up ECGs, dose limitation, and avoidance in patients with prolonged QT or interacting agents; nonetheless, meta-analyses in postpartum populations have not shown increased maternal adverse events versus placebo, though vigilance is warranted [^116SGWYm] [^111TZicr] [^113nChBs] [^114jJMNP].

> Let me consider transfer into breast milk and infant exposure. Domperidone is minimally transferred into milk, with relative infant doses around 0.05% even at maternal doses up to 160 mg/day, and no consistent signal for neonatal QT prolongation in exposed infants, though formal neonatal safety data remain limited and shared decision-making is essential [^117Y6JpD] [^111TZicr].

> I should double-check guideline positioning. The Endocrine Society notes that drug-induced hyperprolactinemia is common and that dynamic testing with agents like domperidone is not recommended for diagnosis; in practice, if domperidone is used off-label for lactation, it should follow counseling on uncertain long-term benefits, potential endocrine effects, and cardiac precautions, with attention to nonpharmacologic lactation support first [^115LgqUX] [^111TZicr].

> In summary, yes — domperidone reliably increases prolactin via peripheral D2 antagonism at the anterior pituitary, with several-fold rises documented in randomized trials and pharmacodynamic studies, translating into clinically meaningful milk increases in preterm mothers; use should be individualized, time-limited, and risk-mitigated given regulatory cautions and potential hyperprolactinemia-related effects [^114wdZrg] [^112HYNNx] [^116SGWYm].

Domperidone increases **prolactin** by blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the anterior pituitary, thereby removing dopamine's tonic inhibition of prolactin secretion [^112HYNNx]. This effect is dose-related and typically reversible upon discontinuation, with prolactin rising within hours and normalizing within days to weeks after stopping therapy [^1159xoFg]. Clinically, this can cause galactorrhea, amenorrhea, and gynecomastia, and caution is advised in patients with prolactinomas or those on other QT-prolonging drugs due to arrhythmia risk [^114soFvc] [^113nChBs].

---

## Mechanism of action

Domperidone is a **peripheral dopamine D2 receptor antagonist** that does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, confining its effects primarily to peripheral tissues [^113nChBs]. Within the anterior pituitary, dopamine normally inhibits prolactin secretion via D2 receptors; domperidone blocks these receptors, thereby **removing inhibition and increasing prolactin release** [^112HYNNx].

---

## Clinical evidence of prolactin elevation

Multiple clinical studies and trials have documented **significant prolactin increases** with domperidone:

- **Healthy volunteers**: A single 20 mg oral dose increased prolactin from 8.1 to 110.9 ng/mL within hours, confirming a rapid, dose-related effect [^1172Awex].

- **Lactating women**: In mothers with insufficient milk supply, domperidone 10 mg three times daily for 14 days increased prolactin from a median of 72.85 to 223.4 ng/mL, correlating with increased milk production [^114wdZrg].

- **Multiple sclerosis trials**: Domperidone increased prolactin several-fold in MS patients, though no clear clinical benefit was observed [^113PPjwf].

---

## Dose-response relationship

Prolactin elevation is **dose-related**: higher doses produce greater increases, but most lactation studies use 10–20 mg three times daily (30–60 mg/day). Higher doses (> 60 mg/day) are not well studied for lactation and may increase adverse effects, including QT prolongation [^113nChBs].

---

## Time course of prolactin elevation

Prolactin rises **within hours** of domperidone administration, peaks within 1–3 days, and typically returns to baseline within days to weeks after discontinuation, depending on dose and duration.

---

## Clinical implications and side effects

Elevated prolactin from domperidone can cause:

- **Galactorrhea**: Milk production outside pregnancy/lactation [^114d5MLH].

- **Amenorrhea**: Menstrual irregularities or cessation [^114soFvc].

- **Gynecomastia**: Breast enlargement in men [^114soFvc].

- **Hypogonadism**: Reduced sex hormones due to suppressed GnRH [^116FYBqL].

These effects are usually reversible after stopping domperidone, but persistent hyperprolactinemia can occur with prolonged use [^1159xoFg].

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

Domperidone is associated with **QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias**, particularly at higher doses or with interacting drugs. Clinicians should:

- **Baseline ECG**: Recommended before starting therapy, especially in patients with cardiac risk factors [^114soFvc].

- **Avoid in patients with**: Known QT prolongation, significant electrolyte disturbances, or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs [^notfound].

- **Use caution in patients with**: Prolactinomas or other prolactin-secreting tumors, as domperidone can exacerbate hyperprolactinemia [^112HYNNx].

---

## Comparison with other dopamine antagonists

Compared with metoclopramide, domperidone causes **greater prolactin elevation** and more sustained hyperprolactinemia, likely due to its higher D2 affinity and minimal CNS penetration. Metoclopramide's central effects increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia, whereas domperidone's peripheral action reduces these risks [^11743Xk7] [^114X6Szd].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize:

- **Use the lowest effective dose**: Typically 10 mg three times daily for lactation support [^112YFn9M].

- **Monitor for side effects**: Watch for galactorrhea, menstrual changes, and cardiac symptoms [^111TZicr].

- **Avoid in patients with**: Prolactinomas or significant cardiac risk factors [^112HYNNx].

---

Domperidone increases **prolactin** by blocking pituitary D2 receptors, producing dose-related, usually reversible hyperprolactinemia. Clinicians should monitor for endocrine and cardiac effects and use the lowest effective dose, avoiding use in patients with prolactinomas or QT risk factors.

### Domperidone-induced elevation of serum prolactin levels and immune response in multiple sclerosis [^113PPjwf]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Increasing systemic prolactin levels improves remyelination and neuronal survival in animal models of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), but it has been suggested that this therapeutic strategy may also increase inflammatory responses, and potentially harm patients. We analyzed serum prolactin and cytokine, chemokine and growth factor levels in sera from MS patients enrolled in two clinical trials who were treated with domperidone, a generic drug that increases systemic prolactin levels. In patients treated with domperidone, molecule levels changed little during follow up, while prolactin levels increased several-fold. We found no significant association between prolactin levels and radiological or clinical outcome.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115LgqUX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society — diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia (Recommendation 1.1) states to establish the diagnosis, "we recommend a single measurement of serum prolactin; a level above the upper limit of normal confirms the diagnosis as long as the serum sample was obtained without excessive venipuncture stress", and "we recommend against dynamic testing of prolactin secretion" (1|⊕⊕⊕⊕). Evidence notes assay-specific normal values are generally lower than 25 μg/liter and that when the World Health Organization Standard 84/500 is used, 1 μg/liter is equivalent to 21.2 mIU/liter; dynamic tests using TRH, L-dopa, nomifensine, and domperidone are not superior to a single sample. A prolactin level greater than 500 μg/liter is diagnostic of a macroprolactinoma, whereas levels greater than 250 μg/liter usually indicate a prolactinoma but selected drugs can cause elevations above 200 μg/liter without evidence of adenoma. Remarks add that the initial determination should avoid excessive venipuncture stress and can be drawn at any time of the day.

### Enhancing breast milk production with domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates (EMPOWER trial) [^113uKcEg]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Currently, there is no clear approach in managing mothers of preterm infants experiencing an inadequate production of breast milk. With EMPOWER, we hypothesize that domperidone, through its pharmacologic action on increasing prolactin levels, will assist mothers of very preterm infants, experiencing inadequate breast milk production, in increasing breast milk volumes to a level identified as being sufficient for continued pumping in the hospitalization period. We also hope to determine the safety and efficacy of domperidone in helping a mother who is experiencing an inadequate milk supply, and how it should be considered in the care of the mother and her preterm infant without causing adverse consequences to either the mother or infant.

Domperidone

Domperidone and metoclopramide are the most commonly used galactagogues. Both domperidone and metoclopramide are dopamine antagonists which could block the dopamine 2 receptors in lactotrophic cells of the anterior pituitary. Our analysis revealed an average increase in volume of 103.55 mL/day in the domperidone group compared to the placebo group for mothers with breast milk insufficiency. This finding was consistent with recent systematic reviews. Domperidone is thought to work by blocking the inhibitory effects of dopamine-mediated prolactin secretion, thereby increasing milk production. Several pharmacologic studies have shown that domperidone can significantly elevate prolactin levels. In the involved studies, 81.8% of studies (9/11) used domperidone 30 mg/day (10 mg orally, administered 3 times daily), one study used 40 mg/day (10 mg orally, administered 4 times daily) and one study used 60 mg/day (20 mg orally, administered 3 times daily). The duration of domperidone varied between four and twenty-eight days. Currently, there is no definitive dosage recommendation for domperidone to improve breastmilk insufficiency. None of studies investigated the sustained efficacy of domperidone beyond a duration of six weeks. Therefore, the recommended of domperidone in recent research is 10 mg orally three times daily for one to two weeks, without convincing evidence to substantiate a higher dosage.

The ability of domperidone to traverse the blood-brain barrier is limited, and its excretion into breast milk is modest. However, some transient adverse effects of domperidone (including abdominal cramps, dry mouth, headache, diarrhea, and dizziness) have been reported. Our analysis demonstrated there were no differences in the frequency of maternal drug-related adverse events after using domperidone compared with the placebo. In 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning that breastfeeding women not use domperidone because of an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. However, a recent study of domperidone for postpartum lactation found no cases of ventricular arrhythmias in women with no prior history. All cases of ventricular arrhythmia have been observed among women with a previous history. Therefore, in postpartum women with a history of arrhythmia, the use of domperidone for lactation should be avoided.

### Study protocol: a double blind placebo controlled trial examining the effect of domperidone on the composition of breast milk [NCT00308334] [^113vng9t]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Significance of study

To date, researchers have analyzed the effects of domperidone on lactating woman with respect to the quantity of their milk production, adverse effects, and drug levels in the breast milk. Currently, guidelines for fortification of human milk for preterm infants do not distinguish between women using or not using domperidone. Domperidone causes an increase in maternal prolactin levels and has been shown to significantly increase human breast milk volumes. No study has examined the effect of domperidone use (to augment lactation) on the composition of breast milk. The purpose of this study is to compare the macronutrient and macro mineral composition of breast milk between mothers of infants delivered at less than 31 weeks gestation, receiving domperidone versus placebo. If significant differences in nutrient content occur between groups, alterations to current standards of feeding practices for premature infants may need to be made in order to optimize growth and nutrition. The results of this study will provide clinicians with valuable information to aid in guiding feeding practices for preterm infants.

### Effect of domperidone on breast milk production in mothers of sick neonates: a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial [^114wdZrg]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective: Mothers of many preterm babies are unable to produce sufficient milk for their babies during the prolonged hospitalization. Domperidone stimulates the release of prolactin, thereby increasing breast milk production. The primary outcome was to study the efficacy of domperidone in augmenting breast milk production in mothers with lactation failure (LF). The secondary outcomes included the effect of domperidone on prolactin levels, adverse effects of domperidone, and outcome on breastfeeding rates at discharge. Materials and Methods: This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial where mothers with LF were either allocated domperidone (10mg) or placebo, 2 tablets three times a day for 14 days. Milk volumes were recorded daily for 14 days. Serum prolactin levels were measured at the start and at day 7 of study. Results: Out of 166 women eligible for the study, 119 (71.7%) mothers were able to increase their breast milk production without pharmacological treatment after being counseled on the advantages of human milk and proper breastfeeding management. Forty-seven mothers were finally enrolled in the study; 24 in the domperidone group (DG) and 23 in the placebo group (PG). Breast milk production increased from a baseline of 156+141.1 to 400.9+239.2mL in the DG and increased from a baseline of 175.8+150.7 to 260.5+237.5mL in the PG, after 14 days (p < 0.01). The prolactin levels in the DG and PG increased from 72.85 (22.2–167.15) and 42.33 (14.02–93.54) ng/mL, respectively, to 223.4 (49.79–280.2) ng/mL (p = 0.005) in the DG and 60.08 (14.31–132.14) ng/mL (p = 0.232) in the PG on the 7th day of treatment. No adverse effects were recorded. Ninety-five percent of babies in the DG were exclusively breastfeeding at hospital discharge, compared with 52.4% in the PG (p = 0.008). Conclusion: Domperidone treatment can result in an increase in breast milk production with no adverse effects. The study was registered with the Thai Clinical Trials Registry ID TCTR2020091008.

What are the proposed methods of protecting against sources of bias?

The double blind study design in which participants, neonatal staff, and study personnel will be blinded to group enrollment will ensure that non-domperidone related intervention effects and information collection is similar between the drug and placebo groups. In order to have similar presentation and appearance of domperidone and placebo, domperidone tablets will be crushed and mixed with lactose. The resulting powder will be placed in clear capsules. Plain lactose powder will also be placed in clear capsules to act as the placebo. Participants will receive a two-week supply of either domperidone or placebo following randomization at no cost to them. Measured prolactin levels will not be made available until the completion of the study period.

### Study protocol: a double blind placebo controlled trial examining the effect of domperidone on the composition of breast milk [NCT00308334] [^1157GeCG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Domperidone, a drug that enhances upper gastric motility, is an anti-dopaminergic medication that also elevates prolactin levels. It has been shown to safely increase the milk supply of lactating women. To date, researchers have analyzed the effects of domperidone on lactating woman with respect to the quantity of their milk production, adverse effects, and drug levels in the breast milk. However, the effect of domperidone on the macronutrient composition of breast milk has not been studied and current guidelines for fortification of human milk for premature infants do not distinguish between those women using or those not using domperidone. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of domperidone (given to lactating mothers of very preterm infants) on the macronutrient composition of breast milk.

Methods/Design

Mothers of infants delivered at less than 31 weeks gestation, who are at least 3 weeks postpartum, and experiencing lactational failure despite non-pharmacological interventions, will be randomized to receive domperidone (10 mg three times daily) or placebo for a 14-day period. Breast milk samples will be obtained the day prior to beginning treatment and on days 4, 7 and 14. The macronutrient (protein, fat, carbohydrate and energy) and macromineral content (calcium, phosphorus and sodium) will be analyzed and compared between the two groups. Additional outcome measures will include milk volumes, serum prolactin levels (measured on days 0, 4, and 10), daily infant weights and breastfeeding rates at 2 weeks post study completion and at discharge. Forty-four participants will be recruited into the study. Analysis will be carried out using the intention to treat approach.

Discussion

If domperidone causes significant changes to the nutrient content of breast milk, an alteration in feeding practices for preterm infants may need to be made in order to optimize growth, nutrition and neurodevelopment outcomes.

### The TSH response to domperidone reflects the biological activity of prolactin in macroprolactinaemia and hyperprolactinaemia [^115CUKas]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that patients with hyperprolactinaemia due to biologically inactive macroprolactin will not show the characteristically increased dopaminergic inhibition of TSH release seen in patients with microprolactinomas secreting biologically active monomeric PRL.

Design

Comparison of the TSH and PRL responses to dopamine antagonism with domperidone (10 mg i.v.) in patients with hyperprolactinaemia due to macroprolactinaemia or microprolactinomas.

Patients

Twenty-two patients referred for the investigation of their hyperprolactinaemia were studied: 11 patients with macroprolactinaemia and 11 patients with hyperprolactinaemia due to microprolactinoma.

Measurements

TSH and PRL levels were measured at baseline and 30 min following domperidone in both groups.

Results

Patients with macroprolactinaemia showed normal TSH and PRL responses to dopamine antagonism whereas patients with microprolactinomas showed exaggerated TSH responses and reduced PRL responses. Although there was considerable overlap between the PRL responses in the two groups, there was very clear separation between the PRL/TSH response ratios (normal > 1.0) of 4.0 ± 1.8 for the macroprolactinaemia group and 0.4 ± 0.2 for the microprolactinoma group (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

These data support the hypothesis that elevated circulating levels of macroprolactin, as opposed to biologically active monomeric PRL, do not exert increased positive feedback on the hypothalamic dopaminergic inhibition of TSH release.

### Study protocol: a double blind placebo controlled trial examining the effect of domperidone on the composition of breast milk [NCT00308334] [^1172Awex]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Thus, domperidone, a peripheral dopamine antagonist, may be safer than metoclopramide. Drug levels of domperidone in breast milk are also significantly lower than metoclopramide (p < 0.05). Studies have shown that breast milk samples taken from women receiving either a 10 mg dose of domperidone or a 10 mg dose of metoclopramide contained 10.3 ng/ml of domperidone and 68.5 ng/ml of metoclopramide (p < 0.05). Domperidone has been shown to significantly increase milk production without evidence of adverse effects in the infant. Domperidone has been shown to raise the serum prolactin level in non-lactating women from 8.1 to 110.9 ng/ml after one 20 mg dose. In a double-blind placebo controlled trial, 32 mothers of full term infants experiencing failure of lactogenesis were randomized to receive either domperidone (10 mg TID) or placebo. Prolactin levels were reported as significantly higher after the 2 nd day of treatment in the domperidone group (p < 0.01). The mean daily milk yield was also increased significantly in the domperidone group (P < 0.01), with a corresponding higher infant weight gain. In a small double blind, randomized controlled trial (n = 16), a 7 day course of domperidone (10 mg TID) given to mothers of preterm infants experiencing insufficient milk production resulted in a significantly increased milk supply (P < 0.05), low levels of drug detected in breast milk (< 0.2 mcg/kg/d) and significantly higher maternal prolactin level when compared to the placebo group. No infant or maternal side effects were reported in the above trials. Both the Canadian and American Academy of Pediatrics have approved the use of domperidone for breast-feeding mothers.

### ABM clinical protocol # 9: use of galactogogues in initiating or augmenting maternal milk production, second revision 2018 [^112LJMF5]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Pharmaceutical galactogogues — mechanism and overall evidence limitations are noted: Domperidone and metoclopramide are the most commonly used pharmaceutical galactogogues at present, and both are dopamine antagonists that increase prolactin secretion. A number of older mainly observational or controlled studies documented increased baseline prolactin levels in lactating women who took metoclopramide or domperidone and provide some evidence for their effectiveness; however, high-quality evidence is lacking, the numbers of women in randomized, placebo-controlled blinded studies are small, and most studies also had limited follow-up.

### Study protocol: a double blind placebo controlled trial examining the effect of domperidone on the composition of breast milk [NCT00308334] [^114X6Szd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

f. Why choose domperidone?

Both metaclopramide and domperidone are anti-dopaminergic drugs. Both induce lactation by inhibiting endogenous dopamine and thereby increasing plasma prolactin levels. Domperidone is a newly developed anti-emetic with no structural relationship to the phenothiazine anti-emetics and metoclopramide; it is structurally related to the neuroleptic drug droperidol. Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist in vitro; it binds strongly to the dopamine (DA) receptors of the striatal area. It is felt the domperidone inhibits dopamine receptors at either the level of the anterior pituitary median eminence or at the tuberoinfundibular systems, both of which are outside the blood brain barrier. This differs significantly from metoclopramide, which inhibits dopamine (DA) centrally. Domperidone is less lipid soluble, has a higher molecular weight and has lower protein binding as compared with metoclopramide. These characteristics may also prevent domperidone from crossing the blood brain barrier, thus causing less extra pyramidal effects that are more commonly reported with the use of metoclopramide.

### ABM clinical protocol # 9: use of galactogogues in initiating or augmenting maternal milk production, second revision 2018 [^111TZicr]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Domperidone — clinical evidence and safety in lactating women are summarized as follows: Domperidone and metoclopramide are the most commonly used pharmaceutical galactogogues at present. Randomized trials report increased milk output with short courses postpartum and during milk expression; in one study of 45 women, 22 were given domperidone, 30 mg per day, for 4 days postcesarean section and were found to have increased milk production, and in a second study of only 15 women there was a 300-mL per day difference when comparing 60 mg per day versus 30 mg per day for 4 weeks. A third trial compared domperidone, 30 mg per day, with metoclopramide, 30 mg per day. The largest trial (EMPOWER) included 90 women randomized between 8 and 21 days postpartum to domperidone, 30 mg per day, for 28 days or placebo for 14 days then domperidone, 30 mg per day, for 14 days; at 14 days, 77.8% in the domperidone-first group increased milk production by 50% compared with 57.8% in the placebo-first group, but by 28 days there were no significant differences and none at term or at 6 weeks post-term. One older very small study (n = 6) suggested that individual women may be responders or nonresponders and that primiparas may respond to domperidone with higher prolactin levels than multiparas. Regarding cardiac risk, there is evidence that domperidone increases the QTc interval and it has been implicated in ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, and in a study of more than 225,532 postpartum women, the only women who developed ventricular arrhythmias while taking domperidone had a past history of ventricular arrhythmias.

### Enhancing breast milk production with domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates (EMPOWER trial) [^111j5Qzy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The use of mother's own breast milk during initial hospitalization has a positive impact not only in reducing potential serious neonatal morbidities but also contribute to improvements in neurodevelopmental outcomes. Mothers of very preterm infants struggle to maintain a supply of breast milk during their infants' prolonged hospitalization. Galactogogues are medications that induce lactation by exerting its effects through oxytocin or prolactin enhancement. Domperidone is a potent dopamine D 2 receptor antagonist which stimulates the release of prolactin. Small trials have established its ability in enhancing breast milk production. EMPOWER was designed to determine the safety and efficacy of domperidone in mothers experiencing an inadequate milk supply.

Methods/design

EMPOWER is a multicenter, double masked, randomized controlled phase-II trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of domperidone in those mothers identified as having difficulty in breast milk production. Eligible mothers will be randomized to one of two allocated groups: Group A: domperidone 10 mg orally three times daily for 28 days; and Group B: identical placebo 10 mg orally three times daily for 14 days followed by domperidone 10 mg orally three times daily for 14 days. The primary outcome will be determined at the completion of the first 2-week period; the second 2-week period will facilitate answering the secondary questions regarding timing and duration of treatment. To detect an estimated 30% change between the two groups (from 40% to 28%, corresponding to an odds ratio of 0.6), a total sample size of 488 mothers would be required at 80% power and alpha = 0.05. To account for a 15% dropout, this number is increased to 560 (280 per group). The duration of the trial is expected to be 36–40 months.

Discussion

The use of a galactogogue often becomes the measure of choice for mothers in the presence of insufficient breast milk production, particularly when the other techniques are unsuccessful. EMPOWER is designed to provide valuable information in guiding the practices for this high-risk group of infants and mothers. The results of this trial will also inform both mothers and clinicians about the choices available to increase and maintain sufficient breast milk.

### ABM clinical protocol # 9: use of galactogogues in initiating or augmenting maternal milk production, second revision 2018 [^115mDqzw]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #9 — Domperidone safety, interactions, dosing, and FDA status: In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an advisory against the use of domperidone in lactating women and has explicitly recommended against the use of Domperidone to increase milk production; domperidone is not approved by the FDA for use in the United States, except for some specific circumstances, and prescription medications used as galactogogues constitute off-label use in most countries. Neonatal findings report very low levels in milk and no QTc prolongation in premature infants who had ingested breast milk of mothers on domperidone. Interactions note increased blood levels of domperidone when combined with some substrates metabolized by CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors, for example, fluconazole, macrolide antibiotics, grapefruit juice, cannabinoids, antipsychotics, and others. Use comments include do not advise exceeding maximum recommended dosage; for gastrointestinal dysmotility, doses of 20 mg 3 or 4 times per day may be recommended if no response to lower doses, with some areas using this dose initially to stimulate prolactin and only one study using this dose in lactating women; tapering of dose usually recommended. Potential side effects (minor and significant) should be weighed carefully against any potential benefit.

### The transfer of domperidone into human milk remains low at high doses [^117Y6JpD]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Domperidone is a dopamine-2 (D2) receptor antagonist that stimulates the release of stored prolactin in the anterior pituitary. It is prescribed off-label in Canada and Australia to promote lactation in prolactin-deficient women. The case of a 43-year-old woman taking a high daily dose of domperidone (160mg) is described from the InfantRisk Center Human Milk Biorepository. Milk samples were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method, detecting an average domperidone concentration of 7.0ng/mL (range 6.2 to 8.4ng/mL). Even at high doses, the transfer of domperidone into breast milk was negligible with a relative infant dose (RID) of 0.05%. The RID estimates the infant's potential exposure to a drug via lactation as a percentage of the weight-adjusted maternal dose. The standard threshold for reasonable infant exposure is an RID of 10%.

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide on human milk production in postpartum mothers: a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^11743Xk7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Metoclopramide

Metoclopramide is another widely used galactagogue. Early clinical trials in the pharmacological treatment for improving breastmilk insufficiency often focused on metoclopramide. Our analysis revealed there was no difference in the increased breast milk volume between metoclopramide and placebo for mothers with breast milk insufficiency. This finding was consistent with two recent systematic reviews. The difference in lactation efficacy between domperidone and metoclopramide, which are both dopamine antagonists, may be due to the following two reasons: First, metoclopramide is more lipid soluble, has lower molecular weight, higher protein binding than domperidone. Second, the medication duration of metoclopramide is too short. A recent meta-analysis found that two-week metoclopramide therapy didn't elevate prolactin levels, but three-week therapy did. However, in the studies involved in our analysis, the duration of metoclopramide was 9.3 ± 5.1 days (only one study > two weeks).

One reason for the limited duration of metoclopramide administration is concern about its potential side effects. Unlike domperidone, metoclopramide does readily cross the blood-brain barrier, and has the potential to cause extrapyramidal side effects and other serious maternal adverse events, including depression. The prolonged use of metoclopramide is associated with an elevated frequency of tardive dyskinesia. Therefore, the experts' recommended dosage (less than five days, less than 10 mg three times daily) is not sufficient to improve breast milk insufficiency.

Limitation

Several limitations are still in our study. First, due to the small sample sizes in the studies analyzed, our conclusions are limited. Second, the included studies were heterogeneous in the details of interventions, including the treatment initiation, the treatment durations, and the dosage of medicine. Third, not all non-pharmacological breastfeeding strategies in the included studies were well described. Fourth, eligibility criteria varied widely across studies (details in Supplemental Table S2).

### Effect of domperidone on the composition of preterm human breast milk [^111QXtxo]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Domperidone is increasingly prescribed to improve breast milk volume despite a lack of evidence regarding its effects on breast milk composition. We examined the effect of domperidone on the nutrient composition of breast milk.

Patients and Methods

Forty-six mothers who had delivered infants at < 31 weeks' gestation, who experienced lactation failure, were randomly assigned to receive domperidone or placebo for 14 days. Protein, energy, fat, carbohydrate, sodium, calcium, and phosphate levels in breast milk were measured on days 0, 4, 7, and 14, serum prolactin levels were measured on days 0, 4, and 14, and total milk volume was recorded daily. Mean within-subject changes in nutrients and milk volumes were examined.

Results

Maternal and infant characteristics, serum prolactin level, and breast milk volume and composition were not significantly different between domperidone and placebo groups on day 0. By day 14, breast milk volumes increased by 267% in the domperidone-treated group and by 18.5% in the placebo group (P = 0.005). Serum prolactin increased by 97% in the domperidone group and by 17% in the placebo group (P = 0.07). Mean breast milk protein declined by 9.6% in the domperidone group and increased by 3.6% in the placebo group (P = 0.16). Changes in energy, fat, carbohydrate, sodium, and phosphate content were also not significantly different between groups. Significant increases were observed in breast milk carbohydrate (2.7% vs -2.7%; p = 0.05) and calcium (61.8% vs -4.4%; p = 0.001) in the domperidone versus placebo groups. No significant adverse events were observed among mothers or infants.

Conclusion

Domperidone increases the volume of breast milk of preterm mothers experiencing lactation failure, without substantially altering the nutrient composition.

### Enhancing breast milk production with domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates (EMPOWER trial) [^111fLnjL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The use of mother's own breast milk during initial hospitalization has a positive impact not only in reducing potential serious neonatal morbidities but also contribute to improvements in neurodevelopmental outcomes. Mothers of very preterm infants struggle to maintain a supply of breast milk during their infants' prolonged hospitalization. Galactogogues are medications that induce lactation by exerting its effects through oxytocin or prolactin enhancement. Domperidone is a potent dopamine D2 receptor antagonist which stimulates the release of prolactin. Small trials have established its ability in enhancing breast milk production. EMPOWER was designed to determine the safety and efficacy of domperidone in mothers experiencing an inadequate milk supply.

Methods/Design

EMPOWER is a multicenter, double masked, randomized controlled phase-II trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of domperidone in those mothers identified as having difficulty in breast milk production. Eligible mothers will be randomized to one of two allocated groups: Group A: domperidone 10 mg orally three times daily for 28 days; and Group B: identical placebo 10 mg orally three times daily for 14 days followed by domperidone 10 mg orally three times daily for 14 days. The primary outcome will be determined at the completion of the first 2-week period; the second 2-week period will facilitate answering the secondary questions regarding timing and duration of treatment. To detect an estimated 30% change between the two groups (from 40% to 28%, corresponding to an odds ratio of 0.6), a total sample size of 488 mothers would be required at 80% power and alpha = 0.05. To account for a 15% dropout, this number is increased to 560 (280 per group). The duration of the trial is expected to be 36–40 months.

Discussion

The use of a galactogogue often becomes the measure of choice for mothers in the presence of insufficient breast milk production, particularly when the other techniques are unsuccessful. EMPOWER is designed to provide valuable information in guiding the practices for this high-risk group of infants and mothers. The results of this trial will also inform both mothers and clinicians about the choices available to increase and maintain sufficient breast milk.

### Study protocol: a double blind placebo controlled trial examining the effect of domperidone on the composition of breast milk [NCT00308334] [^114rU7JZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Background

During the past two decades, significant advances in medical technology have contributed to the increased survival of preterm, very low birth weight infants. As mortality rates have declined, the focus has shifted to decreasing morbidity and length of hospital stay for these high-risk infants. Nutritional care is one area with great potential for improvement. There continue to be many unanswered questions as to what constitutes optimal nutrient intake for the extremely preterm neonate. Although the current literature states that fortified human breast milk is most desirable, the optimal macronutrient composition of prepared fortifiers continues to be studied. Also, the shift from formula feeding of preterm infants to human breast milk has caused an increase in mothers of preterm infants providing expressed breast to their babies over prolonged periods.

Many mothers of very preterm infants experience difficulty maintaining milk production over several months, and hence medications such as domperidone are often recommended to help augment milk supply. Such medications increase maternal prolactin levels and have been shown to significantly increase the quantity of breast milk a lactating woman produces. Higher prolactin levels have been linked to accelerated decline in protein levels in term breast milk. However, there is a paucity of information in the literature, on the effect of domperidone on the macronutrient content of breast milk. Although pharmacological augmentation of breast milk volume is valuable, carefully conducted quantitative studies are required to assess the effect of such medication on human breast milk composition including protein, fat and other constituents. We, therefore, designed a study to determine the effect of domperidone on the macronutrient (protein, fat, and energy) and macromineral (calcium, phosphorus, and sodium) content of breast milk among mothers of very preterm infants.

c. Physiology of lactation

The initiation of lactation (lactogenesis) is a natural process that is based on a complex interaction of hormones. Changes in estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy alter the morphologic structure of breast tissue. Increasing levels of the hormone prolactin is key in the initiation and maintenance of lactation and may play a role in the control of electrolyte composition and alteration in amino acid concentration of mature human breast milk. A significant increase in lactogenesis occurs following delivery with the concurrent decline in estrogen and progesterone. In addition, the tactile stimulus by the suckling baby causes a release of prolactin from the pituitary, which stimulates milk flow. This suckling induced prolactin release is a reflex related to hypothalamic serotoninergic neuron activation, accompanied by a concomitant increase of dopamine turn over. Babies delivered at less than 32 weeks gestation are not able to effectively coordinate sucking, swallowing and breathing. The lack of effective suckling that is associated with the delivery of a preterm baby as well as maternal stress, infection, or fatigue can lead to difficulties maintaining lactation.

d. Non-pharmacological interventions to enhance human breast milk production

Non pharmacological measures such as added emotional support, kangaroo care/skin to skin, compressing and massage, relaxation techniques, expressing breast milk at the baby's bedside, increasing pumping times, and alterations in mechanical expression contribute to a variable level of success in augmenting milk production. For those mothers whose milk production is refractory to non-pharmacological interventions, and who verbalize a continued desire to provide expressed breast milk, the use of pharmacological intervention may be recommended.

e. Pharmacological interventions

The administration of an anti-dopaminergic drug, such as metoclopramide or domperidone has been shown to yield positive results. Endogenous dopamine has a physiological inhibitory role in the control of prolactin release. Therefore, the administration of a dopamine inhibitor increases plasma prolactin levels and induces lactogenesis. Metoclopramide, a central dopamine antagonist, has been most widely studied and proven to be highly efficacious in augmenting milk supply. However, reports indicate that it crosses the blood brain barrier, and is secreted in significant amounts in the breast milk. As well, animal studies have reported dopamine mediated responses in the offspring of nursing rats.

### Central administration of orexin A suppresses basal and domperidone stimulated plasma prolactin [^112ym8NW]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2000). Low credibility.

Orexin immunoreactive fibres are abundant in the hypothalamus suggesting a neuroendocrine regulatory role. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of orexin A suppressed plasma prolactin in male rats by 71% at 20 min post-injection and 83% at 90 min post-injection (P < 0.005 vs saline at both time points). To investigate whether this effect was through the tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) system, a supra-maximal dose of domperidone, a dopamine receptor antagonist, was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) prior to ICV injection of orexin A. ICV orexin A significantly suppressed domperidone (9 mg/kg)-stimulated plasma prolactin levels, by up to 40% (i.p. domperidone + ICV orexin A 3 nmol 34.5 ± 7.4 ng/ml and i.p. domperidone + ICV orexin A 20 nmol 43.5 ± 4.3 ng/ml, both P < 0.005 vs i.p. domperidone + ICV saline 57.9 ± 2.7 ng/ml). Orexin A, 100 nM, significantly stimulated release of neurotensin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, somatostatin, corticotropin releasing factor and luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, but had no effect on release of dopamine, thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), vasopressin or melanin-concentrating hormone from hypothalamic explants in vitro. Orexin A did not alter basal or TRH stimulated prolactin release in dispersed pituitary cells harvested from male rats. The data suggest that ICV administration of orexin A suppresses plasma prolactin in part through a pathway independent of the dopaminergic system.

c. Statistical analysis

Analysis and inference will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. Efforts will be made to ensure that follow up is complete for all subjects and that there are no missing values for any of the subjects for any variable. Blinding of group assignment will be retained until after the analysis is completed. Baseline characteristics of study subjects will be contrasted to ascertain that randomization has in fact produced comparable groups with respect to all variables that effect the composition of breast milk including gestational age at delivery and duration since delivery. The primary outcome of interest will be a potential decline in breast milk protein content over time within the domperidone group versus the placebo group. This analysis will compare the means in the two groups before and after treatment and contrast the mean difference between groups using 95 percent confidence intervals and a p value. The stratified nature of the randomization will be accounted for in the analysis. If differences are noted in baseline characteristics, inferences will be made based on observed and (linear regression) adjusted differences between groups. Analysis for fat, lactose, energy, calcium, phosphorus and sodium content in expressed breast milk will be done in an identical fashion as for protein by comparing the means in the two groups before and after treatment and contrasting the mean differences between groups using 95 percent confidence intervals and a p value. Prolactin levels will be compared between the two groups and used to determine the correlation between prolactin levels and volume of milk produced.

### Longitudinal trends in domperidone dispensing to mothers of very preterm infants and its association with breast milk feeding at infant discharge: a retrospective study [^112bZoKX]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Breast milk is widely recognised as the best source of nutrition for all infants, particularly for preterm infants. However, lactation insufficiency, when a mother cannot produce enough breast milk to meet her infant's requirements, is frequent after preterm birth and is one of the most common reasons women discontinue breast feeding. Despite recognition that mothers of preterm infants face additional challenges with breastfeeding, lactation support for this high-risk group is often suboptimal. When lactation insufficiency persists following non-pharmacological supports, medications such as domperidone are often used to increase breast milk production.

Domperidone increases serum prolactin, a hormone required for breast milk production. Meta-analyses of trials involving mothers of preterm infants with diagnosed lactation insufficiency demonstrate that domperidone is effective for increasing short-term breast milk production by up to 88 mL/day at doses of 30 mg/day for 5–14 days. In contrast, limited evidence supports using domperidone as a preventative therapy immediately or soon after birth. Consequently, use is not typically recommended until after milk letdown has occurred and a trial of non-pharmacological strategies has been completed.

Whether identified short-term benefits of domperidone translate to improved longer-term breast milk feeding outcomes for mothers of preterm infants remains inconclusive. Previous studies report continued breast milk feeding rates at infant discharge from hospital ranging from 58% to 95% among women prescribed domperidone. Clinical trial evidence is inconsistent, with reports of higher breastfeeding rates at discharge or no difference, based on domperidone use. These studies also have significant limitations, including small sample sizes and differences in the treatment regimens. Consequently, it remains difficult to draw reliable conclusions about the longer-term impacts of domperidone use for lactation insufficiency.

Despite uncertainties surrounding longer-term breastfeeding outcomes, the use of domperidone among mothers of preterm infants has increased in high-income countries such as the UK and Canada, with reports suggesting up to 44% of all mothers of preterm infants are prescribed domperidone. Concurrently, safety concerns have been raised about domperidone. In 2014, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) reviewed domperidone's safety and efficacy data and recommended changes in practice due to a small risk of serious cardiac side effects.

### Psychiatric manifestations of withdrawal following domperidone used as a galactagogue [^111HD9hp]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background: Domperidone is a dopamine-2 antagonist used off-label to increase breast milk production. Dosages commonly promoted for lactation are often far above those of studied on-label indications and might pose additional risks, especially upon discontinuation of the drug. Patients: Three U.S. patients are presented who used domperidone for lactation and experienced varying degrees of psychiatric withdrawal symptoms lasting months during dosage tapering and after cessation. Conclusion: Domperidone as a galactagogue may pose a significant psychiatric risk upon discontinuation. This presentation is commonly confused with, but clinically distinct from, postpartum depression. Lactating mothers who present with psychiatric symptoms should be explicitly probed about domperidone use, even in areas where domperidone is not authorized for use. Maternal hesitancy to disclose domperidone use may lead to suboptimal outcomes for the patient and delay management of withdrawal manifestations. The best course of treatment remains unknown, but a slow hyperbolic taper to gently discontinue domperidone may minimize withdrawal symptoms in these patients. Individuals exploring domperidone use should be informed of potential risks upon withdrawal, including psychiatric manifestations, requisite taper, and potential impacts of using unstudied high doses.

### Drug insight: prolactin-receptor antagonists, a novel approach to treatment of unresolved systemic and local hyperprolactinemia? [^116S1dNQ]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Medium credibility.

Prolactin is a polypeptide hormone whose major biological actions are related to normal lactation and reproduction. Abnormally high prolactin levels, referred to as hyperprolactinemia, can result in various reproductive disorders. Currently, therapeutic management of hyperprolactinemia relies on dopamine agonists, since dopamine is the primary physiological suppressor of pituitary prolactin production. Epidemiologic studies have shown that prolactin levels in the high-normal range, as well as medications that interfere with dopamine action (e.g. certain antipsychotic drugs), might correlate with increased breast cancer risk. In addition to circulating prolactin, it is now well established that prolactin is also produced locally within various tissues, including breast and prostate. Increasing evidence, mainly from animal studies at present, suggests that excess locally produced prolactin may promote the growth of breast and prostate tumors via an autocrine or paracrine mechanism. These findings have renewed the interest in finding alternative strategies to suppress prolactin actions when dopamine agonists are ineffective. Our studies of the relationship between prolactin structure and function have resulted in the development of pure prolactin-receptor antagonists. These molecules prevent endogenous prolactin from exerting its actions via a competitive mechanism for receptor binding. In this review, we discuss the possible future therapeutic utility of this novel class of compounds.

### Approach to the patient with prolactinoma [^116UCq8y]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH

The diagnostic workup for hyperprolactinemia is shown in Fig. 2. As reported in Table 1, a number of physiologic (pregnancy, breastfeeding, stress, exercise, food intake, and sleep) and pathologic conditions (chronic kidney and liver failure, primary hypothyroidism, compression of the pituitary stalk by a non–PRL-secreting pituitary tumor or different parasellar mass, and granulomatous infiltration of the hypothalamus), as well as several drugs (mainly antidepressants, dopamine receptor blockers, dopamine synthesis inhibitors, oral contraceptives, gastrointestinal medications, neuroleptics, and antipsychotics) can induce symptomatic hyperprolactinemia. Before a correct diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia is made, such conditions must be investigated and excluded. Attention should be paid to medical history, concomitant medications, and biochemical assessment. This is particularly true in the case of modest PRL elevations, which only occasionally may mask the presence of a prolactinoma, as in clinical case 2. To ascertain the diagnosis of a PRL-secreting pituitary tumor, a single measurement of serum PRL without excessive venipuncture stress is strongly recommended. Breast examination in patients with galactorrhea should not be performed immediately before PRL assessment because any nipple stimulation might result in PRL increase. A level above the upper limit of normal (25 μg/L in women, 20 μg/L in men) raises diagnostic suspicion. Conversely, dynamic testing of PRL secretion based on the administration of TRH, L-dopa, nomifensine, and domperidone does not find clinical application currently. In uncertain conditions, sampling can be repeated after overnight fasting on a different day in 2 to 3 samples in time course at 15- to 20-minute intervals to minimize the effect of PRL pulsatile secretion. PRL levels > 250 μg/L generally confirm the diagnosis of prolactinoma, albeit PRL increase over 200 μg/L can be also seen in case of non–PRL-secreting tumor mass, such as nonfunctioning pituitary tumors. In presence of a serum PRL level > 500 μg/L, the diagnosis of macroprolactinoma can be ruled in. Once other causes of hyperprolactinemia (see previous section) have been excluded, a radiological confirmation with pituitary imaging, mainly based on gadolinium-enhanced MRI is required. Over the past 20 years, pituitary MRI has progressively replaced computed tomography with IV contrast enhancement because the latter is less effective than MRI in visualizing small tumors on the one hand and in shaping the extension of large or giant tumors on the other. Nowadays, a pituitary computed tomography scan is recommended only when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, such as in patients with cardiac pacemakers, implanted cardiac defibrillators; internal pacing wires; clips for cerebral, carotid, or aortic aneurysm; cochlear implants; any implant held in by magnet; Swan-Ganz catheter; and pregnancy. In the latter circumstance, the use of pituitary MRI is not recommended except in the case of clinical confirmation of tumor growth suggested by sudden impairment in the visual field, and MRI should be performed without gadolinium after the second trimester of pregnancy. In those patients with macroadenomas impinging the optic chiasm, a visual field examination is recommended, whereas visual testing is not mandatory for patients with microadenomas.

### Reduced dopaminergic tone during lactation is permissive to the hypothalamic stimulus for suckling-induced prolactin release [^1131ChVj]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2020). Medium credibility.

Dopamine from tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) neurones tonically inhibits prolactin (PRL) secretion. Lactational hyperprolactinaemia is associated with a reduced activity of TIDA neurones. However, it remains controversial whether the suckling-induced PRL surge is driven by an additional decrease in dopamine release or by stimulation from a PRL-releasing factor. In the present study, we further investigated the role of dopamine in the PRL response to suckling. Non-lactating (N-Lac), lactating 4 hour apart from pups (Lac), Lac with pups return and suckling (Lac+S), and post-lactating (P-Lac) rats were evaluated. PRL levels were elevated in Lac rats and increased linearly within 30 minutes of suckling in Lac+S rats. During the rise in PRL levels, dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels in the median eminence (ME) and neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary did not differ between Lac+S and Lac rats. However, dopamine and DOPAC were equally decreased in Lac and Lac+S compared to N-Lac and P-Lac rats. Suckling, in turn, reduced phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase in the ME of Lac+S. Domperidone and bromocriptine were used to block and activate pituitary dopamine D2 receptors, respectively. Domperidone increased PRL secretion in both N-Lac and Lac rats, and suckling elicited a robust surge of PRL over the high basal levels in domperidone-treated Lac+S rats. Conversely, bromocriptine blocked the PRL response to suckling. The findings obtained in the present study provide evidence that dopamine synthesis and release are tonically reduced during lactation, whereas dopamine is still functional with respect to inhibiting PRL secretion. However, there appears to be no further reduction in dopamine release associated with the suckling-induced rise in PRL. Instead, the lower dopaminergic tone during lactation appears to be required to sensitise the pituitary to a suckling-induced PRL-releasing factor.

Future directions

Domperidone and metoclopramide were evaluated in this study. However, some other pharmacological galactagogues have been reported, such as sulpiride, growth hormone, recombinant human prolactin, thyrotropin releasing hormone, oxytocin, and metformin. Due to the scarcity of studies on these drugs, our NMA did not include them. More RCTs on these drugs for postpartum women needed to be carried out in the future.

Although some literature has reported the use of domperidone for lactation in couples who are adopting or same-sex couples, and transgender women, more study is needed.

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide on human milk production in postpartum mothers: a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112U9yjE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Domperidone increased the daily breast milk volume in mothers of preterm infants, without serious adverse events. However, this conclusion is limited due to the small sample sizes in the studies analyzed. The use of domperidone for breast milk stimulation must be prescribed by a physician, and potential side effects should be considered. Women should receive appropriate guidance on ways to enhance breast milk production in hospital and in the 30 days following hospital discharge, before considering to medication to increase milk production.

### Euprolactinemic galactorrhea secondary to domperidone treatment [^112SvjqX]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Milk leakage from the breast, which is known as galactorrhea, can be caused by a number of pharmacological, physical, and tumoral factors. Galactorrhea is a well-known side effect of domperidone, and is usually associated with hyperprolactinemia. However, euprolactinemic galactorrhea secondary to domperidone is very rarely seen and has yet to be reported in children before. Here, we report an adolescent with euprolactinemic galactorrhea caused by domperidone.

### Enhancing breast milk production with domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates (EMPOWER trial) [^114fc5KN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the recent perinatal and neonatal technological advances, at least 8.2% of births in Canada are preterm (< 37 weeks gestation), a figure that has continued to rise. The very preterm infant is often growth restricted because of the concurrent illnesses and difficulties in optimizing energy and nutrient intake for normal growth. Studies have suggested that early nutritional intervention (breast milk and preterm formula) that will support growth, in particular brain growth, will lead to an improved outcome even in the presence of injury. There is further evidence to suggest that the use of mother's own breast milk compared to infant formula during initial hospitalization has a positive impact not only in reducing potential serious neonatal morbidities but also contribute to improvements in neurodevelopmental outcomes. There is a growing movement in neonatal care for very preterm infants to receive breast milk as the primary source of nutrition rather than rely on preterm formula. Mothers are therefore encouraged to begin pumping their breasts to provide breast milk for their infants. With preterm infants requiring hospitalization for anywhere from 10–16 weeks before their discharge from initial hospitalization, continued and sustained breast milk volume can prove to be a challenge to even the most dedicated of mothers. Most mothers of very preterm infants, for a variety of reasons such as illness, stress and other factors related to preterm birth, are unable to express sufficient amounts of milk to exclusively feed their infants.

There have been many identified and studied non-pharmacological measures such as emotional support, kangaroo care, skin-to-skin contact, expressing breast milk at the infant's bedside, increasing pumping frequency and duration and types of mechanical expression that have been found to contribute to variable levels of success in augmenting the breast milk production in mothers of preterm infants. For those mothers in whom milk production has declined and is not responding to non-pharmacologic measures, the use of galactogogues is often considered. Galactogogues are medications that induce lactation generally from exerting its effects through oxytocin or prolactin enhancement. The primary galactogogues used today for prolactin enhancement are dopamine antagonists with the most widely studied being metoclopramide and domperidone. Domperidone is a potent dopamine D 2 receptor antagonist and was developed and marketed as a prokinetic and antiemetic agent. By blocking dopamine D 2 receptors in the anterior pituitary, domperidone stimulates the release of prolactin Table 1.

### Repurposing domperidone in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: a simon 2-stage phase 2 futility trial [^111qrGBZ]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess whether treatment with the generic drug domperidone can reduce the progression of disability in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), we conducted a phase 2 futility trial following the Simon 2-stage design.

Methods

We enrolled patients in an open-label, Simon 2-stage, single-center, phase 2, single-arm futility trial at the Calgary Multiple Sclerosis Clinic if they met the following criteria: age of 18 to 60 years, SPMS, screening Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 4.0 to 6.5, and screening timed 25-ft walk (T25FW) of ≥ 9 seconds. Patients received domperidone 10 mg 4 times daily for 1 year. The primary outcome was worsening of disability, defined as worsening of the T25FW performance by ≥ 20% at 12 months compared to baseline. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02308137).

Results

Between February 13, 2015, and January 3, 2020, 110 patients were screened, 81 received treatment, and 64 completed follow-up, of whom 62 were analyzed. The study did not meet its primary endpoint: 22 of 62 (35%) patients experienced significant worsening of disability, which is close to the expected proportion of 40% and above the predefined futility threshold. Patients with higher prolactin levels during the study had a significantly lower risk of disability progression, which may warrant further investigation. Domperidone treatment was reasonably well tolerated, but adverse events occurred in 84% and serious adverse events in 15% of patients.

Conclusions

Domperidone treatment could not reject futility in reducing disability progression in SPMS. The Simon 2-stage trial model may be a useful model for phase 2 studies in progressive MS.

Trial Registration Information

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02308137.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class III evidence that in individuals with SPMS participating in a futility trial, domperidone treatment could not reject futility in reducing disability progression at 12 months.

### Domperidone for lactation: what health care providers need to know [^117H38Dc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

This commentary serves to raise health care provider awareness about the regulatory status and available evidence regarding domperidone for insufficient lactation. Breastfeeding provides significant health benefits for mothers and infants, and insufficient milk production remains the most common reason for early weaning. Domperidone, a dopamine receptor antagonist that may increase milk production, is not approved for any human use in the United States. It is approved in some countries for certain gastrointestinal disorders, but is not approved in any country for lactation enhancement. Domperidone is associated with serious cardiac arrhythmias. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an import alert in 2004, updated in 2012, explaining that the importation of domperidone is illegal with limited exceptions, including when imported pursuant to an investigational new drug application. The FDA also issued a public safety warning regarding the use of domperidone for lactation. Nonetheless, domperidone is sometimes being obtained illegally and used in attempts to increase milk production in lactating mothers. There is limited quality evidence for the effectiveness of domperidone for lactation enhancement. In contrast, considerable information exists on domperidone's cardiac risks including QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death, including among lactating women. In light of limited efficacy data that do not offset safety concerns from a public health perspective, we continue to caution against using domperidone for lactation enhancement. Research and drug development are needed to address the significant unmet medical need for lactation disorders.

### Effects of domperidone in increasing milk production in mothers with insufficient lactation for infants in the neonatal intensive care unit [^116JLZ2v]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Breast milk is the optimum for all infants, but hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit can cause separation of mothers and infants, which often interferes with milk secretion. Some reports show that domperidone is effective in promoting milk secretion. However, the Food and Drug Administration in the United States cautioned to not use domperidone for increasing milk volume because domperidone carries some risk of cardiac events, including QT prolongation, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. In contrast, it is used in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom with safety. The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs may vary by race or ethnic origin, and it is not known whether domperidone is effective or safe for Japanese. In this study we report the effects of domperidone for Japanese mothers with insufficient lactation. Ten mothers were enrolled in a pilot study. After confirming that there were no abnormal findings on the electrocardiogram, the mothers were administered domperidone. Seven of 10 who took domperidone increased their milking volume. Prolactin was increased in 9 of 10 mothers. Adverse events were observed in two mothers, one headache and one abdominal pain; all symptoms were mild and improved promptly; and there were no adverse cardiac events. These results are consistent with reports from other countries. Domperidone may tentatively be considered effective for increasing milk secretion in Japanese mothers as in other populations. Our preliminary study of 10 cases indicates the need for further studies with larger sample sizes to assess the efficacy and safety of domperidone.

### Diabetic gastroparesis: principles and current trends in management [^114soFvc]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Metoclopramide

Metoclopramide is one of the most commonly used agents in the management of DGP. It is both a central and a peripheral dopamine-2 (D2)-receptor antagonist with antiemetic and prokinetic actions that increases antral contractions and coordinates antral duodenal motility. Restricting the total daily metoclopramide dose to 40 mg/day and using the liquid formulation to improve its pharmacokinetics provide a balance between efficacy and side effects to the central nervous system. Female gender, younger age, presence of diabetes and use of high doses are risk factors for acute dystonia.

Metoclopramide can be administered parenterally when symptoms are severe. The FDA issued a black box warning in 2009 cautioning about its use beyond 3 months.

An intranasal spray was found to improve symptoms compared to placebo in female but not male diabetic patients.

Metoclopramide increases serum prolactin levels. Gynecomastia and galactorrhea may occur in adults as well as adolescents and young children, and adult women may develop oligomenorrhea Metoclopramide also stimulates aldosterone synthesis and may provoke uncontrolled hypertension in a subset of patients with primary hyper-aldosteronism. Metoclopramide can prolong the QTc in susceptible patients. In the United States, it is recommended that metoclopramide be reserved for the most severe cases that are unresponsive to other treatment modalities. A few years ago, the European Medicines Agency cautioned that the risks of extrapyramidal symptoms outweigh the benefits of metoclopramide.

Domperidone

Domperidone is a type II dopamine antagonist similar to metoclopramide, and it is equally efficacious to the latter but with less side effects to the central nervous system as it does not cross the blood–brain barrier. Domperidone has been shown to reduce GI symptoms and hospitalizations from gastroparesis and to accelerate gastric emptying at doses between 10 mg and 30 mg taken orally 30 min before meals and at bedtime. Domperidone can cause gynecomastia in men and amenorrhea and galactorrhea in women. A baseline electrocardiogram is recommended to assess corrected QT intervals, and this should be repeated as indicated. The drug is often withheld from patients with a QTc of > 470 ms in males and of > 450 ms in females, and a cardiology consultation may be indicated. Because of a reported association with serious cardiac arrhythmias, domperidone is restricted for use in some countries. Domperidone is available in the US through an FDA-sponsored Investigational New Drug program.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111pjHdd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Medication-induced hyperprolactinemia — drug associations and prolactin levels is usually associated with prolactin levels ranging from 25 to 100 μg/ liter, with metoclopramide, risperidone, and phenothiazines sometimes leading to prolactin levels exceeding 200 μg/liter; in one group of 106 antipsychotic-treated patients, hyperprolactinemia was present in 81, 35, 29, and 38% of those taking risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, and typical antipsychotics, respectively. Verapamil causes hyperprolactinemia in 8.5% of patients, opiates and cocaine act through the μ-receptor to cause mild hyperprolactinemia, and twelve to 30% of women taking higher estrogen-containing oral contraceptives may have a small increase in serum prolactin.

### Enhanced tolerability of the 5-hydroxytryptophane challenge test combined with granisetron [^115EbG9t]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

A recently developed oral serotonergic challenge test consisting of 5-Hydroxytryptophane (5-HTP, 200 mg) combined with carbidopa (CBD, 100 mg + 50 mg) exhibited dose-related neuroendocrine responsiveness and predictable pharmacokinetics. However, its applicability is limited by nausea and vomiting. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way crossover trial was performed in 12 healthy male volunteers. The 5-HTP/CBD-challenge was combined with two oral anti-emetics (granisetron, 2 mg or domperidone, 10 mg) to investigate its reliability when side-effects are suppressed. The neuroendocrine response (serum cortisol and prolactin), the side-effect profile [Visual Analogue Scale Nausea (VAS)] and vomiting subjects per treatment were the main outcome measures. Compared to 5-HTP/CBD/placebo, 5-HTP/CBD/ granisetron had no impact on cortisol [% change with 95% confidence interval: -7.1% (18.9; 6.5)] or prolactin levels [-9.6% (-25.1; 9.1)]; 5-HTP/CBD/domperidone increased cortisol [+13.0% (-4.2; 33.4)], and increased prolactin extensively [+336.8% (245.7; 451.9)]. Compared to placebo, VAS Nausea increased non-significantly with granisetron [+7.6 mm (-1.3; 16.5)], as opposed to domperidone [+16.2 mm (7.2; 25.2)] and 5-HTP/CBD/placebo [+14.7 mm (5.5; 23.8)]. No subjects vomited with granisetron, compared to two subjects treated with 5-HTP/CBD/placebo and five subjects with domperidone. Compared with 5-HTP/CBD/placebo, granisetron addition decreased C(max) of 5-HTP statistically significantly different (from 1483 to 1272 ng/ml) without influencing AUC(0- infinity). Addition of granisetron to the combined 5-HTP/CBD challenge suppresses nausea and vomiting without influencing the neuroendocrine response or pharmacokinetics, enhancing its clinical applicability in future psychiatric research and drug development.

### Prolactin and dopamine: what is the connection? A review article [^115SESKP]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Dopamine (DA) holds a predominant role in the regulation of prolactin (PRL) secretion. Through a direct effect on anterior pituitary lactotrophs, DA inhibits the basally high-secretory tone of the cell. It accomplishes this by binding to D2 receptors expressed on the cell membrane of the lactotroph, activation of which results in a reduction of PRL exocytosis and gene expression by a variety of intracellular signalling mechanisms. The hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons, which provide DA to the anterior pituitary gland, are themselves regulated by feedback from PRL through a 'short-loop feedback mechanism'. A variety of other modulators of prolactin secretion act at the hypothalamic level by either disinhibition of the dopaminergic tone (e.g. serotonin, GABA, oestrogens and opioids) or by reinforcing it (e.g. substance P). All typical antipsychotic medications are associated with sustained hyperprolactinaemia due to their high affinity for the D2 receptor and their slow dissociation from the receptor once bound, but atypicals differ quite dramatically in their propensity to cause prolonged high prolactin levels. Of those atypicals that are associated with prolactin elevation, the main causative factor appears to be a higher peripheral-to-central dopamine receptor potency of either the parent drug or its active metabolite (e.g. risperidone, 9-hydroxy-risperidone and amisulpride). Antipsychotics that easily cross the blood-brain barrier and exhibit fast dissociation from the dopamine receptor once bound do not result in sustained hyperprolactinaemia.

### Metoclopramide hydrochloride (Reglan) [^1172xBiY]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.7 Hyperprolactinemia

As with other dopamine D2receptor antagonists, metoclopramide elevates prolactin levels.

Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating drugs, including metoclopramide.

Hyperprolactinemia may potentially stimulate prolactin-dependent breast cancer. However, some clinical studies and epidemiology studies have not shown an association between administration of dopamine D2receptor antagonists and tumorigenesis in humans [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

5.8 Effects on the Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery

Metoclopramide may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Concomitant use of central nervous system (CNS) depressants or drugs associated with EPS may increase this effect (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics). Avoid Reglan or the interacting drug, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Antipsychotics and hyperprolactinaemia: clinical recommendations [^117JamwL]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

A group of international experts in psychiatry, medicine, toxicology and pharmacy assembled to undertake a critical examination of the currently available clinical guidance on hyperprolactinaemia. This paper summarises the group's collective views and provides a summary of the recommendations agreed by the consensus group to assist clinicians in the recognition, clinical assessment, investigation and management of elevated plasma prolactin levels in patients being treated for severe mental illness. It also deals with the special problems of particular populations, gives advice about information that should be provided to patients, and suggests a strategy for routine monitoring of prolactin. The recommendations are based upon the evidence contained in the supplement 'Hyperprolactinaemia in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder: Clinical Implications' (2008). The guidance contained in this article is not intended to replace national guidance (such as that of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence), however, it does provide additional detail that is unlikely to be covered in existing guidelines, and focuses on areas of uncertainty and disagreement. We hope it will add to the debate about this topic.

### Current guidelines and their recommendations for prolactin monitoring in psychosis [^114VpLhE]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Guidelines on the use of second-generation antipsychotics and physical health monitoring have begun to include information on hyperprolactinemia, and generally recommend that patients should be queried about possible symptoms related to elevated prolactin: menstrual abnormalities, galactorrhea and sexual dysfunction. However, with only two exceptions, none of the guidelines suggest performing baseline plasma prolactin levels. Although several of the guidelines mention the potential for hyperprolactinemia to be associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis, there is no guidance how to monitor for this. Product labeling for the different antipsychotics inform the clinician about potential risks but are not helpful with precise monitoring recommendations. The internal medicine literature contains important information regarding the pulsatile secretion of prolactin, differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia, and plasma levels of prolactin usually associated with certain symptoms that would be useful for the prescriber of antipsychotics to be aware of. The prudent clinician should consider obtaining a baseline plasma prolactin level and at least one follow-up measurement when starting any patient on a new antipsychotic. This will help guide clinical decisions about antipsychotic dosage, switching antipsychotic medications, or considering ancillary treatments to protect bone mass. These decisions would be within the context of considering other adverse events as well as the overall effectiveness of the antipsychotic medication being used.

### ABM clinical protocol # 33: lactation care for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, plus patients [^114W4ZjY]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Induced lactation regimen — stimulation and expression phases — notes that doses of estrogen and progesterone may be increased gradually as tolerated to 8–12 mg estrogen and 400 mg progesterone daily, with risks (especially blood clots with high doses of estrogen) that should be discussed, and many providers will recommend nipple/areola stimulation and gentle hand expression one to three times per day. Prolactin promotion is generally achieved with galactagogues and may be used during the hormonal stimulation phase or the expression phase; traditional induced lactation protocols use these medications throughout the induced lactation process, although this is not evidence based. Domperidone has the strongest evidence for successful lactation promotion, and the only published case report of successful induced lactation is in a transgender woman who used this medication; it is not FDA approved for use in the United States. During the expression phase, estrogen may be lowered even further (0.025 mg estradiol patch), and consistent hand expression and pumping should be gradually increased 5–10 minutes 6–8 times per day.

### Safety of domperidone in treating nausea associated with dihydroergotamine infusion and headache [^1176kzeP]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this population, we observed no serious side effects or QTc prolongation. We also found that domperidone helps manage DHE-associated nausea in combination with other antiemetics. These findings align with decades of internationally accumulated clinical experience and numerous prospective trials. Although a range of options exist to treat migraine, migraine-associated nausea, and emergent nausea with DHE, most treatments are dangerous or replace nausea with disabling sedation. As a less sedating alternative, domperidone is invaluable in migraine management given that safety concerns are allayed.

Limitations of this study include its retrospective design and small sample size. Efficacy, including comparisons with centrally acting dopaminergic blockers, could not be assessed. Rare events and conditions, such as a concealed long QT syndrome, may be missed. In addition, this population was relatively young and healthy, and few patients had exacerbating conditions, such as electrolyte disorders or coadministration of QT prolonging agents. Finally, side effects were not specifically queried; we relied on progress notes and discharge summaries. Minor and asymptomatic side effects, such as liver enzyme or prolactin elevation, may have been missed.

It should be noted that no patients received high domperidone doses, and that all patients had baseline screening ECGs. While caution should be used when treating patients with risk factors such as older age, heart disease, concurrent use of QT prolonging medications, and hypokalemia, current evidence suggests that domperidone is safe and effective in the vast majority of individuals.

This audit provides Class IV evidence that domperidone is safe for treating nausea associated with DHE infusion and headache in a tertiary hospital. Future studies should extend these findings to other settings (e.g. outpatient clinics) and other populations (e.g. nonmigrainous headache disorders, patients with risk factors). Given domperidone's effectiveness and tolerability, concern for safety should not preclude its use in a well-screened headache population.

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide on human milk production in postpartum mothers: a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114jJMNP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Breastfeeding is the most advantageous nutrition for infants because of its many health benefits. However, lactation insufficiency is a prevalent issue among women, particularly those who give birth prematurely. Galactagogues, such as domperidone and metoclopramide, have been reported and may be beneficial for lactation insufficiency. However, the optimal pharmacological galactagogue remains unclear.

Methods

The PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from their inception to April 23, 2023. The primary aim of this research was to assess the efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide using Bayesian network meta-analysis. The efficacy outcome was the increased breast milk volume (in mL/day). The safety outcome was the frequency of maternal drug-related adverse events during the study period.

Results

Seventeen randomized controlled trials were included in the final analyses. Preterm mothers who took domperidone had a greater increase in breast milk volume than those who took metoclopramide or placebo (domperidone vs. metoclopramide: MD = 82.84, 95% CI: 37.04–118.95; domperidone vs. placebo: MD = 88.30, 95% CI: 59.48–118.62). However, in the term mothers, domperidone did not show the above benefit compared with metoclopramide or placebo (domperidone vs. metoclopramide: MD = 93.67, 95% CI: -186.11–375.59; domperidone vs. placebo: MD = 126.25, 95% CI: -49.91–304.55). Both in preterm and term mothers, metoclopramide was no better than the placebo. There was no difference in the frequency of maternal drug-related adverse outcomes among domperidone, metoclopramide, and placebo.

Conclusion

Domperidone increased the daily breast milk volume in mothers of preterm infants, without serious adverse events. However, this conclusion is limited due to the small sample sizes in the studies analyzed.

### Study protocol: a double blind placebo controlled trial examining the effect of domperidone on the composition of breast milk [NCT00308334] [^11571Hib]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

The first participant was enrolled in October 2003. In June of 2004 a Food and Drug administration (FDA, U.S. A.) warning was issued regarding safety concerns related to domperidone and lactating women. Seven women had been enrolled at that time. The IWK Health Centre Research Ethics Board was informed of the FDA warning and enrollment was discontinued. A No Objection Letter regarding the trial (Control # 093770) was issued by Health Canada October 1, 2004 and Ethics Approval was reinstated on October 5, 2004. An addendum was made to the consent form outlining the concerns raised by the FDA.

The FDA warning against the use of domperidone by lactating women was based on case reports related to the increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death in patients with malignant disease receiving high-dose intravenous domperidone therapy concurrently with chemotherapy and experiencing hypokalemia (serum potassium levels between 2.0 and 3.3 mmol/L). In its oral form, domperidone has been approved for use in Canada and worldwide as a motility agent with an excellent safety record. In a randomized trial, DaSilva et al determined that in women receiving 10 mg of domperidone 3 times daily to enhance lactation, the mean serum level on day 5 of therapy was 6.6 ng/mL. The mean level of domperidone excreted in the breast milk of these women was 1.2 ng/mL. No adverse effects to either mother or infants were reported.

5.7 Hyperprolactinemia

As with other dopamine D2receptor antagonists, metoclopramide elevates prolactin levels. Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating drugs, including metoclopramide.

5.8 Effects on the Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery

Metoclopramide may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Concomitant use of central nervous system (CNS) depressants or drugs associated with EPS may increase this effect (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics). Avoid GIMOTI or the interacting drug, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.9 Risk of Adverse Reactions with GIMOTI in Patients with Moderate or Severe Renal and Hepatic Impairment, CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers and Patients Taking Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors

Patients with moderate or severe renal or hepatic impairment, patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, and patients concurrently using strong CYP2D6 inhibitors have increased exposure to metoclopramide from GIMOTI due to reduced metabolism or excretion which may lead to an increased risk of adverse reactions, including tardive dyskinesia. Use of GIMOTI is not recommended in these patient populations since the dose of GIMOTI cannot be adjusted to reduce exposure [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7, 8.9)].

ABM Clinical Protocol #9 — Table 1 pharmacologic galactogogues (domperidone and metoclopramide) summarize evidence, dosing, duration, effects on lactation, and safety. Domperidone has "Five Level IB studies; others have inadequate methodology or excessive dropout rates" and was used at "10 mg, orally, 3 times per day" in most trials, with one study comparing "10 mg 3 times per day with 20 mg 3 times per day" and noting more milk production; "Doses > 60 mg per day have not been studied in this context". Reported treatment courses were "between 7 and 28 days", with "Increased rate of milk secretion in both pump-dependent mothers of preterm infants and other mothers with low milk supply". Adverse events included "psychomotor withdrawal symptoms from a dose of 160 mg per day" and rare arrhythmias "(1.3/10,000 postpartum women)". For metoclopramide, evidence is "IB-IIB… mixed results; effect on overall rate of milk secretion is unclear, but may be effective", with dosing "10 mg, orally, 3 to 4 times per day" for "7–14 days in various studies", effects described as "Possible increased rate of milk secretion; possible responders versus nonresponders", and safety concerns including "Reversible CNS effects with short-term use… " and "Rare reports of tardive dyskinesia (usually irreversible), causing the FDA to place a black box warning on this drug in the United States".

Discussion

This study reviewed the efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide as galactagogues in postpartum mothers through network analysis. Our paper involved 17 trials and nearly 800 women, which significantly surpassing previous meta-analyses. We also compared the efficacy and safety between domperidone and metoclopramide as galactagogues, which was analyzed and published in a meta-analysis for the first time. In this first comprehensive NMA, we found domperidone was more efficacious than metoclopramide and placebo in improving breast milk insufficiency. This benefit was only revealed in mothers with preterm infants. Orally domperidone 30 mg/day for seven days (cumulative doses = 210 mg) had maximal efficacy based on available data for improving breast milk insufficiency. Meantime, domperidone did not increase the maternal drug-related adverse outcomes, compared with metoclopramide and placebo.

### Enhancing breast milk production with domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates (EMPOWER trial) [^116xhnZN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale for phase II trial

Mothers of preterm infants are at a higher risk of a decline in milk production. It has been recommended that they should be evaluated no later than two weeks postpartum to determine what intervention may be required to assist them in augmenting and maintaining an adequate supply of milk. Although other measures can and should be considered, the use of a galactogogue often becomes the measure of choice, particularly when the other techniques are unsuccessful. The limited body of research on domperidone suggests that it has potential as a galactogogue in mothers of preterm infants; this has led to widespread use of this medication. However, there is a paucity of research to best guide clinicians as to the optimal dose, timing of administration and duration of treatment and to reaffirm safety. EMPOWER was initiated to firmly establish the safety of domperidone for mothers of preterm infants but also guide clinicians regarding initiation, timing and duration of treatment.

5.6 Hyperprolactinemia

As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2receptors, risperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Risperidone is associated with higher levels of prolactin elevation than other antipsychotic agents.

Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.

Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. An increase in pituitary gland, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in the risperidone carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.

Endocrine Society hyperprolactinemia — serum prolactin testing during pregnancy advises: In pregnant patients with prolactinomas, we recommend against performing serum prolactin measurements during pregnancy. During pregnancy, serum prolactin levels increase 10-fold, reaching levels of 150 to 300 μg/liter by term, and the pituitary gland increases in volume more than 2-fold; after dopamine agonists are discontinued at the start of pregnancy, serum prolactin levels increase and subsequent increases do not accurately reflect changes in tumor growth or activity, prolactin may not increase during pregnancy in all patients with prolactinomas, and postpartum levels are frequently lower than before conception with hyperprolactinemia sometimes resolving entirely after pregnancy.

Stratified by different cumulative doses during trials

We used 210 mg (30 mg/day × 7 days) as a boundary for the cumulative dose and divided domperidone and metoclopramide into four groups: "domperidone > 210 mg" (5 trials), "domperidone 210 mg" (6 trials), "metoclopramide > 210 mg" (4 trials), and "metoclopramide 210 mg" (3 trials).

After analysis, we found that both "domperidone > 210 mg" and "domperidone 210 mg" were more effective than placebo in increasing breast milk volume ("domperidone > 210 mg" vs. placebo: MD = 150.80, 95% CI: 80.55–216.73; "domperidone 210 mg" vs. placebo: MD = 74.42, 95% CI: 21.47–129.06; Fig. 4 C). Meanwhile, there was no difference between "domperidone > 210 mg" and "domperidone 210 mg" (MD = 76.54, 95% CI: -13.39–160.33; Supplemental Table S7).

There was no difference among "metoclopramide > 210 mg", "metoclopramide 210 mg", and placebo (Fig. 4 C and Supplemental Table S7).

Safety of galactagogues

There was no difference in the frequency of maternal drug-related adverse outcomes among domperidone, metoclopramide, and placebo (Fig. 5 and Supplemental Table S8). Four trials investigated the neonatal adverse effects: three trials did not reveal any drug-related adverse events, and one trial found there was no difference of the frequency of neonatal adverse events between domperidone and placebo.

### The diagnosis and prevalence of hypoprolactinemia in patients with panhypopituitarism and the effects on depression and sexual functions [^116Av2B2]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

Dopamine agonist-induced sexual dysfunction can also be seen in females. In the present study, female sexual functions do not appear to be significantly affected by hypopituitarism, but since all female patients had PRL deficiency, the effects of hypoprolactinemia could not be evaluated. However, an interesting observation is made regarding the potential influence of societal attitudes on the sexual lives of unmarried female patients, suggesting that conservative mentalities may have inhibitory effects. This raises a question about the validity of the questionnaire in the female group, possibly indicating that social and cultural factors might play a role in shaping perceptions of female sexual functioning. It is crucial to recognize that assessing sexual function involves not only physiological aspects but also psychological and sociocultural factors. Cultural norms, societal expectations, and personal beliefs can influence an individual's perception of sexual well-being. The validity of questionnaires in assessing female sexual function may indeed be influenced by such factors. Further research may be necessary for a better understanding of the interplay between hormonal factors, societal attitudes, and female sexual functions.

On the other hand, a family analysis, including 3 women with postpartum agalactia (2 sisters and one niece) with a heterozygous mutation identified in the exon 5 of PRL gene, revealed that PRL deficiency can be related to decreased fertility and early menopause, but normal sexual development in females.

Recombinant PRL has been used in mothers with lactation insufficiency with or without PRL deficiency and improved milk secretion and content. Lactation is a complex procedure and lack of PRL secretion is seen only in a minority of the mothers. So, other pharmaceutical galactogogues such as domperidone, metoclopramide, GH, metformin and TRH have been tried in the treatment of lactation insufficiency. Acute opioid administration was also shown to increase PRL levels possibly acting through the dopaminergic system. Studies are warranted for defining the therapeutic effects of recombinant PRL, other than lactation, in PRL deficiency.

In conclusion, PRL deficiency is prevalent among individuals with panhypopituitarism, with the potential to result in elevated depression scores in both sexes and impaired sexual functions in males. Notably, the observed lack of PRL effects on BMI, glucose, and lipid levels may be attributed to the limited number of patients with sufficient PRL in the study. A basal PRL level seems to be sufficient for the diagnosis of hypoprolactinemia in routine clinical practice and TRH stimulation test can be reserved for unequivocal results, if it will change our clinical approach, that may presumably occur in the future.

### Evaluating the effect of a 14-day course of domperidone on breast milk production: a per-protocol analysis from the EMPOWER trial [^115uCS1e]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Galactogogues are often considered when mothers of very preterm infants experience challenges in producing adequate amounts of breast milk. We conducted a per-protocol analysis of those mothers who completed a 14-day course of domperidone during the EMPOWER trial. Our primary aim was to evaluate the response to a completed course of domperidone and whether the response was affected by the timing of the initiation of intervention.

Methods

For this analysis, 83 mothers of infants ≤ 29 weeks gestation were included: 45 mothers who received domperidone from days 1 to 14 of the trial study treatment period and 38 mothers who received domperidone from days 15 to 28. Domperidone was given at a dose of 10mg thrice daily for 14 days. The primary outcome was the proportion of mothers who achieved a modest 50% increase in breast milk volume from the volume at the end of the 2-week period of treatment of domperidone.

Results

When adjusted for the initiation of domperidone treatment, the proportion of mothers in the days 1–14 group (77.8%) was similar compared to those in the days 15–28 group (65.8%), OR 1.96 (95% CI 0.72–5.32; p = 0.19).

Conclusion

Taking into consideration potential limitations in power, this secondary analysis was able to show that the mothers in the EMPOWER study who were identified as actually completing a 14-day treatment course responded irrespective of the timing of their initiation of domperidone and demonstrated a modest increase in breast milk volume.

### Metoclopramide or domperidone for increasing maternal breast milk output: a randomised controlled trial [^114Mziz1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effects of metoclopramide and domperidone on the breast milk output of mothers with infants in neonatal intensive care.

Design

Double-blind randomised controlled trial.

Setting

Tertiary level neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

Sample

Eighty mothers expressing breast milk for their infants (mean gestational age 28 weeks) based in NICU and the amounts expressed fell short of the prescribed target.

Intervention

Mothers were randomised to receive domperidone or metoclopramide for 10 days (10 mg three times a day).

Outcome Measures

Total milk volume daily for up to 10 days before the medication, 10 days during the trial and up to 10 days after medication. Adverse side effects were also recorded.

Results

Mothers produced more milk in the domperidone group and achieved a mean of 96.3% increase in milk volume (mean increase/pretrial volume) compared with a 93.7% increase for metoclopramide. After adjusting for the amount of milk produced prior to medication, the mean amount of milk produced while taking medication for those on domperidone was 31.0 ml/24 h (95% CI -5.67 to 67.6) greater than the mean for those on metoclopramide. Seven mothers taking metoclopramide reported side effects and three taking domperidone; a further eight women (of 29) who had a follow-on prescription for metoclopramide also reported side effects.

Conclusions

Oral domperidone and metoclopramide increased the volume of milk produced by mothers who are expressing to feed their babies in NICU. There were small differences in milk output between the two medications and in the incidence of side effects, but the differences were non-significant.

Stratified by gestational week (Preterm/term subgroup analysis)

12 RCTs reported the efficacy outcome in mothers with preterm infants. Preterm mothers who took domperidone had a greater increase in breast milk volume than those who took metoclopramide or placebo (domperidone vs. metoclopramide: MD = 82.84, 95% CI: 37.04–118.95; domperidone vs. placebo: MD = 88.30, 95% CI: 59.48–118.62; Fig. 4 A and Supplemental Table S4). There was no difference between metoclopramide and placebo (MD = 3.95, 95% CI: -22.52–46.59; Fig. 4 A).

Fig. 4
Subgroup analysis of efficacy. (A) Stratified by gestational week (preterm or term); (B) Stratified by different daily doses; (C) Stratified by different cumulative doses during trials

5 RCTs reported the efficacy outcome in mothers with term infants. There was no difference among domperidone, metoclopramide, and placebo (Fig. 4 A and Supplemental Table S5).

Stratified by different daily doses

According to the different daily doses, all trials received domperidone have been divided into 2 groups: "domperidone 30 mg/day" (9 trials) and "domperidone > 30 mg/day" (2 trials). All doses of metoclopramide taken were 30 mg per day.

Therefore, the results revealed both "domperidone 30 mg/day" and "domperidone > 30 mg/day" were more effective than placebo in increasing breast milk volume ("domperidone 30 mg/day" vs. placebo: MD = 100.52, 95% CI: 50.49–150.31; "domperidone > 30 mg/day" vs. placebo: MD = 120.35, 95% CI: 3.01–240.43; Fig. 4 B). Meanwhile, "domperidone 30 mg/day" was more efficacious than "metoclopramide 30 mg/day" for increasing breast milk volume (MD = 75.81, 95% CI: 6.13–147.15; Supplemental Table S6).

There was no difference between "metoclopramide 30 mg/day" and placebo (MD = 24.59, 95% CI: -36.93–84.64; Fig. 4 B).

### Drugs and prolactin [^117CXxzL]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

Medications commonly cause hyperprolactinemia and their use must be differentiated from pathologic causes. The most common medications to cause hyperprolactinemia are the antipsychotic agents, although some of the newer atypical antipsychotics do not do so. Other medications causing hyperprolactinemia include antidepressants, antihypertensive agents, and drugs which increase bowel motility. Often, the medication-induced hyperprolactinemia is symptomatic, causing galactorrhea, menstrual disturbance, and erectile dysfunction. In the individual patient, it is important differentiate hyperprolactinemia due to a medication from a structural lesion in the hypothalamic-pituitary area. This can be done by stopping the medication temporarily to determine if the prolactin (PRL) levels return to normal, switching to another medication in the same class which does not cause hyperprolactinemia (in consultation with the patient's physician and/or psychiatrist), or by performing an MRI or CT scan. If the hyperprolactinemia is symptomatic, management strategies include switching to an alternative medication which does not cause hyperprolactinemia, using estrogen/testosterone replacement, or cautiously adding a dopamine agonist.

### Metoclopramide hydrochloride [^115paZTR]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactinelevating drugs, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of prolactin-stimulating neuroleptic drugs and metoclopramide. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive at this time.

An Ames mutagenicity test performed on metoclopramide was negative.

Pregnancy Category B

Reproduction studies performed in rats, mice, and rabbits by the I.V. I.M. S.C., and oral routes at maximum levels ranging from 12 to 250 times the human dose have demonstrated no impairment of fertility or significant harm to the fetus due to metoclopramide. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Nursing Mothers

Metoclopramide is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when metoclopramide is administered to a nursing mother.

### Pharmacological hyperprolactinaemia [^116Qfz6Z]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

A middle-aged woman was referred under the 2-week urgent brain cancer initiative following the finding of a raised serum prolactin level. The patient had been taking metoclopramide on a daily basis to aid her symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. The raised prolactin level had led to oligomenorrhoea prompting her general practitioner (GP) to check pituitary hormone levels. Metoclopramide is a potent dopamine antagonist and dopamine acts as the physiological inhibitor of prolactin synthesis. Thus, the dopamine antagonism led to elevated prolactin level and the symptom of oligomenorrhoea. Following curtailment of the metoclopramide, the prolactin level normalised very quickly and the patient was reassured. Consideration should be given to non-pathological causes of hyperprolactinaemia, including physiological states such as pregnancy and concurrent medication.

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide in breastfeeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115QtGsZ]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide used by breastfeeding women. Methods: A systematic literature search retrieved citations from PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Medline, EBSCO, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov (from inception to January, 2021) and bibliographies of known articles. Randomized controlled trials exploring the effects of domperidone and metoclopramide in breastfeeding women with term and preterm infants experiencing adequate or low milk supply were identified. Human milk volume and maternal side effects were presented as mean difference (MD) or relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Sixteen trials involving 729 women were included in the qualitative analysis and 14 trials involving 607 women were included in the meta-analysis. In mothers of preterm infants with low milk supply, domperidone demonstrated a significant increase in daily human milk volume (MD = 90.53mL/day, 95% CI [65.42 to 115.64], I² = 9%). However, metoclopramide did not show significant difference in daily human milk volume in women with preterm infants (MD = -1.14mL/day, 95% CI [-31.42 to 29.14], I² = 0%). No differences in maternal side effects were noted with domperidone (RR = 1.20, 95% CI [0.74 to 1.97], I² = 0%) or metoclopramide (RR = 1.05, 95% CI [0.52 to 2.11], I² = 27%) in women with preterm infants. Regarding the women with term infants, there were insufficient data in the current review. Conclusions: Domperidone can be used to treat low milk supply in women with preterm infants without significant side effects based on the current review. More evidence exploring the efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide are still needed for breastfeeding women in the future.

Prolactinoma — first-line therapy and when not to treat: We recommend dopamine agonist therapy to lower prolactin levels, decrease tumor size, and restore gonadal function for symptomatic prolactin-secreting microadenomas or macroadenomas, and we recommend using cabergoline in preference to other dopamine agonists because it has higher efficacy in normalizing prolactin levels and a higher frequency of pituitary tumor shrinkage. We suggest that clinicians not treat asymptomatic patients harboring microprolactinomas with dopamine agonists, and we suggest treatment with a dopamine agonist or oral contraceptives for patients with microadenomas who have amenorrhea. We suggest that with careful clinical and biochemical follow-up, therapy may be tapered and perhaps discontinued after at least 2 yr in patients who no longer have elevated serum prolactin and have no visible tumor remnant on MRI.

### Risperidone (Risperdal) [^1146WaXC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Hyperprolactinemia

As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2receptors, RISPERDAL elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. RISPERDAL is associated with higher levels of prolactin elevation than other antipsychotic agents.

Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.

Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. An increase in pituitary gland, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in the risperidone carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Published epidemiologic studies have shown inconsistent results when exploring the potential association between hyperprolactinemia and breast cancer.

### Metoclopramide hydrochloride (metoclopramide) [^114PnbNj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

A 77-week study was conducted in rats with oral doses up to about 40 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Metoclopramide elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of metoclopramide is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating drugs, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of prolactin-stimulating neuroleptic drugs and metoclopramide. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive at this time. in vitro

An Ames mutagenicity test performed on metoclopramide was negative.

Pregnancy Category B

Reproduction studies performed in rats, mice, and rabbits by the I.V. I.M. S.C. and oral routes at maximum levels ranging from 12 to 250 times the human dose have demonstrated no impairment of fertility or significant harm to the fetus due to metoclopramide. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Nursing Mothers

Metoclopramide is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when metoclopramide is administered to a nursing mother.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established (see). OVERDOSAGE

Care should be exercised in administering metoclopramide to neonates since prolonged clearance may produce excessive serum concentrations (see). In addition, neonates have reduced levels of NADH-cytochrome b reductase, which, in combination with the aforementioned pharmacokinetic factors, make neonates more susceptible to methemoglobinemia (see). CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY — Pharmacokinetics 5 OVERDOSAGE

The safety profile of metoclopramide in adults cannot be extrapolated to pediatric patients. Dystonias and other extrapyramidal reactions associated with metoclopramide are more common in the pediatric population than in adults. (See and .) WARNINGS ADVERSE REACTIONS — Extrapyramidal Reactions

### Metoclopramide [^116he7XN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Metoclopramide stimulates motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract without stimulating gastric, biliary, or pancreatic secretions. Its mode of action is unclear. It seems to sensitize tissues to the action of acetylcholine. The effect of metoclopramide on motility is not dependent on intact vagal innervation, but it can be abolished by anticholinergic drugs.

Metoclopramide increases the tone and amplitude of gastric (especially antral) contractions, relaxes the pyloric sphincter and the duodenal bulb, and increases peristalsis of the duodenum and jejunum resulting in accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit. It increases the resting tone of the lower esophageal sphincter. It has little, if any, effect on the motility of the colon or gallbladder.

In patients with gastroesophageal reflux and low LESP (lower esophageal sphincter pressure), single oral doses of metoclopramide produce dose-related increases in LESP. Effects begin at about 5 mg and increase through 20 mg (the largest dose tested). The increase in LESP from a 5 mg dose lasts about 45 minutes and that of 20 mg lasts between 2 and 3 hours. Increased rate of stomach emptying has been observed with single oral doses of 10 mg.

The antiemetic properties of metoclopramide appear to be a result of its antagonism of central and peripheral dopamine receptors. Dopamine produces nausea and vomiting by stimulation of the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), and metoclopramide blocks stimulation of the CTZ by agents like l-dopa or apomorphine which are known to increase dopamine levels or to possess dopamine-like effects. Metoclopramide also abolishes the slowing of gastric emptying caused by apomorphine.

Like the phenothiazines and related drugs, which are also dopamine antagonists, metoclopramide produces sedation and may produce extrapyramidal reactions, although these are comparatively rare (see WARNINGS). Metoclopramide inhibits the central and peripheral effects of apomorphine, induces release of prolactin and causes a transient increase in circulating aldosterone levels, which may be associated with transient fluid retention.

The onset of pharmacological action of metoclopramide is 1 to 3 minutes following an intravenous dose, 10 to 15 minutes following intramuscular administration, and 30 to 60 minutes following an oral dose, pharmacological effects persist for 1 to 2 hours.

### Lurasidone hydrochloride [^1171a63T]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Hyperprolactinemia

As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2receptors, lurasidone hydrochloride elevates prolactin levels.

Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia, when associated with hypogonadism, may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male patients [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, an increase in mammary gland neoplasia was observed in a carcinogenicity study conducted with lurasidone in rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13)]. Published epidemiologic studies have shown inconsistent results when exploring the potential association between hyperprolactinemia and breast cancer.

Schizophrenia

Adults:

In short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies, the median change from baseline to endpoint in prolactin levels for lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients was +0.4 ng/mL and was -1.9 ng/mL in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline to endpoint for males was +0.5 ng/mL and for females was -0.2 ng/mL. Median changes for prolactin by dose are shown in Table 14.

### Paliperidone [^116uhq9P]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Hyperprolactinemia

Like other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, paliperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Paliperidone has a prolactin-elevating effect similar to that seen with risperidone, a drug that is associated with higher levels of prolactin than other antipsychotic drugs.

Hyperprolactinemia, regardless of etiology, may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.

Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. An increase in the incidence of pituitary gland, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in the risperidone carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive.

### Metoclopramide hydrochloride (Gimoti) [^113oojGe]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of metoclopramide hydrochloride IN (also known as Reglan, Gimoti):

- **Cognitive difficulties, motor impairment**: use extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.
- **Depression, suicidal ideation**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as metoclopramide has been associated with depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide in patients with or without a history of depression. Avoid metoclopramide in patients with a history of depression.
- **Fluid retention**: use caution in patients with congestive HF or cirrhosis, as metoclopramide causes a transient increase in plasma aldosterone.
- **Hypertension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as metoclopramide may elevate BP. Avoid metoclopramide in patients with hypertension or in patients taking MAOIs.
- **Increased serum prolactin**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as metoclopramide elevates prolactin levels, which can cause galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence.
- **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as metoclopramide may cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome when overdosed or given with another drug associated with the condition. Avoid metoclopramide in patients receiving other drugs associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, including typical and atypical antipsychotics.
- **Parkinsonism**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as metoclopramide may cause other extrapyramidal symptoms, in addition to tardive dyskinesia, including parkinsonism and motor restlessness.

### Domperidone to increase breast milk supply in mothers of… [^112QhXSv]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Background: Breast milk is considered optimal nutrition for all infants, even in the neonatal intensive care unit. Increasingly, mothers of preterm infants are encouraged to express breast milk for their newborns. However, providing an adequate milk supply for preterm infants can be difficult, and medications such as domperidone and metoclopramide are often used to increase the milk supply. Domperidone augments lactation by increasing prolactin concentration. The galactagogue dosage of 10 to 20 mg three times per day is less than the maximum approved oral dosage, and is generally well tolerated. Domperidone does not cross the blood-brain barrier and is excreted only minimally into breast milk. Metoclopramide has been known to decrease protein concentration and change the electrolyte composition of breast milk; however, the effect of domperidone on breast milk composition had not been studied previously.

Campbell-Yeo and colleagues conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of domperidone on the composition of preterm breast milk. Women were excluded if they were already taking domperidone or any medication known to alter or interact with it; or if they had mastitis, chronic illness, previous breast surgery, or known lactose intolerance. The primary outcome was the change in breast milk protein concentration, with secondary outcomes of changes within patients of fat, carbohydrate, lactose, energy, calcium, phosphate, and sodium concentration; daily breast milk volume; prolactin levels; and breastfeeding rates two weeks after study completion and at infant's discharge. Results: The study was powered to detect a change of 20 percent or more in protein content in the domperidone group compared with the placebo group.

Of the 278 mothers who delivered before 31 weeks' gestation, 46 provided informed consent and were randomized to participate. The mean within-patient breast milk volume increased by 267 percent in the domperidone group and by 19 percent in the placebo group. Protein and fat concentration did not change significantly, although the carbohydrate concentration increased 2. 7 percent in the domperidone group and decreased
2. 7 percent in the placebo group. No adverse events were reported in mothers or infants. Conclusion: The authors conclude that domperidone notably increases breast milk volume without substantial changes to breast milk composition.

### FDA warns against women using unapproved drug, domperidone… [^116SGWYm]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

June 7, 2004 In response to reports that women may be using an unapproved drug, domperidone, to increase milk production, the Food and Drug Administration is warning breastfeeding women not to use this product because of safety concerns. Today, FDA also issued six letters to pharmacies that compound products containing domperidone and firms that supply domperidone for use in compounding. The Agency also is issuing an Import Alert which alerts FDA field personnel to be on the lookout for attempts to import this drug so that it can be detained and refused admission into the U. S. if appropriate. FDA took these actions because it has become aware that some women who breastfeed and/or pump breast milk are purchasing this drug, domperidone, from compounding pharmacies and from sources in foreign countries to increase breast milk production. Domperidone may increase the secretion of prolactin, a hormone that is needed for lactation.

Although domperidone is approved in several countries outside the U. S. to treat certain gastric disorders, it is not approved in any country, including the U. S., for enhancing breast milk production in lactating women and is also not approved in the U. S. for any indication. The agency is concerned with the potential public health risks associated with domperidone. There have been several published reports and case studies of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death in patients receiving an intravenous form of domperidone that has been withdrawn from marketing in a number of countries. In several countries where the oral form of domperidone continues to be marketed, labels for the product contain specific warnings against use of domperidone by breastfeeding women and note that the drug is excreted in breast milk that could expose a breastfeeding infant to unknown risks.

Because of the possibility of serious adverse effects, FDA recommends that breastfeeding women not use domperidone to increase milk production. The FDA recognizes the immense health benefits that breast milk provides for a nursing infant and is taking these actions today not to discourage women from breastfeeding but rather to warn them not to use this particular drug while they are breastfeeding.
