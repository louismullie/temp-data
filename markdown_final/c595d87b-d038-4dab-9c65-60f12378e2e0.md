## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about risperidone's efficacy, safety, dosing, special populations, and practical prescribing considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic identity and labeled indications. Then, I should verify efficacy data across conditions and formulations. Next, I will examine safety and boxed warnings. After that, I need to review dosing strategies and pharmacokinetic interactions. Then, I should consider special populations and off-label uses. Finally, I will synthesize practical prescribing guidance and monitoring, and close with a balanced conclusion that acknowledges uncertainties and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic identity and labeled indications so I don't miss anything foundational. Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic with potent D2 and 5-HT2A antagonism, and its active metabolite is paliperidone, which is also marketed as a separate agent with overlapping properties, so I need to keep that metabolic link in mind when interpreting class effects and dose-response data [^114nxGjk]. The FDA-labeled indications include schizophrenia in adults and adolescents, acute manic or mixed episodes in bipolar I disorder in adults and adolescents, and irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents, which anchors the core use-cases I will evaluate next [^113iqRsq] [^116URzj7] [^111hXVYu] [^115djorr].

> Now, I should review efficacy in schizophrenia, starting with oral risperidone versus placebo. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and certainty of benefit. Individual participant data meta-analyses show a modest but statistically significant reduction in PANSS total scores versus placebo, with a mean difference around −5 to −6 points over about 9 weeks, which aligns with earlier Cochrane findings of improved global improvement and fewer patients leaving studies early, albeit with low to very low certainty in some analyses due to risk of bias and industry sponsorship [^114QgJ2Z] [^113ogu2F] [^117UTdUg]. I should also confirm dose-response; multiple sources converge on 4–6 mg/day as an optimal range balancing efficacy and extrapyramidal symptoms, with higher doses not clearly improving outcomes and increasing adverse effects, which supports a conservative titration approach in routine practice [^115hrA5n] [^114on1UK].

> Next, I will examine long-acting injectable risperidone for schizophrenia, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about superiority over oral therapy. High-quality randomized data show that LAI risperidone reduces relapse versus placebo and is effective acutely, yet in unstable patients it was not superior to clinician's choice of oral antipsychotics for hospitalization or global outcomes and caused more injection-site and EPS adverse effects, so benefits may be more about adherence facilitation than superior efficacy per se [^113CHif8] [^1145vPWj] [^111dC77T]. I should double-check dosing guidance; VA/DoD provides practical oral-to-LAI mappings and recommends at least 21 days of oral overlap after the first injection, which operationalizes initiation in real-world care [^112uCpFW] [^113wMMpe].

> I will now examine bipolar disorder, and I need to ensure I separate acute mania from maintenance. For acute mania, short-term placebo-controlled trials demonstrate efficacy across 1–6 mg/day in adults and 0.5–2.5 mg/day in pediatrics, with no additional benefit above 2.5–6 mg/day depending on age, which argues against dose escalation beyond these ranges in acute episodes [^113Mk4Fy] [^117C6bJj] [^111hXVYu]. For maintenance, evidence is mixed; a post hoc analysis suggested benefit of continued risperidone adjunct to mood stabilizer for about 24 weeks but not beyond, and guidelines suggest lithium or quetiapine as preferred maintenance agents, with risperidone LAI as a conditional alternative, so I should be cautious about extrapolating long-term benefits [^112FQUh2] [^1142TCGJ].

> Let me consider autism-related irritability next, and I should confirm pediatric dosing ranges. Controlled trials show efficacy for irritability in ASD with weight-based dosing, typically 0.125–1.75 mg/day depending on body weight, and a maintenance study demonstrated longer time to symptom recurrence with continued risperidone versus placebo, supporting continuation in responders while monitoring growth and metabolic parameters [^115djorr] [^111ATdZK]. Hold on, I should verify that the maintenance signal is not overgeneralized; the trial was specific to disruptive behavior disorders in youth with ASD, so external validity to broader pediatric populations is limited [^notfound].

> Turning to dementia-related behavioral symptoms, I need to check both efficacy and regulatory risk. Trials and meta-analyses indicate modest reductions in aggression and psychosis with risperidone at low doses, but there is a boxed warning for increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, and dose-related parkinsonism and sedation are notable, so any use should be time-limited, at the lowest effective dose, with periodic attempts to taper and close monitoring for cerebrovascular events and falls [^111BHrf8] [^111yPKvn] [^113QKVfc] [^113Hodni]. But wait, what if early response predicts durability? An individual participant data analysis suggested early improvement by week 2 predicts later response, which could guide timely reassessment and discontinuation planning in this high-risk group [^115TqoQp].

> I should review off-label uses briefly and be careful not to overstate. Small studies suggest risperidone augmentation may help refractory OCD after SRI nonresponse, and open-label data hint at utility in refractory anxiety disorders, but these signals require replication and should be reserved for carefully selected cases with explicit informed consent regarding limited evidence and metabolic risks [^112K6EyG] [^1174BPDN]. For rapid tranquillization in psychosis-induced aggression, evidence is very limited and low quality, so haloperidol or benzodiazepines remain standard while risperidone may be considered in select contexts, acknowledging uncertainty [^117G6yux].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerability comprehensively, and I need to ensure I separate class effects from risperidone-specific liabilities. Extrapyramidal symptoms occur more often than with some other SGAs and often necessitate anticholinergic medication, with meta-analytic data showing higher antiparkinsonian use versus clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone, reinforcing the need for cautious dosing and proactive monitoring [^111WwvP7]. Hyperprolactinemia is common and clinically meaningful, contributing to sexual dysfunction and reproductive effects, and is more pronounced than with several comparators, which should be discussed upfront and monitored during therapy [^114QgJ2Z] [^114jsdet]. Metabolic effects include weight gain and dyslipidemia, with observational data suggesting less weight gain than olanzapine but more than some alternatives, and rare but serious risks include NMS, tardive dyskinesia, orthostatic hypotension, seizures, and QT prolongation, all of which mandate counseling and vigilance [^116ApPPm] [^114jsdet] [^115hVBTZ].

> I should confirm boxed warnings and special risk populations so I don't omit critical cautions. Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis have an increased mortality risk with antipsychotics including risperidone, so use should be avoided or strictly time-limited with documented risk–benefit discussions and attempts to taper, and aspiration pneumonia risk warrants extra caution in advanced Alzheimer's or dysphagia [^113Hodni] [^114jsdet]. In hepatic impairment, dose adjustments are required, and in renal impairment, lower starting doses and slower titration are prudent, which I need to remember when initiating therapy in medically comorbid patients [^112ssypD] [^114jsdet].

> Now, dosing strategy and pharmacokinetic interactions require careful verification. For adults with schizophrenia, a typical start is 2 mg/day with titration by 1–2 mg to 4–8 mg/day, balancing efficacy and EPS, and for adolescents 0.5 mg/day titrated to 1–6 mg/day, with pediatric bipolar mania typically 0.5–2.5 mg/day, not exceeding 2.5–6 mg/day depending on age and indication, which aligns with trial data and labeling [^114h3Akj] [^116qJVxv] [^117C6bJj]. For LAI, practical mappings of 1–3 mg oral ≈ 25 mg q2weeks, 4–5 mg ≈ 37.5 mg, and ≥ 6 mg ≈ 50 mg are recommended, with 21-day oral overlap and consideration of 12.5 mg if tolerability is a concern, which I should standardize in orders to prevent early relapse [^112uCpFW] [^113wMMpe]. CYP2D6 inhibitors like fluoxetine or paroxetine increase risperidone exposure and may necessitate dose reduction, whereas enzyme inducers like carbamazepine decrease exposure and may require dose increases up to double, so I need to check concomitant medications at each visit [^1143ptKW].

> Special populations deserve explicit attention, and I should double-check pregnancy and pediatric growth considerations. Risperidone is category C in pregnancy; use only if benefits outweigh risks, with neonatal monitoring for EPS or withdrawal if exposure occurs late in gestation, and hyperprolactinemia may impair fertility, which should be discussed in reproductive-age patients [^113J56Ge] [^115yJozh] [^111jGEdm]. In pediatrics, monitor height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, glucose, and lipids at baseline and periodically, and in hepatic impairment start low and go slow, not exceeding 1.5 mg twice daily without careful titration, to mitigate adverse effects [^114jsdet] [^112ssypD].

> Practical prescribing guidance should integrate adherence, monitoring, and switching strategies, and I need to ensure I cover these operationally. For patients with adherence challenges, LAI risperidone can be reasonable, but I should set expectations about injection-site reactions and EPS and ensure adequate oral overlap, while recognizing that LAI did not outperform oral therapy in unstable schizophrenia cohorts for hospitalization outcomes, so selection should be individualized [^113CHif8] [^112uCpFW]. Early nonresponse at 2 weeks predicts poor 12-week outcomes, so if there is less than 20% improvement by week 2, consider switching antipsychotic rather than simply escalating dose, which avoids futile dose increases and delays in effective care [^116BxjS4]. I should also counsel on NMS, TD, metabolic risks, orthostasis, and priapism, and provide written action plans for emergencies and routine labs for glucose and lipids, reinforcing shared decision-making and periodic dose minimization attempts when clinically safe [^115hVBTZ] [^114jsdet].

> Finally, I should synthesize the overall risk–benefit profile and acknowledge evidence limitations. Risperidone offers modest efficacy benefits versus placebo and broadly similar efficacy to several SGAs, with a trade-off of higher EPS and prolactin effects but less weight gain than olanzapine, and its low cost and generic availability can be advantageous in systems-level care, though this should not overshadow individualized safety profiling and monitoring plans [^114QgJ2Z] [^112Lk9nj] [^114JNpTS]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating certainty; much of the comparative literature is industry-sponsored and heterogeneous, so shared decision-making, careful dose selection, and vigilant monitoring remain essential to optimize outcomes and minimize harm [^113avEts] [^113ogu2F].

Risperidone is a **second-generation antipsychotic** indicated for schizophrenia, bipolar mania, and irritability in autism [^113iqRsq]. It is also used off-label for dementia-related agitation and psychosis, and for treatment-resistant depression and OCD. Typical dosing is 2–8 mg/day for adults with schizophrenia, 1–6 mg/day for bipolar mania, and 0.5–3 mg/day for autism-related irritability, with lower doses for elderly or hepatic impairment [^111Ywh4s] [^117C6bJj] [^113iQuuw] [^112ssypD]. Common adverse effects include extrapyramidal symptoms, hyperprolactinemia, weight gain, and metabolic changes; rare risks include tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and QT prolongation [^114jsdet]. Long-acting injectables improve adherence but have similar efficacy to oral forms; monitor for EPS, metabolic effects, and prolactin-related issues [^114ogQkX] [^113CHif8].

---

## Pharmacological profile

Risperidone is a **second-generation antipsychotic** with potent antagonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, which underlies its antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing effects. It also blocks alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors, contributing to sedation and orthostatic hypotension [^notfound].

---

## Clinical indications

Risperidone is **FDA-approved** for the following indications:

| **Indication** | **Age group** | **Clinical context** |
|-|-|-|
| Schizophrenia | Adults and adolescents (≥ 13 years) | Treatment of acute and maintenance phases [^113iqRsq] |
| Bipolar I disorder | Adults and adolescents (≥ 10 years) | Acute manic or mixed episodes [^113Mk4Fy] |
| Irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder | Children and adolescents (5–17 years) | Severe tantrums, aggression, and self-injury [^115djorr] |

---

Off-label uses include **dementia-related agitation and psychosis**, treatment-resistant depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

---

## Dosage and administration

### Schizophrenia

- **Initial dose**: 2 mg/day orally, titrate by 1–2 mg/day every 24 hours to 4–8 mg/day [^111Ywh4s].
- **Adolescents**: Start 0.5 mg/day, titrate to 1–6 mg/day [^116qJVxv].
- **Long-acting injection**: 25–50 mg IM every 2 weeks; oral overlap for 3 weeks [^112uCpFW].

---

### Bipolar mania

- **Initial dose**: 2–3 mg/day, titrate by 1 mg/day to 1–6 mg/day [^117C6bJj].
- **Pediatrics**: Start 0.5 mg/day, titrate to 1–2.5 mg/day [^117C6bJj].

---

### Autism-related irritability

Start at **0.5 mg/day** and titrate to **1–2.5 mg/day** based on weight and response [^notfound].

---

## Efficacy

Risperidone is effective for **positive symptoms** in schizophrenia and for **acute mania** in bipolar disorder, with modest benefits for negative symptoms. Long-acting injectables improve adherence but have similar efficacy to oral formulations [^114ogQkX] [^113CHif8].

---

## Safety and tolerability

### Common adverse effects

- **Extrapyramidal symptoms**: Parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia [^114QgJ2Z].
- **Hyperprolactinemia**: Galactorrhea, gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities [^114jsdet].
- **Metabolic effects**: Weight gain, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia [^114jsdet].
- **Sedation**: Dose-related, especially early in treatment [^113QKVfc].

---

### Serious adverse effects

- **Tardive dyskinesia**: Risk increases with prolonged use [^notfound].
- **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome**: Rare but potentially fatal [^115hVBTZ].
- **QT prolongation**: Use caution with other QT-prolonging drugs [^notfound].
- **Increased mortality**: Elderly with dementia-related psychosis [^113Hodni].

---

## Drug interactions

- **CYP2D6 inhibitors**: Fluoxetine, paroxetine increase risperidone levels; reduce dose [^1143ptKW].
- **CYP3A4 inducers**: Carbamazepine decreases levels; may need higher dose [^1143ptKW].
- **CNS depressants**: Additive sedation and respiratory depression [^notfound].

---

## Special populations

Elderly patients require **lower initial doses** with slower titration due to increased sensitivity and a higher risk of mortality in dementia-related psychosis [^113iQuuw] [^113Hodni]. In hepatic impairment, start at 0.5 mg twice daily and titrate cautiously [^112ssypD]. In renal impairment, reduce the dose and titrate slowly [^notfound]. In pregnancy, use only if benefits outweigh risks; monitor neonates for EPS and withdrawal [^111jGEdm].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

First-line for schizophrenia and bipolar mania, with **individualized selection** based on patient characteristics and comorbidities. For dementia-related psychosis, use only if benefits outweigh risks and monitor closely for adverse effects [^111yPKvn].

---

Risperidone is a **versatile atypical antipsychotic** with broad efficacy across psychiatric indications, but its use requires careful dose titration, monitoring for metabolic and prolactin-related adverse effects, and attention to drug interactions and special populations.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of risperidone maintenance treatment in children and adolescents with disruptive behavior disorders [^111ATdZK]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors compared the effects of maintenance versus withdrawal of risperidone treatment in children and adolescents with symptoms of disruptive behavior disorder.

Method

Patients with disruptive behavior disorder (5–17 years of age and a range of intellect) who had responded to risperidone treatment over 12 weeks were randomly assigned to 6 months of double-blind treatment with either risperidone or placebo. The primary efficacy measure was time to symptom recurrence, defined as sustained deterioration on either the Clinical Global Impression severity rating (/2 points) or the conduct problem subscale of the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (/7 points). Secondary efficacy measures included rates of discontinuation due to symptom recurrence, disruptive behavior disorder symptoms, and general function. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Risperidone dosage was based on weight (patients < 50 kg: 0.25–0.75 mg/day; patients /50 kg: 0.5–1.5 mg/day).

Results

Treatment was initiated in 527 patients, with 335 randomly assigned to a double-blind maintenance condition. Time to symptom recurrence was significantly longer in patients who continued risperidone treatment than in those switched to placebo. Symptom recurrence in 25% of patients occurred after 119 days with risperidone and 37 days with placebo. Secondary efficacy measures also favored risperidone over placebo. Weight increased over the initial 12 weeks of treatment (mean weight z score change = 0.2, SD = 2.7, N = 511), after which it plateaued.

Conclusions

This study is the first placebo-controlled maintenance versus withdrawal trial of its kind in disruptive behavior disorder and provides evidence that patients who respond to initial treatment with risperidone would benefit from continuous treatment over the longer term.

### Antipsychotic dose reduction compared to dose continuation for people with schizophrenia [^117WMmjj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia, yet they are associated with diverse and potentially dose‐related side effects which can reduce quality of life. For this reason, the lowest possible doses of antipsychotics are generally recommended, but higher doses are often used in clinical practice. It is still unclear if and how antipsychotic doses could be reduced safely in order to minimise the adverse‐effect burden without increasing the risk of relapse.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of reducing antipsychotic dose compared to continuing the current dose for people with schizophrenia.

Search methods

We conducted a systematic search on 10 February 2021 at the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials, which is based on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN, and WHO ICTRP. We also inspected the reference lists of included studies and previous reviews.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any dose reduction against continuation in people with schizophrenia or related disorders who were stabilised on their current antipsychotic treatment.

Data collection and analysis

At least two review authors independently screened relevant records for inclusion, extracted data from eligible studies, and assessed the risk of bias using RoB 2. We contacted study authors for missing data and additional information. Our primary outcomes were clinically important change in quality of life, rehospitalisations and dropouts due to adverse effects; key secondary outcomes were clinically important change in functioning, relapse, dropouts for any reason, and at least one adverse effect. We also examined scales measuring symptoms, quality of life, and functioning as well as a comprehensive list of specific adverse effects. We pooled outcomes at the endpoint preferably closest to one year. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main results

We included 25 RCTs, of which 22 studies provided data with 2635 participants (average age 38.4 years old). The median study sample size was 60 participants (ranging from 18 to 466 participants) and length was 37 weeks (ranging from 12 weeks to 2 years). There were variations in the dose reduction strategies in terms of speed of reduction (i.e.g.radual in about half of the studies (within 2 to 16 weeks) and abrupt in the other half), and in terms of degree of reduction (i.e. median planned reduction of 66% of the dose up to complete withdrawal in three studies). We assessed risk of bias across outcomes predominantly as some concerns or high risk.

No study reported data on the number of participants with a clinically important change in quality of life or functioning, and only eight studies reported continuous data on scales measuring quality of life or functioning. There was no difference between dose reduction and continuation on scales measuring quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.17 to 0.15, 6 RCTs, n = 719, I² = 0%, moderate certainty evidence) and scales measuring functioning (SMD 0.03, 95% CI −0.10 to 0.17, 6 RCTs, n = 966, I² = 0%, high certainty evidence).

Dose reduction in comparison to continuation may increase the risk of rehospitalisation based on data from eight studies with estimable effect sizes; however, the 95% CI does not exclude the possibility of no difference (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.81, 8 RCTs, n = 1413, I² = 59% (moderate heterogeneity), very low certainty evidence). Similarly, dose reduction increased the risk of relapse based on data from 20 studies (RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.06, 20 RCTs, n = 2481, I² = 70% (substantial heterogeneity), low certainty evidence).

More participants in the dose reduction group in comparison to the continuation group left the study early due to adverse effects (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.49, 6 RCTs with estimable effect sizes, n = 1079, I² = 0%, moderate certainty evidence) and for any reason (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.81, 12 RCTs, n = 1551, I² = 48% (moderate heterogeneity), moderate certainty evidence).

Lastly, there was no difference between the dose reduction and continuation groups in the number of participants with at least one adverse effect based on data from four studies with estimable effect sizes (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.12, 5 RCTs, n = 998 (4 RCTs, n = 980 with estimable effect sizes), I² = 0%, moderate certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

This review synthesised the latest evidence on the reduction of antipsychotic doses for stable individuals with schizophrenia. There was no difference between dose reduction and continuation groups in quality of life, functioning, and number of participants with at least one adverse effect. However, there was a higher risk for relapse and dropouts, and potentially for rehospitalisations, with dose reduction. Of note, the majority of the trials focused on relapse prevention rather potential beneficial outcomes on quality of life, functioning, and adverse effects, and in some studies there was rapid and substantial reduction of doses. Further well‐designed RCTs are therefore needed to provide more definitive answers.

### New generation antipsychotics for first episode schizophrenia [^115ZFHtF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The new generation antipsychotics are associated with a lower risk of adverse effects compared with drugs such as haloperidol. Many treatment guidelines recommend the use of new generation ('atypical') antipsychotic drugs for people with a first episode of schizophrenia.

Objectives

To examine the effects of the new generation antipsychotics for people with a first episode of schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Search Strategy

The reviewers searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register (March 2002) and the included and excluded studies tables of relevant Cochrane reviews, references of all relevant studies, contacted industry and authors of relevant studies to identify further trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing new generation antipsychotics (amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sulpiride, ziprasidone, zotepine) with conventional antipsychotics for people with a first episode of schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Data Collection and Analysis

Citations and, where possible, abstracts were independently inspected by three reviewers, papers ordered, re-inspected and quality assessed. We independently extracted data but excluded them if loss to follow up was greater than 50%. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated the relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence interval (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, reviewers calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).

Main Results

We include two short-term studies (total n = 266), one of which was a report of a sub-group of a larger study. One compared risperidone with an average of 6 mg/day haloperidol and the other olanzapine with an average of 11 mg/day haloperidol. Compared with olanzapine, significantly more people receiving haloperidol left the study early (n = 83, 1 RCT, RR 0.43 CI 0.3 to 0.7, NNH 3 CI 2 to 8). This was not so for the risperidone versus haloperidol comparison (n = 183, 1 RCT, RR = 0.7 CI 0.4 to 1.1). In terms of global effects, studies reported no differences between risperidone and haloperidol (n = 183, RR not much improved 1.0 CI 0.6 to 1.5), and olanzapine and the same control (n = 83, RR needing at least one dose of benzodiazepine 0.8 CI 0.5 to 1.1). More people allocated to olanzapine had clinically significant improvement in mental state compared with those given haloperidol (n = 83, RR no 'clinically significant improvement' 0.45 CI 0.3 to 0.7, NNH 3 CI 2 to 6). In the risperidone study, however, no such difference was apparent (n = 183, RR 'no clinically significant improvement in mental state' 0.85 CI 0.6 to 1.2). Significantly more people given haloperidol (4–16mg) experienced at least one adverse event when compared with risperidone (4–16mg) (n = 183, RR 0.9 CI 0.8 to 0.98, NNH 8 CI 4 to 50). Use of anticholinergic medication for extrapyramidal adverse events was less prevalent for people allocated either olanzapine (n = 83, RR 0.3 CI 0.2 to 0.7, NNH 4 CI 2 to 14) or risperidone (n = 183, RR 0.7 CI 0.5 to 0.9, NNH 4 CI 3 to 9) compared with those given haloperidol. There are no data at all on outcomes such as compliance, cost, social and cognitive functioning, relapse, rehospitalisation, or quality of life. There are no medium to long-term data. Eight ongoing studies may provide more information.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The results of this review are inconclusive. Whether the use of new generation antipsychotics really makes the treatment less off putting and enhances long-term compliance is unclear. Pragmatic, well-designed and reported long-term trials would be useful to answer this question.

### Risperidone (Risperdal) [^114h3Akj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The dosage of risperidone PO for treatment of schizophrenia in adults is:

- Start at: 2 mg PO daily
- Maintenance: 4–16 mg PO daily

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^112K6EyG]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Risperidone augmentation after SRI resistance — primary randomized trial results indicate that 36 patients were assigned to 6 weeks of adjunctive risperidone (n = 20) or placebo (n = 16) after SRI nonresponse; risperidone started at 1 mg/day with weekly 1 mg increases to a mean final 2.2 mg/day (SD = 0.7 mg/day; range 1–4), and among completers (risperidone n = 18; placebo n = 15) the Y-BOCS reduction was 32% versus 9%, with 9 of 18 (50%) risperidone completers responders versus none of 15 on placebo; risperidone was generally well tolerated with mild/transient sedation most prominent and one dropout due to intolerable insomnia.

### Treatment modifiers and predictors of risperidone response in dementia: an individual participant data meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials [^115TqoQp]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Risperidone demonstrates modest effectiveness for treating psychosis, aggression, and anxiety in people with dementia, while showing limited impact on other symptoms. Treatment response may vary depending on individual pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic‐related factors. Early improvement by week 2 appears to be a strong indicator of continued response at weeks 4 and 8. Future research should focus on developing tools to better balance the risks and benefits of antipsychotic use, ultimately supporting more personalized and effective treatment decisions.

### Bilateral chorea following severe traumatic brain injury treated with risperidone [^113KCE7T]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A functionally independent man in his 20s with a history of intellectual disability and epilepsy and family history of Huntington's disease suffered a severe traumatic brain injury. Postinjury, bilateral chorea rendered him dependent for all activities of daily living. Risperidone provided a significant reduction of chorea, decreasing the overall burden of care. Movement disorders are a common sequela of brain injury. Currently, there are no best treatment guidelines for chorea in patients with brain injury. To the authors' knowledge there have been no case reports describing the effects of brain injury on patients with a primary movement disorder. Risperidone was an effective treatment in this case. Further research is needed to establish guidelines for treatment of movement disorders following brain injury and to better understand the effect of brain injuries on primary movement disorders.

### Long-acting injectable risperidone: efficacy and safety of the first long-acting atypical antipsychotic [^112b2175]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors assessed the efficacy and safety of the first long-acting atypical antipsychotic (long-acting injectable risperidone) in patients with schizophrenia.

Method

In a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study, patients received intramuscular injections every 2 weeks of placebo or long-acting risperidone (25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg). The primary measure of efficacy was the change in total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.

Results

Of the 554 patients who were enrolled, 400 entered the double-blind study, and 370 received at least one postbaseline assessment. Mean changes in score of -6.2, -8.5, and -7.4 on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale were seen at endpoint for the 25-, 50-, and 75-mg risperidone groups, respectively; all three change scores were significantly different from that seen with placebo (+2.6). Improvements in positive and negative symptoms were also significantly greater in patients receiving risperidone. Long-acting risperidone was well tolerated. Adverse events related to extrapyramidal symptoms were spontaneously reported by 13% of patients receiving placebo and 10% of patients in the 25-mg risperidone group, with higher rates in the 50-mg and 75-mg groups. Severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was mild at baseline and throughout the trial in each treatment group. Mean weight changes were small in the 25-, 50-, and 75-mg risperidone groups (0.5 kg, 1.2 kg, and 1.9 kg, respectively). Injection site pain was rated as low by the patients, consistent with the investigators' pain ratings.

Conclusions

Long-acting injectable risperidone was efficacious and well tolerated and provides both clinicians and patients with a new mode of treatment that can improve the outcome of long-term therapy.

### Efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological interventions for schizophrenia non-responsive to prior treatment: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1176Ng6E]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

As for specific adverse effects, clozapine use necessitated less anti-Parkinson medication use than risperidone, fluphenazine, haloperidol, and zotepine (ORs from 0.03 to 0.31). It however caused more sedation than amisulpride, ziprasidone, sertindole, quetiapine, olanzapine, haloperidol, risperidone, and chlorpromazine (ORs from 1.72 to 6.67); more weight gain than ziprasidone, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, aripiprazole plus clozapine, quetiapine, and risperidone (SMDs from 0.32 to 0.78); higher prolactin levels than aripiprazole plus clozapine, and ziprasidone plus clozapine (SMDs 0.96 and 3.37 respectively) and lower compared to haloperidol, amisulpride plus clozapine, zotepine, olanzapine plus risperidone, risperidone, risperidone plus clozapine, and sulpiride plus clozapine (SMDs from −0.69 to −3.15). Lastly, clozapine caused more QTc prolongation than risperidone plus clozapine (SMD 1.31)(Appendixes 10.10–10.14).

No difference was shown between other treatments and clozapine for quality of life and functioning (Appendixes 10.15 and 10.16).

46 studies (30.67%) were judged as having an overall low risk of bias, while 75 studies (50%) were judged as having an overall moderate risk of bias and 29 (19.33%) having an overall high risk of bias. The risk of bias summary plot and assessment per individual study are presented in the Appendix 7. Heterogeneity was low to moderate for most outcomes, moderate to high for change in overall symptoms, and high for negative symptoms, functioning and QTc prolongation. Heterogeneity and inconsistency assessments are presented in the Appendix 13. Judgements about confidence in most estimates (CINeMA) for the primary outcome ranged from very low to moderate (Appendix 14).

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of long-acting risperidone in cocaine-dependent men [^115TuKbB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

There is no approved pharmaco-therapy for cocaine dependence. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic drug with combined dopamine-2/serotonin-2 (D(2)/5-HT(2)) antagonist activity that has been effective in reducing cocaine use in some animal studies. We tested the efficacy of a long-acting, injectable preparation of risperidone on cocaine use in active cocaine users.

Method

Thirty-one cocaine-dependent men who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for current cocaine dependence entered a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intramuscular risperidone, 25 mg every other week. The primary outcome measure was cocaine use as measured by urinary concentration of cocaine metabolites. Secondary outcomes were self-report of cocaine use and craving, depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and adverse events. Participants were recruited during a 12-month period from October 2005 to September 2006.

Results

Both groups reduced their cocaine use during the study. There were no between-group differences in the primary measure of cocaine use (urinary metabolites [F = 0.7, p = .41]) or on craving measures. Those assigned to risperi-done reported significantly worsened depressive symptoms (mean ± SD HAM-D change scores: +7.4 ± 8.8 vs. -2.3 ± 5.8, respectively, F = 7.5, p = .018) and gained significantly more weight (mean weight change: +6.3 ± 9.4 lb vs. -4.0 ± 8.9 lb, respectively, F = 4.65, p = .044) than those assigned to placebo.

Conclusion

Treatment with long-acting injectable risperidone in active cocaine users was not associated with reduction in cocaine use or craving and was associated with worsening of depressive symptoms and weight gain.

Trial Registration

### Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of risperidone for acute treatment of bipolar anxiety [^114Jixu1]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of bipolar disorder is often complicated by the presence of a co-occuring anxiety disorder. Although second generation antipsychotics are being used with increasing frequency in bipolar patients, their anxiolytic effects have not been well studied in this population.

Methods

The anxiolytic effect of risperidone 0.5–4 mg/day was tested in an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in 111 patients with bipolar disorder and a co-occuring panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The primary outcome measure was the Clinician Global Improvement-21 Anxiety scale (CGI-21 Anxiety). Secondary measures included the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and the Sheehan Panic Disorder Scale.

Results

On the last-observation-carried forward analysis of repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), risperidone was not more effective than placebo for the CGI-21 Anxiety score or the other anxiety outcome measures. Risperidone was well tolerated, with only two patients withdrawing because of adverse events.

Limitations

The risperidone treated group had more patients with mixed states and lifetime panic disorder at randomization than the placebo group. The study was limited to 8 weeks and to individuals with bipolar and comorbid panic disorder or GAD. The results may not be applicable to risperidone as an add-on treatment to mood stabilizers, or to bipolar disorder comorbid with anxiety disorders other than panic disorder or GAD.

Conclusions

Risperidone monotherapy was not an effective anxiolytic for bipolar patients with comorbid panic disorder or GAD in doses of 0.5–4 mg/day over 8 weeks of treatment. The efficacy of other second generation antipsychotics and mood stabilizers on anxiety in patients with bipolar disorder and a co-occuring anxiety disorder should be investigated in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.

### Benefits and harms of risperidone and paliperidone for treatment of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: a meta-analysis involving individual participant data and clinical study reports [^114guoEF]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis

In this comparison, pooled estimates for all outcomes of interest were compared across the three data sources (CSR, trial registry and journal publication) to assess for consistency. The pooled effects from each data source were then compared using the 'ratio of relative risks' or 'ratio of means' to observe for statistical differences. For the primary efficacy outcome (PANSS), IPD-MAs effect-sizes were included also in the ratio of mean comparisons. In total, sixty-one possible outcome-specific meta-analysis comparisons were made enabling comparisons of the pooled effects from the different data sources.

Aggregate data from CSRs, journal publication and registry reports were meta-analysed using DerSimonian-Laird random-effects. For continuous outcomes, standardised mean differences (SMD) were calculated using Hedges' g and interpreted according to Cohen's criteria. Hartung-Knapp confidence intervals were used to account for uncertainty in the variance estimate. For dichotomous outcomes (including AEs), effects were assessed by pooling the relative risk (RR). Effect estimates were pooled across trials using Mantel Haenszel fixed-effect or inverse-variance random-effects meta-analysis dependent upon the number of studies reporting the outcome of interest. A sensitivity analysis was also performed pooling the relative difference instead of RR for rare events. For studies reporting single or double zero events in one or both treatment group, we used the 'exact' fixed-effect meta-analysis method for pooling the effects. Safety narratives were also obtained from the listings data where possible.

### Optimal dosing with risperidone: updated recommendations [^113iQuuw]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Drug dosages utilized during controlled clinical trials are not always optimal for patients encountered in day-to-day practice. The original trials of risperidone, a novel antipsychotic, suggested that an initial target dose of 6 mg/day was appropriate, but these trials were necessarily conducted among patients who were chronically impaired, hospitalized, and often partly drug resistant.

Data Sources

Relevant data relating to the dosage of risperidone identified through an online (MEDLINE) search using the keywords risperidone, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder dementia, bipolar disorder, and dose were supplemented by a review of international and U.S. Congress abstracts in which the dose of risperidone was specifically described.

Conclusion

On the basis of naturalistic studies, clinical audit, phase 4 trials, positron emission tomography data, and 5 years of clinical experience, the currently recommended target dose of risperidone is 4 mg/day for most patients, with less-rapid titration than previously recommended. Moreover, a lower dose than this and slower titration may be appropriate for elderly patients, young patients, and first-episode patients.

### Safety and acceptability of clozapine and risperidone in progressive multiple sclerosis: a phase I, randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled trial [^111ZSGFy]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Clozapine and risperidone are atypical antipsychotic agents originally developed in 1959 and 1992, respectively, and are used to treat several neurological disorders, including schizophrenia. Both are potent antagonists of a wide range of neuroreceptors, including dopamine and serotonin receptors, and recent studies indicate that these agents have anti-inflammatory actions on microglia. Given the known role for neuroinflammation in schizophrenia, it is now believed that this class of agents may provide superior benefits during schizophrenia due to their immune-modulatory activity in the central nervous system (CNS).

Previous work has shown that clozapine and risperidone reduce disease severity and improve disease resolution in mouse models of multiple sclerosis (MS) including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model of immune-mediated demyelination that recapitulates aspects of relapsing-remitting MS, and cuprizone intoxication, a model of non-immune demyelination, which models aspects of progressive multiple sclerosis (pMS). Protection correlates with reduced CNS inflammation and enhanced functional recovery, and can be achieved at doses that do not promote weight gain, a dose-dependent side effect of both clozapine and risperidone. Together, this preclinical work suggests that clozapine and risperidone, which readily pass through an intact blood–brain barrier and reduce neuroinflammation in mice and humans, may be useful to treat the chronic neuroinflammation and demyelination associated with pMS in contrast to current disease-modifying treatments which target peripheral immune responses but not those restricted to the CNS compartment.

To this end, the Clozapine and Risperidone in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (CRISP) trial was designed to investigate the suitability of clozapine and risperidone treatment for people with pMS. Although there have been several case reports describing the successful use of risperidone or clozapine in patients with MS to treat psychosis, this was the first trial of clozapine or risperidone in humans to treat MS itself. The primary aim of this study was to determine if doses of 100–150 mg of clozapine and 2.0–3.5 mg of risperidone are safe and well tolerated in patients with pMS.

### Risperidone (Perseris) [^115yJozh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of risperidone ER SC (also known as Uzedy, Perseris) in pregnant patients for first trimester: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. When considering the use of risperidone during pregnancy, the possibility of risperidone-related adverse outcomes in the fetus or neonate should be weighed against the risks of an untreated maternal psychiatric condition, which may include hospitalization, relapse, suicide, and increased adverse perinatal outcomes (e.g., pre-term birth). Drug-induced hyperprolactinemia may impair reproductive function in both male and female patients. Hyperprolactinemia causes a reduction in the pituitary secretion of gonadotropin which, in turn, impairs gonadal steroidogenesis. The drug risperidone ER SC (also known as Uzedy, Perseris) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Cytochrome P450 2D6 *17 and *29 allele activity for risperidone metabolism: advancing precision medicine health equity [^1113r2Hk]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic drug used in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism‐related irritability in youth. CYP2D6 metabolizes risperidone (which is active) into an active metabolite, 9‐OH‐risperidone, the majority of which is excreted unchanged. Therapeutic drug monitoring guidelines indicate that the total active moiety (risperidone +9‐OH‐risperidone) is what is important for efficacy. However, there are differences in side effect profiles of risperidone and paliperidone (9‐OH‐risperidone), and brain penetration is greater for risperidone than 9‐OH‐risperidone. The DPWG recommends reduced risperidone doses in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, and a CPIC guideline is in progress.

Most studies investigating the effect of CYP2D6 on risperidone metabolism to date have been conducted primarily in Eurocentrically biased study populations, with no studies involving pediatric patients in Africa. The activity values assigned to the sub‐Saharan African‐specific CYP2D6*17 and *29 alleles are based on several substrates (debrisoquine, bufuralol, codeine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, tamoxifen, primaquine) but do not include risperidone. One of these studies indicates there may be substrate‐specific effects, with decreased activity of the *17 and *29 alleles for debrisoquine, metoprolol, and dextromethorphan but not codeine.CPIC's assessment of the activity values of these alleles is currently rated as moderate, based on 4–6 studies in vitro and in vivo whereas the *10 allele is rated as strong based on 18 studies, and the *41 allele is rated as strong based on 5 studies. The primary objective of this study was to determine the effects of alleles *17 and *29 on CYP2D6‐mediated risperidone metabolism in a Nigerian pediatric population. We additionally explored the relationship between these predictors and risperidone‐associated adverse drug reactions.

### Second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections in bipolar disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Wnvxj]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

3.2 Primary Outcomes

The meta‐analysis included seven RCTs (n = 1192), of which three were open label 3, 17, 18 and four were double blind. 16, 19, 20, 21 Six of the RCTs 3, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 involved the use of risperidone LAI and one aripiprazole LAI. 16

For the meta‐analysis, studies were categorised into placebo controlled 16, 19, 20, 21 (n = 4 RCTs) and active controlled 3, 17, 18, 20 (n = 4 RCTs). Since study by Vieta et al 20 contained three arms (risperidone LAI vs placebo vs oral olanzapine), this study appeared in both categories. Risperidone LAI vs placebo (Vieta, 2012) was put under placebo‐controlled category while risperidone LAI vs oral olanzapine (Vieta, 2012 A) under active controlled.
Study‐defined relapse rate (placebo‐controlled studies only): Pooled data from four placebo‐controlled studies favour SGA LAIs for study‐defined relapse rate as shown in Figure 2 with statistically significant difference between the two groups.
Primary safety outcome: All‐cause discontinuation (placebo‐controlled studies only). All‐cause discontinuation was significantly less in SGA LAIs group compared to placebo group as shown in Figure 3 below.
Primary efficacy outcome: Study‐defined relapse rate (active‐controlled studies only). Active‐controlled studies evaluated various oral antipsychotics or TAU against risperidone LAI. There was no statistically significant difference between SGA LAIs and active control as shown in Figure 4 below. However, there was significant heterogeneity. Heterogeneity reduced to 0% when a study by Vieta et al 20 was removed. This led to a significant difference, that is, SGA LAIs performing better than active control (RR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.53 ‐ 0.94, P = 0.02), but this would have removed a high quality, highest weighted study with two third of participants. Thus, the study by Vieta et al was retained in the analysis.
All‐cause discontinuation (Active‐controlled studies only). All‐cause discontinuation was not significantly different between SGA LAIs group and active control group as shown in Figure 5 below.

### Weight change over two years in people prescribed olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone in UK primary care: cohort study in THIN, a UK primary care database [^116ApPPm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Follow-up studies of weight gain related to antipsychotic treatment beyond a year are limited in number. We compared weight change in the three most commonly prescribed antipsychotics in a representative UK General Practice database.

Method

We conducted a cohort study in United Kingdom primary care records of people newly prescribed olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone. The primary outcome was weight in each six month period for two years after treatment initiation. Weight changes were compared using linear regression, adjusted for age, baseline weight and diagnosis.

Results

N = 6338 people received olanzapine, 12,984 quetiapine and 6556 risperidone. Baseline weight was lowest for men treated with olanzapine (80.8 kg versus 83.5 kg quetiapine, 82.0 kg risperidone) and women treated with olanzapine (67.7 kg versus 71.5 kg quetiapine 68.4 kg risperidone. Weight gain occurred during treatment with all three drugs. Compared with risperidone mean weight gain was higher with olanzapine (adjusted co-efficient +1.24 kg (95% confidence interval: 0.69–1.79 kg per six months) for men and +0.77 kg (95% confidence interval: 0.29–1.24 kg) for women). Weight gain with quetiapine was lower in unadjusted models compared with risperidone, but this difference was not significant after adjustment.

Conclusion

Olanzapine is more commonly prescribed to people with lower weight. However, after accounting for baseline weight, age, sex and diagnosis, olanzapine is still associated with greater weight gain over two years than risperidone or quetiapine. Baseline weight does not ameliorate the risks of weight gain associated with antipsychotic medication. Weight gain should be assertively discussed and managed for people prescribed antipsychotics, especially olanzapine.

### Assessment of strategies for switching patients from olanzapine to risperidone: a randomized, open-label, rater-blinded study [^112CefKd]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

In clinical practice the successful treatment of schizophrenia may require switching between antipsychotics. The reasons for changing treatments include inadequate or complete lack of efficacy, partial compliance or noncompliance with medication, and the presence of adverse events such as movement disorders, weight gain, somnolence, endocrine side effects, and metabolic dysfunction. The possibility of exacerbation of psychotic symptoms due to withdrawal of the original antipsychotic before the new antipsychotic has become effective is a major consideration. Conversely, when drugs with long half-lives are quickly replaced with new treatments, consideration must be given to possible excessive drug effects.

Guidelines on changing a patient's antipsychotic medications were provided by a Consensus Study Group in 1996. Their primary purpose was to assist clinicians in switching patients from conventional antipsychotics and from clozapine to the new antipsychotic risperidone. The guidelines suggest that for hospitalized schizophrenia patients who are at low risk for psychotic exacerbation or aggressive or suicidal reactions and who are receiving antipsychotics other than clozapine, the previous antipsychotic can be withdrawn completely before risperidone is started. Gradual withdrawal while introducing the other antipsychotic, however, may be necessary in patients who are combative or assaultive, those with a history of exacerbation of psychotic behavior or suicidal tendencies when the dose of an antipsychotic was reduced, those receiving high doses of an antipsychotic, and those receiving clozapine (withdrawal of clozapine has been associated with withdrawal symptoms and rebound psychosis in some patients).

### Antipsychotic dose reduction compared to dose continuation for people with schizophrenia [^115kXXHY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia, yet they are associated with diverse and potentially dose-related side effects which can reduce quality of life. For this reason, the lowest possible doses of antipsychotics are generally recommended, but higher doses are often used in clinical practice. It is still unclear if and how antipsychotic doses could be reduced safely in order to minimise the adverse-effect burden without increasing the risk of relapse.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of reducing antipsychotic dose compared to continuing the current dose for people with schizophrenia.

Search Methods

We conducted a systematic search on 10 February 2021 at the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials, which is based on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN, and WHO ICTRP. We also inspected the reference lists of included studies and previous reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any dose reduction against continuation in people with schizophrenia or related disorders who were stabilised on their current antipsychotic treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently screened relevant records for inclusion, extracted data from eligible studies, and assessed the risk of bias using RoB 2. We contacted study authors for missing data and additional information. Our primary outcomes were clinically important change in quality of life, rehospitalisations and dropouts due to adverse effects; key secondary outcomes were clinically important change in functioning, relapse, dropouts for any reason, and at least one adverse effect. We also examined scales measuring symptoms, quality of life, and functioning as well as a comprehensive list of specific adverse effects. We pooled outcomes at the endpoint preferably closest to one year. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 25 RCTs, of which 22 studies provided data with 2635 participants (average age 38.4 years old). The median study sample size was 60 participants (ranging from 18 to 466 participants) and length was 37 weeks (ranging from 12 weeks to 2 years). There were variations in the dose reduction strategies in terms of speed of reduction (i.e.g.radual in about half of the studies (within 2 to 16 weeks) and abrupt in the other half), and in terms of degree of reduction (i.e. median planned reduction of 66% of the dose up to complete withdrawal in three studies). We assessed risk of bias across outcomes predominantly as some concerns or high risk. No study reported data on the number of participants with a clinically important change in quality of life or functioning, and only eight studies reported continuous data on scales measuring quality of life or functioning. There was no difference between dose reduction and continuation on scales measuring quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.17 to 0.15, 6 RCTs, n = 719, I² = 0%, moderate certainty evidence) and scales measuring functioning (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.17, 6 RCTs, n = 966, I² = 0%, high certainty evidence). Dose reduction in comparison to continuation may increase the risk of rehospitalisation based on data from eight studies with estimable effect sizes; however, the 95% CI does not exclude the possibility of no difference (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.81, 8 RCTs, n = 1413, I² = 59% (moderate heterogeneity), very low certainty evidence). Similarly, dose reduction increased the risk of relapse based on data from 20 studies (RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.06, 20 RCTs, n = 2481, I² = 70% (substantial heterogeneity), low certainty evidence). More participants in the dose reduction group in comparison to the continuation group left the study early due to adverse effects (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.49, 6 RCTs with estimable effect sizes, n = 1079, I² = 0%, moderate certainty evidence) and for any reason (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.81, 12 RCTs, n = 1551, I² = 48% (moderate heterogeneity), moderate certainty evidence). Lastly, there was no difference between the dose reduction and continuation groups in the number of participants with at least one adverse effect based on data from four studies with estimable effect sizes (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.12, 5 RCTs, n = 998 (4 RCTs, n = 980 with estimable effect sizes), I² = 0%, moderate certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review synthesised the latest evidence on the reduction of antipsychotic doses for stable individuals with schizophrenia. There was no difference between dose reduction and continuation groups in quality of life, functioning, and number of participants with at least one adverse effect. However, there was a higher risk for relapse and dropouts, and potentially for rehospitalisations, with dose reduction. Of note, the majority of the trials focused on relapse prevention rather potential beneficial outcomes on quality of life, functioning, and adverse effects, and in some studies there was rapid and substantial reduction of doses. Further well-designed RCTs are therefore needed to provide more definitive answers.

### Paliperidone palmitate for schizophrenia [^114nxGjk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Paliperidone palmitate, a long-acting, intramuscular formulation of paliperidone, is now available for clinical use. Paliperidone is an active metabolite of risperidone and it is also available in an oral formulation for daily use.

Objectives

To compare the effects of paliperidone palmitate with any other treatment for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like illnesses.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (November 2009) and inspected references of identified studies for further trials. We contacted the manufacturers of paliperidone palmitate, the Food and Drug Administration, and authors of relevant trials for additional material.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently selected and critically appraised studies, extracted data and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Where possible and appropriate, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) with the number needed to benefit/harm statistic (NNB/H). We calculated mean differences (MD) for continuous data.

Main Results

Five studies with 2215 participants compared paliperidone palmitate with placebo. Fewer people left studies early if they were randomised to paliperidone palmitate (n = 2183, 5 RCTs, RR 0.76 CI 0.70 to 0.84, NNTB 9 CI 7 to 14) and those receiving any dose of paliperidone palmitate were significantly less likely to show no improvement in global state (n = 1696, 4 RCTs, RR 0.79 CI 0.74 to 0.85, NNTB 7 CI 5 to 9). People randomised to paliperidone palmitate were less likely to experience a recurrence of psychosis (n = 312, 1 RCT, RR 0.28 CI 0.17 to 0.48, NNTB 5 CI 4 to 6) than those allocated to placebo in a single trial specifically designed to study recurrence. In the other studies where recurrence was recorded only as an adverse event, we found that people who received paliperidone palmitate were also less likely to experience a recurrence of psychotic symptoms (n = 1837, 4 RCTs, RR 0.55 CI 0.44 to 0.68, NNTB 10 CI 8 to 14). Paliperidone palmitate was associated with fewer reports of agitation or aggression (n = 2180, 5 RCTs, RR 0.65 CI 0.46 to 0.91, NNTB 39 CI 25 to 150) and of using anxiolytic medications (n = 2170, 5 RCTs, RR 0.89 CI 0.83 to 0.96, NNTB 16 CI 11 to 44). A consistent, significant elevation in serum prolactin (ng/mL) was found for both men and women receiving paliperidone palmitate, but the data were too heterogenous to sum. We found no evidence of sexual dysfunction in these short-term trials. People receiving paliperidone palmitate had a significantly greater increase in weight (n = 2052, 5 RCTs, MD 1.34 CI 0.97 to 1.70) in comparison with people who received placebo. Two studies with 1969 participants compared flexibly-dosed paliperidone palmitate with flexibly-dosed risperidone long-acting injection. The mean doses of paliperidone palmitate in these trials were 73.3 and 104.6 mg every four weeks compared with risperidone long-acting injection at mean doses, respectively, of 35.3 and 31.7 mg every two weeks. We found no differences between paliperidone palmitate and risperidone long-acting injection for leaving these studies early for any reason (n = 1969, 2 RCTs, RR 1.12 CI 1.00 to 1.25). Those receiving paliperidone palmitate were statistically no more likely to have a recurrence of psychotic symptoms than those receiving risperidone long-acting injection (n = 1961, 2 RCTs, RR 1.23 CI 0.98 to 1.53). While we found no significant difference in the occurrences of deaths in the pooled trials (n = 1967, 2 RCTs, RR 3.62 CI 0.60 to 21.89), we note that a total of six deaths occurred in these two trials, with five deaths among people who received paliperidone palmitate and one death among people who received risperidone long-acting injection. Although death is the most serious of adverse events, the small number of these events in these trials makes it unclear if this finding is meaningful. We found that participants randomised to paliperidone palmitate were significantly less likely to use anticholinergic medications in these trials (n = 1587, 2 RCTs, RR 0.67 CI 0.55 to 0.82, NNTB 13 CI 10 to 24). We found no data regarding paliperidone palmitate relating to services use, quality of life, behaviour, patient satisfaction, cognitive functioning or cost.

Authors' Conclusions

In short-term studies, paliperidone palmitate is an antipsychotic drug that is more efficacious than placebo. We found its adverse effects to be similar to those of its related compounds, paliperidone and risperidone, with extrapyramidal movement disorders, weight gain, and tachycardia all more common with paliperidone palmitate than placebo. While no difference was found in the incidence of reported adverse sexual outcomes, paliperidone palmitate is associated with substantial increases in serum prolactin. When flexibly dosed with a mean doses of approximately 70 to 110 mg every four weeks, paliperidone palmitate appears comparable in efficacy and tolerability to risperidone long-acting injection flexibly dosed with mean doses of approximately 35 mg every two weeks.

### Depot risperidone for schizophrenia [^117H43Zd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Risperidone is the first new generation antipsychotic drug made available in a long acting injection.

Objectives

To examine the clinical effects of depot risperidone for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (December 2002), references of all included studies, and contacted industry and authors of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing depot risperidone with other treatments for people with schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently inspected citations and/or abstracts, ordered papers, re-inspected and quality assessed the results, and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence interval (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).

Main Results

One study (n = 400) compared depot risperidone with placebo but 56% of people did not complete the three-month study rendering most global and mental state data unusable. Risperidone depot compared with placebo did not affect levels of anxiety (n = 400, RR 0.58 CI 0.32 to 1.05) but may decrease agitation (n = 400, RR 0.60 CI 0.39 to 0.92). Risperidone depot did not substantially influence hallucinations (n = 400, RR 1.23 CI 0.47 to 3.22) but 'psychosis' was reduced (n = 400, RR 0.52 CI 0.33 to 0.83, NNT 9 CI 7 to 26). Attrition was higher for the placebo group compared with people allocated risperidone depot (n = 400, RR 0.74 CI 0.63 to 0.88, NNT 6 CI 4 to 12). Severe adverse events were common (13% to 23%) but significantly more so in the placebo group (n = 400, RR 0.59 CI 0.38 to 0.93, NNT 11 CI 7 to 70). Poor reporting, however, makes these difficult to interpret. Movement disorders were equally common in both groups (n = 400, RR 2.38 CI 0.73 to 7.78) although it looks as if there is a trend for the higher depot doses to encourage movement disorders. One study (n = 640) compared depot risperidone against oral risperidone for stable people with relatively mild illness. For global outcomes there was no clear difference between the depot group and oral group (n = 640, RR 'no global improvement' 1.06 CI 0.92 to 1.22). Mental state measures were also similar across groups. Overall, in this study compliance was good (n = 640, RR < 4 injections or "major protocol violation" 1.16 CI 0.81 to 1.67). Adverse effects were poorly reported but over half of both groups reported some adverse effect (n = 640, RR 1.04 CI 0.91 to 1.18).

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is no reliable data to support the claim that depot risperidone is beneficial for people with schizophrenia. For reasonably well, stable people it may mean that the need for regular oral doses can be avoided, but adverse affects are not well reported. For more severely ill people, few benefits are evident although it may increase compliance with injections in comparison with placebo. Use of depot risperidone, especially at the higher doses, is weakly associated with movement disorders. Well designed and reported, randomised studies, firmly grounded in real world clinical practice are needed to fully assess the effects of this new preparation.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^111yPKvn]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Antipsychotics — Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are presented as the primary pharmacological treatment for psychotic symptoms and the most commonly used and best-studied pharmacological treatment for agitation, with considerable evidence from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses for efficacy. Findings from CATIE-AD failed to demonstrate conclusive benefits of second-generation antipsychotics over placebo in Alzheimer's disease with psychosis or aggression, although certain outcome variables favored medications and discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was lower with olanzapine and risperidone than with placebo or quetiapine. Given side effects and potential toxicity, the risks and benefits must be reassessed on an ongoing basis, the lowest effective dose should be sought with emergent side effects first treated by dose reduction, and indications should be generally limited to psychosis or behavioral disturbances, not primarily for sleep disorders or anxiety. Periodic attempts (e.g., every several months) to reduce or withdraw antipsychotic medications should be considered for all patients while weighing the probability of a relapse and the dangerousness of the target behavior(s). In general, agents with significant anticholinergic properties should be avoided in patients with dementia, and mild to moderate adverse effects of antipsychotics include akathisia, parkinsonism, and sedation.

### Long-acting injectable second-generation antipsychotics vs placebo and their oral formulations in acute schizophrenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled-trials [^1145vPWj]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Hypothesis

Long-acting injectable antipsychotic drugs (LAIs) are mainly used for relapse prevention but could also be advantageous for acutely ill patients with schizophrenia.

Study Design

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled-trials (RCTs) comparing the second-generation long-acting injectable antipsychotics (SGA-LAIs) olanzapine, risperidone, paliperidone, and aripiprazole with placebo or their oral counterparts in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia. We analyzed 23 efficacy and tolerability outcomes, with the primary outcome being overall symptoms of schizophrenia. The results were obtained through random effects, pairwise meta-analyses, and subgroup tests. The study quality was assessed using the Cochrane-Risk-of-Bias-Tool version-1.

Study Results

Sixty-six studies with 16 457 participants were included in the analysis. Eleven studies compared second-generation long-acting injectable antipsychotics (SGA-LAIs) with a placebo, 54 compared second-generation oral antipsychotics (SGA-orals) with a placebo, and one compared an SGA-LAI (aripiprazole) with its oral formulation. All 4 SGA-LAIs reduced overall symptoms more than placebo, with mean standardized differences of -0.66 (95% CI: -0.90; -0.43) for olanzapine, -0.64 (-0.80; -0.48) for aripiprazole, -0.62 (-0.76; -0.48) for risperidone and -0.42 (-0.53; -0.31) for paliperidone. The side-effect profiles of the LAIs corresponded to the patterns known from the oral formulations. In subgroup tests compared to placebo, some side effects were less pronounced under LAIs than under their oral formulations.

Conclusions

SGA-LAIs effectively treat acute schizophrenia. Some side effects may be less frequent than under oral drugs, but due to the indirect nature of the comparisons, this finding must be confirmed by RCTs comparing LAIs and orals head-to-head.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: an expert consensus [^112ufPqE]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

For several decades, lithium has been, and remains, the "gold standard" first‐line treatment for patients living with BP‐I, followed by other oral medications (such as olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone orally disintegrating tablet). Despite declining prescription rates during the past decade due to the adverse‐event and toxicity burden, it is used because of its effectiveness in both BP‐I and BP‐II, including for the prevention of suicidal behavior. In recent years, LAIs such as aripiprazole and risperidone have emerged as potential maintenance treatment options for patients living with BP‐I, including early in the course of the illness. At present, aripiprazole and risperidone are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration; however, the use of LAIs for bipolar disorder is currently off‐label in Europe according to European Medicines Agency recommendations. Compared to oral antipsychotics that are shorter acting and must be taken more frequently, LAIs are designed to provide relief of symptoms by slowly releasing the drug over an extended period (weeks to months). Studies in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder suggest that LAIs may provide additional benefits over oral antipsychotics by reducing the rates of re‐hospitalization and risk of relapse, improving overall quality of life, and improving adherence to treatment. However, LAIs are not routinely offered to patients living with BP‐I, for reasons that will be explored in this expert consensus report.

The main objectives of this article are to highlight the potential benefits of LAIs in the management of BP‐I, particularly in early disease, and to discuss the many barriers faced during implementation, while providing expert consensus recommendations for potential solutions.

### Benefits and harms of risperidone and paliperidone for treatment of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: a meta-analysis involving individual participant data and clinical study reports [^113avEts]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Using IPD from the drug manufacturer, we found that Risperidone and Paliperidone lead to small clinical improvements in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder which are more conservative compared to those of previous studies based on publicly available data. CSRs also contained a significantly greater volume of major harms compared to journal articles and trial registry reports. Our findings clearly support the use of IPD and CSRs for accurately assessing the efficacy and safety of antipsychotic drug interventions. For this type of in-depth analysis, more informed guidance is needed to help encourage researchers to access and analyse these data sources in an efficient manner.

### Risperidone adjunctive therapy duration in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder: a post hoc analysis [^112FQUh2]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic medication, is recommended as a first line treatment for acute mania in patients with bipolar disorder I (BD I). It is unknown if continuing treatment with risperidone adjunct to lithium or valproate after remission of the manic episode offers additional benefit in prevention of mood episode relapse.

Methods

A post-hoc subgroup analysis was conducted using data from a 52-week, double-blind, placebo controlled trial involving 93 patients treated with oral risperidone adjunct to mood stabilizer, randomized to arms discontinuing risperidone at entry ("0-week arm"), 24 weeks after entry ("24-week arm") or continuing risperidone ("52-week arm"). Time to any episode, manic episode, and depressive episode was compared between arms using Cox regression models.

Results

Time to any mood episode was longer in the 24-week arm versus the 0-week arm (HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.31–1.05, P = 0.07) and shorter in the 52-week arm versus 24-week arm (HR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.00–3.41, P = 0.05), though these results were not significant. Time to relapse into manic episode was significantly longer in the 24-week arm versus 0-week arm (HR: 0.14, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.65, P = 0.01). No other significant differences were observed between arms.

Limitations

The sample size was modest, as the original dataset was powered to study optimal duration for two atypical antipsychotics.

Conclusions

Adjunctive risperidone treatment was observed to reduce the risk of manic episodes during the first 24 weeks, but not after 24 weeks. Treatment did not appear to reduce the risk of depressive episodes.

### Benefits and harms of risperidone and paliperidone for treatment of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: a meta-analysis involving individual participant data and clinical study reports [^114QgJ2Z]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are severe mental illnesses which are highly prevalent worldwide. Risperidone and Paliperidone are treatments for either illnesses, but their efficacy compared to other antipsychotics and growing reports of hormonal imbalances continue to raise concerns. As existing evidence on both antipsychotics are solely based on aggregate data, we aimed to assess the benefits and harms of Risperidone and Paliperidone in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, using individual participant data (IPD), clinical study reports (CSRs) and publicly available sources (journal publications and trial registries).

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Central, EMBASE and PsycINFO until December 2020 for randomised placebo-controlled trials of Risperidone, Paliperidone or Paliperidone palmitate in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. We obtained IPD and CSRs from the Yale University Open Data Access project. The primary outcome Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score was analysed using one-stage IPD meta-analysis. Random-effect meta-analysis of harm outcomes involved methods for coping with rare events. Effect-sizes were compared across all available data sources using the ratio of means or relative risk. We registered our review on PROSPERO, CRD42019140556.

Results

Of the 35 studies, IPD meta-analysis involving 22 (63%) studies showed a significant clinical reduction in the PANSS in patients receiving Risperidone (mean difference - 5.83, 95% CI - 10.79 to - 0.87, I² = 8.5%, n = 4 studies, 1131 participants), Paliperidone (- 6.01, 95% CI - 8.7 to - 3.32, I² = 4.3%, n = 13, 3821) and Paliperidone palmitate (- 7.89, 95% CI - 12.1 to - 3.69, I² = 2.9%, n = 5, 2209). CSRs reported nearly two times more adverse events (4434 vs. 2296 publication, relative difference (RD) = 1.93, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.00) and almost 8 times more serious adverse events (650 vs. 82; RD = 7.93, 95% CI 6.32 to 9.95) than the journal publications. Meta-analyses of individual harms from CSRs revealed a significant increased risk among several outcomes including extrapyramidal disorder, tardive dyskinesia and increased weight. But the ratio of relative risk between the different data sources was not significant. Three treatment-related gynecomastia events occurred, and these were considered mild to moderate in severity.

Conclusion

IPD meta-analysis conclude that Risperidone and Paliperidone antipsychotics had a small beneficial effect on reducing PANSS score over 9 weeks, which is more conservative than estimates from reviews based on journal publications. CSRs also contained significantly more data on harms that were unavailable in journal publications or trial registries. Sharing of IPD and CSRs are necessary when performing meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of antipsychotics.

### Risperidone [^116URzj7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatrics

The efficacy of risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents aged 13–17 years was demonstrated in two short-term (6 and 8 weeks), double-blind controlled trials. All patients met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and were experiencing an acute episode at time of enrollment. In the first trial (study #1), patients were randomized into one of three treatment groups: risperidone 1–3 mg/day (n = 55, mean modal dose = 2.6 mg), risperidone 4–6 mg/day (n = 51, mean modal dose = 5.3 mg), or placebo (n = 54). In the second trial (study #2), patients were randomized to either risperidone 0.15–0.6 mg/day (n = 132, mean modal dose = 0.5 mg) or risperidone 1.5–6 mg/day (n = 125, mean modal dose = 4 mg). In all cases, study medication was initiated at 0.5 mg/day (with the exception of the 0.15–0.6 mg/day group in study #2, where the initial dose was 0.05 mg/day) and titrated to the target dosage range by approximately Day 7. Subsequently, dosage was increased to the maximum tolerated dose within the target dose range by Day 14. The primary efficacy variable in all studies was the mean change from baseline in total PANSS score.

Results of the studies demonstrated efficacy of risperidone in all dose groups from 1–6 mg/day compared to placebo, as measured by significant reduction of total PANSS score. The efficacy on the primary parameter in the 1–3 mg/day group was comparable to the 4–6 mg/day group in study #1, and similar to the efficacy demonstrated in the 1.5–6 mg/day group in study #2. In study #2, the efficacy in the 1.5–6 mg/day group was statistically significantly greater than that in the 0.15–0.6 mg/day group. Doses higher than 3 mg/day did not reveal any trend towards greater efficacy.

### Risperidone (Risperdal) [^111NX9YE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Reinitiation of Treatment in Patients Previously Discontinued

Although there are no data to specifically address reinitiation of treatment, it is recommended that after an interval off RISPERDAL, the initial titration schedule should be followed.

Switching From Other Antipsychotics

There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching schizophrenic patients from other antipsychotics to RISPERDAL, or treating patients with concomitant antipsychotics.

2.2 Bipolar Mania

Usual Dose

Adults

The initial dose range is 2 mg to 3 mg per day. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 1 mg per day. The effective dose range is 1 mg to 6 mg per day, as studied in the short-term, placebo-controlled trials. In these trials, short-term (3 week) anti-manic efficacy was demonstrated in a flexible dosage range of 1 mg to 6 mg per day [see Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3)]. RISPERDAL doses higher than 6 mg per day were not studied.

Pediatrics

The initial dose is 0.5 mg once daily, administered as a single-daily dose in the morning or evening. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 0.5 mg or 1 mg per day, as tolerated, to the recommended target dose of 1 mg to 2.5 mg per day. Although efficacy has been demonstrated in studies of pediatric patients with bipolar mania at doses between 0.5 mg and 6 mg per day, no additional benefit was observed above 2.5 mg per day, and higher doses were associated with more adverse events. Doses higher than 6 mg per day have not been studied.

Patients experiencing persistent somnolence may benefit from administering half the daily dose twice daily.

Maintenance Therapy

There is no body of evidence available from controlled trials to guide a clinician in the longer-term management of a patient who improves during treatment of an acute manic episode with RISPERDAL. While it is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment beyond an acute response in mania is desirable, both for maintenance of the initial response and for prevention of new manic episodes, there are no systematically obtained data to support the use of RISPERDAL in such longer-term treatment (i.e., beyond 3 weeks). The physician who elects to use RISPERDAL for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term risks and benefits of the drug for the individual patient.

### RISPERIDONE… [^111Ywh4s]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

1/2025 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for: Treatment of schizophrenia As monotherapy or adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate, for the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder. Risperidone can be administered once or twice daily. Initial dosing is 2 mg per day. May increase the dose at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 1 to 2 mg per day, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 4 to 8 mg per day. In some patients. the effectiveness of risperidone 2 mg per day to 8 mg per day at delaying relapse was demonstrated in a controlled trial in adult patients who had been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks and were then followed for a period of 1 to 2 years. Both adult and adolescent patients who respond acutely should generally be. dose of risperidone should be increased up to double the patient's usual dose.

It may be necessary to decrease the risperidone dose when enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine are discontinued. Similar effect may be expected with co-administration of risperidone with other enzyme inducers or infectious in. hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status including delirium, and autonomic instability. Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria, and acute renal failure. Table 4.

### Second-generation antipsychotic drugs and extrapyramidal side effects: a systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head comparisons [^111WwvP7]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

While all second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are promoted for having a low risk of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), clinical observations suggest differences between the various agents. Nevertheless, this question has never been examined in a systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head comparisons.

Methods

We searched the register of the Cochrane schizophrenia group (last search May 2007), supplemented by MEDLINE (last search July 2009) for randomized, blinded studies comparing the following SGAs in the treatment of schizophrenia or related disorders: amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone, and zotepine. At least 3 reviewers extracted the data independently. The primary outcome was "use of antiparkinson medication". The results were combined in a meta-analysis.

Results

We included 54 studies with 116 arms. Risperidone was associated with more use of antiparkinson medication than clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone. Ziprasidone showed more use of antiparkinson medication than olanzapine and quetiapine and zotepine more than clozapine. There was no significant difference between amisulpride and its comparators (olanzapine, risperidone, or ziprasidone). Quetiapine showed significantly less use of antiparkinson medication than the 3 other SGAs it was compared with (olanzapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone). Scale-derived data (Barnes Akathisia Scale and Simpson Angus Scale) were limited.

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis demonstrates that there are differences between the SGAs in their ability to induce EPS that clinicians consider warrant treatment with antimuscarinic drugs. Even though the differences were relatively small, they might be important for individual patients and should be taken into account in drug choice.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: an expert consensus [^114PWjZA]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

The concomitant use of LAIs and mood stabilizers should also be adequately assessed, offering insights to help ease burden on patients and healthcare systems. Preliminary evidence has shown that second‐generation LAIs used for BP‐I, such as adjunctive risperidone, can protect against manic relapses/recurrences in patients living with BP‐I, but not against depression, and so combination with appropriate other treatments (e.g. lamotrigine) should be investigated. Most RCTs of combination pharmacotherapy focus on the benefit of pairing a mood stabilizer with a second‐ or third‐generation antipsychotic for the prevention of either acute mania or relapse; however, in clinical practice, patients living with bipolar disorder often take more elaborate combinations of mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and other psychotropic medications for indefinite periods that do not necessarily follow a strategic or logical course. Thus, tracking of outcomes through both clinical and database studies is of great importance so that HCPs can devise regimens that are complementary, non‐redundant, purposeful, and evidence based.

Finally, while clinical trials and other research methods are important in helping raise awareness of LAIs for BP‐I, additional avenues could include increased education for HCPs about the benefits of LAIs (online courses and congress presentations), scientific publications (including reviews and guidelines), and direct patient education.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe risperidone.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

Counsel patients about a potentially fatal adverse reaction, Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), that has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs. Advise patients, family members, or caregivers to contact the healthcare provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs and symptoms of NMS, including hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status including delirium, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Tardive Dyskinesia

Counsel patients on the signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia and to contact their healthcare provider if these abnormal movements occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Metabolic Changes

Educate patients about the risk of metabolic changes, how to recognize symptoms of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, and the need for specific monitoring, including blood glucose, lipids, and weight [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Orthostatic Hypotension

Educate patients about the risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope, particularly at the time of initiating treatment, re-initiating treatment, or increasing the dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### Long-acting risperidone and oral antipsychotics in unstable schizophrenia [^113CHif8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Long-acting injectable risperidone, a second-generation antipsychotic agent, may improve adherence to treatment and outcomes in schizophrenia, but it has not been tested in a long-term randomized trial involving patients with unstable disease.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients in the Veterans Affairs (VA) system who had schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and who had been hospitalized within the previous 2 years or were at imminent risk for hospitalization to 25 to 50 mg of long-acting injectable risperidone every two weeks or to a psychiatrist's choice of an oral antipsychotic. All patients were followed for up to 2 years. The primary end point was hospitalization in a VA or non-VA psychiatric hospital. Symptoms, quality of life, and functioning were assessed in blinded videoconference interviews.

Results

Of 369 participants, 40% were hospitalized at randomization, 55% were hospitalized within the previous 2 years, and 5% were at risk for hospitalization. The rate of hospitalization after randomization was not significantly lower among patients who received long-acting injectable risperidone than among those who received oral antipsychotics (39% after 10.8 months vs. 45% after 11.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.63 to 1.20). Psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, scores on the Personal and Social Performance scale of global functioning, and neurologic side effects were not significantly improved with long-acting injectable risperidone as compared with control treatments. Patients who received long-acting injectable risperidone reported more adverse events at the injection site and more extrapyramidal symptoms.

Conclusions

Long-acting injectable risperidone was not superior to a psychiatrist's choice of oral treatment in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder who were hospitalized or at high risk for hospitalization, and it was associated with more local injection-site and extrapyramidal adverse effects.

### New generation antipsychotics versus low-potency conventional antipsychotics: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Z5PSn]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

The clearest advantage of new generation, atypical antipsychotics is a reduced risk of extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS), compared with conventional compounds. These findings might have been biased by the use of the high-potency antipsychotic haloperidol as a comparator in most of the trials. We aimed to establish whether the new drugs induce fewer EPS than low-potency conventional antipsychotics.

Methods

We did a meta-analysis of all randomised controlled trials in which new generation antipsychotics had been compared with low-potency (equivalent or less potent than chlorpromazine) conventional drugs. We included studies that met quality criteria A or B in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook, and assessed quality with the Jadad scale. The primary outcome of interest was the number of patients who had at least one EPS. We used risk differences and 95% CIs as measures of effect size.

Findings

We identified 31 studies with a total of 2320 participants. Of the new generation drugs, only clozapine was associated with significantly fewer EPS (RD = -0.15, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.4, p = 0.008) and higher efficacy than low-potency conventional drugs. Reduced frequency of EPS seen with olanzapine was of borderline significance (-0.15, -0.31 to -0.01, p = 0.07). Only one inconclusive trial of amisulpride, quetiapine, and risperidone and no investigations of ziprasidone and sertindole were identified, but some evidence indicates that zotepine and remoxipride do not lead to fewer EPS than low-potency antipsychotics. Mean doses less than 600 mg/day of chlorpromazine or its equivalent had no higher risk of EPS than new generation drugs. As a group, new generation drugs were moderately more efficacious than low-potency antipsychotics, largely irrespective of the comparator doses used.

Interpretation

Optimum doses of low-potency conventional antipsychotics might not induce more EPS than new generation drugs. Potential advantages in efficacy of the new generation drugs should be a factor in clinical treatment decisions to use these rather than conventional drugs.

### Risperidone versus placebo for schizophrenia [^113ogu2F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Risperidone is the first new-generation antipsychotic drug made available in the market in its generic form.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effects, safety and cost-effectiveness of risperidone compared with placebo for treating schizophrenia.

Search Methods

On 19th October 2015, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register, which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We checked the references of all included studies and contacted industry and authors of included studies for relevant studies and data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing oral risperidone with placebo treatments for people with schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened studies, assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR), and the 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and the 95% CI. We created a 'Summary of findings table' using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

Main Results

The review includes 15 studies (N = 2428). Risk of selection bias is unclear in most of the studies, especially concerning allocation concealment. Other areas of risk such as missing data and selective reporting also caused some concern, although not affected on the direction of effect of our primary outcome, as demonstrated by sensitivity analysis. Many of the included trials have industry sponsorship of involvement. Nonetheless, generally people in the risperidone group are more likely to achieve a significant clinical improvement in mental state (6 RCTs, N = 864, RR 0.64, CI 0.52 to 0.78, very low-quality evidence). The effect withstood, even when three studies with > 50% attrition rate were removed from the analysis (3 RCTs, N = 589, RR 0.77, CI 0.67 to 0.88). Participants receiving placebo were less likely to have a clinically significant improvement on Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI) than those receiving risperidone (4 RCTs, N = 594, RR 0.69, CI 0.57 to 0.83, very low-quality evidence). Overall, the risperidone group was 31% less likely to leave early compared to placebo group (12 RCTs, N = 2261, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.78, low-quality evidence), but Incidence of significant extrapyramidal side effect was more likely to occur in the risperidone group (7 RCTs, N = 1511, RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.15, very low-quality evidence). When risperidone and placebo were augmented with clozapine, there is no significant differences between groups for clinical response as defined by a less than 20% reduction in PANSS/BPRS scores (2 RCTs, N = 98, RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.42, low-quality evidence) and attrition (leaving the study early for any reason) (3 RCTs, N = 167, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.42, low quality evidence). One study measured clinically significant responses using the CGI, no effect was evident (1 RCT, N = 68, RR 1.12 95% CI 0.87 to 1.44, low quality evidence). No data were available for extrapyramidal adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on low quality evidence, risperidone appears to be benefitial in improving mental state compared with placebo, but it also causes more adverse events. Eight out of the 15 included trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The currently available evidence isvery low to low quality.

### Risperidone versus placebo for schizophrenia [^117UTdUg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Risperidone is the first new generation antipsychotic drug made available in the market in its generic form.

Objectives

To examine the clinical effects of oral risperidone for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses in comparison with placebo.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (February 2008), references of all included studies, and contacted industry and authors of included studies for relevant studies and data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing oral risperidone with placebo treatments for people with schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently inspected citations and/or abstracts, ordered papers, re-inspected and assessed the quality of results and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence interval (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).

Main Results

One study (n = 599) compared risperidone against placebo but the attrition rate was 60% over a period of six weeks rendering most of the efficacy and global improvement data unusable. The attrition rate was higher for placebo compared with risperidone (n = 1363, 10 RCTs, RR 0.70 CI 0.57 to 0.86, NNT 13 CI 9 to 29) and less participants left the trial in the risperidone arm due to lack of efficacy (n = 888, 5 RCTs, RR 0.38 CI 0.20 to 0.73, NNT 7 CI 5 to 15). Risperidone was no better than placebo on the CGI global score (n = 397, 3 RCTs, RR 0.80 CI 0.55 to 1.15) but significantly more number of participants in risperidone arm had more than 20% reduction in their BPRS/PANSS score (n = 856, 7 RCTs, RR 0.43 CI 0.32 to 0.58, NNT 7 CI 6 to 10). Data became considerably more homogeneous (and positive) when the one study independent of industry funding was removed (I(2) 75% to 55%). Despite poor reporting, it is clear that around 24% of all participants receiving either risperidone or placebo developed some form of extrapyramidal effects (n = 723, 5 RCTs, RR 1.40 CI 0.93 to 2.10). Three people on risperidone had prolonged QTc (n = 198, 1 RCT, RR 7.5 CI 0.4 to 144), more on risperidone gained weight (n = 303, 2 RCTs, RR 5.14 CI 1.79 to 14.73, NNH 10 CI 3 to 51) and had a raised prolactin (n = 323, 2 RCTs, RR 12.54 CI 5.11 to 30.79, NNH 3 CI 2 to 5). Fewer in the risperidone arm needed an additional psychotropic during the trial period (n = 186, 1 RCT, RR 0.62 CI 0.45 to 0.85, NNT 10 CI 7 to 28).

Authors' Conclusions

Risperidone appears to have a marginal benefit in terms of clinical improvement compared with placebo in the first few weeks of treatment but data are limited, poorly reported and probably biased in favour of risperidone. The margin of improvement chosen by the researchers as their outcome may not be clinically meaningful. Even after so much use of this drug, we feel that further independent trials can be justified.

### Effects of risperidone / paliperidone versus placebo on cognitive functioning over the first 6 months of treatment for psychotic disorder: secondary analysis of a triple-blind randomised clinical trial [^1144TBSu]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Note. The p values for 'Group × time interaction' indicates if the three groups differ in terms of the rate of change from baseline to 6-month assessment. The p values for 'Group' indicate the significance of the group main effect, i.e. the overall difference between the group means. For those measures with no significant group × time interaction, this is a similar test to an ANOVA of the baseline values. The p values for 'Time' indicate the significance of the overall rate of change assuming there is no group × time interaction, i.e. if all the groups have the same rate of change. When there is significant group × time interaction (i.e. when there is significant difference in rate of change between the groups), then 'Time' may not be meaningful.

### Rethinking antipsychotic formulary policy [^114zak8h]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

In this commentary, we review recent research suggesting that (a) second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) may be no more effective than first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), (b) the reduced risk of EPS and tardive dyskinesia with SGAs is more weakly supported by the research literature than has been appreciated, and (c) benefits may be offset by greater metabolic risks of some SGAs and their substantially greater cost. Bearing in mind, as well, that risperidone, currently the least expensive SGA, will soon be available as an even less expensive generic drug, we propose a new algorithm for maintenance antipsychotic therapy. We further outline a cautious implementation procedure that relies on standardized documentation and feedback, without a restrictive formulary that would limit physician choice. The algorithm outlined here and the process for its implementation are intended as a stimulus for discussion of potential policy responses, not as a finalized proposition.

### Risperidone [^1143ptKW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Carbamazepine and other enzyme inducers decrease plasma concentrations of risperidone. Increase the risperidone dose up to double the patient's usual dose. Titrate slowly. (7.1)
Fluoxetine, paroxetine, and other CYP 2D6 enzyme inhibitors increase plasma concentrations of risperidone. Reduce the initial dose. Do not exceed a final dose of 8 mg per day of risperidone. (7.1)

7.1 Pharmacokinetic-related Interactions

The dose of risperidone should be adjusted when used in combination with CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, and paroxetine) and enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) [see Table 18 and Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Dose adjustment is not recommended for risperidone when co-administered with ranitidine, cimetidine, amitriptyline, or erythromycin [see Table 18].

Effect of Risperidone on Other Drugs

Lithium

Repeated oral doses of risperidone (3 mg twice daily) did not affect the exposure (AUC) or peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of lithium (n = 13). Dose adjustment for lithium is not recommended.

Valproate

Repeated oral doses of risperidone (4 mg once daily) did not affect the pre-dose or average plasma concentrations and exposure (AUC) of valproate (1000 mg/day in three divided doses) compared to placebo (n = 21). However, there was a 20% increase in valproate peak plasma concentration (Cmax) after concomitant administration of risperidone. Dose adjustment for valproate is not recommended.

Digoxin

Risperidone (0.25 mg twice daily) did not show a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. Dose adjustment for digoxin is not recommended.

7.2 Pharmacodynamic-related Interactions

Centrally Acting Drugs and Alcohol

Given the primary CNS effects of risperidone, caution should be used when risperidone is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol.

Drugs with Hypotensive Effects

Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, risperidone may enhance the hypotensive effects of other therapeutic agents with this potential.

Levodopa and Dopamine Agonists

Risperidone may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.

Methylphenidate

Concomitant use with methylphenidate, when there is change in dosage of either medication, may increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Monitor for symptoms of EPS with concomitant use of risperidone and methylphenidate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Clozapine

Chronic administration of clozapine with risperidone may decrease the clearance of risperidone.

### Can authorities appreciably enhance the prescribing of oral generic risperidone to conserve resources? Findings from across Europe and their implications [^113fp6sC]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

We principally undertook a segmented regression analysis of retrospective time-series analysis to assess the effect of various initiatives in Belgium, Ireland, Scotland and Sweden following the introduction of generic risperidone. The xtmixed command in Stata (version 12) (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA) was used to fit a linear random coefficient model with country-specific intercepts. At the time of introduction of generic risperidone into each country, a random shift in intercepts and slopes was allowed to estimate the effect of the introduction. Data on the number of monthly reimbursed prescriptions within each country's health service for all patients prescribed at least one atypical antipsychotic drug (N05AH03 to 06, N05AL05, N05AX08, N05AX011 to 13) up to 20 months before and up to 20 months after the availability of generic risperidone was included. Clozapine was not included in the analysis as it is generally reserved for patients not responding to other atypical antipsychotic drugs because of its side-effect profile. Ziprasidone (N05AE04) was also not included. This was in view of its different classification and limited utilisation in practice in a number of European countries, including Sweden.

A retrospective observational study of the same population dispensed at least one atypical antipsychotic drug was also undertaken in Austria and one of the regions in Spain (Catalonia) from January 2005 (Austria) or January 2006 (Spain) to the end of 2010 (Austria) and September 2011 (Spain). This was because generic risperidone was already available in Austria and Spain in July 2004 and by January 2006 respectively, but only became available later in the four chosen European countries: Ireland in December 2007, Scotland in April 2008, and Belgium and Sweden in January 2009. A retrospective observational study was also undertaken in one English primary care organisation, Bury Primary Care Trust (PCT), between November 2009 and October 2011. The objective was to assess the influence of a request to psychiatrists to consider oral risperidone as first line treatment in new or other suitable patients, where appropriate, now it was available as a generic.

### Primary nonadherence to antipsychotic treatment among persons with schizophrenia [^114ogQkX]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Medium credibility.

The Difference in Primary Nonadherence between Different Antipsychotic Treatments

Table 3 represents the number of users and number of nondispensed prescriptions. There were 29,956 patients with schizophrenia using various antipsychotic medications in the total sample. Of all the explored drugs, we found the highest number of users for oral olanzapine (N = 9288) and clozapine (N = 8699), and the lowest for sulpiride (N = 303) and LAI perphenazine (N = 374). Of all antipsychotic prescriptions, 7.39% had not been dispensed. Regarding primary nonadherence to individual antipsychotic treatments, clozapine had a significantly lower number of nondispensed prescriptions (4.77%) than the second-lowest (LAI risperidone, 5.47%): χ 2 = 5.29, P -value = .02. The highest number of nondispensed prescriptions of all prescriptions were detected for oral haloperidol (17.03%), followed by oral quetiapine (11.39%).

Table 3.
Primary Nonadherence to Antipsychotic Prescriptions, as a Proportion of Nondispensed Prescriptions of all Prescriptions Issued in 2015–2016

As a group, oral antipsychotics measured a higher number of nondispensed prescriptions (10.26%, 95% CI = 10.02–10.49) compared to their LAI counterparts (7.27%, 95%CI = 6.85–7.71), χ 2 = 118.08, P -value < .0001. When we explored individual agents, lower number of nondispensed prescriptions for LAIs (vs. orals) were observed for haloperidol (χ 2 = 51.50, P -value < .0001), risperidone (χ 2 = 106.40, P -value < .0001) and zuclopenthixol (χ 2 = 15.78, P -value < .0001). No such differences were observed for aripiprazole (χ 2 = 0.30, P -value = .58), olanzapine (χ 2 = 0.04, P -value = .85) or perphenazine (χ 2 = 0.38, P -value = .54).

### Updated rationale for the initial antipsychotic selection for patients with schizophrenia [^111bqbQi]. Schizophrenia (2024). Medium credibility.

Perphenazine

Perphenazine is excluded from first-line treatment options due to recognized risk of tardive dyskinesia (TD) and other extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) associated with FGAs –. However, there is considerable variability in TD risk within FGA and second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) classes, a nuance frequently ignored by other algorithms. Perphenazine has one of the lowest known risks of TD among FGAs. It also may have a lower risk of TD relative to some SGAs (e.g. lurasidone). Perphenazine users have higher antiparkinsonian medication use than aripiprazole users, but similar to risperidone users; akathisia risk is also comparable between perphenazine and risperidone. Perphenazine trends toward less weight gain compared to aripiprazole and risperidone, and demonstrates significance versus olanzapine [12]. It is linked to lower prolactin elevation than risperidone. Finally, in CATIE, perphenazine outperformed olanzapine and risperidone in exploratory analysis of neurocognitive performance at 18 months but not in the primary outcome of neurocognitive scores at 2 months.

In the context of overall mortality, perphenazine outperformed risperidone in the 11-year follow-up study (as discussed in the section "Olanzapine"). In FIN-20, oral perphenazine trended toward lower risk of somatic hospitalization relative to risperidone.

There is paucity of studies on perphenazine in first-episode psychosis (see the "Summary" section). Aside from this limitation, we see no other compelling rationale to include risperidone in first-line treatment options while excluding perphenazine. This contrasts with other available algorithms.

Regarding the use of risperidone PO (also known as Risperdal) in patients with chronic liver disease, Child-Pugh A (mild):
- Use with caution.
- 1 mg/day in 1 or 2 divided doses; titrate cautiously based on tolerability and response in increments of no more than 0.5 mg twice daily and no more frequently than recommended for patients with normal liver function; doses > 1.5 mg twice daily should be titrated at intervals of ≥ 1 week.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^113QKVfc]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Risperidone adverse effects in dementia — dose-related parkinsonism and sedation — are reported with parkinsonism rates of 21%, 13%, and 7% in patients receiving 2 mg/day risperidone, 1 mg/day risperidone, and placebo, respectively; in another trial, parkinsonism incidence was 15% with risperidone at a mean endpoint dosage of 1.1 mg/day versus 11% with placebo, and in a third study parkinsonism was 2.3% with risperidone (mean dosage 0.95 mg/day) versus 16% with placebo; a meta-analysis found an overall odds ratio for extrapyramidal signs and symptoms of 1.80 (CI, 1.35–2.42) for risperidone versus placebo, and sedation affected 12% on risperidone versus 4.4% on placebo in one trial with the meta-analysis confirming increased sedation risk (odds ratio, 2.43; CI, 1.78–3.32); the meta-analysis also noted a higher rate of peripheral edema with risperidone, and risperidone may cause abnormal gait in some patients.

### Benefits and harms of risperidone and paliperidone for treatment of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: a meta-analysis involving individual participant data and clinical study reports [^111CoppZ]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Eligibility

We included randomised placebo-controlled trials involving patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

Interventions include Risperidone (brand name: Risperdal (oral) and Risperdal Consta (intravenously injected)), Paliperidone (brand name: Invega and Trevicta) or Paliperidone palmitate (brand name: Xeplion) with any form of application at any dose. As the included trials were placebo-controlled, the comparator was therefore a placebo pill or kit vials which contained microspheres with no active drug.

The primary outcome for efficacy includes the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score comprising the three subscales positive, negative and general psychopathology which are regarded as the 'gold standard' for assessment of psychotic behaviour disorders. We used a 30-point subtraction to calculate the PANSS total score which is important for interpreting the percentage change of improvement in the mental health state of the patients. Based on previous recommendations, we categorised the difference in PANSS from baseline using following improvement thresholds: 25% (minimal improvement), 50% (good clinical response) and 75%. Secondary outcomes for efficacy include the mean time after treatment until relapse, Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scale and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS).

For safety, primary outcomes include treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) following the Food and Drug Administration's definition (including life-threatening, hospitalisation, disability or permanent damage, congenital anomaly/birth defect, required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage or other serious important medical events), discontinuations due to AE, gynecomastia and drug-induced death. Secondary outcomes include cerebrovascular events, extrapyramidal disorder, weight increased, tardive dyskinesia and behaviour-related outcomes (i.e. aggression, irritability and intentional self-injury). These outcomes were informed by previous meta-analyses, patient and public involvement feedback and black box warnings.

### A randomized comparison of aripiprazole and risperidone for the acute treatment of first-episode schizophrenia and related disorders: 3-month outcomes [^115sLnnz]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2015). Low credibility.

Research findings are particularly important for medication choice for first-episode patients as individual prior medication response to guide treatment decisions is unavailable. We describe the first large-scale double-masked randomized comparison with first-episode patients of aripiprazole and risperidone, 2 commonly used first-episode treatment agents. One hundred ninety-eight participants aged 15–40 years with schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic disorder Not Otherwise Specified, and who had been treated in their lifetime with antipsychotics for 2 weeks or less were randomly assigned to double-masked aripiprazole (5–30 mg/d) or risperidone (1–6 mg/d) and followed for 12 weeks. Positive symptom response rates did not differ (62.8% vs 56.8%) nor did time to response. Aripiprazole-treated participants had better negative symptom outcomes but experienced more akathisia. Body mass index change did not differ between treatments but advantages were found for aripiprazole treatment for total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, and prolactin levels. Post hoc analyses suggested advantages for aripiprazole on depressed mood. Overall, if the potential for akathisia is a concern, low-dose risperidone as used in this trial maybe a preferred choice over aripiprazole. Otherwise, aripiprazole would be the preferred choice over risperidone in most situations based upon metabolic outcome advantages and some symptom advantages within the context of similar positive symptom response between medications.

### Risperidone (Risperdal) [^115djorr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A third trial was a 6-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a lower than recommended dose of risperidone in subjects (N = 96) 5 to 17 years of age with autistic disorder (defined by DSM-IV criteria) and associated irritability and related behavioral symptoms. Approximately 77% of patients were younger than 12 years of age (mean age = 9), and 88% were male. Most patients (73%) weighed less than 45 kg (mean weight = 40 kg). Approximately 90% of patients were antipsychotic-naïve before entering the study.

There were two weight-based, fixed doses of risperidone (high-dose and low-dose). The high dose was 1.25 mg per day for patients weighing 20 to < 45 kg, and it was 1.75 mg per day for patients weighing ≥ 45 kg. The low dose was 0.125 mg per day for patients weighing 20 to < 45 kg, and it was 0.175 mg per day for patients weighing ≥ 45 kg. The dose was administered once daily in the morning, or in the evening if sedation occurred.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in the Aberrant Behavior Checklist – Irritability subscale (ABC-I) score from baseline to the end of Week 6. The study demonstrated the efficacy of high-dose risperidone, as measured by the mean change in ABC-I score. It did not demonstrate efficacy for low-dose risperidone. The mean baseline ABC-I scores were 29 in the placebo group (n = 35), 27 in the risperidone low-dose group (n = 30), and 28 in the risperidone high-dose group (n = 31). The mean changes in ABC-I scores were -3.5, -7.4, and -12.4 in the placebo, low-dose, and high-dose group respectively. The results in the high-dose group were statistically significant (p < 0.001) but not in the low-dose group (p = 0.164).

### Risperidone long-acting injection: a prospective 3-year analysis of its use in clinical practice [^116urBHX]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate outcomes of clinical use of risperidone long-acting injection (RLAI) and determine factors predicting continuation with treatment.

Method

This prospective, 3-year follow-up of consecutive patients started on treatment with RLAI in normal clinical practice between August 2002 and September 2003 obtained demographic and clinical data from case notes, prescription charts, and hospital computer records. To determine predictors of continuation, a proportional hazards regression (Cox) model was constructed.

Results

The study included 211 evaluable patients. Over 3 years, 84% of subjects discontinued RLAI; 27.7% of these switched to oral risperidone. The Cox model showed that younger age (p = .001), longer duration of illness (p = .001), inpatient status at initiation (p = .002), and an RLAI dose of 25 mg/2 weeks (p < .001) predicted greater probability of discontinuation.

Conclusion

A small proportion of patients initiated on treatment with RLAI continued for 3 years. Outcome is likely to be improved by targeting RLAI treatment at specific patient groups and by using a dose of more than 25 mg/2 weeks.

### Treatment modifiers and predictors of risperidone response in dementia: an individual participant data meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials [^114LYtiZ]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sources and access

Data were obtained from the Yale Open Data Access (YODA) Project, an independent platform that enables secure and transparent sharing of clinical trial data. YODA was selected for its rigorous scientific review process and its provision of harmonized datasets suitable for secondary analyses. We searched this repository for studies involving individuals with dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). After identifying relevant trials, we reviewed the associated documentation to select datasets that met the following eligibility criteria: (1) adult participants diagnosed with dementia and exhibiting BPSD, (2) participants involved in double‐blind placebo‐controlled trials receiving risperidone treatment, and (3) IPD were available for the primary outcome. Once the potentially eligible studies were identified, we requested access to the participant‐level datasets through the standard procedure outlined on the website on May 1, 2024.

Background

Risperidone is one of the 'new generation' antipsychotics. As well as its reputed tendency to cause fewer movement disorders than the older drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, it is claimed that risperidone may improve negative symptoms.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of risperidone for schizophrenia in comparison to 'conventional' neuroleptic drugs.

Search Strategy

The original electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1980–1997), Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (1997), The Cochrane Library (1997, Issue 1), EMBASE (1980–1997), MEDLINE (1966–1997), PsycLIT (1974–1997), and SCISEARCH (1997) were updated with a new electronic search of the same databases in 2002. The search term used in the update was identical to that used in 1997. Any new studies or relevant references were added to the review. In addition, references of all identified studies were searched for further trial citations. Pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials were also contacted.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials comparing risperidone to any 'conventional' neuroleptic treatment for people with schizophrenia or other similar serious mental illnesses.

Data Collection and Analysis

Citations and, where possible, abstracts were independently inspected by reviewers, papers ordered, re-inspected and quality assessed. Data were also independently extracted. Where possible, sensitivity analyses on dose of risperidone, haloperidol and duration of illness were undertaken for the primary outcomes of clinical improvement, side effects (movement disorders) and acceptability of treatment. For homogeneous dichotomous data the Relative Risk (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis.

Main Results

In the short-term, risperidone was more likely to produce an improvement in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) when compared with haloperidol (n = 2368, 9 RCTs, RR not 20% improved 0.72 CI 0.59 to 0.88 NNT 8). A similar, favourable outcome for risperidone was found in long-term studies (n = 859, 2RCTs RR not 20% improved 0.51 CI 0.38 to 0.67 NNT 4; n = 675 1RCT, RR not improved 40% 0.75 CI 0.66 to 0.84 NNT 5; n = 675, 1 RCT, RR not 60% improved 0.90 CI 0.84 to 0.96, NNT 11). Risperidone was also more likely to reduce relapse at one year follow up, compared with haloperidol (n = 367, 1 RCT, RR 0.64 CI 0.41 to 0.99, NNT 7). Less people allocated risperidone left studies before completion, both for short-term (n = 3066, 16 RCTs, RR 0.76 CI 0.63 to 0.92, NNT 6) and long-term trials (n = 1270, 4RCTs, RR 0.55 CI 0.42 to 0.73 NNT 4). For general movement disorders results favoured risperidone. People given risperidone had significantly fewer general movement disorders (including extrapyramidal side effects) than those receiving older typical antipsychotics (n = 2702, 10 RCTs, RR 0.63 CI 0.56 to 0.71, NNT 3). Significantly fewer people given risperidone used antiparkinsonian drugs (n = 2524, 11 RCTs, RR 0.66 CI 0.58 to 0.74, NNT 4). As regards body weight, however, four studies (n = 1708) found people were more likely to gain weight if allocated risperidone compared to typical antipsychotics (RR 1.55 CI 1.25 to 1.93, NNH 3). Risperidone was no more or less likely than haloperidol to cause sexual problems such as erectile dysfunction (n = 106, 2 RCTs, RR 1.55 CI 0.58 to 4.20). Finally, some results found risperidone was more likely to cause rhinitis than conventional antipsychotics (n = 656, 3 RCTs, RR1.99 CI 1.24 to 3.19, NNH 3).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Risperidone may be more acceptable to those with schizophrenia than older antipsychotics and have marginal benefits in terms of limited clinical improvement. Its adverse effect profile may be better than haloperidol. With the addition of more studies to this review, the publication bias evident in previous versions is no longer a significant issue. Any marginal benefits this drug may have have to be balanced against its greater cost and increased tendency to cause side effects such as weight gain. Recent important longer term data favouring risperidone's effect on relapse needs to be replicated by researchers independently of the manufacturers of the drug.

### Atypical antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia: systematic review [^111BHrf8]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To review the role of oral atypical antipsychotic drugs in the management of the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD).

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Reference lists were reviewed and experts were contacted to identify additional trials.

Study Selection

Double blind randomised controlled trials that evaluated the four oral atypical antipsychotic therapies for BPSD.

Review Methods

Two reviewers assessed trial validity independently.

Data Extraction

Demographics of patients, study duration, dose of antipsychotic, primary end points, adverse events.

Results

77 abstracts were reviewed. Five randomised trials (1570 patients) evaluating risperidone and olanzapine were identified. The quality of trials was generally good. Most participants were in an institution (> 96%), elderly (weighted mean 82.3 years), and had Alzheimer's disease (76.3%). Trials lasted 6–12 weeks. Treatment with atypical antipsychotic drugs was superior to placebo for the primary end point in three of the five trials. Two trials comparing risperidone with haloperidol did not find any differences in the primary measures of efficacy. Adverse events were common and included extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, and abnormal gait.

Conclusions

Although atypical antipsychotic drugs are being used with increasing frequency, few randomised trials have evaluated their use for BPSD. Limited evidence supports the perception of improved efficacy and adverse event profiles compared with typical antipsychotic drugs.

### An open-label trial of risperidone augmentation for refractory anxiety disorders [^1174BPDN]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Background

There is a paucity of data to support "next-step" treatments for the many patients with anxiety disorders who remain symptomatic after initial pharmacotherapy.

Method

Thirty patients with a primary diagnosis of an anxiety disorder-panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)-refractory to initial pharmacotherapy with an adequate (or maximally tolerated) antidepressant and/or benzodiazepine trial of at least 8 weeks' duration prior to study initiation received open-label augmentation with flexibly dosed risperidone for 8 weeks. Participants were diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV.

Results

Risperidone augmentation at a mean ± SD dose of 1.12 ± 0.68 mg/day (range, 0.25–3.00 mg/day) resulted in a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms across disorders as measured by the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) scores and for each disorder-specific primary outcome measure-the Panic Disorder Severity Scale, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, and HAM-A-in the intent-to-treat sample. Seventy percent (21/30) of participants completed the 8-week trial, with premature discontinuation due primarily to sedation and weight gain.

Conclusions

Although conclusions are limited by the open-label, relatively brief nature of this trial, our data suggest that augmentation with low-dose risperidone may be a useful option for patients with PD, SAD, or GAD refractory to adequate initial intervention with antidepressants and/or benzodiazepines. Longer-term, controlled safety and efficacy data are needed to understand the place of risperidone augmentation in the algorithm of treatment options for refractory anxiety disorders.

### Treatment-resistant bipolar depression: a STEP-BD equipoise randomized effectiveness trial of antidepressant augmentation with lamotrigine, inositol, or risperidone [^111tojQh]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Clinicians have few evidence-based options for the management of treatment-resistant bipolar depression. This study represents the first randomized trial of competing options for treatment-resistant bipolar depression and assesses the effectiveness and safety of antidepressant augmentation with lamotrigine, inositol, and risperidone.

Method

Participants (N = 66) were patients with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder enrolled in the NIMH Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD). All patients were in a current major depressive episode that was nonresponsive to a combination of adequate doses of established mood stabilizers plus at least one antidepressant. Patients were randomly assigned to open-label adjunctive treatment with lamotrigine, inositol, or risperidone for up to 16 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the rate of recovery, defined as no more than two symptoms meeting DSM-IV threshold criteria for a mood episode and no significant symptoms present for 8 weeks.

Results

No significant between-group differences were seen when any pair of treatments were compared on the primary outcome measure. However, the recovery rate with lamotrigine was 23.8%, whereas the recovery rates with inositol and risperidone were 17.4% and 4.6%, respectively. Patients receiving lamotrigine had lower depression ratings and Clinical Global Impression severity scores as well as greater Global Assessment of Functioning scores compared with those receiving inositol and risperidone.

Conclusions

No differences were found in primary pairwise comparison analyses of open-label augmentation with lamotrigine, inositol, or risperidone. Post hoc secondary analyses suggest that lamotrigine may be superior to inositol and risperidone in improving treatment-resistant bipolar depression.

### Pharmacological treatment of primary negative symptoms in schizophrenia: a systematic review [^111QTkNB]. Schizophrenia Research (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal treatment of primary negative symptoms is important because their presence is associated with poor outcome.

Aims

To systematically review all studies dealing with the efficacy of pharmacological agents on primary negative symptoms.

Method

A comprehensive search of the relevant literature was undertaken using electronic database, reference lists and personal contact.

Results

There is a lack of standardized research designs. Amisulpride is the most extensively studied drug with respect to efficacy against primary negative symptoms. At low doses it demonstrates a consistent, modest effect compared to placebo, though not to conventional antipsychotics and has yet to be tested against other atypicals. Evidence from multiple studies that used simple statistical analyses and inclusion criteria for patients with primary negative symptoms does not support a direct effect for clozapine. Path-analysis studies support the direct effects of risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and aripiprazole, however, different statistical analyses of the same risperidone study produced conflicting results and the direct effects of olanzapine were not confirmed in selected patients with primary negative symptoms. There are no studies supporting the use of ziprasidone or quetiapine. The effects of typical antipsychotics on primary negative symptoms are inconclusive and likely to depend on drug dosages. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), mirtazepine and NMDA agonists show early promise but require further study. Novel agents such as selegiline, naltrexone, dehydroepiandrosterone, galantamine, Ginkgo, nitric oxide, L-deprenyl and pergolide show positive effects on general negative symptoms but remain untested against primary negative symptoms.

Conclusions

Further studies using standardized selective inclusion criteria and controlling for chronicity are needed. Research guidelines are discussed.

### Risperidone [^113Mk4Fy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults

The efficacy of risperidone in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes was established in two short-term (3-week) placebo-controlled trials in patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes. These trials included patients with or without psychotic features.

The primary rating instrument used for assessing manic symptoms in these trials was the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), an 11-item clinician-rated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of manic symptomatology (irritability, disruptive/aggressive behavior, sleep, elevated mood, speech, increased activity, sexual interest, language/thought disorder, thought content, appearance, and insight) in a range from 0 (no manic features) to 60 (maximum score). The primary outcome in these trials was change from baseline in the YMRS total score. The results of the trials follow:

(1) In one 3-week placebo-controlled trial (n = 246), limited to patients with manic episodes, which involved a dose range of risperidone 1–6 mg/day, once daily, starting at 3 mg/day (mean modal dose was 4.1 mg/day), risperidone was superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score.

(2) In another 3-week placebo-controlled trial (n = 286), which involved a dose range of 1–6 mg/day, once daily, starting at 3 mg/day (mean modal dose was 5.6 mg/day), risperidone was superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^111mtDvr]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Psilocybin evidence and limitations — depression and other indications are summarized as follows: Psilocybin did not significantly outperform escitalopram when assessed using the primary outcome for depression (QIDS), whereas secondary outcome assessments mostly favoured psilocybin over escitalopram, underscoring the importance of psychometrics and symptom characterisation. Beyond major depressive disorder (MDD), psilocybin has shown safety and potential utility in alcohol use disorder (AUD), tobacco use disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), migraine headaches, cluster headaches, bipolar depression, and anorexia nervosa; many studies are ongoing including investigations in comorbid MDD and AUD and work on dosing or psychotherapy protocols and co-administration with a serotonin 5HT2A receptor antagonist such as risperidone. Overall, evidence for therapeutic benefits suggests promise but key limitations include highly protocolised trials that may not generalise to non-research clinical settings, lack of diversity in which more than 80% of participants in psychedelic trials have been white individuals, and understudied mechanisms wherein pharmacology and psychotherapy are closely intertwined and not yet separable, with psychotherapeutic approaches plausibly contributing to observed efficacy.

### Risperidone maintenance treatment in schizophrenia: a randomized, controlled trial [^113KNWd8]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Prevention of relapse is the crucial task in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia. The investigators in this study sought to determine the duration of maintenance treatment needed with the initial therapeutic dose, in contrast to a reduced dose.

Method

In a multicenter open-label, randomized, controlled study, patients with schizophrenia who were clinically stabilized following an acute episode were randomly assigned to a no-dose-reduction group (initial optimal therapeutic dose continued throughout the study), a 4-week group (initial optimal therapeutic dose continued for 4 weeks, followed by a 50% dose reduction that was maintained until the end of the study), or a 26-week group (initial optimal therapeutic dose continued for 26 weeks, followed by a 50% dose reduction until the end of the study). All patients continued until the last recruited patient completed the 1-year follow-up.

Results

Of the 404 patients who met the entry criteria and were randomly assigned, 374 completed the study. The estimated mean time from entry to relapse was 571 days in the 4-week group, 615 days in the 26-week group, and 683 days in the no-dose-reduction group, with estimated relapse rates of 30.5%, 19.5%, and 9.4%, respectively. Patients in the no-dose-reduction group experienced greater reduction in the severity of psychotic symptoms.

Conclusions

Patients who continued to receive the full risperidone dose used for their acute episode had fewer relapses than those who had dose reductions after 4 weeks or 26 weeks during the maintenance period. There was negligible difference in side effects among the three groups.

### Risperidone (Risperdal) [^114jsdet]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of risperidone PO (also known as Risperdal):
- Aspiration pneumonia: use extreme caution in patients with advanced Alzheimer's dementia or with dysphagia or who are at risk for aspiration.
- Cardiovascular risk: use caution in patients with pre-existing conditions such as obesity, pre-diabetes, established diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemia.
- Cognitive difficulties, motor impairment: use caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.
- Fever, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, ALF: maintain a high level of suspicion, as risperidone has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.
- Hyperprolactinemia, weight gain: maintain a high level of suspicion as risperidone is associated with an increased risk of these adverse events.
- Hypothermia, hyperthermia: maintain a high level of suspicion as risperidone is associated with an increased risk of these adverse events.
- Increased blood eosinophil count, increased blood glucose, increased serum cholesterol: maintain a high level of suspicion, as risperidone has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.
- Neutropenia, agranulocytosis: use caution in patients with leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low WBC count (WBC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia.
- Orthostatic hypotension: use caution in patients with known CVD (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, HF, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension, e.g., dehydration and hypovolemia, and in the elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
- Priapism: use caution in all patients, especially those with a history of sexual complications.
- Seizure: use caution in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold.
- Tardive dyskinesia, falls: maintain a high level of suspicion, as risperidone has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.

### Risperidone versus olanzapine for schizophrenia [^115rZ3N7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Antipsychotic medication is a mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia. Risperidone and olanzapine are popular choices among the new generation drugs.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effects, safety and cost effectiveness of risperidone compared with olanzapine for treating schizophrenia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (Sept 2005) which is based on regular searches of, amongst others, BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were inspected for further trials. We also contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included all clinical randomised trials comparing risperidone with olanzapine for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).

Main Results

We found no difference for the outcome of unchanged or worse in the short term (n = 548, 2 RCTs, RR 1.00 CI 0.88 to 1.15). One study favoured olanzapine for the outcome of relapse/rehospitalisation by 12 months (n = 279, 1 RCT, RR 2.16 CI 1.31 to 3.54, NNH 7 CI 3 to 25). Most mental state data showed the two drugs to be as effective as each other (n = 552, 2 RCTs, RR 'no < 20% decrease PANSS by eight weeks' 1.01 CI 0.87 to 1.16). Both drugs commonly cause adverse events: 75% given either drug experience an adverse event; 20% anticholinergic symptoms; both groups experienced insomnia although it was more frequent with risperidone (n = 1588, 5 RCTs, RR 1.41 CI 1.15 to 1.72, NNH 15 CI 9 to 41); about 30% experienced sleepiness (n = 1713, 6 RCTs, RR 0.92 CI 0.79 to 1.07). People given either drug often experienced some extrapyramidal symptoms (n = 893, 3 RCTs, RR 1.18 CI 0.75 to 1.88); 25% of people using risperidone required medication to alleviate these symptoms (n = 419, 2 RCTs, RR 1.76 CI 1.25 to 2.48, NNH 8 CI 4 to 25). People allocated to risperidone were less likely to gain weight compared with those given olanzapine and the weight gain was often considerable and of quick onset (n = 984, 2 RCTs, RR gain more than 7% of their baseline weight in short term 0.47 CI 0.36 to 0.61, NNH 7 CI 6 to 10). Risperidone participants were less likely to leave the study due to metabolic side effects and weight gain compared with olanzapine (n = 667, 1RCT, RR 0.19 CI 0.08 to 0.45). Patients on risperidone were more likely to experience abnormal ejaculation (n = 370, 2 RCTs, RR 4.36 CI 1.38 to 13.76, NNH 20 CI 6 to 176). Both drugs are associated with high attrition rates; in the long term consistent findings show that 66% of those allocated risperidone left the study early compared with 56% given olanzapine (n = 1440, 5 RCTs, RR 1.17 CI 1.08 to 1.27, NNH 11 CI 7 to 23).

Authors' Conclusions

We know very little of the effects of these drugs regarding service outcomes, general functioning and behaviours, engagement with services and treatment satisfaction from evaluative studies. There was generally a high rate of attrition in the trials and there appears to be little to differentiate between risperidone and olanzapine except on issues of adverse effects. Both drugs are associated with a reduction in psychotic symptoms but both commonly cause unpleasant adverse effects.

### The heterogeneity of antipsychotic response in the treatment of schizophrenia [^116BxjS4]. Psychological Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Method

Study design

Data for this study were obtained from a randomized, double-blind, parallel, 12-week study (Kinon et al.) consisting of 628 patients (aged 18–65 years) meeting the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder or schizophreniform disorder according to DSM-IV. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and all applicable regulatory requirements. This study was conducted at 64 study centers in three countries from May 2006 to December 2007. Eligible patients provided written informed consent before undergoing any study procedure or receiving any study treatment.

Details of the study design consisting of three study periods and inclusion/exclusion criteria can be found in the primary manuscript of this clinical trial (Kinon et al.). Study period I consisted of screening of patients. Study period II consisted of patients receiving 2 weeks of open-label treatment with risperidone 2 to 6 mg/day and, at the end of 2 weeks, patients were classified as early responders (ER) or early non-responders (ENR) based on a-priori criteria of 20% improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; Kay et al.) total scores. Details regarding the 20% improvement criteria for the PANSS scores are given in the primary manuscript (Kinon et al.). After early study discontinuation, 83% of patients (522/628) entered study period III double-blinded (post-baseline data were not available for one patient). Early responders (⩾20% improvement in PANSS total score at week 2) to risperidone treatment continued the same treatment for another 10 weeks. Early non-responders (< 20% improvement in PANSS total score at week 2) to risperidone treatment were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either risperidone 2–6 mg/day or olanzapine 10 to 20 mg/day for another 10 weeks of treatment (see Supplementary Fig. 1. available online).

For the current analysis, the hypothesis is that longitudinal response profiles may exist that can better characterize response to treatment compared to cross-sectional dichotomization of response/non-response based on a-priori degree of categorical symptom improvement after a specified duration of treatment. Therefore, the analysis was conducted using pooled treatment groups of risperidone and olanzapine.

### Long-acting injectable risperidone [^115dfgjn]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety profile of long-acting (LA) risperidone for the treatment of schizophrenia.

Data Sources

Information was selected from PubMed (1965-July 2004). Applicable scientific posters were also used.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All published information on risperidone LA was considered. Material providing a comprehensive description was considered.

Data Synthesis

Risperidone LA is the first long-acting, injectable atypical antipsychotic. It is dosed at 25–50 mg every 2 weeks. Adverse effects are similar to those seen with oral risperidone. A short-term study showed that risperidone LA is better than placebo in reducing the signs and symptoms of schizophrenia, and a long-term trial showed that stable schizophrenic patients can be switched from either oral or other injectable antipsychotic medications to risperidone LA.

Conclusions

Risperidone LA is efficacious and safe in the treatment of schizophrenia.

### Risperidone (depot) for schizophrenia [^111dC77T]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Risperidone is the first new generation antipsychotic drug made available in a long-acting injection formulation.

Objectives

To examine the effects of depot risperidone for treatment of schizophrenia or related psychoses in comparison with placebo, no treatment or other antipsychotic medication. To critically appraise and summarise current evidence on the resource use, cost and cost-effectiveness of risperidone (depot) for schizophrenia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (December 2002, 2012, and October 28, 2015). We also checked the references of all included studies, and contacted industry and authors of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing depot risperidone with other treatments for people with schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR), with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE.

Main Results

Twelve studies, with a total of 5723 participants were randomised to the following comparison treatments: Risperidone depot versus placebo Outcomes of relapse and improvement in mental state were neither measured or reported. In terms of other primary outcomes, more people receiving placebo left the study early by 12 weeks (1 RCT, n = 400, RR 0.74 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, very low quality evidence), experienced severe adverse events in short term (1 RCT, n = 400, RR 0.59 95% CI 0.38 to 0.93, very low quality evidence). There was however, no difference in levels of weight gain between groups (1 RCT, n = 400, RR 2.11 95% CI 0.48 to 9.18, very low quality evidence). Risperidone depot versus general oral antipsychotics The outcome of improvement in mental state was not presented due to high levels of attrition, nor were levels of severe adverse events explicitly reported. Most primary outcomes of interest showed no difference between treatment groups. However, more people receiving depot risperidone experienced nervous system disorders (long-term:1 RCT, n = 369, RR 1.34 95% CI 1.13 to 1.58, very-low quality evidence). Risperidone depot versus oral risperidoneData for relapse and severe adverse events were not reported. All outcomes of interest were rated as moderate quality evidence. Main results showed no differences between treatment groups with equivocal data for change in mental state, numbers leaving the study early, any extrapyramidal symptoms, weight increase and prolactin-related adverse events. Risperidone depot versus oral quetiapine Relapse rates and improvement in mental state were not reported. Fewer people receiving risperidone depot left the study early (long-term: 1 RCT, n = 666, RR 0.84 95% CI 0.74 to 0.95, moderate quality evidence). Experience of serious adverse events was similar between groups (low quality evidence), but more people receiving depot risperidone experienced EPS (1 RCT, n = 666, RR 1.83 95% CI 1.07 to 3.15, low quality evidence), had greater weight gain (1 RCT, n = 666, RR 1.25 95% CI 0.25 to 2.25, low quality evidence) and more prolactin-related adverse events (1 RCT, n = 666, RR 3.07 95% CI 1.13 to 8.36, very low quality evidence). Risperidone depot versus oral aripiprazoleRelapse rates, mental state using PANSS, leaving the study early, serious adverse events and weight increase were similar between groups. However more people receiving depot risperidone experienced prolactin-related adverse events compared to those receiving oral aripiprazole (2 RCTs, n = 729, RR 9.91 95% CI 2.78 to 35.29, very low quality of evidence). Risperidone depot versus oral olanzapineRelapse rates were not reported in any of the included studies for this comparison. Improvement in mental state using PANSS and instances of severe adverse events were similar between groups. More people receiving depot risperidone left the study early than those receiving oral olanzapine (1 RCT, n = 618, RR 1.32 95% CI 1.10 to 1.58, low quality evidence) with those receiving risperidone depot also experiencing more extrapyramidal symptoms (1 RCT, n = 547, RR 1.67 95% CI 1.19 to 2.36, low quality evidence). However, more people receiving oral olanzapine experienced weight increase (1 RCT, n = 547, RR 0.56 95% CI 0.42 to 0.75, low quality evidence). Risperidone depot versus atypical depot antipsychotics (specifically paliperidone palmitate)Relapse rates were not reported and rates of response using PANSS, weight increase, prolactin-related adverse events and glucose-related adverse events were similar between groups. Fewer people left the study early due to lack of efficacy from the risperidone depot group (long term: 1 RCT, n = 749, RR 0.60 95% CI 0.45 to 0.81, low quality evidence), but more people receiving depot risperidone required use of EPS-medication (2 RCTs, n = 1666, RR 1.46 95% CI 1.18 to 1.8, moderate quality evidence). Risperidone depot versus typical depot antipsychoticsOutcomes of relapse, severe adverse events or movement disorders were not reported. Outcomes relating to improvement in mental state demonstrated no difference between groups (low quality evidence). However, more people receiving depot risperidone compared to other typical depots left the study early (long-term:1 RCT, n = 62, RR 3.05 95% CI 1.12 to 8.31, low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Depot risperidone may be more acceptable than placebo injection but it is hard to know if it is any more effective in controlling the symptoms of schizophrenia. The active drug, especially higher doses, may be associated with more movement disorders than placebo. People already stabilised on oral risperidone may continue to maintain benefit if treated with depot risperidone and avoid the need to take tablets, at least in the short term. In people who are happy to take oral medication the depot risperidone is approximately equal to oral risperidone. It is possible that the depot formulation, however, can bring a second-generation antipsychotic to people who do not reliably adhere to treatment. People with schizophrenia who have difficulty adhering to treatment, however, are unlikely to volunteer for a clinical trial. Such people may gain benefit from the depot risperidone with no increased risk of extrapyramidal side effects.

### Aripiprazole versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia [^116ZRzSk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In most western industrialised countries, second generation (atypical) antipsychotics are recommended as first line drug treatments for people with schizophrenia. In this review we specifically examine how the efficacy and tolerability of one such agent - aripiprazole - differs from that of other comparable second generation antipsychotics.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of aripiprazole compared with other atypical antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (November 2011), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials, and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, drug approval agencies and authors of trials for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing aripiprazole (oral) with oral and parenteral forms of amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone or zotepine for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis based on a random-effects model. Where possible, we calculated illustrative comparative risks for primary outcomes. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias for each included study.

Main Results

We included 12 trials involving 6389 patients. Aripiprazole was compared to olanzapine, risperidone and ziprasidone. All trials were sponsored by an interested drug manufacturer. The overall number of participants leaving studies early was 30% to 40%, limiting validity (no differences between groups). When compared with olanzapine no differences were apparent for global state (no clinically important change: n = 703, 1 RCT, RR short-term 1.00 95% CI 0.81 to 1.22; n = 317, 1 RCT, RR medium-term 1.08 95% CI 0.95 to 1.22) but mental state tended to favour olanzapine (n = 1360, 3 RCTs, MD total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 4.68 95% CI 2.21 to 7.16). There was no significant difference in extrapyramidal symptoms (n = 529, 2 RCTs, RR 0.99 95% CI 0.62 to 1.59) but fewer in the aripiprazole group had increased cholesterol levels (n = 223, 1 RCT, RR 0.32 95% CI 0.19 to 0.54) or weight gain of 7% or more of total body weight (n = 1095, 3 RCTs, RR 0.39 95% CI 0.28 to 0.54). When compared with risperidone, aripiprazole showed no advantage in terms of global state (n = 384, 2 RCTs, RR no important improvement 1.14 95% CI 0.81 to 1.60) or mental state (n = 372, 2 RCTs, MD total PANSS 1.50 95% CI -2.96 to 5.96). One study compared aripiprazole with ziprasidone (n = 247) and both the groups reported similar change in the global state (n = 247, 1 RCT, MD average change in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score -0.03 95% CI -0.28 to 0.22) and mental state (n = 247, 1 RCT, MD change PANSS -3.00 95% CI -7.29 to 1.29). When compared with any one of several new generation antipsychotic drugs the aripiprazole group showed improvement in global state in energy (n = 523, 1 RCT, RR 0.69 95% CI 0.56 to 0.84), mood (n = 523, 1 RCT, RR 0.77 95% CI 0.65 to 0.92), negative symptoms (n = 523, 1 RCT, RR 0.82 95% CI 0.68 to 0.99), somnolence (n = 523, 1 RCT, RR 0.80 95% CI 0.69 to 0.93) and weight gain (n = 523, 1 RCT, RR 0.84 95% CI 0.76 to 0.94). Significantly more people given aripiprazole reported symptoms of nausea (n = 2881, 3 RCTs, RR 3.13 95% CI 2.12 to 4.61) but weight gain (7% or more of total body weight) was less common in people allocated aripiprazole (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 0.35 95% CI 0.19 to 0.64). Aripiprazole may have value in aggression but data are limited. This will be the focus of another review.

Authors' Conclusions

Information on all comparisons are of limited quality, are incomplete and problematic to apply clinically. Aripiprazole is an antipsychotic drug with a variant but not absent adverse effect profile. Long-term data are sparse and there is considerable scope for another update of this review as new data emerges from the many Chinese studies as well as from ongoing larger, independent pragmatic trials.

### Antipsychotic dose, dopamine D2 receptor occupancy and extrapyramidal side-effects: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^115VTViN]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods and materials

We followed the PRISMA statement (eAppendix 1), pre-registered the protocol (PROSPERO-ID: data extraction for this analysis had started before submission of the protocol), and noted any deviations (eAppendix 2).

Eligibility criteria

Participants

We included adults with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, i.e. schizophrenia, schizoaffective and schizophreniform disorder, without other restrictions in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, setting, previous response to treatment and diagnostic criteria. We analysed separately studies focusing on predominant negative symptoms, first-episode, and elderly, given that these patients may require lower doses and could be more vulnerable to side-effects. We excluded studies on stable patients (relapse prevention studies) due to methodological and clinical heterogeneity, e.g. pre-exposure to antipsychotics in the stabilization phase.

Interventions

We included studies evaluating monotherapy with 16 second-generation antipsychotics, i.e. amisulpride, aripiprazole, asenapine, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, clozapine, iloperidone, lumateperone, lurasidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, paliperidone, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone, and zotepine, the first-generation antipsychotic haloperidol (commonly used as an active comparator), and placebo. Studies allocating participants to fixed-dosing schedules or narrow fixed dose ranges were eligible, and flexible-dosing schedules were excluded. There was no restriction in terms of formulations (e.g. oral, long-acting intramuscular injection, transdermal, and immediate- and extending-release). Different formulations were combined in the primary analysis by converting doses to daily oral equivalents similar to our previous analysis. Nevertheless, they were also analysed separately in a sensitivity analysis.

Study design

We included open and blinded randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) with a minimum study duration of 3 weeks comparing fixed-doses of the above-mentioned antipsychotics or placebo in people with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, we excluded studies that investigated only head-to-head comparisons between two different antipsychotics, as well as relapse-prevention studies. We also excluded studies with a high risk of bias in terms of randomization. In case of crossover trials, we used the first phase in order to avoid carry-over effects. Cluster-randomized trials were excluded because of unit-of-analysis problems.

### Risperidone dose for schizophrenia [^115hrA5n]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Risperidone is a widely used antipsychotic drug for people with schizophrenia. It is important to get a balance between gaining the most positive effects for the least negative outcomes. The optimal dose of risperidone is the focus of this review.

Objectives

To determine risperidone dose response relationships for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Trials Register (July 2008) for all relevant references.

Selection Criteria

All relevant randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved disagreement by discussion with a third member of the team. When insufficient data were provided, we contacted the study authors. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated fixed-effect relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (MD).

Main Results

A consistent finding when risperidone ultra low doses (< 2 mg/day) were compared with other doses (short-term data) was that more people left early because of insufficient response (n = 456, 1 RCT, RR when compared with standard-low (≥ = 4- < 6 mg/day) 12.48 CI 1.43 to 4.30). The insufficient response for this low dose is reflected in measures of mental state. When low doses (≥ = 2- < 4 mg/day) are used and compared with standard-higher doses (≥ = 6- < 10 mg/day) and the high dose range (≥ = 10 mg/day), more people left early because of insufficient response (≥ = 4- < 6 mg/day: n = 173, 2 RCTs, RR 4.05 CI 1.09 to 15.07; ≥ = 10 mg/day: n = 173, 2 RCTs, RR 1.92 CI 1.36 to 2.70). For the outcome of 'no clinically important improvement' results favour standard-higher doses (n = 272, 2 RCTs, RR 2.26 CI 0.81 to 6.34). When low doses are compared with other higher doses, we found no differences in terms of cardiovascular, CNS, endocrine or gastrointestinal adverse effects. Unspecified EPS were more frequent with the higher doses (≥ = 10 mg: n = 262, 2 RCTs, RR 0.45 CI 0.24 to 0.84). One trial did find that endpoint scores on PANSS significantly favoured a low dose when compared with ≥ = 4–6 mg/day (n = 124, 1 RCT, MD -12.40 CI -17.01 to -7.79). When ≥ = 4- < 6 mg/day is compared with high doses, less people left early (n = 677, 1 RCT, RR leaving any reason 0.74 CI 0.54 to 1.00; n = 677, 1 RCT, RR due to adverse effects 0.56 CI 0.32 to 0.97). ≥ = 4- < 6 mg/day was no worse than ≥ = 6- < 10 mg/day for 'no clinically important improvement' (n = 39, 1 RCT, RR on CGI-I 0.79 CI 0.29 to 2.17). People allocated ≥ = 4- < 6 mg/day had more movement disorders than those on a low dose (n = 124 1 RCT, RR 2.28 CI 1.67 to 3.11). When ≥ = 6- < 10 mg/day is compared with standard-lower doses and a high dose range, there is no significant difference in terms of proportions leaving early. ≥ = 6- < 10 mg/day is better than a low dose for 'no clinical important improvement' (n = 172, 2 RCTs, RR 0.76 CI 0.61 to 0.94). Overall ≥ = 6- < 10 mg/day caused less problems especially in EPS when compared with ≥ = 10mg/day (n = 261, 2 RCTs, RR unspecified EPS 0.56 CI 0.31 to 0.99). When a high dose was compared with a low dose less people left early (n = 70, 1 RCT, RR 0.43 CI 0.26 to 0.71) but not when compared with a standard-lower dose (n = 677, 1 RCT, RR leaving due to adverse event 1.78 CI 1.03 to 3.09). ≥ = 10 mg/day was better than a low dose in terms of 'no clinical important improvement' (n = 257, 2 RCTs, RR 0.64 CI 0.50 to 0.82), but worse than a standard-higher dose (≥ = 6- < 10 mg/day: n = 255, 2 RCTs, RR 1.22 CI 1.00 to 1.51). ≥ = 10 mg/day caused more unspecified EPS adverse effects and any drug for adverse events when compared with a standard-higher dose and with a low dose.

Authors' Conclusions

There is still lack of strong evidence for an optimal dose for clinical practice. The quality of trials suggests that an over estimate of effect is likely and we think this is most probably for the mid-range doses. One such dose (standard-lower dose range, 4- < 6 mg/day) does seem optimal for clinical response and adverse effects. Weak evidence suggests that low doses (≥ = 2- < 4 mg/day) may be of value for people in their first episode of illness. High doses (≥ = 10 mg/day) did not confer any advantage over any other dose ranges and caused more adverse effects, especially for movement disorders. Ultra low dose (< 2 mg/day) seemed useless. We advise the use of dosages from low dose to standard-lower dose for different kinds of individual patients. Future trials should focus on specific populations, e.g. those in their first episode, with acute exacerbation, in relapse or refractory to treatment, and should also test the optimal dose of risperidone over a longer period of time and in the community.

### Risperidone versus haloperidol in psychotic patients with disturbing neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms: a double-blind, multi-center trial [^112dXtY4]. Schizophrenia Research (2000). Low credibility.

Background

A randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial was started to compare the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) during risperidone and haloperidol treatment in schizophrenic patients who had disturbing EPS during their previous neuroleptic treatment. Additional objectives of this trial were comparing the antipsychotic effectiveness of the two treatments and the use of antiparkinsonian medication.

Methods

Effects of flexible doses of risperidone and haloperidol were compared in 77 psychotic patients (83% with chronic schizophrenia) with disturbing neuroleptic-induced EPS (risperidone 40 patients, haloperidol 37). The trial was completed by 47 patients: 25 in the risperidone group (12 women, 13 men), and 22 in the haloperidol group (10 women, 12 men).

Results

An adequate antipsychotic effect was obtained in most patients by both treatments. The primary aim of this trial was comparing parkinsonism measured with the extrapyramidal syndrome rating scale (ESRS) during treatment with risperidone and haloperidol. Two primary parameters were selected: the change from baseline to the worst score during treatment of ESRS II (parkinsonism) and ESRS VI (clinical global impression of severity of parkinsonism). The CGI of severity of parkinsonism was better with risperidone (P = 0.025), while the parkinsonism total score tended to be better with risperidone (P < 0. 10). Before the double-blind treatment, 34 (of the 77) had used antiparkinson medication (risperidone 18, haloperidol 16). During the double-blind treatment phase, 21 patients had used antiparkinson medication (risperidone 11, haloperidol 10). The larger reduction of parkinsonism in the risperidone group was not due to a difference in the use of anti-parkinsonian medication.

Conclusions

In this group of schizophrenic patients with disturbing EPS during previous neuroleptic treatment, a stronger reduction of parkinsonism was observed with risperidone than with haloperidol.

### Risperidone (Perseris) [^117SyyjM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of risperidone ER SC (also known as Uzedy, Perseris) in pregnant patients for second trimester: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. When considering the use of risperidone during pregnancy, the possibility of risperidone-related adverse outcomes in the fetus or neonate should be weighed against the risks of an untreated maternal psychiatric condition, which may include hospitalization, relapse, suicide, and increased adverse perinatal outcomes (e.g., pre-term birth). Drug-induced hyperprolactinemia may impair reproductive function in both male and female patients. Hyperprolactinemia causes a reduction in the pituitary secretion of gonadotropin which, in turn, impairs gonadal steroidogenesis. The drug risperidone ER SC (also known as Uzedy, Perseris) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Risperidone [^111hXVYu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatrics

The efficacy of risperidone in the treatment of mania in children or adolescents with Bipolar I disorder was demonstrated in a 3-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial including patients ranging in ages from 10 to 17 years who were experiencing a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder. Patients were randomized into one of three treatment groups: risperidone 0.5–2.5 mg/day (n = 50, mean modal dose = 1.9 mg), risperidone 3–6 mg/day (n = 61, mean modal dose = 4.7 mg), or placebo (n = 58). In all cases, study medication was initiated at 0.5 mg/day and titrated to the target dosage range by Day 7, with further increases in dosage to the maximum tolerated dose within the targeted dose range by Day 10. The primary rating instrument used for assessing efficacy in this study was the mean change from baseline in the total YMRS score.

Results of this study demonstrated efficacy of risperidone in both dose groups compared with placebo, as measured by significant reduction of total YMRS score. The efficacy on the primary parameter in the 3–6 mg/day dose group was comparable to the 0.5–2.5 mg/day dose group. Doses higher than 2.5 mg/day did not reveal any trend towards greater efficacy.

### Benefits and harms of risperidone and paliperidone for treatment of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: a meta-analysis involving individual participant data and clinical study reports [^113jo2fa]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 1288 references were retrieved. Following full-text screening of 204 studies, 57 RCTs met our inclusion criteria and IPD/CSRs were accessible for 35 (61%) studies involving 12,316 patients (Fig. 1). The characteristics of the 35 studies are provided in Additional file 3: Table S3. The remaining 22 studies were excluded due to their low quality, differences in primary outcome selection with only a single subscale being used to measure PANSS and a general poor reporting of harms meaning data could not be include in the meta-analysis.

Asterisk indicates; phi symbol; beta symbol; and Yen symbol

Characteristics of included studies

Twenty-five studies (71%) were carried out in America and seven (20%) in Europe. The median number of patients across the studies was 323 (IQR, 263). The median age across studies was 39 (IQR, 4) years, and only three studies (9%) involved children or adolescents under the age of 19 years. Twenty-eight of the studies (80%) involved more male patients than female.

Twenty-five (71%) of the studies involved patients with schizophrenia, and 10 (29%) involved patients with bipolar disorder. Paliperidone was administered in sixteen (46%) of the studies comprising 4920 participants, eleven studies (31%; 3697 participants) used Risperidone (six involving oral administered Risperidone and five intravenous administration of Risperidone Consta) and eight studies (23%; 3699 participants) used Paliperidone palmitate. Oral and intravenously administered Risperidone were combined into one analysis due to the limited number of studies available in the IPD meta-analysis. The median length of the intervention was 63 (IQR, 53) days. The doses used for oral administration of Risperidone and Paliperidone ranged from 1 to 75 mg and for long-acting injectable Paliperidone palmitate, 25 to 150 mg.

### Paliperidone overdose with delayed onset of toxicity [^111y9FFU]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Paliperidone, or 9-hydroxy risperidone, is the newest atypical antipsychotic agent to be approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration. Despite being the primary active metabolite of risperidone, paliperidone differs in several ways from risperidone. The most notable difference is that paliperidone is formulated as an extended-release product. We present a case of a 14-year-old, 59-kg girl with a history of psychosis and major depressive disorder who developed toxicity after an ingestion of 180 mg (3.1 mg/kg) of paliperidone. This case is not only one of the first cases of paliperidone overdose described in the literature but also is unique in that it describes delayed onset of toxicity, as well as extended duration of symptoms.

### Treatment modifiers and predictors of risperidone response in dementia: an individual participant data meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials [^1157JAFB]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

4.4 Future research and implications

This study adds to existing evidence supporting the effectiveness of risperidone in managing psychosis, aggression, and possibly anxiety in people with dementia. Nonetheless, developing a data‐driven prediction model to identify patients most likely to benefit or experience harm could substantially improve clinical decision making, support personalized BPSD management, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes. Previous research has demonstrated that well‐designed prediction models of antipsychotic use in people with schizophrenia can assist clinicians in personalizing treatment, optimizing therapeutic effectiveness, and reducing the likelihood of adverse effects. In addition, subgroups that may influence treatment response — possibly due to risperidone's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics — were identified, and these hypotheses should be tested to enable clinically meaningful interpretation. Finally, early response at week 2 was strongly associated with achieving response at weeks 4 and 8, suggesting that early treatment evaluation could help guide more informed clinical decisions.

### Optimal doses of specific antipsychotics for relapse prevention in a nationwide cohort of patients with schizophrenia [^11686DjW]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Medium credibility.

The sensitivity analyses stratified based on age, schizoaffective diagnosis, and first-episode status confirmed the results of primary analysis. The results on high-dose perphenazine and risperidone were even more extreme in the first-episode cohort which is in line with guideline recommendations that first-episode patients need lower doses. Certain risperidone and perphenazine doses below 0.9 DDD/day were associated with 21%–45% lower risk of re-hospitalization (P < .001) than the standard dose of 0.9–1.1 DDD/day. When the first 30 days were omitted from the beginning of all antipsychotic use and nonuse periods, these results remained the same (23%–45% difference), indicating that recent dose increase to standard dose due to putative worsening of the symptoms does not explain the findings. Additional head-to-head analyses comparing doses of each antipsychotic with its own standard dose as reference (including only those patients who had used standard dose), as well as head-to-head comparison with high-dose olanzapine as reference (including only those patients who had used high-dose olanzapine) were well in line with the primary analysis, indicating the robustness of the findings.

### Risperidone for psychosis-induced aggression or agitation (rapid tranquillisation) [^117G6yux]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Aggressive, agitated or violent behaviour due to psychosis constitutes an emergency psychiatric treatment where fast-acting interventions are required. Risperidone is a widely accessible antipsychotic that can be used to manage psychosis-induced aggression or agitation.

Objectives

To examine whether oral risperidone alone is an effective treatment for psychosis-induced aggression or agitation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials (up to April 2017); this register is compiled by systematic searches of major resources (including AMED, BIOSIS CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates, handsearches, grey literature, and conference proceedings. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records into the register.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid use of risperidone and other drugs, combinations of drugs or placebo for people exhibiting aggression or agitation (or both) thought to be due to psychosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently inspected all citations from searches, identified relevant abstracts, and independently extracted data from all included studies. For binary data we calculated risk ratio (RR) and for continuous data we calculated mean difference (MD), all with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and used a fixed-effect model. We assessed risk of bias for the included studies and used the GRADE approach to produce a 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

The review now contains data from nine trials (total n = 582) reporting on five comparisons. Due to risk of bias, small size of trials, indirectness of outcome measures and a paucity of investigated and reported 'pragmatic' outcomes, evidence was graded as very-low quality. None of the included studies provided useable data on our primary outcome 'tranquillisation or asleep' by 30 minutes, repeated need for tranquillisation or any economic outcomes. Data were available for our other main outcomes of agitation or aggression, needing restraint, and incidence of adverse effects. Risperidone versus haloperidol (up to 24 hours follow-up)For the outcome, specific behaviour - agitation, no clear difference was found between risperidone and haloperidol in terms of efficacy, measured as at least 50% reduction in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - Psychotic Agitation Sub-score (PANSS-PAS) (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.26; participants = 124; studies = 1; very low-quality evidence) and no effect was observed for need to use restraints (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.43 to 9.21; participants = 28; studies = 1; very low-quality evidence). Incidence of adverse effects was similar between treatment groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.66; participants = 124; studies = 1; very low-quality evidence). Risperidone versus olanzapineOne small trial (n = 29) reported useable data for the comparison risperidone versus olanzapine. No effect was observed for agitation measured as PANSS-PAS endpoint score at two hours (MD 2.50, 95% CI -2.46 to 7.46; very low-quality evidence); need to use restraints at four days (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.39 to 5.28; very-low quality evidence); specific movement disorders measured as Behavioural Activity Rating Scale (BARS) endpoint score at four days (MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.83; very low-quality evidence). Risperidone versus quetiapineOne trial reported (n = 40) useable data for the comparison risperidone versus quetiapine. Aggression was measured using the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) endpoint score at two weeks. A clear difference, favouring quetiapine was observed (MD 1.80, 95% CI 0.20 to 3.40; very-low quality evidence). No evidence of a difference between treatment groups could be observed for incidence of akathisia after 24 hours (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 6.06; very low-quality evidence). Two participants allocated to risperidone and one allocated to quetiapine experienced myocardial ischaemia during the trial. Risperidone versus risperidone + oxcarbazepineOne trial (n = 68) measured agitation using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - Excited Component.(PANSS-EC) endpoint score and found a clear difference, favouring the combination treatment at one week (MD 2.70, 95% CI 0.42 to 4.98; very low-quality evidence), but no effect was observed for global state using Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) endpoint score at one week (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.21; very-low quality evidence). Incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms after 24 hours was similar between treatment groups (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.49 to 5.14; very-low quality evidence). Risperidone versus risperidone + valproic acidTwo trials compared risperidone with a combination of risperidone plus valproic acid. No clear differences between the treatment groups were observed for aggression (MOAS endpoint score at three days: MD 1.07, 95% CI -0.20 to 2.34; participants = 54; studies = 1; very low-quality evidence) or incidence of akathisia after 24 hours: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.03; participants = 122; studies = 2; very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, results for the main outcomes show no real effect for risperidone. The only data available for use in this review are from nine under-sampled trials and the evidence available is of very low quality. This casts uncertainty on the role of risperidone in rapid tranquillisation for people with psychosis-induced aggression. High-quality pragmatic RCTs are feasible and are needed before clear recommendations can be drawn on the use of risperidone for psychosis-induced aggression or agitation.

### Risperidone versus olanzapine for schizophrenia [^112Lk9nj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Antipsychotic medication is a mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia and risperidone and olanzapine are the most popular treatment choice of the new generation drugs.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effects, safety and cost effectiveness of risperidone compared with olanzapine for treating schizophrenia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (June 2004) which is based on regular searches of, amongst others, BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were inspected for further trials. We also contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included all clinical randomised trials comparing risperidone with olanzapine for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).

Main Results

We found no difference for the outcome of unchanged or worse in the short term (n = 548, 2 RCTs, RR 1.00 CI 0.88 to 1.15). One study, sponsored by the manufactures of olanzapine, favoured this drug for the outcome of relapse/rehospitalisation by 12 months (n = 279, RR 2.16 CI 1.31 to 3.54, NNT 7 CI 4 to 25). Most mental state data showed the two drugs to as effective as each other (n = 552, 2 RCTs, RR 'no < 20% decrease PANSS by eight weeks' 1.01 CI 0.87 to 1.16). At least two thirds of people given risperidone or olanzapine experienced an adverse event (n = 300, 2 RCTs, RR 1.16 CI 0.70 to 1.94). About 20% had anticholinergic symptoms (n = 719, 3 RCTs, RR 1.12 CI 0.77 to 1.63) and 20% of both groups experienced insomnia (n = 594, 3 RCTs, RR 1.33 CI 0.95 to 1.85) and approximately 33% sleepiness (n = 719, 4 RCTs, 0.99 CI 0.79 to 1.23). One third of people given either drug experienced some extrapyramidal symptoms (n = 893, 3 RCTs, RR 1.18 CI 0.75 to 1.88) but 25% of people using risperidone require medication to alleviate extrapyramidal adverse effects (n = 419, 2 RCTs, RR 1.76 CI 1.25 to 2.48, NNH 8 CI 4 to 25). People allocated to risperidone were less likely to gain weight compared with those given olanzapine and the weight gain resulting from olanzapine can be considerable and of rapid onset (n = 377, 1 RCT, RR gain more than 7% of their baseline weight 0.40 CI 0.23 to 0.70, NNT 8 CI 6 to 17). Risperidone may cause more sexual dysfunction than olanzapine (n = 370, 2 RCTs, RR abnormal ejaculation 4.36 CI 1.38 to 13.76, NNH 20 CI 6 to 176; n = 31, 1 RCT, RR impotence 2.43 CI 0.24 to 24.07). Within trials both drugs are associated with equal attrition (n = 1217, 7 RCTs, RR leaving the study early 1.17 CI 0.92 to 1.49).

Authors' Conclusions

Data regarding quality of life and economic outcomes are difficult to interpret, and for both these highly marketed new drugs we know very little from evaluative studies regarding service outcomes, general functioning and behaviour, engagement with services and treatment satisfaction. There is little to differentiate between risperidone and olanzapine except on the issue of adverse effects and both these drugs have unpleasant adverse effects. Risperidone is particularly associated with movement disorders and sexual dysfunction. Olanzapine can cause considerable rapid weight gain. This review highlights the need for large, independent, well designed, conducted and reported pragmatic randomised studies.

### Can authorities appreciably enhance the prescribing of oral generic risperidone to conserve resources? Findings from across Europe and their implications [^114JNpTS]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Generic atypical antipsychotic drugs offer health authorities opportunities for considerable savings. However, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders are complex diseases that require tailored treatments. Consequently, generally there have been limited demand-side measures by health authorities to encourage the preferential prescribing of generics. This is unlike the situation with hypertension, hypercholaesterolaemia or acid-related stomach disorders.

The objectives of this study were to compare the effect of the limited demand-side measures in Western European countries and regions on the subsequent prescribing of risperidone following generics; to utilise the findings to provide future guidance to health authorities; and where possible, to investigate the utilisation of generic versus originator risperidone and the prices for generic risperidone.

Methods

Principally, this was a segmented regression analysis of retrospective time-series data of the effect of the various initiatives in Belgium, Ireland, Scotland and Sweden following the introduction of generic risperidone. The study included patients prescribed at least one atypical antipsychotic drug up to 20 months before and up to 20 months after generic risperidone. In addition, retrospective observational studies were carried out in Austria and Spain (Catalonia) from 2005 to 2011 as well as one English primary care organisation (Bury Primary Care Trust (PCT)).

Results

There was a consistent steady reduction in risperidone as a percentage of total selected atypical antipsychotic utilisation following generics. A similar pattern was seen in Austria and Spain, with stable utilisation in one English PCT. However, there was considerable variation in the utilisation of generic risperidone, ranging from 98% of total risperidone in Scotland to only 14% in Ireland. Similarly, the price of generic risperidone varied considerably. In Scotland, generic risperidone was only 16% of pre-patent loss prices versus 72% in Ireland.

Conclusion

Consistent findings of no increased prescribing of risperidone post generics with limited specific demand-side measures suggests no 'spillover' effect from one class to another encouraging the preferential prescribing of generic atypical antipsychotic drugs. This is exacerbated by the complexity of the disease area and differences in the side-effects between treatments. There appeared to be no clinical issues with generic risperidone, and prices inversely reflected measures to enhance their utilisation.

VA/DoD schizophrenia management — pairwise comparisons and safety of clozapine are summarized as follows: Another SR focused on pairwise comparisons for treatment-resistant schizophrenia found no differences between clozapine and chlorpromazine, haloperidol, risperidone, olanzapine, or ziprasidone in symptomatic outcomes, and the GRADE rating of the evidence included in this SR was low. This SR included studies using a range of definitions for treatment resistance, and sensitivity analyses suggested that the primary outcome did not differ among definitions; the authors suggested that the lack of differences might have been a result of limited statistical power, and they also speculated that differences from evidence leading to FDA approval for clozapine might reflect changes over time in the quality of clinical trials, treatment histories for treatment-resistant patients, and increasing placebo responses that led to smaller drug-placebo differences. Nevertheless, possibly consistent with a unique role for clozapine, none of the pairwise comparisons suggested that any other medication led to greater improvements than clozapine, and both SRs noted that clinically meaningful associations of clozapine plasma levels with clinical responses exist and that, for those studies reporting plasma levels, they appear to have been low; both SRs speculate that this finding might have attenuated the differences between medications. The FDA-approved product label for clozapine includes a Black Box warning emphasizing serious risks.

### Establishing a dose-response relationship for oral risperidone in relapsed schizophrenia [^114on1UK]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

For many antipsychotics, dose-response relationships remain poorly understood. High dose treatment remains commonplace. We aimed to establish the dose-response relationship for oral risperidone in relapsed schizophrenia. We searched the known medical literature for fixed-dose studies of oral risperidone in this patient group. Data recovered were used to construct graphs of dose versus response. Eighteen reports evaluating the efficacy of oral risperidone were retrieved. Three studies used fixed doses of oral risperidone for eight weeks in relapsed schizophrenia. The data from these studies were included. Graphs plotted using these data strongly suggest that doses of around 4 mg daily are optimal. A dose of 2 mg daily consistently produced a lower level of efficacy. Doses of 6 mg or greater produced no additional benefit and doses tend to be less efficacious at 10mg daily and above. Frequency of extrapyramidal adverse effects increased with dose. The optimal dose of risperidone in relapsed schizophrenia is 4 mg daily. Higher doses are unlikely to improve efficacy and may reduce it. Adverse movement disorders become more common.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Primary outcome measures

Our systematic review and meta‐analysis found that on primary outcome measures, that is, study‐defined relapse rate and all‐cause discontinuation, SGA LAIs performed better than placebo but not when compared with oral active control.

It is worth noting that three 3, 17, 18 of four active‐controlled studies are open label, two 3, 18 of them are pilot studies and the number of patients in active control studies is less than half that of placebo‐controlled studies. However, the active‐controlled study by Vieta et al 20 was of high quality (Jadad score = 5) with a larger sample size (n = 260), in which SGA LAI was less effective than oral olanzapine (RR 1.63, 95% CI = 1.12 to 2.37). Study by Vieta et al 20 contained three arms: risperidone LAI, placebo, oral olanzapine, and used double dummy, that is, placebo LAI was given to patient assigned to oral olanzapine group and placebo oral was given to patients assigned to risperidone LAI and placebo LAI group.

It is also argued that participants in the RCTs are more likely to adhere to their oral medication owing to extra care and monitoring they receive during studies compared to real‐world patients. This may have favoured the active control group and can be a limitation of RCT comparing SGA LAIs with oral active control. This limitation could be overcome by designing double‐blind RCTs with double dummy, that is, giving LAI placebo for oral active control group and giving oral placebo for SGA LAI group as in the case of the study by Vieta et al. 20 Such design would make the study scientifically more robust but would also add significant logistical burden to the RCT. It could also be argued that extra care and monitoring received by two groups (SGA LAIs and oral active control group) are unlikely to be huge, and thus, their effect on adherence is likely to be minimal.

### Risperidone (Perseris) [^111jGEdm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of risperidone ER SC (also known as Uzedy, Perseris) in pregnant patients for third trimester: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms. The drug risperidone ER SC (also known as Uzedy, Perseris) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

2.2 Bipolar Mania

Usual Dose

Adults

The initial dose range is 2 mg to 3 mg per day. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 1 mg per day. The effective dose range is 1 mg to 6 mg per day, as studied in the short-term, placebo-controlled trials. In these trials, short-term (3 week) anti-manic efficacy was demonstrated in a flexible dosage range of 1 mg to 6 mg per day [see Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3)]. Risperidone doses higher than 6 mg per day were not studied.

Pediatrics

The initial dose is 0.5 mg once daily, administered as a single-daily dose in the morning or evening. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 0.5 mg or 1 mg per day, as tolerated, to the recommended target dose of 1 mg to 2.5 mg per day. Although efficacy has been demonstrated in studies of pediatric patients with bipolar mania at doses between 0.5 mg and 6 mg per day, no additional benefit was observed above 2.5 mg per day, and higher doses were associated with more adverse events. Doses higher than 6 mg per day have not been studied.

Patients experiencing persistent somnolence may benefit from administering half the daily dose twice daily.

Maintenance Therapy

There is no body of evidence available from controlled trials to guide a clinician in the longer-term management of a patient who improves during treatment of an acute manic episode with risperidone. While it is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment beyond an acute response in mania is desirable, both for maintenance of the initial response and for prevention of new manic episodes, there are no systematically obtained data to support the use of risperidone in such longer-term treatment (i.e., beyond 3 weeks). The physician who elects to use risperidone for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term risks and benefits of the drug for the individual patient.
