## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Adjunctive treatment for hypocalcemia in adults with hypoparathyroidism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for adjunctive treatment of hypocalcemia in adults with hypoparathyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "adjunctive" means in this context and whether we are dealing with conventional therapy versus PTH replacement. Then, I should verify the first-line conventional regimen and its dosing ranges. Next, I will examine when and how to escalate to intravenous calcium. After that, I need to check the role and dosing of PTH replacement therapy, including rhPTH(1–84) and palopegteriparatide. Finally, I should confirm monitoring, safety thresholds, and special situations like magnesium deficiency and hypercalciuria, and then synthesize a concise, practical recommendation with caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misinterpret the request. "Adjunctive treatment" in hypoparathyroidism generally refers to therapies added to or used alongside conventional oral calcium and active vitamin D, and in some contexts specifically denotes PTH replacement when conventional therapy is insufficient; I should keep both interpretations in mind and specify which scenario applies as I proceed [^632016e3] [^050a9644].

> I will now examine conventional first-line therapy, because most patients are managed with oral calcium plus active vitamin D before any PTH is considered. Typical oral calcium carbonate provides 40% elemental calcium, and practical postoperative or chronic dosing often uses 1–2 g elemental calcium in divided doses two to three times daily, with titration to symptoms and serum calcium, and many patients ultimately require around 1500 mg/day elemental calcium in divided doses for maintenance; calcium citrate is preferred in achlorhydria or with PPIs due to better absorption, though carbonate is otherwise standard [^a74e1e65] [^a4b1a817].

> Next, I should review active vitamin D dosing, since calcitriol is the workhorse when PTH is absent. The FDA-labeled starting dose is 0.25 mcg orally once daily, with titration every 2–4 weeks to a usual maintenance range of 0.5–2 mcg/day; in symptomatic or refractory cases, especially postoperatively, higher divided doses such as 0.25–0.5 mcg twice daily are commonly used, and some patients require up to 4 mcg/day, though I need to ensure close monitoring to avoid hypercalcemia [^01ddb189] [^49d1f050] [^notfound] [^a74e1e65].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about oral therapy alone in severe presentations. For severe symptomatic hypocalcemia or when oral therapy fails, I should confirm intravenous calcium indications and dosing. IV calcium gluconate is preferred peripherally; a bolus of 1–2 g (about 93–186 mg elemental calcium) infused over 20 minutes can be repeated as needed, followed by a continuous infusion of calcium gluconate for sustained correction; calcium chloride is more irritating and generally reserved for central access or when appropriately diluted, and I should double-check for QT prolongation and cardiac effects before and during IV therapy [^474ca296] [^de684c59].

> Now, I need to check when PTH replacement becomes the "adjunctive" option. Recombinant human PTH(1–84) (Natpara) is FDA-approved as adjunct to calcium and active vitamin D for adults who cannot be well controlled on conventional therapy; the labeled starting dose is 50 mcg subcutaneously once daily, with titration to 75 mcg and then 100 mcg based on serum calcium and the goal of reducing oral supplements; importantly, it carries a boxed warning for osteosarcoma risk and is restricted to REMS, so I should confirm that patients meet criteria and understand risks before prescribing [^050a9644] [^0285604e] [^64846263].

> Wait, let me verify the newer long-acting PTH option, because dosing differs. Palopegteriparatide (Yorvipath), a long-acting PTH(1–34) prodrug, is dosed once daily starting at 18 mcg subcutaneously with titration to maintain albumin-adjusted calcium in the lower-normal range; this agent has shown improvements in urinary calcium and quality of life compared with conventional therapy, and I should remember to taper calcium and active vitamin D as PTH takes effect to avoid hypercalcemia [^4a1fdac1] [^5b27264e].

> I should confirm adjuncts that help with refractory control or hypercalciuria. Thiazide diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–50 mg daily can reduce urinary calcium excretion and are reasonable when hypercalciuria persists despite optimization; magnesium deficiency impairs PTH responsiveness, so if magnesium is low, correcting it with magnesium oxide 400 mg once or twice daily can improve calcium recovery and reduce requirements, and I need to check magnesium periodically, especially in postoperative patients [^1213cdf0] [^53eb1530] [^4b835cb8].

> Next, I should review monitoring so I don't miss safety issues. During active titration, serum calcium should be checked frequently — at least twice weekly early on with calcitriol changes — then, once stable, every 3–6 months for calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and creatinine/eGFR, with periodic 24-hour urine calcium to assess for hypercalciuria; I should also watch for hypercalcemia, especially with PTH therapy, and consider measuring calcium about 7 hours after injection to detect transient peaks, adjusting the dose accordingly [^53eb1530] [^01ddb189] [^3a0f4994].

> But wait, what if the user is asking about postoperative versus chronic non-surgical hypoparathyroidism; does dosing differ meaningfully? Early postoperative hypoparathyroidism often requires higher upfront calcium and calcitriol doses with a planned taper as parathyroid function recovers, whereas chronic hypoparathyroidism emphasizes the lowest effective maintenance to mitigate renal complications; in both, the same principles of divided calcium dosing, calcitriol titration, and vigilant monitoring apply, with PTH reserved for refractory cases or when hypercalciuria and pill burden drive the need for replacement [^3c770ed8] [^632016e3] [^050a9644].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer, keeping the two scenarios explicit. For conventional adjunctive therapy, start with oral calcium carbonate 1–2 g elemental calcium two to three times daily with meals and calcitriol 0.25 mcg once daily, titrating calcium to symptoms and serum calcium and increasing calcitriol by 0.25–0.5 mcg increments every 2–4 weeks to a typical maintenance of 0.5–2 mcg/day, with many patients stabilizing around 1500 mg/day elemental calcium plus 0.5–1 mcg/day calcitriol; add magnesium if low and consider thiazide if hypercalciuria persists, and monitor calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and renal function regularly [^3c770ed8] [^a74e1e65] [^53eb1530] [^1213cdf0]. For PTH-based adjunctive therapy when conventional therapy is inadequate, use rhPTH(1–84) 50 mcg subcutaneously once daily, titrating to 75–100 mcg to reduce oral supplements, or palopegteriparatide 18 mcg subcutaneously once daily with titration to maintain low-normal calcium while tapering calcium and active vitamin D, all under REMS precautions and close laboratory surveillance [^050a9644] [^0285604e] [^4a1fdac1].

For adults with hypoparathyroidism, **start calcitriol at 0.25 mcg twice daily** [^4b835cb8] and titrate to 0.5–1 mcg/day in divided doses to maintain serum calcium in the low-normal range (8.0–9.0 mg/dL) [^a74e1e65]. Use **oral calcium 1–2 g elemental calcium three times daily** with meals, adjusting to tolerance and serum calcium [^3c770ed8]. Monitor calcium and phosphate every 1–2 weeks initially, then every 3–6 months; add thiazide and restrict sodium if hypercalciuria occurs [^1213cdf0] [^7ce388ef]. Reserve **rhPTH(1–84) 50 mcg SC daily** [^0285604e] for refractory cases or when conventional therapy is unsatisfactory [^050a9644].

## Calcitriol (active vitamin D) dosing

- **Initial dose**: 0.25 mcg orally twice daily (total 0.5 mcg/day) [^4b835cb8].
- **Titration**: Increase by 0.25 mcg/day every 2–4 weeks based on serum calcium and clinical response [^53eb1530].
- **Typical maintenance dose**: 0.5–1 mcg/day in divided doses; some patients require up to 2 mcg/day [^a74e1e65].
- **Monitoring**: Check serum calcium and phosphate every 1–2 weeks initially, then every 3–6 months once stable [^01ddb189].

---

## Calcium supplementation

- **Initial dose**: 1–2 g elemental calcium orally three times daily with meals (total 3–6 g/day) [^3c770ed8].
- **Titration**: Adjust to maintain serum calcium in the low-normal range (8.0–9.0 mg/dL) [^06a94a04].
- **Formulation**: Calcium carbonate is preferred; calcium citrate is used if achlorhydria or PPI use limits absorption [^a4b1a817].
- **Monitoring**: Assess serum calcium and 24-hour urinary calcium periodically to avoid hypercalciuria [^01ddb189].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

### Thiazide diuretics

Use **hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–50 mg daily** [^1213cdf0] if hypercalciuria persists despite optimized calcium and calcitriol, and restrict sodium intake to < 2 g/day to enhance calciuretic effect [^notfound].

---

### Magnesium supplementation

Correct **hypomagnesemia** with magnesium oxide 400 mg once or twice daily to restore PTH responsiveness and improve calcium control [^4b835cb8].

---

## Parathyroid hormone replacement therapy

- **Indication**: Reserved for refractory cases or when conventional therapy is unsatisfactory [^050a9644].
- **Agent**: Recombinant human PTH (1–84) (Natpara) 50 mcg subcutaneously daily [^0285604e].
- **Titration**: Adjust to 75–100 mcg based on serum calcium and clinical response [^0285604e].
- **Monitoring**: Close monitoring is required due to risks of hypercalcemia and osteosarcoma [^050a9644].

## Clinical targets and monitoring

| **Parameter** | **Target range** | **Monitoring frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| Serum calcium | 8.0–9.0 mg/dL (2.0–2.25 mmol/L) | Every 1–2 weeks initially, then every 3–6 months [^01ddb189] |
| Serum phosphate | 2.5–4.5 mg/dL (0.81–1.45 mmol/L) | Every 3–6 months [^01ddb189] |
| 24-hour urinary calcium | < 7.5 mmol/day (< 300 mg/day) | Annually or if hypercalciuria suspected [^01ddb189] |
| Serum magnesium | 1.6–2.2 mg/dL (0.66–0.91 mmol/L) | Periodically, especially if symptomatic [^01ddb189] |

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Calcitriol**: Start at 0.25 mcg twice daily, titrate to 0.5–1 mcg/day in divided doses [^4b835cb8].
- **Calcium**: 1–2 g elemental calcium three times daily with meals, adjust to maintain low-normal calcium [^3c770ed8].
- **Adjuncts**: Add thiazide and restrict sodium for hypercalciuria; correct magnesium deficiency [^1213cdf0] [^7ce388ef].
- **PTH therapy**: Consider rhPTH(1–84) 50 mcg SC daily for refractory cases [^0285604e].

---

Adjunctive therapy for hypocalcemia in adults with hypoparathyroidism centers on **calcitriol and calcium**, with thiazide, magnesium, and PTH reserved for refractory cases. Dosing is individualized to maintain serum calcium in the low-normal range while minimizing hypercalciuria and renal complications [^632016e3].

(Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence)". Practical dosing and adjuncts include: "Oral calcium carbonate is widely available without prescription, usually well tolerated, and a typical postoperative dose is 1–2 g, 2–3 times daily with prompt dose escalation as required for symptom relief (excess ingestion is readily excreted)". If symptoms persist with oral calcium, "oral calcitriol should also be initiated, at a typical dose of 0.25 to 0.5 mcg twice daily", and laboratory evaluation can guide management: "Phosphorus level can help to distinguish between bone hunger (normal PO4) and hypoparathyroidism (elevated PO4). Magnesium and 25-OH vitamin D levels should also be checked". For severe cases, infusion is preferred: "Intravenous boluses of calcium are not recommended due to their short-lived effect; infusions of calcium over several hours are more effective and preferred".

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — prophylactic postoperative management can include oral calcium carbonate given as 500–625 mg to 1000–1250 mg two to three times a day, and routine administration of oral calcium has been reported to reduce postoperative hypocalcemia to approximately 10%; adding calcitriol (1,25-(OH)2-D3), usually 0.5–1.0 μg per day, increases effectiveness, and calcitriol has a half-life of 5–8 hours; in a prospective randomized study, 1500 mg of oral calcium salts and 1 μg of calcitriol increased calcium and PTH superior to 0.5 μg of calcitriol administered twice a day or no calcitriol; given risks of overshooting and hypercalcemia, biochemical monitoring for medication titration is mandatory; costs noted indicate the cost of calcitriol and calcium tend to be less than PTH testing, though PTH testing is considerably lower than an emergency room visit or hospital admission; when postoperative hypoPT is known to be present, higher baseline calcium and activated vitamin D replacement are associated with better chances of parathyroid recovery.

### Is calcium supplementation always needed in patients with hypoparathyroidism? [^8df6c69a]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

Oral calcium salts are recommended for the treatment of chronic hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT), although dosimetry is variable between individual patients and clinicians. However, patient feedback on calcium salts can be negative, particularly due to gastrointestinal side effects and hypercalciuria-related complications. We begin with a clinical case of a HypoPT patient taking oral calcium salts following thyroid surgery, who requested support in reducing her dose of these with a view to stopping entirely. To evaluate her request, we first describe the usual treatment of HypoPT according to current guidance and then present data from (a) a case note review of a cohort of 24 HypoPT patients managed with a "no calcium" treatment regimen by single physician (b) a comprehensive online survey of HypoPT patients' treatment and experiences (n = 330). The case note review found that target range serum calcium levels were successfully achieved in all 24 patients since transitioning to a "no calcium" regimen, without any breakthrough hypocalcaemia-related symptoms, the development of new renal stones, the occurrence of calcium-related hospital admissions or the finding of significant hypercalciuria. The online survey identified 36% of HypoPT patients who continued to take activated vitamin D, but had discontinued calcium supplements. HypoPT patients not currently taking calcium reported a significantly lower prevalence of adverse effects and outcomes, both compared with their previous experiences whilst taking calcium and also compared with the 64% of patients who continued to take oral calcium. We conclude that, subject to methodological limitations, there are significant issues of tolerability arising from conventional calcium-based treatment regimens for patients with chronic HypoPT. For selected patients, it may be reasonable to facilitate a managed therapeutic transition to "no calcium" regimen, and we also propose that calcium-based regimes be prospectively evaluated against calcium-free (or calcium-low) alternatives.

### Conventional treatment of hypoparathyroidism [^a4b1a817]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Conventional therapy of hypoparathyroidism consists of oral calcium and either activated vitamin D or vitamin D supplements at varying doses. Although adjusting dosing of calcium and/or activated vitamin D or vitamin D itself, the serum calcium should be obtained weekly or monthly depending on the clinical situation. Calcium supplementation in hypoparathyroidism usually consists of calcium carbonate because it is 40% elemental calcium by weight. However, calcium citrate (21% elemental calcium) is indicated for patients with achlorhydria and proton pump inhibitor therapy. Many clinicians prefer to uptitrate the activated form of vitamin D to reduce the amount of calcium supplementation.

The standard treatment of primary hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) with oral calcium supplementation and calcitriol (or an analog), intended to control hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia and avoid hypercalciuria, remains challenging for both patients and clinicians. In 2015, human parathyroid hormone (hPTH) (1–84) administered as a daily subcutaneous injection was approved as an adjunctive treatment in patients who cannot be well controlled on the standard treatments alone. This open-label study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of an oral hPTH(1–34) formulation as an adjunct to standard treatment in adult subjects with hypoparathyroidism. Oral hPTH(1–34) tablets (0.75mg human hPTH(1–34) acetate) were administered four times daily for 16 consecutive weeks, and changes in calcium supplementation and alfacalcidol use, albumin-adjusted serum calcium (ACa), serum phosphate, urinary calcium excretion, and quality of life throughout the study were monitored. Of the 19 enrolled subjects, 15 completed the trial per protocol. A median 42% reduction from baseline in exogenous calcium dose was recorded (p = .001), whereas median serum ACa levels remained above the lower target ACa levels for hypoPT patients (> 7.5mg/dL) throughout the study. Median serum phosphate levels rapidly decreased (23%, p = .0003) 2 hours after the first dose and were maintained within the normal range for the duration of the study. A notable, but not statistically significant, median decrease (21%, p = .07) in 24-hour urine calcium excretion was observed between the first and last treatment days. Only four possible drug-related, non-serious adverse events were reported over the 16-week study, all by the same patient. A small but statistically significant increase from baseline quality of life (5%, p = .03) was reported by the end of the treatment period. Oral hPTH(1–34) treatment was generally safe and well tolerated and allowed for a reduction in exogenous calcium supplementation, while maintaining normocalcemia in adult patients with hypoparathyroidism. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT

The standard treatment of primary hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) with oral calcium supplementation and calcitriol (or an analog), intended to control hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia and avoid hypercalciuria, remains challenging for both patients and clinicians. In 2015, human parathyroid hormone (hPTH) (1‐84) administered as a daily subcutaneous injection was approved as an adjunctive treatment in patients who cannot be well controlled on the standard treatments alone. This open‐label study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of an oral hPTH(1‐34) formulation as an adjunct to standard treatment in adult subjects with hypoparathyroidism. Oral hPTH(1‐34) tablets (0.75 mg human hPTH(1‐34) acetate) were administered four times daily for 16 consecutive weeks, and changes in calcium supplementation and alfacalcidol use, albumin‐adjusted serum calcium (ACa), serum phosphate, urinary calcium excretion, and quality of life throughout the study were monitored. Of the 19 enrolled subjects, 15 completed the trial per protocol. A median 42% reduction from baseline in exogenous calcium dose was recorded (p = .001), whereas median serum ACa levels remained above the lower target ACa levels for hypoPT patients (> 7.5 mg/dL) throughout the study. Median serum phosphate levels rapidly decreased (23%, p = .0003) 2 hours after the first dose and were maintained within the normal range for the duration of the study. A notable, but not statistically significant, median decrease (21%, p = .07) in 24‐hour urine calcium excretion was observed between the first and last treatment days. Only four possible drug‐related, non‐serious adverse events were reported over the 16‐week study, all by the same patient. A small but statistically significant increase from baseline quality of life (5%, p = .03) was reported by the end of the treatment period.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^a74e1e65]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — long-term targets and supplementation: Serum calcium should be maintained in the low normal reference range and serum phosphorus should be maintained no higher than the upper normal range; recommendations for 24-hour urine calcium excretion < 7.5 mmol/day and calcium-phosphorus product < 55 mg²/dL² have been advocated. Calciphylaxis mortality approaches 45–50%. Calcium supplementation doses up to 3500 mg of elemental calcium per day have been reported, with most patients requiring 1500 mg daily, and therapy in two to three divided doses provides the best absorption. Calcitriol is usually recommended, with most patients requiring 0.25 to 0.5 µg of calcitriol daily (0.25–4.0 µg/day).

### Management of hypoparathyroidism [^632016e3]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is a rare disorder characterized by hypocalcemia in the presence of a low or inappropriately normal parathyroid hormone level. HypoPT is most commonly seen after neck surgery, which accounts for approximately 75% of cases, whereas approximately 25% have HypoPT due to nonsurgical causes. In both groups of patients, conventional therapy includes calcium and active vitamin D analogue therapy aiming to maintain serum calcium concentration in the low normal or just below the normal reference range and normalize serum phosphorus, magnesium concentrations, and urine calcium levels. The limitations of conventional therapy include wide fluctuations in serum calcium, high pill burden, poor quality of life, and renal complications. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) replacement therapy may improve the biochemical profile in those in whom conventional therapy proves unsatisfactory. Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature, the panel made a graded recommendation suggesting conventional therapy as first line therapy rather than administration of PTH (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). When conventional therapy is deemed unsatisfactory, the panel considers use of PTH. Because pregnancy and lactation are associated with changes in calcium homeostasis, close monitoring is required during these periods with appropriate adjustment of calcium and active vitamin D analogue therapy to ensure that serum calcium remains in the mid to low normal reference range in order to avoid maternal and fetal complications. Emerging therapies include molecules with prolonged PTH action as well as different mechanisms of action that may significantly enhance drug efficacy and safety. © 2022 The Authors.

Table 1
Recommended Changes to Calcium (Ca) Supplements and Alfacalcidol or hPTH(1‐34) Dosages in Accordance With Patients' Albumin‐Adjusted Serum Ca (ACa) a

Based on previous phase 1 studies and IRB approval, the maximum allowed dosage was 9.0 mg hPTH(1‐34) acetate per day. Because of the heterogeneous patient population, their sensitivity to PTH, and their variable daily supplements, the extent of the adjustment was left to the investigator's discretion for how to best adjust in order to achieve the individual patient's target ACa levels. Follow‐up visits were performed at the end of weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and at the end of week 16, when treatment with oral hPTH(1‐34) was discontinued. Serum calcium, phosphate, albumin, and creatinine levels were evaluated at all visits (before and 1 hour after self‐administration of the study drug at the clinic) and medication dose adjustments were performed, according to the subjects' ACa levels. Individuals were contacted by a study coordinator during each week that did not include a clinical visit. Urinalysis and 24‐hour urine collection for calcium, creatinine, and phosphate were performed before treatment initiation and at the end of weeks 8 and 16. A follow‐up/end of study (FU/EOS) visit was performed 7 to 14 days after the completion of the treatment phase or at early trial discontinuation.

Treatment compliance was monitored throughout the study by checking personal diaries and weekly patient status update calls. Compliance to treatment was calculated as the percentage of the tablets consumed by the subject from the prescribed amounts and defined as follows: > 80% (good), 60% to 80% (satisfactory), and < 60% (poor).

Quality of life (QoL) was assessed with the EQ‐5D‐5L (EuroQoL), a standardized instrument used to measure health‐related quality of life assessments, which was completed by the subjects at each visit during the treatment phase. This instrument used a Visual Analog Scale (VAS; 1 being worst to 100 being best) to record patients' self‐rated overall health. This instrument has been used to assess quality of life in patients with hypoPT. (10)

Hypocalcemia‐related symptoms were reported at each treatment visit, beginning with the first visit after treatment was initiated.

### The PARADIGHM (physicians advancing disease knowledge in hypoparathyroidism) registry for patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism: study protocol and interim baseline patient characteristics [^4fe409d6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

The recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1–84), rhPTH(1–84), is full-length PTH that is approved in the United States and Europe as adjunctive treatment for patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. In Europe, rhPTH(1–84) is indicated as adjunctive treatment for patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism who cannot be adequately controlled with conventional therapy alone. In the United States, rhPTH(1–84) is indicated as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to control hypocalcemia and is recommended only for patients who cannot be well controlled with calcium supplements and active vitamin D alone. The safety and efficacy of rhPTH(1–84) in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism were first shown in short-term placebo-controlled clinical studies in which the need for conventional therapy was reduced, serum calcium levels were maintained, serum phosphate decreased, and events of hypocalcemia were reduced. In longer-term, open-label clinical studies, no new safety concerns were observed, reductions in oral calcium supplements and active vitamin D were achieved, serum calcium remained within target range, serum phosphorus and calcium-phosphate product levels improved, and urinary calcium excretion normalized.

Observational studies complement findings from interventional clinical trials and can provide real-world information on long-term outcomes of safety, effectiveness, and HRQoL across a broad population. Patient registries, in particular for rare diseases, can obtain natural disease or treatment response data over the long-term that would otherwise be limited if performed by individual centers.

The multinational PARADIGHM (physicians advancing disease knowledge in hypoparathyroidism) registry (NCT01922440, EUPAS register number: EUPAS16927) is an opportunity to obtain valuable real-world data beyond those reported for clinical trials in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism by providing long-term data for the treatment of patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism with rhPTH(1–84). PARADIGHM also records data that will allow for the assessment of the overall disease course in patients under conditions of routine clinical practice. Herein we describe the protocol for PARADIGHM and report baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for the current participants.

### Calcium citrate versus calcium carbonate in the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism: a randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial [^094526ae]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

A statistician not directly involved in the trial allocated subjects by use of computer‐generated randomization. Randomization to Ca‐Cit or CaCO 3 was double‐blind (ie, patients, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to study drugs). We randomly allocated patients who fulfilled the selection criteria 1:1 to Ca‐Cit or CaCO 3, for 1 month, and then the patients crossed over to the other treatment for another month. The initial total amount of elemental calcium was the same amount that they had taken before the study enrolment. The total amount of elemental calcium was divided in two or three doses (each dose immediately after meal). The dose of active vitamin D was equal to the daily dose taken before the study and was not changed during the study period. At the time of crossover (from drug A to drug B or from drug B to drug A), patients received the same total amount of elemental calcium that they had taken during the last week of phase 1. Medication containers were labeled with a unique number representing the randomly allocated study sequence. Both Ca‐Cit and CaCO 3 tablets had identical appearance, smell, and taste. Each tablet consisted of 250 mg elemental calcium. Furthermore, the calcium supplementation dosage was changed based on the albumin‐adjusted serum calcium values as suggested below: if the albumin‐adjusted serum calcium value was less than 8 mg/dL, the dose of calcium was increased by 500 mg of elemental calcium with a new dosage of calcium on blood sample after 48 hours, up to the achievement of normocalcemia. If the subject had serum albumin‐adjusted calcium between 8 mg/dL and 9 mg/dL (optimal range) with signs and/or symptoms of hypocalcemia, calcium supplementation was increased by 500 mg of elemental calcium. If instead, the albumin‐adjusted calcium value was higher than 10.4 mg/dL, the dose of calcium was reduced by 500 mg of elemental calcium with a new dosage of calcium on blood sample after 48 hours, up to the achievement of normocalcemia.

### Efficacy and safety of recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1–84) in hypoparathyroidism (REPLACE): a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 3 study [^0285604e]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypoparathyroidism results in impaired mineral homoeostasis, including hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia. Treatment with high-dose oral calcium and active vitamin D does not provide adequate or consistent control of biochemical indices and can lead to serious long-term complications. We aimed to test the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once-daily recombinant human parathyroid hormone 1–84 (rhPTH[1–84]) in adults with hypoparathyroidism.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised phase 3 study (REPLACE), we recruited patients with hypoparathyroidism (≥ 18 months duration) aged 18–85 years from 33 sites in eight countries. After an optimisation period, during which calcium and active vitamin D doses were adjusted to achieve consistent albumin-corrected serum calcium, patients were randomly assigned (2:1) via an interactive voice response system to 50 μg per day of rhPTH(1–84) or placebo for 24 weeks. Active vitamin D and calcium were progressively reduced, while rhPTH(1–84) could be titrated up from 50 μg to 75 μg and then 100 μg (weeks 0–5). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients at week 24 who achieved a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in their daily dose of oral calcium and active vitamin D while maintaining a serum calcium concentration greater than or the same as baseline concentrations and less than or equal to the upper limit of normal, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00732615.

Findings

Between June 23, 2009, and Feb 28, 2011, 134 eligible patients were recruited and randomly assigned to rhPTH(1–84) (n = 90) or placebo (n = 44). Six patients in the rhPTH(1–84) group and seven in the placebo group discontinued before study end. 48 (53%) patients in the rhPTH(1–84) group achieved the primary endpoint compared with one (2%) patient in the placebo group (percentage difference 51.1%, 95% CI 39.9–62.3; p < 0.0001). The proportions of patients who had at least one adverse event were similar between groups (84 [93%] patients in the rhPTH[1–84] group vs 44 [100%] patients in the placebo group), with hypocalcaemia, muscle spasm, paraesthesias, headache, and nausea being the most common adverse events. The proportions of patients with serious adverse events were also similar between the rhPTH(1–84) group (ten [11%] patients) and the placebo group (four [9%] patients).

Interpretation

50 μg, 75 μg, or 100 μg per day of rhPTH(1–84), administered subcutaneously in the outpatient setting, is efficacious and well tolerated as a PTH replacement therapy for patients with hypoparathyroidism.

### Safety and efficacy of recombinant human parathyroid hormone in adults with hypoparathyroidism randomly assigned to receive fixed 25-μ g or 50-μ g daily doses [^19a59a23]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The present study examined the efficacy and safety of a lower rhPTH(1–84) dose.

Methods

RELAY was a dose-blinded, multicenter, 8-week study of patients with hypoparathyroidism randomized to fixed 25- or 50-μg/d doses of subcutaneous rhPTH(1–84). The primary end point was the percentage of patients at week 8 with supplement reductions in calcium to ≤ 500 mg/d and in calcitriol to ≤ 0.25 μg/d, while maintaining serum calcium levels between 1.875 mmol/L and the upper limit of normal. The secondary end point was the percentage of patients at week 8 with a ≥ 50% reduction in calcium and calcitriol doses, while maintaining serum calcium levels between 1.875 mmol/L and the upper limit of normal.

Findings

Forty-two patients were randomized (25-μg group, n = 19; 50-μg group, n = 23). At week 8, the primary end point was achieved by 4 (21%; 95% CI, 6%-46%) and 6 (26%; 95% CI, 10%-48%) of the patients receiving 25 and 50 μg/d of rhPTH(1–84), respectively. The secondary end point was achieved by 2 (11%; 95% CI, 1%-33%) and 6 (26%; 95% CI, 10%-48%) of the patients receiving 25 and 50 μg/d of rhPTH(1–84), respectively. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 11 (58%) patients in the 25-μg group and 17 (74%) patients in the 50-μg group.

Implications

Doses as low as 25 µg/d of rhPTH(1–84) are well tolerated and may be effective for a subset of patients. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01268098.

Participants

Eligible participants included men and nonpregnant women (≥ 18 years of age) with chronic hypoparathyroidism of postsurgical, autoimmune, genetic, or idiopathic etiologies for a duration of at least 26 weeks. Participants must have been treated with calcitriol ≥ 0.5 μg/d or alfacalcidol ≥ 1.0 μg/d in addition to elemental calcium ≥ 800 mg/d for at least 12 weeks before screening. Stable doses of conventional therapy (ie, active vitamin D and calcium) were required for at least 5 weeks before screening, not precluding occasional (≤ 2/week) pro re nata (PRN, as needed) doses of calcium and/or active vitamin D. To ensure safety for those who might be randomized to the placebo arm, participants were required to achieve an albumin‐adjusted or ionized serum calcium within the normal range or slightly below the normal range (albumin‐adjusted serum calcium 7.8–10.6 mg/dL [1.95–2.64 mmol/L] or ionized serum calcium 4.40–5.29 mg/dL [1.10–1.32 mmol/L]), 25(OH) vitamin D levels 20–80 ng/mL (49–200 nmol/L), and magnesium levels ≥ 1.3 mg/dL (0.53 mmol/L), as is currently the goal of conventional treatment. Urinary calcium excretion ≥ 125 mg/24 h and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² was required for enrollment. The diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism was confirmed by the presence of persistent hypocalcemia in the setting of inappropriately low serum PTH levels. Low PTH levels were defined as at or below the median value of the reference range at the performing laboratory. Individuals with impaired responsiveness to PTH (pseudohypoparathyroidism) or any disease that might affect calcium metabolism, calcium × phosphate homeostasis, or PTH levels other than hypoparathyroidism were excluded. Thiazide diuretic use was not allowed within 4 weeks before the 24‐hour urine collection before visit 1, and the use of PTH analogs was not allowed within 4 weeks of screening. Eligible participants could not have used other drugs known to influence calcium and bone metabolism (except for active vitamin D analogs and elemental calcium) within 12 weeks before screening or osteoporosis therapies known to influence calcium and bone metabolism (ie, bisphosphonate) within 2 years before screening. The use of loop diuretics, phosphate binders, digoxin, lithium, methotrexate, biotin > 30 μg/d, and systemic corticosteroids (other than as replacement therapy) were not permitted during the trial. All participants provided signed informed consent before treatment initiation.

### PTH (1–84) replacement therapy in hypoparathyroidism: a randomized controlled trial on pharmacokinetic and dynamic effects after 6 months of treatment [^3a0f4994]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2013). Low credibility.

Untreated, hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) is a state of hypocalcemia with inappropriately low plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and hyperphosphatemia. PTH administration normalizes plasma calcium and phosphate levels and reduces the doses of calcium and active vitamin D analogues needed. To develop an evidence-based clinical algorithm to monitor hypoPT patients treated with recombinant human PTH (rhPTH[1–84]) injected subcutaneously in the thigh, we performed a 24-hour monitoring study of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects in a group of 38 patients who had completed a 6-month randomized study on effects of treatment with a fixed rhPTH(1–84) dose of 100µg/d or similar placebo as an add-on to conventional treatment. PTH levels rose immediately, reaching a median peak level of 26.5 (interquartile range [IQR], 20.1–42.5) pmol/L 15 minutes following injection. Thereafter, levels gradually decreased until reaching predosing levels after 16 hours, with a plasma half-life of 2.2 (1.7–2.5) hours. rhPTH(1–84) changed the diurnal rhythms of ionized calcium levels and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2 D) levels, with rising levels following injection. Ionized calcium peaked after 7.0 (5.0–10.0) hours. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia was present in 71% of the rhPTH(1–84)-treated patients. Compared with placebo, 24-hour urinary calcium, phosphate, and magnesium did not change, although the diurnal variation in renal excretion rates changed significantly in response to treatment. In conclusion, as a safety precaution, we recommend occasionally measuring calcium levels at approximately 7 hours after administration in order to reveal episodes of hypercalcemia. A 100-µg daily dose of rhPTH(1–84) appears to be too high in some patients, suggesting a need for a device allowing for individual dose adjustments.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^256ce646]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

Post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism — incidence variability and definitional criteria are outlined as follows: Hypoparathyroidism is the most common complication of bilateral and re-operative thyroid operations. Reported rates are influenced by different time points after surgery, diverse electrolyte supplementation protocols, variable operation aggressiveness and surgeon expertise, and by variable use of clinical criteria including symptomatic versus asymptomatic hypocalcemia, biochemical criteria (serum parathyroid hormone [PTH] and/or calcium and/or ionized calcium), and treatment criteria (requirement for calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation). According to a recent meta-analysis, the median incidence of temporary and permanent hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy ranges from 19% to 38% and 0% to 3%, respectively.

The British Journal of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Post-thyroidectomy monitoring — calcium measurement and follow-up: Serum calcium levels (albumin-adjusted and/or ionized) should also be measured. In patients with biochemical hypoparathyroidism and/or low serum calcium levels and/or manifestations of hypocalcaemia, measurements of calcium should be repeated as necessary to assure diagnosis and to allow tailoring of calcium and/or active vitamin D analogue supplements. To prevent iatrogenic suppression of PTH, excessive calcium intake, and potential renal complications, thyroid surgeons should proactively recommend a structured tapering strategy for supplementation.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^d5ea8364]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association — Table 4 key recommendations for prevention and management of hypoparathyroidism: Conduct surgery so as to avoid removal or devascularization of parathyroid tissue. Autotransplant devascularized or inadvertently removed parathyroid glands. Either treat at-risk patients empirically with calcium, or measure calcium and/or PTH in the immediate postoperative period and treat according to evidence-based protocols. Titrate calcium with or without calcitriol to maintain eucalcemia, and wean calcium and/or calcitriol when appropriate. Communication between providers is critical, since hypoPT may be prolonged and can negatively affect multiple organ systems. Inability to achieve independence from calcium by six months indicates permanent hypoPT. Recombinant human PTH analogues may be considered for patients with permanent hypoPT. Avoiding hypoPT is much less costly than treating hypoPT. Teriparatide acetate (recombinant human PTH 1–34; rhPTH[1–34]) is an approved treatment for osteoporosis, but it is currently being studied as a possible off-label treatment for postoperative hypoPT.

### Calcitriol (Rocaltrol) [^53eb1530]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism

The recommended initial dosage of Rocaltrol is 0.25 mcg/day given in the morning. If a satisfactory response in the biochemical parameters and clinical manifestations of the disease is not observed, the dose may be increased at 2- to 4-week intervals. During the dosage titration period, serum calcium levels should be obtained at least twice weekly and, if hypercalcemia is noted, Rocaltrol should be immediately discontinued until normocalcemia ensues (see PRECAUTIONS: General). Careful consideration should also be given to lowering the dietary calcium intake. Serum calcium, phosphorus, and 24-hour urinary calcium should be determined periodically.

Most adult patients and pediatric patients age 6 years and older have responded to dosages in the range of 0.5 mcg to 2 mcg daily. Pediatric patients in the 1- to 5-year age group with hypoparathyroidism have usually been given 0.25 mcg to 0.75 mcg daily. The number of treated patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism less than 6 years of age is too small to make dosage recommendations.

Malabsorption is occasionally noted in patients with hypoparathyroidism; hence, larger doses of Rocaltrol may be needed.

Predialysis Patients

The recommended initial dosage of Rocaltrol is 0.25 mcg/day in adults and pediatric patients 3 years of age and older. This dosage may be increased if necessary to 0.5 mcg/day.

For pediatric patients less than 3 years of age, the recommended initial dosage of Rocaltrol is 10 to 15 ng/kg/day.

### Update on hypoparathyroidism [^0bbcbfca]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by low or insufficient parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations leading to hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and markedly reduced bone turnover. Despite being a rare disease, hypoparathyroidism has a profound impact on affected patients.

Recent Findings

Recent epidemiologic surveys demonstrate a prevalence of between 5.3 and 40/100000, confirming the orphan status of this disease. There is a female predominance, and anterior neck surgery is the most common etiology. Recent studies have better elucidated the chronic manifestations of the disease, impacting quality of life and multiple organ systems including the renal, cardiovascular, and skeletal systems. There are now data on longer term use of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH analogs.

Summary

This review focuses on recent contributions to the literature on the prevalence and epidemiology of the disease, risk of chronic manifestations, and treatment with PTH(1–34) and rhPTH(1–84). Further research is needed to determine the pathophysiology of complications in hypoparathyroidism and whether interventions can decrease future risk of these complications. In addition, further data are needed with regards to more physiologic dosing regimens and long-term treatment with PTH and PTH analogs.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^26422bc8]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association postoperative hypoparathyroidism — PTH-based discharge and supplementation guidance states that it is the opinion of the ATA Surgical Affairs Committee that a PTH value ≥ 15 pg/mL, measured in adults at ≥ 20 minutes following thyroidectomy would obviate the need for intensive serum calcium monitoring and/or calcium supplementation, whereas a postoperative PTH value of ≤ 15 pg/mL would suggest an increased risk for acute hypoPT that might prompt preemptive prescribing of oral calcium and calcitriol; additionally, a PTH level < 15 pg/mL is usually predictive of impending hypocalcemia, and intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) levels measured alone or combined with serum calcium level measurements may guide the decision to discharge versus monitor or prescribe prophylactic oral calcium.

### Management of postthyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism and its effect on hypocalcemia-related complications: a meta-analysis [^13ddd43a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this Meta-analysis is to evaluate the impact of different treatment strategies for early postoperative hypoparathyroidism on hypocalcemia-related complications and long-term hypoparathyroidism.

Data Sources

Embase.com, MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the top 100 references of Google Scholar were searched to September 20, 2022.

Review Methods

Articles reporting on adult patients who underwent total thyroidectomy which specified a treatment strategy for postthyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism were included. Random effect models were applied to obtain pooled proportions and 95% confidence intervals. Primary outcome was the occurrence of major hypocalcemia-related complications. Secondary outcome was long-term hypoparathyroidism.

Results

Sixty-six studies comprising 67 treatment protocols and 51,096 patients were included in this Meta-analysis. In 8 protocols (3806 patients), routine calcium and/or active vitamin D medication was given to all patients directly after thyroidectomy. In 49 protocols (44,012 patients), calcium and/or active vitamin D medication was only given to patients with biochemically proven postthyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism. In 10 protocols (3278 patients), calcium and/or active vitamin D supplementation was only initiated in case of clinical symptoms of hypocalcemia. No patient had a major complication due to postoperative hypocalcemia. The pooled proportion of long-term hypoparathyroidism was 2.4% (95% confidence interval, 1.9–3.0). There was no significant difference in the incidence of long-term hypoparathyroidism between the 3 supplementation groups.

Conclusions

All treatment strategies for postoperative hypocalcemia prevent major complications of hypocalcemia. The early postoperative treatment protocol for postthyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism does not seem to influence recovery of parathyroid function in the long term.

### PaTH forward: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of transCon PTH in adult hypoparathyroidism [^9a93875e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Trial Protocol

During the screening period and before randomization, active vitamin D and calcium supplementation was optimized to achieve a 25-hyroxyvitamin D level between 30 and 70 ng/mL, normal serum magnesium, and an albumin-adjusted (or ionized) sCa level in the lower half of normal. For the purpose of this trial, the normal range for albumin-adjusted sCa was 8.3 to 10.6 mg/dL (2.07–2.64 mmol/L) and the normal range for ionized sCa was 1.16–1.32 mmol/L. Participants were then randomly assigned to receive daily TransCon PTH 15, 18, or 21 µg PTH(1–34)/day, or placebo (subrandomized into 3 groups of 1:1:1 to mimic the 3 TransCon PTH cohorts). The drug was administered by SC injection via Ypsomed Uno prefilled pens with a 31-gauge needle. Participants were maintained at the same dose throughout the 4-week blinded period. When sCa was within the normal range at predefined visits, active vitamin D was decreased by increments of 33% to 50% (ie, by skipping the second of 2 daily doses or skipping the third of 3 daily doses) until discontinued. Calcium was subsequently decreased and ultimately discontinued according to a predefined protocol. In the event of laboratory results or clinical symptoms indicating hypocalcemia, rescue doses of active vitamin D and/or calcium were permitted.

For the open-label extension period, participants were assigned to treatment groups based on the continued need for active vitamin D. Individuals no longer requiring active vitamin D were continued on the same dose of TransCon PTH as previously. Those still receiving active vitamin D were started on a TransCon PTH dose of 15 µg/day with the titration of active vitamin D and calcium as per the initial 4-week period protocol. At follow-up visits, TransCon PTH was either increased by 3 µg/day (if persistently hypocalcemic or if sCa was below the lower limit of normal), maintained at the same dose, or decreased by 3 µg/day (if persistently hypercalcemic and no longer taking active vitamin D or calcium). Doses for the extension period ranged from TransCon PTH 6–60 µg/day, with rescue doses of active vitamin D and/or calcium allowed throughout.

Patients self-administered rhPTH(1–84) subcutaneously, once daily, in the morning. For this study, a starting dose of 50 µg/d was used for patients with a total serum calcium concentration ≤ 9.5 mg/dL (≤ 2.37 mmol/L) and for patients with a serum calcium concentration > 9.5 mg/dL who were taking ≥ 500 mg of calcium and/or any calcitriol. A starting dose of 25 µg/d was used for patients with a total serum calcium concentration > 9.5 mg/dL who were taking < 500 mg of supplemental calcium and no calcitriol. The dose of rhPTH(1–84) could be increased or decreased by the investigator in stepwise increments of 25 µg up to a maximum dose of 100 µg/d any time during the study, with the goal of achieving or maintaining total serum calcium levels in the target range of 8.0 to 9.0 mg/dL (2.00 to 2.25 mmol/L; Fig. 1). Patients continued taking the dose of rhPTH(1–84) at which their serum calcium levels were stable in the target range and that permitted the lowest possible doses of oral calcium and calcitriol.

The study was conducted in accordance with applicable International Council for Harmonization Guidelines, Good Clinical Practice, and the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments. The study was approved by central or local institutional review boards, and all patients provided written informed consent.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — management when symptoms progress or become severe: If symptoms progress and serum calcium remains < 7 mg/dL, magnesium levels should be measured and supplemented as needed; if severe symptomatic hypocalcemia develops despite oral calcium and calcitriol, a 12-lead EKG should be performed, corrected QT interval measured, and intravenous calcium administered. For rapid correction, an i.v. bolus (1–2 g of calcium gluconate [93 mg elemental calcium in one vial of calcium gluconate] in 50 mL of 5% dextrose infused over 20 min) can be used; calcium gluconate (90 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL) is preferred for peripheral i.v. repletion, whereas calcium chloride (270 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL) is prone to phlebitis and local tissue necrosis unless delivered through a central line or appropriately diluted.

14.1	Treatment of Adults with Hypoparathyroidism

The effectiveness and safety of YORVIPATH in adults with hypoparathyroidism were evaluated in a 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study (Study 1 [NCT04701203]).

Study 1 was conducted in 82 subjects with hypoparathyroidism. Prior to randomization, all subjects underwent an approximate 4-week screening period in which calcium and active vitamin D supplements were adjusted to achieve an albumin-corrected serum calcium concentration between 7.8 and 10.6 mg/dL, a magnesium concentration ≥ 1.3 mg/dL and below the upper limit of the reference range, and a 25(OH) vitamin D concentration between 20 to 80 ng/mL. During the double-blind period, subjects were randomized to either YORVIPATH (N = 61) or placebo (N = 21), at a starting dose of 18 mcg/day, co-administered with conventional therapy (calcium and active vitamin D). Randomization was stratified by etiology of hypoparathyroidism (postsurgical vs. all other causes). Study drug and conventional therapy were subsequently titrated according to the albumin-corrected serum calcium levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)].

### Safety and efficacy of 5 years of treatment with recombinant human parathyroid hormone in adults with hypoparathyroidism [^1b768f70]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

PTH plays a central role in mineral homeostasis by stimulating renal reabsorption of calcium, promoting renal phosphate excretion, and stimulating conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH] 2 D), the fully active form of vitamin D. Moreover, 1,25[OH] 2 D enhances absorption of calcium and phosphate from the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, PTH is a potent regulator of bone turnover (i.e. the coupled process of bone resorption and bone formation); deficiency of PTH results in decreased bone turnover. Conventional therapy for hypoparathyroidism includes oral calcium and active vitamin D (e.g. calcitriol), as well as thiazide diuretics and magnesium supplementation as needed. Although this approach can correct the hypocalcemia associated with hypoparathyroidism, it does not replace other functions of PTH and can lead to or worsen hypercalciuria. Other concerns with conventional therapy include unpredictable episodes of hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia; increased serum calcium-phosphorus (Ca × P) product; and complications such as extraskeletal calcifications, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and decreased kidney function (,–). Reduced quality of life and symptoms of hypocalcemia are consistent findings among patients with hypoparathyroidism receiving conventional treatment.

### Safety and efficacy of oral human parathyroid hormone (1–34) in hypoparathyroidism: an open-label study [^e0b35558]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). Medium credibility.

In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a daily subcutaneous injection of the full‐length human PTH molecule (hPTH(1‐84)), synthesized through recombinant technology as an adjunct to calcium and calcitriol (or other calcitriol analogs) treatment in order to control hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia in patients with hypoPT. Currently, two hPTH analogs are clinically available for different indications: hPTH(1‐34), the 1‐34 N‐terminal fragment of human PTH (teriparatide) for the treatment of osteoporosis, and hPTH(1‐84) for hypoPT. Both the full‐length 84‐amino acid hormone (13, 14, 15, 16) and its fully active amino‐terminal 34 amino acid peptide (17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24) have demonstrated salutary effects in hypoPT management and have lowered or eliminated supplemental calcium and active vitamin D requirements while maintaining serum calcium within the reference range. Presently, both hPTH(1‐84) and hPTH(1‐34) are only available in injectable subcutaneous forms, and although hPTH(1‐84) is approved for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism, hPTH(1‐34) is only approved for the treatment of osteoporosis. An oral formulation devoid of the injection‐related complexities will likely have a positive impact on compliance and adherence, simplifying the patients' treatment regimen and their general quality of life.

Entera Bio is developing an oral formulation of hPTH(1‐34) based on its novel drug delivery technology that facilitates absorption of proteins, which has achieved therapeutic relevant plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetics of the drug. (25) We report the results of a 16‐week pilot study aimed to assess the safety, tolerability (rate of discontinuation), and efficacy (reduction of calcium supplementation) of an oral hPTH(1‐34) formulation as an add‐on therapy to conventional treatment in adults with hypoPT.

### Management of hypoparathyroidism: present and future [^44ee550f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Conventional management of hypoparathyroidism has focused upon maintaining the serum calcium with oral calcium and active vitamin D, often requiring high doses and giving rise to concerns about long-term consequences including renal and brain calcifications. Replacement therapy with PTH has recently become available. This paper summarizes the results of the findings and recommendations of the Working Group on Management of Hypoparathyroidism.

Evidence Acquisition

Contributing authors reviewed the literature regarding physiology, pathophysiology, and nutritional aspects of hypoparathyroidism, management of acute hypocalcemia, clinical aspects of chronic management, and replacement therapy of hypoparathyroidism with PTH peptides. PubMed and other literature search engines were utilized.

Evidence Synthesis

Under normal circumstances, interactions between PTH and active vitamin D along with the dynamics of calcium and phosphorus absorption, renal tubular handing of those ions, and skeletal responsiveness help to maintain calcium homeostasis and skeletal health. In the absence of PTH, the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and skeleton are all affected, leading to hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, reduced bone remodeling, and an inability to conserve filtered calcium. Acute hypocalcemia can be a medical emergency presenting with neuromuscular irritability. The recent availability of recombinant human PTH (1–84) has given hope that management of hypoparathyroidism with the missing hormone in this disorder will provide better control and reduced needs for calcium and vitamin D.

Conclusions

Hypoparathyroidism is associated with abnormal calcium and skeletal homeostasis. Control with calcium and active vitamin D can be a challenge. The availability of PTH (1–84) replacement therapy may usher new opportunities for better control with reduced supplementation requirements.

### Evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism summary statement and guidelines from the second international workshop [^8ceb2727]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

This clinical practice guideline addresses the prevention, diagnosis, and management of hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) and provides evidence-based recommendations. The HypoPT task forces included four teams with a total of 50 international experts including representatives from the sponsoring societies. A methodologist (GG) and his team supported the taskforces and conducted the systematic reviews. A formal process following the Gradingof Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and the systematic reviews provided the structure for seven of the guideline recommendations. The task force used a less structured approach based on narrative reviews for 20 non-GRADEd recommendations. Clinicians may consider postsurgical HypoPT permanent if it persists for > 12 months after surgery. To predict which patients will not develop permanent postsurgical HypoPT, we recommend evaluating serum PTH within 12 to 24 hours post total thyroidectomy (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). PTH > 10pg/mL (1.05pmol/L) virtually excludes long-term HypoPT. In individuals with nonsurgical HypoPT, genetic testing may be helpful in the presence of a positive family history of nonsurgical HypoPT, in the presence of syndromic features, or in individuals younger than 40years. HypoPT can be associated with complications, including nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, renal insufficiency, cataracts, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease, depression, and an increased risk of infection. Minimizing complications of HypoPT requires careful evaluation and close monitoring of laboratory indices. In patients with chronic HypoPT, the panel suggests conventional therapy with calcium and active vitamin D metabolites as first-line therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). When conventional therapy is deemed unsatisfactory, the panel considers the use of PTH. © 2022 The Authors.

### Use of a systems pharmacology model based approach toward dose optimization of parathyroid hormone therapy in hypoparathyroidism [^b1a3a984]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

We present an application of a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model to support a regulatory decision, specifically in assessing the adequacy of the proposed dosing regimen. On January 23, 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Natpara (human parathyroid hormone (PTH)) to control hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism. Clinical trial results indicated that although once-daily PTH reduced calcium and vitamin D dose requirement while maintaining the normocalcemia, the regimen was not adequate to control hypercalciuria. We hypothesized that the lack of control on urinary calcium excretion was due to the short half-life of PTH. The QSP model-based simulations indicated that a more frequent dosing regimen may provide better control on hypercalciuria while maintaining normocalcemia. A postmarketing trial was recommended to assess pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics (PDs) of PTH dose and dosing regimen. Although other modeling approaches may be feasible, in this specific case, QSP model-based simulations fulfilled the information gap to support recommendations of this postmarketing trial.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^f7747f23]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association postoperative hypoparathyroidism — risk factors, thresholds, and management are summarized as follows: Hypoparathyroidism occurs when a low intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is accompanied by hypocalcemia. Risk factors for post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism include bilateral thyroid operations, autoimmune thyroid disease, central neck dissection, substernal goiter, surgeon inexperience, and malabsorptive conditions. Measurement of intraoperative or early postoperative PTH levels following thyroidectomy can help guide patient management, and in general, a postoperative PTH level ≤ 15 pg/mL indicates increased risk for acute hypoparathyroidism. Effective management of mild to moderate potential or actual postoperative hypoparathyroidism can be achieved by administering either empiric/prophylactic oral calcium and vitamin D, selective oral calcium and vitamin D based on rapid postoperative PTH level(s), or serial serum calcium levels as a guide for supplementation; for more severe hypocalcemia, inpatient management may be necessary. Permanent hypoparathyroidism has long-term consequences for both objective and subjective well-being, and should be prevented whenever possible.

### Safety and efficacy of 5 years of treatment with recombinant human parathyroid hormone in adults with hypoparathyroidism [^050665a5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Recombinant human PTH [rhPTH(1–84)] is full-length PTH that is approved in the United States and Europe as an adjunctive treatment of adults with hypoparathyroidism. Safety and efficacy of rhPTH(1–84) in patients with hypoparathyroidism have been demonstrated in short-term, placebo-controlled and open-label studies. In the pivotal REPLACE (Use of NPSP558 in the Treatment of Hypoparathyroidism) Study, a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase 3 study conducted with 134 patients, 53% of patients receiving rhPTH(1–84) vs 2% of patients receiving placebo met the primary study end point (≥ 50% reduction from baseline in oral calcium and calcitriol doses with maintenance of normal albumin-corrected serum calcium). In addition, patients receiving rhPTH(1–84) in REPLACE showed significant reductions in serum phosphorus throughout the 24-week study compared with patients receiving placebo. In both study groups, urinary calcium excretion declined from baseline, but at week 24 in both groups, the mean urinary calcium excretion remained above the upper limit of normal (ULN) for women and near the ULN for men.

RACE (Open-label Study Investigating the Safety and Tolerability of NPSP558, a Recombinant Human Parathyroid Hormone [rhPTH(1–84)], for the Treatment of Adults With Hypoparathyroidism — A Clinical Extension Study; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01297309) was an open-label extension study designed to assess long-term safety and efficacy of rhPTH(1–84) in patients with hypoparathyroidism. This article reports 5-year safety and efficacy of treatment with rhPTH(1–84) and examines changes in mineral homeostasis, kidney function, and skeletal parameters.

### Therapy of hypoparathyroidism with PTH (1–84): a prospective six year investigation of efficacy and safety [^820532b1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Human recombinant (rh)PTH(1–84) was recently approved for the treatment of refractory hypoparathyroidism, based upon a short-term phase 3 clinical trial. Long-term data are needed, because no time limit was placed on the treatment period.

Objective

We studied the effect of long-term rhPTH(1–84) treatment in hypoparathyroidism for up to 6 years.

Design

Prospective open-label study.

Setting

Referral center.

Patients

A total of 33 subjects with hypoparathyroidism.

Interventions

rhPTH(1–84) treatment was initiated at a starting dose of 100 μg every other day for 6 years. Due to the availability of new dosages during the 6-year time period of the study, the dose could be and was adjusted for most patients to a daily dosing regimen.

Main Outcome Measures

Supplemental calcium and vitamin D requirements, serum and urinary calcium (monthly for 6 mo and then biannually), serum phosphorus, bone turnover markers, and bone mineral density (BMD) biannually.

Results

Treatment with rhPTH(1–84) progressively reduced supplemental calcium requirements over 6 years by 53% (P < .0001) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D requirements by 67% (P < .0001). Sixteen subjects (48%) were able to eliminate 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D supplementation completely. Serum calcium concentration remained stable, and urinary calcium excretion fell. Lumbar spine BMD increased (3.8 ± 1%, P = 0.004) as did total hip BMD (2.4 ± 1%, P = 0.02), whereas femoral neck BMD remained stable and the distal one third radius decreased (-4.4 ± 1%, P < .0001). Bone turnover markers increased significantly, reaching a 3-fold peak above baseline values at 1 year and subsequently declining but remaining higher than pretreatment values. Hypercalcemia was uncommon (12 episodes over 6 y; 2.5% of all values).

Conclusions

Long-term, continuous therapy of hypoparathyroidism for 6 years with rhPTH(1–84) is associated with reductions in supplemental calcium and calcitriol requirements, stable serum calcium concentration, and reduced urinary calcium excretion. The safety profile remains good. These data represent the longest experience with the therapeutic use of PTH for any condition and demonstrate its long-term efficacy and safety in hypoparathyroidism.

### Safety and efficacy of PTH 1–34 and 1–84 therapy in chronic hypoparathyroidism: a meta-analysis of prospective trials [^f7959e41]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations affecting the results of this meta‐analysis, mostly in relation to the small number and the heterogeneity of the studies. However, hypoparathyroidism is a rare disease, and a relatively small sample size is to be expected. Several trials provided results from the same cohort in different reports. Because this has to be avoided in a rigorous meta‐analysis, we also reduced the number of eligible studies included. We made a significant effort to identify overlapping cohorts, enabling us to focus on high‐quality data. Unfortunately, over the years several patients have participated in different clinical trials and cannot be considered naïve to PTH treatment on enrollment in a given study. Moreover, not all studies reported similar outcomes or full baseline and posttreatment values, further narrowing the available evidence. There are also several important differences in titration regimens, dosing, and inclusion criteria that contribute to the heterogeneity of the results, possibly masking differences and reducing their generalizability. Furthermore, the data could not be analyzed in relation to different etiologies of hypoparathyroidism, which could be a confounding factor. A recent study by Winer and colleagues found that patients with genetic mutations required higher doses of PTH 1−34 than did patients with postsurgical or idiopathic hypoparathyroidism. Finally, most of the studies were sponsored, with only 10 nonprofit studies included.

### Etiology and pathophysiology of hypoparathyroidism: a narrative review [^d8055aa9]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Immediate postsurgical hypoparathyroidism

Immediate postsurgical hypoparathyroidism is defined as a serum albumin-adjusted calcium (s-Ca) level that is < 2 mmol/L (8.0 mg/dL), with or without symptoms. It occurs frequently in patients following thyroid surgery and is usually transient (> 85% to 90% of the time). A patient's s-Ca and serum P (s-P) should be monitored within the first 6 hours postoperatively and treatment initiated prior to the onset of symptoms. Symptomatic patients and patients in whom postsurgical parathyroid failure is suspected should receive therapy with Ca salts and activated vitamin D metabolites prior to discharge. Patients who undergo parathyroid/thyroid surgery should have normal serum concentrations of 25(OH) vitamin D (> 50 nmol/L or 20 ng/mL) and receive supplementation if levels are lower than this. The surgical procedure and the number of glands remaining in situ can predict the likelihood of immediate, protracted and permanent postoperative parathyroid failure. A rising s-P in conjunction with a declining s-Ca following a total thyroidectomy suggests inadequate PTH secretion and is a simple, cost-effective screening tool in lieu of intact PTH (iPTH) measurements, to delineate those at risk of developing hypocalcemia. Many centers utilize iPTH measurements within 6 hours postoperatively or prior to discharge and institute calcium and activated vitamin D metabolite therapy if iPTH drops below 10 pg/mL (1.06pM) (,–) (Fig. 2) to prevent both biochemical and clinical hypocalcemia. Although some authors and guidelines advocate for routine Ca supplementation as a cost-effective strategy in all postoperative patients, (,–) in a recent Cochrane review, there was no high-quality evidence to support this approach, and numerous reports have illustrated the danger of unchecked Ca supplementation, poor patient compliance, and medication side-effects.

### PaTH forward: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of transCon PTH in adult hypoparathyroidism [^01e1a06c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is a 2-hormone deficiency resulting in abnormal calcium and phosphate homeostasis, neuromuscular symptoms, and impaired health-related quality of life. Under normal conditions, the 2 hormones — parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitriol — act at the bone, kidney, intestines, and parathyroid glands to maintain normal serum calcium (sCa) and phosphate. Within the kidney, PTH is responsible for the 1α-hydroxylation of calcidiol to become calcitriol (also known as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3, or active vitamin D), the downstream hormone to PTH.

Conventional therapy of hypoparathyroidism includes oral calcitriol (or its analogue alfacalcidol) — because its endogenous production is insufficient in the face of PTH deficiency — and oral calcium. This approach results in the increased intestinal absorption of calcitriol and calcium in an attempt to keep sCa high enough to prevent symptoms but does not mimic normal physiology. Instead, this approach increases the filtered load of calcium; increases the risk of nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and chronic kidney disease; fails to restore normal rates of bone turnover; and fails to alleviate the burden of diminished quality of life.

In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the once-daily subcutaneous (SC) administration of recombinant human (rh) PTH(1–84) (Natpara) as an adjunctive treatment for adult patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism who cannot be adequately controlled with active vitamin D and calcium supplements.

TransCon PTH is an investigational long-acting prodrug of PTH in development as a once-daily hormone replacement therapy for adult hypoparathyroidism, and is designed to replace PTH at physiologic levels over a 24-hour period. The prodrug consists of a parent drug, PTH(1–34), transiently bound to an inert carrier via a proprietary linker (Fig. 1). The carrier blocks the parent drug from receptor binding and uptake, renal clearance, and enzymatic degradation. Following SC injection and on exposure to physiologic conditions, autocleavage of the linker occurs, and active PTH is released in a controlled manner.

### Methodology for the guidelines on evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism [^91fa0396]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

To develop guidelines for hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism, the panel assembled a panel of experts in parathyroid disorders, general endocrinologists, representatives of the Hypoparathyroidism Association, and systematic review and guideline methodologists. The guideline panel referred to a formal process following the Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) methodology to issue GRADEd recommendations. In this approach, panelists and methodologists formatted the questions, conducted systematic reviews, evaluated risk of bias, assessed certainty of evidence, and presented a summary of findings in a transparent fashion. For most recommendations, the task forces used a less structured approach largely based on narrative reviews to issue non-GRADEd recommendations. The panel issued Eight GRADEd recommendations (seven for hypoparathyroidism and one for hyperparathyroidism). Each GRADEd recommendation is linked to the underlying body of evidence and judgments regarding the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations, values and preferences, and costs, feasibility, acceptability and equity. This article summarizes the methodology for issuing GRADEd and non-GRADEd recommendations for patients with hypoparathyroidism or hyperparathyroidism. © 2022 The Authors.

### Long-term treatment of hypoparathyroidism: a randomized controlled study comparing parathyroid hormone-(1–34) versus calcitriol and calcium [^e4412919]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is one of the few remaining hormonal insufficiency states for which replacement therapy is unavailable. Previous short-term controlled trials have shown PTH to be a safe and effective treatment of hypoparathyroidism. In this randomized, parallel group, open-label trial, we compared synthetic human PTH-(1–34) (PTH) with conventional therapy, calcitriol and calcium, over a 3-yr period. Twenty-seven patients with confirmed hypoparathyroidism, aged 18–70 yr, were randomized to either twice daily sc PTH or oral calcitriol and calcium. The primary end points were calcium levels in serum and urine. Secondary end points were creatinine clearance, markers of bone turnover, and bone mineral density. Throughout the 3-yr study period, serum calcium levels were similar in both treatment groups within or just below the normal range. Mean urinary calcium excretion was within the normal range from 1–3 yr in PTH-treated patients, but remained above normal in the calcitriol group. Bone mineral content and bone mineral density showed no significant between-group differences over the 3-yr study period. We conclude that treatment with twice daily sc PTH provides a safe and effective alternative to calcitriol therapy and is able to maintain normal serum calcium levels without hypercalciuria for at least 3 yr in patients with hypoparathyroidism.

### Safety and efficacy of oral human parathyroid hormone (1–34) in hypoparathyroidism: an open-label study [^a33353e0]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) is a rare mineral metabolism disorder, with a prevalence of 22 per 100,000 individuals (1) and is biochemically characterized by low serum calcium and low or undetectable parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. The leading cause of hypoPT in adults is iatrogenic, typically secondary to excision or injury incurred during anterior neck surgery. (2) Less common etiologies include autoimmune disease, congenital absence, and genetic disorders resulting in defective biosynthesis or secretion of the hormone. (3) The characteristic hypocalcemia in hypoPT is due to PTH levels insufficient to adequately mobilize calcium from bone, reabsorb filtered calcium from the distal nephron, or increase intestinal calcium absorption by stimulating renal 25‐hydroxyvitamin D 1α‐hydroxylase activity and subsequent 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2 D) synthesis. Hyperphosphatemia develops due to the loss of the phosphaturic effect of PTH. (4)

### Hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, management and emerging therapies [^5b27264e]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is characterized by inadequate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion or action and results in hypocalcaemia, and can lead to hyperphosphataemia and hypercalciuria. Most cases of hypoparathyroidism occur as a complication of surgery, with the remainder due to causes including autoimmune disease, genetic causes, infiltrative diseases, mineral deposition or due to abnormalities in serum levels of magnesium. Hypoparathyroidism can cause multisystem disease, with long-term complications resulting from ectopic calcification as well as renal complications with nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis and renal impairment in addition to respiratory, cardiac or neurological manifestations. Conventional therapy consists of oral calcium salts and active vitamin D but it has limitations, including fluctuations in serum levels of calcium and a high pill burden, and can increase the risk of long-term complications. By contrast, PTH replacement therapy can effectively achieve normal serum levels of calcium, and lower serum levels of phosphate. The long-acting PTH analogue, palopegteriparatide, has been shown to normalize urine levels of calcium. In addition, PTH replacement therapy reduces the pill burden. Palopegteriparatide is also associated with improved quality of life in comparison to conventional therapy. This Review summarizes current recommendations regarding the pathophysiology, evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism and also references the 2022 international hypoparathyroidism guidelines. Palopegteriparatide has now been approved as PTH replacement therapy for hypoparathyroidism. Emerging therapies will also be presented in this Review.

### Management of hypoparathyroidism: summary statement and guidelines [^0ce46239]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare disorder characterized by hypocalcemia and absent or deficient PTH. This report presents a summary of current information about epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, clinical features, and management and proposes guidelines to help clinicians diagnose, evaluate, and manage this disorder.

Participants

Participants in the First International Conference on the Management of Hypoparathyroidism represented a worldwide constituency with acknowledged interest and expertise in key basic, translational, and clinical aspects of hypoparathyroidism. Three Workshop Panels were constituted to address questions for presentation and discussion at the Conference held in Florence, Italy, May 7–9, 2015. At that time, a series of presentations were made, followed by in-depth discussions in an open forum. Each Workshop Panel also met in closed sessions to formulate the three evidence-based reports that accompany this summary statement. An Expert Panel then considered this information, developed summaries, guidelines, and a research agenda that constitutes this summary statement.

Evidence

Preceding the conference, each Workshop Panel conducted an extensive literature search as noted in the individual manuscripts accompanying this report. All presentations were based upon the best peer-reviewed information taking into account the historical and current literature.

Consensus Process

This report represents the Expert Panel's synthesis of the conference material placed in a context designed to be relevant to clinicians and those engaged in cutting-edge studies of hypoparathyroidism.

Conclusions

This document not only provides a summary of our current knowledge but also places recent advances in its management into a context that should enhance future advances in our understanding of hypoparathyroidism.

### Safety and efficacy of 5 years of treatment with recombinant human parathyroid hormone in adults with hypoparathyroidism [^91ef9933]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Conventional hypoparathyroidism treatment with oral calcium and active vitamin D is aimed at correcting hypocalcemia but does not address other physiologic defects caused by PTH deficiency.

Objective

To evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of recombinant human PTH (1–84) [rhPTH(1–84)].

Design

Open-label extension study; 5-year interim analysis.

Setting

12 US centers.

Patients

Adults (N = 49) with chronic hypoparathyroidism.

Intervention(S)

rhPTH(1–84) 25 or 50 µg/d initially, with 25-µg adjustments permitted to a 100 µg/d maximum.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Safety parameters; composite efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients with ≥ 50% reduction in oral calcium (or ≤ 500 mg/d) and calcitriol (or ≤ 0.25 µg/d) doses, and albumin-corrected serum calcium normalized or maintained compared with baseline, not exceeding upper limit of normal.

Results

Forty patients completed 60 months of treatment. Mean albumin-corrected serum calcium levels remained between 8.2 and 8.7 mg/dL. Between baseline and month 60, levels ± SD of urinary calcium, serum phosphorus, and calcium-phosphorus product decreased by 101.2 ± 236.24 mg/24 hours, 1.0 ± 0.78 mg/dL, and 8.5 ± 8.29 mg²/dL², respectively. Serum creatinine level and estimated glomerular filtration rate were unchanged. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported in 48 patients (98.0%; hypocalcemia, 36.7%; muscle spasms, 32.7%; paresthesia, 30.6%; sinusitis, 30.6%; nausea, 30.6%) and serious AEs in 13 (26.5%). At month 60, 28 patients (70.0%) achieved the composite efficacy outcome. Bone turnover markers increased, peaked at ∼12 months, and then declined to values that remained above baseline.

Conclusion

Treatment with rhPTH(1–84) for 5 years demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous studies and improved key biochemical parameters.

### Safety and efficacy of oral human parathyroid hormone (1–34) in hypoparathyroidism: an open-label study [^6b21efb3]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). Medium credibility.

This study demonstrated the safety and tolerability of oral hPTH(1‐34) administered four times daily for 16 weeks to patients with hypoPT. Treatment was associated with decreases in serum phosphate, whereas serum ACa levels remained stable throughout the study. No drug‐related serious adverse events were reported and most of the adverse events were not considered study drug‐related. Oral hPTH(1‐34) adjunct to conventional hypoPT treatment with supplemental calcium and alfacalcidol led to a statistically significant decrease in supplemental calcium requirements from week 4 until the end of the 16‐week treatment period (42%, p = .001). In 40% of the patients, a 50% or more reduction from baseline calcium intake was achieved and in 73% of patients, the reduction was at least 30%. The 4‐week delay in reduction of calcium requirements was expected, as the study was designed with a gradual titration of the study drug dose. Supplemental calcium dose was significantly reduced, while total serum ACa levels remained stable during the study.

In contrast to the significant reduction in calcium requirements, the average calcitriol analog (alfacalcidol) doses did not change significantly. These results can be attributed to the study design, which targeted reduction of supplemental calcium, and its short duration. According to the study protocol, dose adjustments in calcitriol analogs were only to be implemented after reaching an adequate reduction of calcium supplement intake.

The pharmacokinetic profile of the 0.75‐mg dose of oral hPTH(1‐34) measured on the first treatment day was characterized by rapid absorption and elimination (Table 5). The overnight fast preceding the first dose may explain the slightly higher hPTH(1‐34) absorption compared with the second dose, which was administered 3 hours after a standard meal (Table 5). After both the first and second dose, median plasma hPTH(1‐34) concentrations (on a molar basis) reached the normal levels of endogenous hPTH(1‐84) (adjusting for relative molecular weight). The main reason for the different pharmacokinetic profiles of the oral hPTH(1‐34) and injectable hPTH(1‐84) is the prolonged release from the injection site of the latter, which results in the significantly longer apparent plasma half‐life (21.1 to 27.5 minutes versus ~3 hours, respectively).

After daily doses of calcium and active vitamin D were stable for 2 weeks, patients were randomly assigned in a double-blinded manner to receive once-daily subcutaneous injections of either placebo or 50 μg rhPTH(1–84) in a 1:2 ratio. The 24-week treatment period began with a titration phase, during which the rhPTH(1–84) dose was increased and active vitamin D and calcium doses were reduced while maintaining albumin-corrected serum calcium at or above baseline levels [target level: between 7.5 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L) and the upper limit of normal]. The first increase of rhPTH(1–84) to 75 μg/d could occur at week 2, and the second increase to 100 μg/d could occur at week 4. The titration phase was followed by a maintenance phase for the remainder of the treatment period. The dose of rhPTH(1–84) could be decreased at any time, if necessary, but not increased during this latter period. At any time during the treatment period, adjustments were permitted in the doses of active vitamin D and calcium supplements to maintain serum calcium in the target range and to reduce hypercalciuria. After 24 weeks, rhPTH(1–84) was discontinued, baseline oral calcium and active vitamin D were resumed, and patients were monitored for another 4 weeks.

Materials and Methods

Study design and patients

RACE was an open-label extension conducted at 12 centers in the United States. The primary objective was to assess long-term safety and tolerability of rhPTH(1–84) in adult patients with hypoparathyroidism (Fig. 1). Patients were eligible to participate in RACE if they completed the randomized, placebo-controlled, 24-week REPLACE Study and/or the 8-week open-label, dose-blind RELAY (Study of Safety and Efficacy of rhPTH[1–84] of Fixed Doses of 25 and 50 μg in Adults With Hypoparathyroidism) Study. A treatment interruption between the end of treatment in REPLACE or RELAY and enrollment in RACE was permitted. Additional eligibility criteria included serum creatinine level < 1.5 mg/dL (< 132.6 µmol/L) at enrollment, total serum calcium level at or below the ULN based on local laboratory result before enrollment, and serum 25(OH)D ≤ 1.5 times the ULN (100 ng/mL) within 16 weeks before enrollment. Patients were permitted to continue taking most baseline concomitant medications during the trial, including thiazide diuretics, hormone therapy (estrogen with or without progesterone), and antihypertensives. Other drugs known to affect bone or mineral metabolism were prohibited (e.g. calcitonin, cinacalcet, raloxifene, bisphosphonates, fluoride).

Investigators were permitted to introduce thiazide diuretics for control of hypercalciuria at or after week 16 for patients who were on a stable dose of rhPTH(1–84), had a 24-hour urine calcium level of > 300 mg (> 7.5 mmol) for men or > 250 mg (> 6.25 mmol) for women, and had not been receiving diuretics before the start of the study. Investigators administered sufficient supplemental cholecalciferol and/or ergocalciferol during the study to maintain patients' serum 25(OH)D levels between 30 and 100 ng/mL.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^973da749]. Thyroid (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) is the most common complication following bilateral thyroid operations. Thyroid surgeons must employ strategies for minimizing and preventing post-thyroidectomy hypoPT. The objective of this American Thyroid Association Surgical Affairs Committee Statement is to provide an overview of its diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.

Summary

HypoPT occurs when a low intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is accompanied by hypocalcemia. Risk factors for post-thyroidectomy hypoPT include bilateral thyroid operations, autoimmune thyroid disease, central neck dissection, substernal goiter, surgeon inexperience, and malabsorptive conditions. Medical and surgical strategies to minimize perioperative hypoPT include optimizing vitamin D levels, preserving parathyroid blood supply, and autotransplanting ischemic parathyroid glands. Measurement of intraoperative or early postoperative intact PTH levels following thyroidectomy can help guide patient management. In general, a postoperative PTH level < 15pg/mL indicates increased risk for acute hypoPT. Effective management of mild to moderate potential or actual postoperative hypoPT can be achieved by administering either empiric/prophylactic oral calcium and vitamin D, selective oral calcium, and vitamin D based on rapid postoperative PTH level(s), or serial serum calcium levels as a guide. Monitoring for rebound hypercalcemia is necessary to avoid metabolic and renal complications. For more severe hypocalcemia, inpatient management may be necessary. Permanent hypoPT has long-term consequences for both objective and subjective well-being, and should be prevented whenever possible.

### Hypoparathyroidism [^97ef2e0a]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is a disease characterized by inadequately low circulating concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) resulting in low calcium levels and increased phosphate levels in the blood. Symptoms of the disease result from increased neuromuscular irritability caused by hypocalcaemia and include tingling, muscle cramps and seizures. The most common cause of the disease is inadvertent removal of, or injury to, the parathyroid glands during neck surgery, followed by genetic, idiopathic and autoimmune aetiologies. Conventional treatment includes activated vitamin D and/or calcium supplements, but this treatment does not fully replace the functions of PTH and can lead to short-term problems (such as hypocalcaemia, hypercalcaemia and increased urinary calcium excretion) and long-term complications (which include nephrocalcinosis, kidney stones and brain calcifications). PTH replacement has emerged as a new treatment option. Clinical trials using human PTH(1–34) and PTH(1–84) showed that this treatment was safe and effective in studies lasting up to 6 years. Recombinant human PTH(1–84) has been approved in the United States and Europe for the management of hypoparathyroidism; however, its effect on long-term complications is still being evaluated. Clinical practice guidelines, which describe the consensus of experts in the field, have been published and recognize the need for more research to optimize care. In this Primer, we summarize current knowledge of the prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of hypoparathyroidism.

### Safety and efficacy of PTH 1–34 and 1–84 therapy in chronic hypoparathyroidism: a meta-analysis of prospective trials [^d6b16f8c]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our meta‐analysis of the largest available number of treated patients demonstrates that PTH replacement therapy is well‐tolerated, safe, and effective in the management of hypoparathyroidism. Unlike conventional supplementation, it has beneficial effects on serum phosphate, calcium‐phosphate product, and urinary calcium excretion, which are currently the unmet needs in chronic hypoparathyroidism. Basing on available data, no significant differences between PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84 have been demonstrated in most outcomes, except for a beneficial effect of PTH 1−84 only in reducing calcium‐phosphate product. It also improves several extrarenal outcomes, such as QoL and bone turnover. In addition to its current indication as second‐line treatment in patients with refractory hypocalcaemia, our results support the use of PTH replacement therapy in patients in whom hyperphosphatemia and increased urinary calcium excretion are a clinical concern.

### UK national chronic hypoparathyroidism audit [^b325a129]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

Endocrine leads in 117 endocrine departments in the United Kingdom were invited to complete a survey of up to 5 sequential cases of chronic hypoparathyroidism seen in their department's outpatient clinics in the preceding 6 months. The data collection tool and audit standards were developed from the recommendations in the European Society for Endocrinology Chronic Hypoparathyroidism management guideline. Specifically, the audit standards employed were:
Treatment standards: (1) Recommend treatment of all patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism with an albumin adjusted serum calcium level < 2.0 mmol/L; (2) Recommend the use of activated vitamin D analogues plus calcium supplements in divided doses as the primary therapy; (3) Recommend against the routine use of replacement therapy with PTH or PTH analogues; (4) Recommend vitamin D supplementation in a daily dose of 400–800 IU to patients treated with activated vitamin D analogues.
Monitoring standards: (5) Recommend routine biochemical monitoring of albumin adjusted serum calcium (e.g. every 3–6 months); (6) Recommend routine biochemical monitoring of serum phosphate (e.g. every 3–6 months); (7) Recommend routine biochemical monitoring of serum magnesium (e.g. every 3–6 months); (8) Recommend routine biochemical monitoring of creatinine (e.g. every 3–6 months); (9) Recommend routine monitoring of estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) (e.g. every 3–6 months); (10) Recommend routine assessment of symptoms of hypocalcaemia and hypercalcaemia at regular time intervals (e.g. every 3–6 months); (11) Suggest considering monitoring of 24 h urinary calcium excretion at regular intervals (1–2 yearly); (12) Recommend renal imaging if a patient has symptoms of renal stone disease or if serum creatinine levels start to rise; (13) Advise against routine monitoring of bone mineral density (BMD) by dual energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) — definitions and diagnostic thresholds — Biochemical hypoPT is defined as a low intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level below the laboratory lower limit (usually 12 pg/mL) with hypocalcemia, while clinical hypoPT adds symptoms or signs of hypocalcemia; hypocalcemia itself is a total serum calcium below the center-specific reference range. Transient or temporary hypoPT lasts for less than six months after surgery, and permanent hypoPT continues beyond six months. The short half-life of PTH (3–5 minutes) contributes to postoperative vulnerability of parathyroid function. Parathyroid insufficiency (relative hypoPT) can occur after central neck surgery with symptoms despite normal laboratory values.

### Safety and efficacy of PTH 1–34 and 1–84 therapy in chronic hypoparathyroidism: a meta-analysis of prospective trials [^003d1020]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Calcium supplements are often poorly tolerated or absorbed, leading to dose fractioning and the inconvenience of multiple daily administrations. Meta‐analysis of the published data confirmed that PTH replacement is effective in reducing calcium and calcitriol therapy. This reduction also appears to be clinically meaningful, with a mean reduction in calcium supplementation of more than 70% of the daily calcium dosage (~1.5 g/daily) or calcitriol (or equivalent) replacement (~0.60 μg/daily). Withdrawal of oral supplementation was also possible in a large percentage of patients after transitioning to PTH replacement therapy. Interestingly, no difference was found between the PTH formulations, suggesting that both are equally effective in this respect. PTH replacement therapy could thus be a valid alternative to calcium supplements in terms of adherence and overall perceived wellness.

Patients with hypoparathyroidism generally report decreased QoL. This is in part due to so‐called "brain fog", which persists even when serum calcium levels are well‐controlled. Our meta‐analysis revealed a significant improvement in both the mental and physical composite score of the SF‐36 questionnaire after PTH replacement therapy, although results were only available from uncontrolled studies. Long‐term studies not included in this meta‐analysis show similar findings.

PTH replacement therapy itself is not free from side effects. Although the data on its safety are reassuring, a significant number of adverse events have been reported, especially in the most recent trials with PTH 1−84. However, most of these should be ascribed to the fragility of hypoparathyroid patients, rather than the treatments themselves. Our meta‐analysis did not show any increased risk of total adverse events or serious adverse events compared to controls in patients receiving PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84.

Abstract

Context

Conventional hypoparathyroidism treatment with oral calcium and active vitamin D is aimed at correcting hypocalcemia but does not address other physiologic defects caused by PTH deficiency.

Objective

To evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of recombinant human PTH (1–84) [rhPTH(1–84)].

Design

Open-label extension study; 5-year interim analysis.

Setting

12 US centers.

Patients

Adults (N = 49) with chronic hypoparathyroidism.

Intervention(s)

rhPTH(1–84) 25 or 50 µg/d initially, with 25-µg adjustments permitted to a 100 µg/d maximum.

Main Outcome Measure(s)

Safety parameters; composite efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients with ≥ 50% reduction in oral calcium (or ≤ 500 mg/d) and calcitriol (or ≤ 0.25 µg/d) doses, and albumin-corrected serum calcium normalized or maintained compared with baseline, not exceeding upper limit of normal.

Results

Forty patients completed 60 months of treatment. Mean albumin-corrected serum calcium levels remained between 8.2 and 8.7 mg/dL. Between baseline and month 60, levels ± SD of urinary calcium, serum phosphorus, and calcium-phosphorus product decreased by 101.2 ± 236.24 mg/24 hours, 1.0 ± 0.78 mg/dL, and 8.5 ± 8.29 mg²/dL², respectively. Serum creatinine level and estimated glomerular filtration rate were unchanged. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported in 48 patients (98.0%; hypocalcemia, 36.7%; muscle spasms, 32.7%; paresthesia, 30.6%; sinusitis, 30.6%; nausea, 30.6%) and serious AEs in 13 (26.5%). At month 60, 28 patients (70.0%) achieved the composite efficacy outcome. Bone turnover markers increased, peaked at ∼12 months, and then declined to values that remained above baseline.

Conclusion

Treatment with rhPTH(1–84) for 5 years demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous studies and improved key biochemical parameters.

### Standardizing the reporting of postoperative hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy: consensus statement from the European Society of Endocrine Surgeons, the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons, and the international association of endocrine surgeons [^92cb1fb2]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Early substitution with oral calcium and active vitamin D should be routinely initiated in patients with biochemical hypoparathyroidism within 24 h post-surgery. This approach was shown to reduce the risk of symptomatic hypocalcaemia, including muscle cramps, paraesthesia, and cardiac irritability, and supported safe discharge planning. Use of standardized supplementation protocols should be helpful to prevent under-treatment and avoid emergency hospital readmissions. Sessa et al.compared three protocols for preventing symptomatic hypocalcaemia after total thyroidectomy: PTH-driven selective postoperative supplementation with calcium and active vitamin D (calcitriol); high-dose routine preoperative and postoperative supplementation; and low-dose routine preoperative and postoperative supplementation. High-dose routine preoperative and postoperative supplementation resulted in the shortest hospital stays and the lowest rate of symptomatic hypocalcaemia. Although overall hypocalcaemia rates were similar across groups, PTH-driven selective supplementation alone had significantly more symptomatic cases. No readmission for hypoparathyroidism or hypercalcaemia occurred in the study. High-dose routine preoperative supplementation was deemed the most effective and safest approach, making it the protocol recommended by Sessa et al. In addition, maintaining appropriate serum magnesium levels is essential for PTH function. Low intracellular magnesium impairs PTH responsiveness due to its role as a cofactor for adenylate cyclase, while elevated serum magnesium may suppress PTH synthesis and secretion by activating the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR).

Statement 4: Patients with biochemical hypoparathyroidism within 24 h after surgery should have oral calcium supplementation with or without an active vitamin D analogue started before discharge to reduce the risk of developing clinical manifestations of hypocalcaemia.

Consensus: Yes (8.311)

Outliers: 8

Negative outliers: 1

Evidence level: Moderate

Statement 4A: Serum calcium levels (albumin-adjusted and/or ionized) should also be measured.

Consensus: Yes (7.800)

Outliers: 11

Negative outliers: 7

Evidence level: Moderate

Adjustment protocols for calcium and vitamin D supplementation vary widely among external follow-up providers, leading to inconsistent management. To prevent iatrogenic suppression of PTH, excessive calcium intake, and potential renal complications, thyroid surgeons should proactively recommend a structured tapering strategy for supplementation.

### Safety and efficacy of PTH 1–34 and 1–84 therapy in chronic hypoparathyroidism: a meta-analysis of prospective trials [^54408b87]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is the only endocrine deficiency for which hormone replacement therapy is not the standard of care. Although conventional treatments may control hypocalcaemia, other complications such as hyperphosphatemia, kidney stones, peripheral calcifications, and bone disease remain unmet needs. This meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration number CRD42019126881) aims to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of PTH 1–34 and PTH 1–84 in restoring calcium metabolism in chronic hypoparathyroidism. EMBASE, PubMed, and CENTRAL databases were searched for randomized clinical trials or prospective studies published between January 1996 and March 2021. English-language trials reporting data on replacement with PTH 1–34 or PTH 1–84 in chronic hypoparathyroidism were selected. Three authors extracted outcomes, one author performed quality control, all assessed the risk of biases. Overall, data from 25 studies on 588 patients were analyzed. PTH therapy had a neutral effect on calcium levels, while lowering serum phosphate (-0.21mmol/L; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.31 to -0.11mmol/L; p < 0.001) and urinary calcium excretion (-1.21mmol/24h; 95% CI, -2.03 to -0.41mmol/24h; p = 0.003). Calcium phosphate product decreased under PTH 1–84 therapy only. Both treatments enabled a significant reduction in calcium and calcitriol supplementation. PTH therapy increased bone turnover markers and lumbar spine mineral density. Quality of life improved and there was no difference in the safety profile between PTH and conventionally treated patients. Results for most outcomes were similar for the two treatments. Limitations of the study included considerable population overlap between the reports, incomplete data, and heterogeneity in the protocol design. In conclusion, the meta-analysis of data from the largest collection to date of hypoparathyroid patients shows that PTH therapy is safe, well-tolerated, and effective in normalizing serum phosphate and urinary calcium excretion, as well as enabling a reduction in calcium and vitamin D use and improving quality of life. © 2022 The Authors.

Serious adverse events

Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 11 studies (330 patients). Overall, 30 patients reported at least one SEA (estimated percentage 9.1%; 95% CI, 6.2% to 12.7%). The estimated percentage of patients experiencing a SAE throughout the study observation period was 2.2% (95% CI, 0.3% to 7.6%) for PTH 1−34 and 11.8% (95% CI, 8.0% to 16.7%) for PTH 1−84. This percentage does not take into account the results from Rubin and colleagues, who described nine SAEs without reporting the number of patients. The large majority of SAEs were not considered PTH‐related.

Treatment‐related adverse events

Pooled data for the two studies that also reported adverse events in controls showed a nonsignificant association with treatment, with a pooled relative risk (RR) of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.91 to 1.04; p = 0.932), and nonsignificant heterogeneity between the studies (I 2 = 47.5%; p = 0.167). Both these studies showed an increased risk of SAEs in patients receiving PTH therapy compared to controls, but results on pooled risk were nonsignificant (RR = 1.35; 95% CI, 0.58 to 3.16; p = 0.491).

Data on hypocalcaemia were available for patients and controls. There was a reduced relative risk in patients taking PTH therapy in one study and an increased — albeit nonsignificant — risk in the other. However, pooled data confirmed a nonsignificant difference in relative risk for hypocalcaemia between patients taking PTH therapy and controls (RR = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.22 to 2.51; p = 0.626); the heterogeneity between the studies was high (I 2 = 82%; p = 0.018). Similarly, pooled data showed a nonsignificant difference in relative risk for hypercalcemia between patients taking PTH therapy and controls (RR = 3.98; 95% CI, 0.77 to 20.55; p = 0.099; I² = 56.5%; p = 0.130).

Introduction

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder resulting from undetectable or inappropriately low circulating levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is the principal regulator of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. The main biochemical abnormalities resulting from PTH deficiency are hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. The most common cause of hypoparathyroidism is neck surgery (approximately 75% of cases). Guidelines from the European Society of Endocrinology; the First International Conference on the Diagnosis, Management, and Treatment of Hypoparathyroidism; and the Canadian-led international working group provide recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of chronic hypoparathyroidism in adults. Patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism who are treated with conventional therapy consisting of calcium and active vitamin D supplements may still be inadequately controlled and have symptoms and risks of complications and comorbidities. In a 13-country patient and caregiver survey, the magnitude of symptom severity experienced by patients whose hypoparathyroidism was not adequately controlled despite receiving conventional therapy was associated with decreased health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and health status assessments and with increased caregiver burden. Evaluation of HRQoL in patients with hypoparathyroidism has proved challenging because of variability of symptoms and differing types of study designs. Many but not all studies found there is a substantial burden of illness that adversely affects HRQoL in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. A spectrum of symptomatology varying from no symptoms to severe symptoms was reported by patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism; in 36-item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-36) data transformed on a 0−100 scale (lower scores indicating poorer health states) the scores ranged from 20 to > 80 in different domains.

### New directions in treatment of hypoparathyroidism [^d7cff56c]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The history of parathyroid hormone (PTH) replacement therapy for hypoparathyroidism begins in 1929. In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration approved recombinant human PTH(1–84) [rhPTH(1–84)] as a treatment for hypoparathyroidism. Long-term studies of rhPTH(1–84), up to 6 years, have demonstrated continued efficacy of this replacement agent. Approaches to optimize PTH treatment in hypoparathyroidism include subcutaneous pump delivery systems, long-lived carrier molecules, and long-acting PTH analogues that show promise to prolong efficacy. Calcilytic compounds have been explored as a treatment for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia. Calcilytics are negative modulators of the calcium-sensing receptor and may present a therapeutic opportunity to increase endogenous PTH synthesis and secretion.

### Hypoparathyroidism [^acf27ecd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by hypocalcemia and low or undetectable levels of parathyroid hormone.

Methods

This review is an evidence-based summary of hypoparathyroidism in terms of relevant pathophysiological, clinical, and therapeutic concepts.

Results

Many clinical manifestations of hypoparathyroidism are due to the lack of the physiological actions of parathyroid hormone on its 2 major target organs: the skeleton and the kidney. The skeleton is inactive, accruing bone without remodeling it. The kidneys lose the calcium-conserving actions of parathyroid hormone and, thus, excrete a greater fraction of calcium. Biochemical manifestations, besides hypocalcemia and low or undetectable levels of parathyroid hormone, include hyperphosphatemia and low levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Calcifications in the kidney, brain, and other soft tissues are common. Removal of, or damage to, the parathyroid glands at the time of anterior neck surgery is, by far, the most likely etiology. Autoimmune destruction of the parathyroid glands and other genetic causes represent most of the other etiologies. Conventional treatment with calcium and active vitamin D can maintain the serum calcium level but high doses may be required, adding to the risk of long-term soft tissue calcifications. The advent of replacement therapy with recombinant human PTH(1–84) represents a major step in the therapeutics of this disease.

Conclusions

Advances in our knowledge of hypoparathyroidism have led to greater understanding of the disease itself and our approach to it.

### Chronic hypoparathyroidism-current and emerging therapies [^945ffe01]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by low serum calcium due to insufficient parathyroid hormone (PTH) and results in significant complications. Conventional treatment for hypoparathyroidism with calcium salts and activated vitamin D has limitations such as inadequate control of symptomatic hypocalcemia and large pill burden. PTH replacement therapy offers a more physiologic alternative to conventional therapy. PTH (1–34) has a short half-life of 1 hour and is used off-label for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism. rhPTH (1–84) has a half life of 3 hours and improves symptom control but its production is being halted due to manufacturing issues. Palopegteriparatide has a 60-hour half life and results in an infusion like PTH release profile. This molecule is effective in lowering urinary calcium, maintaining serum eucalcemia, lowering serum phosphate and reducing pill burden and is now approved by the FDA and EMA. Emerging therapies include Eneboparatide which is currently being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials. Encalaret is a calcilytic molecule which is in phase 3 clinical trials and is a promising molecule for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1. New molecules include an oral PTH1receptor agonist which is in phase 1 clinical trials. A weekly PTH molecule is also being evaluated in phase 2 clinical trials.

Discussion

Through a systematic analysis of all published clinical trials, we collated the largest group to date of patients treated with PTH‐receptor agonists and demonstrated their efficacy in restoring serum phosphate levels, reducing calcium excretion and reactivating bone turnover — all issues that are not addressed by any alternative treatment. These therapies also enabled the reduction or discontinuation of oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and had a relatively good safety profile.

The first clinical study on PTH replacement therapy in hypoparathyroidism dates back to 1996. Despite the 25 years elapsed since then, very few randomized trials have been conducted to date, and none have compared PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84. Given the rarity of this disease, the few trials conducted were small in size and heterogeneous in outcomes or design, limiting the ability to draw robust conclusions. PTH replacement therapy is not currently used as standard clinical practice according to the European guidelines. However, although the conventional therapies are generally able to control hypocalcaemia, they leave several clinical issues unaddressed: hyperphosphatemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis are a significant burden for many patients, for whom PTH treatment might well be a better alternative.

One of the concerns in the treatment of hypoparathyroidism with calcium and calcitriol supplements is the delicate balance between overtreatment and symptomatic hypocalcaemia. Our meta‐analysis showed PTH replacement therapy could be considered neither superior nor inferior to oral supplements in controlling serum calcium levels. This may be because the patients enrolled in clinical trials were mostly on target for calcium at the baseline, and their oral calcium supplements were significantly reduced or discontinued during studies. It is worth noticing that studies were heterogenous in duration. We showed that PTH therapies are safe with respect to the risk of hypocalcemic or hypercalcemic episodes.

An unmet need in hypoparathyroidism is combating the associated rise in serum phosphate levels, which are largely unaffected by conventional therapies. Active vitamin D is unable to match the phosphaturic action of PTH and can even worsen hyperphosphatemia, by promoting intestinal phosphate absorption. Our meta‐analysis revealed a large posttreatment reduction in serum phosphate and a significant difference between patients receiving PTH therapies and controls. PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84 showed a similar efficacy in lowering serum phosphate.

### Safety and efficacy of PTH 1–34 and 1–84 therapy in chronic hypoparathyroidism: a meta-analysis of prospective trials [^8f44932f]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Hypoparathyroidism is the only endocrine deficiency for which hormone replacement therapy is not the standard of care. Although conventional treatments may control hypocalcaemia, other complications such as hyperphosphatemia, kidney stones, peripheral calcifications, and bone disease remain unmet needs. This meta‐analysis (PROSPERO registration number CRD42019126881) aims to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84 in restoring calcium metabolism in chronic hypoparathyroidism. EMBASE, PubMed, and CENTRAL databases were searched for randomized clinical trials or prospective studies published between January 1996 and March 2021. English‐language trials reporting data on replacement with PTH 1−34 or PTH 1−84 in chronic hypoparathyroidism were selected. Three authors extracted outcomes, one author performed quality control, all assessed the risk of biases. Overall, data from 25 studies on 588 patients were analyzed. PTH therapy had a neutral effect on calcium levels, while lowering serum phosphate (−0.21 mmol/L; 95% confidence interval [CI] −0.31 to −0.11 mmol/L; p < 0.001) and urinary calcium excretion (−1.21 mmol/24 h; 95% CI, −2.03 to −0.41 mmol/24 h; p = 0.003). Calcium phosphate product decreased under PTH 1−84 therapy only. Both treatments enabled a significant reduction in calcium and calcitriol supplementation. PTH therapy increased bone turnover markers and lumbar spine mineral density. Quality of life improved and there was no difference in the safety profile between PTH and conventionally treated patients. Results for most outcomes were similar for the two treatments. Limitations of the study included considerable population overlap between the reports, incomplete data, and heterogeneity in the protocol design. In conclusion, the meta‐analysis of data from the largest collection to date of hypoparathyroid patients shows that PTH therapy is safe, well‐tolerated, and effective in normalizing serum phosphate and urinary calcium excretion, as well as enabling a reduction in calcium and vitamin D use and improving quality of life. © 2022 The Authors.

Table 1
Detailed breakdown of treatments used

In terms of compliance with the audit standards, these were, for the treatment standards: 63.5% for standard 1 (Recommend treatment of all patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism with an albumin adjusted serum calcium level < 2.0 mmol/L); 62.5% for standard 2 (Recommend the use of activated vitamin D analogues plus calcium supplements in divided doses as the primary therapy). Patients who had both a vitamin D analogue and a calcium supplement prescribed met the standard; 98.8% for standard 3 (Recommend against the routine use of replacement therapy with PTH or PTH analogues.) and 60.0% for standard 4 (Recommend vitamin D supplementations in a daily dose of 400–800 IU to patients treated with activated vitamin D analogues) (Figure 1A). However, it should be noted that the compliance with standard 1 was calculated from a partially incomplete data set. Although 40 out of 80 returns demonstrated compliance against this standard (50%), 23 (28.8%) returns demonstrated non compliance. against this standard and a further 17 returns contained incomplete data (21.3%), incomplete data sets arose as a result of biochemical results from the time of diagnosis not being available on the replies. The headline compliance figure of 63.5% was, therefore, calculated as a percentage of the 63 returns containing complete data for this standard.

### Calcium, vitamin D or recombinant parathyroid hormone for managing post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism [^a5cb0b82]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-surgical hypoparathyroidism is a common complication after thyroid surgery. The incidence is likely to increase given the rising trend in the annual number of thyroid operations being performed. Measures to prevent post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism including different surgical techniques and prophylactic calcium and vitamin D supplements have been extensively studied. The management of post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism however has not been extensively evaluated. Routine use of calcium and vitamin D supplements in the postoperative period may reduce the risk of symptoms, temporary hypocalcaemia and hospital stay. However, this may lead to overtreatment and has no effect on long-term hypoparathyroidism. Current recommendations on the management of post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism is based on low-quality evidence. Existing guidelines do not often distinguish between surgical and non-surgical hypoparathyroidism, and transient and long-term disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarise evidence on the use of calcium, vitamin D and recombinant parathyroid hormone in the management of post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism. In addition, we aimed to highlight deficiencies in the current literature and stimulate further work in this field.

Objectives

The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effects of calcium, vitamin D and recombinant parathyroid hormone in managing post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase as well as ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of the last search for all databases was 17 December 2018 (except Embase, which was last searched on 21 December 2017). No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomised control trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) examining the effects of calcium, vitamin D or recombinant parathyroid hormone in people with temporary and long-term post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts for relevance.

Main Results

Database searches yielded a total of 1751 records. We retrieved potentially relevant full texts and excluded articles on the following basis: not a RCT or CCT; intervention, comparator or both did not match prespecified criteria; non-surgical causes of hypoparathyroidism, and studies on prevention. None of the articles was eligible for inclusion in the systematic review.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review highlights a gap in the current literature and the lack of high-quality evidence in the management of post-thyroidectomy temporary and long-term hypoparathyroidism. Further research focusing on clinically relevant outcomes is needed to examine the effects of current treatments in the management of temporary and long-term post-thyroidectomy hypocalcaemia.

### Safety and efficacy of 5 years of treatment with recombinant human parathyroid hormone in adults with hypoparathyroidism [^36b207ad]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

Outcome measures included mean change from baseline in albumin-corrected serum calcium, phosphorus, and creatinine levels; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); 24-hour urinary calcium excretion; and impact of thiazide diuretics on urinary calcium. Other outcome measures included incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and treatment-emergent serious AEs; mean percentage change from baseline in oral calcium and calcitriol doses; and mean change from baseline in serum 1,25(OH) 2 D, bone turnover markers (BTMs), and bone mineral density (BMD). Fractional excretion of calcium (FECa), urinary calcium adjusted for body weight, and mean Ca × P product were also determined as post hoc analyses.

The composite efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients who achieved a reduction in the use of oral calcium supplements (≥ 50% reduction in dose from baseline or oral calcium dose ≤ 500 mg/d) and calcitriol (≥ 50% reduction in dose from baseline or oral calcitriol dose ≤ 0.25 µg/d) while normalizing or maintaining albumin-corrected serum calcium levels compared with the baseline value and not exceeding the ULN for the central laboratory [10.2 mg/dL (2.55 mmol/L)].

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — monitoring and timing after thyroidectomy requires anticipating the delayed calcium nadir and structured labs, as the nadir may occur 24–72 hours after thyroidectomy; postoperative measurement of absolute values and trends of total or ionized calcium blood levels are the mainstays of clinical monitoring, and at least one perioperative serum albumin level should be measured to allow calculation of corrected calcium; the cost of measuring ionized calcium level can be significantly higher than measuring serum calcium.

Preoperative vitamin D deficiency — In planned bilateral thyroid operations, preoperative serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and 25‑hydroxy vitamin D testing can be helpful; if calcium is low normal or below normal the risk of hypoparathyroidism is increased and scheduled oral calcium may be appropriate. Vitamin D deficiency categories are severe (< 10 ng/mL), moderate (10 to < 20), or mild (20–30), and to optimize postoperative oral calcium absorption it is prudent to treat vitamin D deficiency preoperatively. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved regimen is 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) weekly or 6000 IU daily for eight weeks. Given the present evidence, it would appear preferable to diagnose vitamin D deficiency and initiate appropriate corrective supplementation prior to surgery, and in elective bilateral thyroid surgery it may be prudent to defer surgery in order to correct severe vitamin D deficiency.

2.1 Measurements

Medical records were reviewed with focus on P‐Ca 2+ and changes in doses of calcium supplements and alfacalcidol. Patients diagnosed with postoperative hypocalcaemia were initially admitted to our department for monitoring and treatment of calcium homeostasis. After initial stabilization, patients were followed up at our out‐patient clinic for further titration with less frequent measurement of calcium levels on the discretion of the treating physician. After stabilization, calcium levels are measured routinely every 3 rd month, or more frequently, if needed (eg suspected hypo‐ or hypercalcaemia). If dose adjustments were needed, calcium levels were re‐measured 3–14 days later and the patient was followed closely until normocalcaemia was re‐established. If a patient was not seen for a given week, normocalcaemia was assumed as well as unchanged doses were assumed since the last clinical visit with last values carried forward. Calcium levels were measured in blood drawn in the morning and prior to medication. In the beginning of the disease, levels were sometimes measured several times a day. However, for the purpose of this study, we only used fasting morning samples. Ionized plasma calcium was measured immediately by an automated electrochemical method (Nova 8), and levels were adjusted to a pH value of 7.4. All patients were treated at our department according to the standard of care as detailed in the European guidelines for monitoring and treatment of chronic HypoPT, aiming at P‐Ca 2+ levels in the lower half of the reference interval or slightly below the lower limit of normal. The reference for ionized calcium in our laboratory is 1.18–1.32 mmol/L. In the context of guidelines allowing for a target range for plasma calcium levels slightly below lower limit of normal, we defined hypocalcaemia as levels ≤ 1.15 mmol/L.

### An open-label extension study of parathyroid hormone rhpth (1–84) in adults with hypoparathyroidism [^8d26fec9]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypoparathyroidism is characterized by inadequate parathyroid hormone (PTH), resulting in hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and bone abnormalities. Adults with hypoparathyroidism treated with recombinant human PTH, rhPTH(1–84), in the 24-week, phase III REPLACE study maintained serum calcium despite reductions in oral calcium and active vitamin D. This study assessed the long-term efficacy and safety of rhPTH(1–84) for hypoparathyroidism.

Methods

This was a 24-week, open-label, flexible-dose extension study of REPLACE (REPEAT) conducted in 3 outpatient centers in Hungary. Patients who previously completed or enrolled in REPLACE received 50 μg/day rhPTH(1–84), escalated to 75 and then to 100 μg/day, if needed, to reduce active vitamin D and oral calcium. The primary endpoint was ≥ 50% reduction in oral calcium (or ≤ 500 mg/day) and active vitamin D (or calcitriol ≤ 0.25 μg/day or alfacalcidol ≤ 0.50 μg/day) with normocalcemia.

Results

Twenty-four patients (n = 16 previously treated with rhPTH[1–84]; n = 8 rhPTH[1–84]-naïve) were enrolled and completed the study. At Week 24, 75% of patients (95% confidence interval [CI] 53.3–90.2%) achieved the study endpoint; 58% eliminated oral calcium and active vitamin D. Urinary calcium, serum phosphate, and calcium × phosphate (Ca × P) product decreased by Week 24. Mean serum bone turnover markers increased with rhPTH(1–84). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 92% of patients. No serious adverse events (AEs) occurred.

Conclusion

This study used a simplified treatment algorithm intended to better mimic typical clinical practice and demonstrated the extended efficacy and safety of rhPTH(1–84) in patients with hypoparathyroidism and confirmed the REPLACE findings. Sustained rhPTH(1–84) efficacy up to 48 weeks was observed despite treatment interruption between studies.

### Changes in treatment needs for chronic postoperative hypoparathyroidism during initiation of conventional treatment compared to stable phase of treatment [^ecf2d885]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The mean maintenance dose of alfacalcidol in the study by Halabe et alwas 1 µg/day with a range of 0.5–2.5 µg/day. This was a much lower dose than the dose needed for patients in our study, that is 16 µg/week at 33 weeks after surgery. However, the needed amount of calcium in the first weeks of treatment (7–13 g/week in week 1–11) and at the end of this study (6 g/week) was similar to Halabe et al, where the needed dose of calcium was 1.5–2.0 g/day in the beginning of treatment and 0.5–1.0 g/day as maintenance dose.

The population in this study is not quite comparable to the population in Halabe et al, due to the difference in treatment of HypoPT. Treatment of HypoPT with alfacalcidol and calcium supplements can be titrated differently. At our department, patients are treated with relatively high doses of alfacalcidol in combination with lower doses of calcium whereas other institutions are treating HypoPT with high doses of calcium and relatively lower doses of activated vitamin D. These differences in the titration of the treatment are of course of importance as it influences on the needed doses. It would be interesting to have a direct comparison of the different regimes. It seems that doses of calcium supplements stabilized earlier than doses of alfacalcidol. Dose adjustments for calcium and alfacalcidol were based on clinical judgement. Further prospective studies using a predefined treatment protocol are needed to define the best treatment regimens during initiation of treatment.

Results

Subject disposition

Nineteen subjects with confirmed diagnoses of hypoPT for more than 1 year were enrolled in the study (Table 2). Most of the subjects (16/19) were female. The median age of the subjects was 41.1 years (range 20.3 to 71.0 years), with a median BMI of 25.5 kg/cm 2. Seventeen subjects completed the study, while two subjects withdrew on the first day of the study — one who withdrew consent and one because of an unrelated serious adverse event (SAE) of hypercalcemia, which occurred before the first study drug administration and was only identified after administration of the first dose, when pre‐dose lab results were received.

Table 2
Baseline Demographics and Clinical Parameters

Reduction in supplemental calcium and alfacalcidol (or calcitriol) doses

The mean daily doses of oral hPTH(1‐34) by week are summarized in Table 3. In accordance with the study protocol, supplemental calcium intake was reduced in parallel with the gradual increase in the daily oral hPTH(1‐34) dose (up to 9.0 mg) to maintain stable serum ACa concentrations. Calcium supplement requirements decreased consistently during the study (Table 4; Fig. 1 A) and was significantly lower than baseline from week 4 until the end of the study. Median exogenous calcium doses decreased from 3.6 g at baseline to 2.2 g by week 16, equivalent to a 42% (p = .0001) reduction from baseline requirements. By the end of the study, 40% of the patients achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in calcium intake and 73% of patients achieved a ≥ 30% reduction. Although some decreases in the average alfacalcidol doses were observed throughout the study, mean alfacalcidol doses reduced 4.3% from 1.1 to 1.0 μg per day, which was not significantly different from baseline doses. Despite significant reductions in supplemental calcium doses, total serum ACa levels remained stable and above the lower target ACa levels for hypoPT patients (> 7.5 mg/ dL (10)) (Fig. 1 B). At the start of the study, 20% of patients had ACa > 8.5 mg/dL compared with 33% at the end of week 16.

### Natpara for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism [^bc33320a]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphatemia, due to absent or inappropriately low parathyroid hormone levels. For management of chronic hypoparathyroidism, current treatment options involve oral calcium and vitamin D. This standard treatment cannot resolve all problematic aspects of the disease, such as abnormal bone remodeling and reduced quality of life, and is associated with long-term complications, including nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, renal impairment, cataracts and cerebral calcifications.

Areas Covered

In 2015, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved rhPTH (1–84), named Natpara®, a bioengineered recombinant human PTH, for the management of hypoparathyroidism of any etiology, except Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia, not well controlled with calcium and active vitamin D. Herein, the authors review its chemistry, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy for hypoparathyroidism.

Expert Opinion

Replacement therapy with rhPTH (1–84) is a fundamental step in the treatment of chronic hypoparathyroidism in cases not well controlled by standard therapy, providing the natural hormone that is lacking for the maintenance of normal calcium levels, and reducing long-term risks associated with conventional therapy. Nevertheless, given the chronic nature of the disease, in the future, further studies will have to be performed to evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of the drug.

rhPTH(1–84) and oral supplement dosing and serum 1,25(OH) 2 D level

At the start of RACE, the dose of rhPTH(1–84) was 25 µg/d for 4.1% of patients (n = 2), 50 µg/d for 93.9% (n = 46), and 100 µg/d for 2.0% (n = 1; Fig. 4). At month 60, the rhPTH(1–84) dose was 100 µg/d for 72.5% of patients (n = 29), 75 µg/d for 10.0% (n = 4), and 50 µg/d for 17.5% (n = 7). Treatment with rhPTH(1–84) led to reductions in daily doses of oral calcium and calcitriol that were sustained throughout the 5-year treatment period (Fig. 5). At month 60, daily intake of supplemental oral calcium and calcitriol had declined by a mean of 53.4% ± 81.34% (95% CI, –79.4% to –27.4%) and 75.7% ± 38.44% (95% CI, –88.0% to –63.5%), respectively, from baseline. Furthermore, at month 60, 26.5% of patients (n = 13) had stopped taking oral calcium, 55.1% (n = 27) had stopped oral calcitriol, and 18.4% (n = 9) had stopped both. Despite reductions in supplementation with oral calcitriol, serum concentrations of 1,25[OH] 2 D increased by a mean of 9.1 ± 11.72 pg/mL (95% CI, 4.3 to 14.0 pg/mL; n = 25) between baseline (30.6 ± 12.21 pg/mL; n = 29) and month 60 (39.4 ± 12.66 pg/mL; n = 39).

Definitions — temporary and permanent postoperative hypoparathyroidism: Temporary postoperative hypoparathyroidism is a condition that usually resolves within the first 6 months after surgery (but sometimes can last up to 12 months) with PTH and serum calcium levels within the reference range, without calcium and/or active vitamin D analogue supplements. Permanent postoperative hypoparathyroidism is a condition that continues for more than 12 months after surgery with persistently low serum calcium levels if not supplemented; the PTH level can be undetectable, low, or inappropriately low, and to assure the diagnosis of this condition, there should be an attempt at stopping supplements within 12 months after surgery.

### Medical management of postsurgical hypoparathyroidism [^3a63397d]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a clinical update on the management of hypoparathyroidism with focus on postsurgical hypoparathyroidism.

Methods

Using PubMed, English-language literature was searched related to management of hypoparathyroidism after thyroid and parathyroid surgery. We discuss the incidence, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, early diagnosis, and treatment of transient and permanent hypoparathyroidism.

Results

Hypoparathyroidism is a well-recognized complication after thyroid and parathyroid surgery. Transient hypoparathyroidism occurs in 10% of patients who undergo total thyroidectomy. Less than half of patients who develop transient hypoparathyroidism after thyroid surgery develop permanent hypoparathyroidism. Postsurgical hypocalcemia resulting from inadequate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion could cause neurologic complications and respiratory compromise. Calcium supplements and vitamin D analogues effectively treat hypocalcemia associated with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. Measurement of PTH after thyroid and parathyroid surgery allows early identification of patients likely to require calcium supplements and vitamin D analogue therapy. Early identification and appropriate management of postsurgical hypoparathyroidism prevent hypocalcemia-related complications and allow patients to be discharged from the hospital earlier. Patients who develop permanent hypoparathyroidism should receive appropriate follow-up care to monitor for long-term complications related to supplemental therapy. PTH replacement therapy is currently being evaluated for the treatment of transient and permanent hypoparathyroidism.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary approach involving an endocrinologist and surgeon is imperative to reduce the morbidity associated with hypoparathyroidism after thyroid and parathyroid surgery. Supplemental therapy with calcium and vitamin D analogues is standard. New drugs currently in clinical trials offer promising treatment options.
