## Question

Treatment for small hiatal hernia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for a small hiatal hernia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining "small" and classifying the hernia type. Then, I should verify the clinical context, especially whether there are symptoms and objective reflux. Next, I will review guideline-based management for asymptomatic versus symptomatic cases, including medical therapy, endoscopic options, and surgery. After that, I need to examine special scenarios like recurrent hernia and mesh use. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight key uncertainties and shared decision-making points, making sure I anchor each step to the best available evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification, because treatment hinges on both size and type. A small hiatal hernia is generally defined as axial length 2 cm or less, and most such small hernias are type I (sliding), where the gastroesophageal junction migrates through the hiatus; paraesophageal types II–IV are less common and carry different risk profiles and management implications, so I need to keep that distinction in mind as I proceed [^ca9eb273] [^17748301].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the clinical context next. I need to check whether the patient is asymptomatic, has typical GERD symptoms, or has alarm features, and I should confirm objective evidence of reflux when considering interventions beyond lifestyle and medication, because guidelines emphasize aligning therapy with symptom burden and objective disease severity rather than hernia size alone [^e3e92418] [^f81db88a].

> For asymptomatic small sliding hernias, I should confirm that observation is appropriate. The SAGES 2024 guideline advises watchful waiting when the evaluation is unrevealing and the patient understands and accepts the small risk of volvulus, and older SAGES guidance cautions against routine repair of type I hernias without reflux disease, so I need to ensure we are not over-treating incidental findings discovered on imaging [^8f19199e] [^50e8e934].

> Wait, let me verify the role of lifestyle and medical therapy in symptomatic patients with small hernias. First-line management of GERD symptoms, even with a small hernia, is lifestyle modification and PPI therapy at the lowest effective dose, with escalation as needed; this remains the backbone for most patients and should be optimized before considering procedural options, and I should double-check that we are not prematurely moving to surgery or endoscopy without a fair medical trial [^f81db88a] [^732a0e54].

> Next, I should review when endoscopic therapy is reasonable. The ASGE 2025 guideline suggests evaluating for transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF 2.0) in patients with confirmed GERD, a small hernia (≤ 2 cm), Hill grade I or II, and at least one of: chronic GERD ≥ 6 months, chronic PPI use ≥ 6 months, refractory GERD, regurgitation-predominant symptoms, or patient preference to avoid long-term PPIs; I need to ensure objective reflux is documented and anatomy is suitable before referral, and I should also note that Stretta may be considered only when TIF or surgery are not available or feasible, given very low certainty evidence and limited contemporary support [^ca9eb273] [^f33e5c07] [^e7008335].

> I will now examine surgical indications for small hernias. Surgery is generally reserved for patients with persistent, troublesome GERD despite optimized medical therapy, or for those with complications such as esophagitis, stricture, Barrett's, or patient preference for definitive therapy after informed discussion; importantly, SAGES advises against routine repair of type I hernias without reflux, so I should confirm objective reflux and symptom refractoriness before recommending fundoplication, and I should discuss the trade-offs, including a higher risk of early dysphagia with fundoplication even though reflux control improves [^50e8e934] [^3c96ae6c] [^90dbec9f].

> Let me consider technical choices if surgery is pursued. Laparoscopic repair is preferred over open approaches due to lower morbidity and similar effectiveness, and when repairing a hernia in the setting of reflux, adding a fundoplication reduces objective reflux and may reduce recurrence, albeit with more early dysphagia; I should confirm that the decision to add fundoplication is individualized and that patients are counseled on symptom trade-offs and the possibility of partial versus complete fundoplication based on motility and surgeon judgment [^1695d3b2] [^3c96ae6c] [^90dbec9f].

> But wait, what about mesh at the hiatus for small hernias? I initially thought mesh might help reduce recurrence even in small defects, but hold on, I should verify the evidence. High-quality RCTs and meta-analyses show no consistent long-term benefit of routine mesh reinforcement for small defects, with some signals toward more early dysphagia and no clear reduction in clinically meaningful recurrence; thus, I should avoid routine mesh for small type I hernias and reserve mesh consideration for large defects, poor tissue, or recurrent cases after shared decision-making, acknowledging the evidence remains low certainty and heterogeneous [^b0005874] [^b387a190] [^e0265932].

> I need to ensure I address special scenarios. For recurrent type II–IV hernias without obesity, expert opinion allows consideration of conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in selected patients with multiple failures, severe dysmotility, short esophagus, or poor tissue, but I should confirm that this is individualized and typically pursued in expert centers after multidisciplinary review, given the weak evidence base and the magnitude of the intervention [^f021c33f] [^7a63bba7].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check it aligns with guidelines. If the small hernia is asymptomatic and there is no objective reflux, observation with patient education is appropriate. If symptomatic, optimize lifestyle and PPIs first. If symptoms persist and objective reflux is confirmed, consider TIF when anatomy is suitable and expertise is available, reserving laparoscopic repair with fundoplication for refractory cases or when TIF is not feasible. Throughout, avoid routine mesh in small type I hernias and use shared decision-making to weigh reflux control against dysphagia risk and the need for long-term follow-up [^8f19199e] [^ca9eb273] [^50e8e934].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and research gaps so we set expectations accurately. Much of the evidence for mesh, fundoplication nuances, and endoscopic therapies in this exact population is low to very low certainty, and guidelines repeatedly call for larger, well-designed RCTs; therefore, I need to document shared decision-making, reassess periodically, and adapt as new evidence emerges, keeping the patient's values front and center [^dd0787f9] [^904f2d6c] [^f7fbccd2].

Small hiatal hernias (≤ 2 cm) are common and often incidental; **no treatment is needed if asymptomatic** [^8f19199e]. For symptomatic patients with GERD, start with **lifestyle changes and PPIs** [^f81db88a]; consider TIF or Stretta if symptoms persist or PPIs are undesired [^ca9eb273] [^46aa6979]. Surgery is rarely indicated unless there is refractory GERD or complications. Routine mesh is not recommended for small hernias [^b0005874] [^b387a190], and **shared decision-making is essential** given low-certainty evidence [^dd0787f9].

---

## Clinical significance of small hiatal hernia

Small hiatal hernias are common and often incidental; **most are asymptomatic** and discovered during imaging for other reasons [^e8fb81af]. When symptoms occur, they are typically due to GERD — heartburn, regurgitation, and dysphagia [^b2c07261]. Complications such as esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, or gastric volvulus are rare with small hernias but can occur, especially with larger hernias or paraesophageal types [^17748301].

---

## Management of asymptomatic small hiatal hernia

For asymptomatic small hiatal hernias, **observation and reassurance are appropriate** [^8f19199e]. No intervention is needed, and routine follow-up is not required unless symptoms develop. Patients should be educated about GERD symptoms and advised to seek care if they occur.

---

## Management of symptomatic small hiatal hernia

### Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle changes are **first-line** for symptomatic small hernias, particularly with mild GERD:

- **Weight loss**: Reduces reflux and symptoms [^notfound].
- **Dietary changes**: Avoid triggers (fatty foods, caffeine, alcohol, chocolate, spicy foods).
- **Meal timing**: Avoid late meals; elevate head of bed 6–8 inches [^notfound].
- **Smoking cessation**: Reduces reflux and improves outcomes [^notfound].

---

### Medical therapy

Medical therapy is indicated for patients with **persistent symptoms** despite lifestyle changes:

- **Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)**: First-line for GERD symptoms; effective in healing esophagitis and controlling reflux [^732a0e54].
- **H2 receptor antagonists**: Alternative for mild symptoms or as adjuncts.
- **Antacids**: For occasional symptom relief.

---

### Endoscopic therapy

Endoscopic options are considered for patients with **refractory GERD**, intolerance to PPIs, or preference to avoid long-term medication:

- **Transoral Incisionless Fundoplication (TIF)**: Effective for small hernias (≤ 2 cm) with Hill grade I or II; reduces reflux and medication use [^ca9eb273] [^f33e5c07].
- **Radiofrequency energy (Stretta)**: Option when TIF or surgery are not feasible; limited evidence, but may help select patients [^46aa6979] [^e7008335].

---

### Surgical therapy

Surgery is rarely indicated for small hernias; consider only for **refractory GERD** or complications (e.g. severe esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, recurrent aspiration). Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is the standard when surgery is needed, with good long-term outcomes [^17748301]. Routine mesh is not recommended for small hernias due to limited benefit and potential complications [^b0005874] [^b387a190].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|
| Asymptomatic | Observation and reassurance |
| Symptomatic (mild GERD) | Lifestyle modifications and PPIs |
| Refractory GERD or PPI intolerance | TIF or Stretta |
| Severe complications or refractory cases | Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Small hiatal hernias are common and usually benign; **no treatment is needed if asymptomatic**. For symptomatic patients, start with lifestyle changes and PPIs; consider TIF or Stretta if symptoms persist or PPIs are undesired. Reserve surgery for refractory cases or complications, and avoid routine mesh in small hernias. Shared decision-making is essential given the low-certainty evidence base [^dd0787f9].

SAGES Guidelines for the Surgical Treatment of Hiatal Hernias—an expert panel convened to develop evidence-based recommendations for adults with hiatal hernia (HH) after systematic reviews addressing four key questions: surgical treatment of asymptomatic HH versus surveillance; use of mesh versus no mesh; performing a fundoplication versus no fundoplication; and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) versus redo fundoplication for recurrent HH. Recommendations were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology and expert opinion was utilized when evidence was insufficient. The panel provided one conditional recommendation and two expert opinions for adults with HH, and the panel suggested routinely performing a fundoplication in the repair of HH, though this was based on low certainty evidence.

SAGES hiatal hernia guideline—The panel suggests patients undergoing repair of a type II, III or IV hiatal hernia may benefit from surgical fundoplication compared to no fundoplication (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence). Evidence informing this included data from two RCTs and 6 observational studies, and in papers with direct comparative data a complete rather than partial fundoplication was performed. Outcomes with desirable effects for fundoplication included objective reflux, hiatal hernia recurrence, leak rates, and quality of life. For objective reflux, two RCTs with a total sample size of 147 patients showed a RR of 0.31, corresponding to 321 fewer patients with objective evidence of reflux per 1,000 patients with fundoplication (95% CI 386 fewer to 205 fewer). For hiatal hernia recurrence (symptomatic or large), two RCTs with 148 pooled patients demonstrated a RR 0.55, translating to 51 fewer recurrences per 1,000 patients treated with fundoplication (95% CI 90 fewer to 57 more). For postoperative leak rates, one RCT with 40 patients showed a RR of 0.33, equating to 33 fewer leaks per 1,000 patients treated with fundoplication (95% CI 50 fewer to 336 more).

Evidence reviews and synthesis—SAGES hiatal hernia guidelines base recommendations on a systematic review of evidence for each KQ with searches of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Clinicaltrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Platform, with PRISMA diagrams in Appendices B and C and using the highest-level evidence available. Two independent reviewers screened each study at abstract and full-text, reached consensus on data extraction and quality assessment, used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess randomized and non-randomized studies, and synthesized estimates using random effects meta-analysis when appropriate. The outcome of dysphagia was reported with variable granularity and baseline identification was inconsistent, which frequently introduced greater risk of bias for new, unresolved, and total dysphagia. Determining certainty used GRADEPro tables populated with the highest level of evidence, evaluated risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision, noted too few studies to assess publication bias, downgraded certainty when concerns existed, and imported data into Evidence to Decision (EtD) tables available in Appendix D. Assumed values and preferences state that no patients participated, panel members used clinical experience to judge patient values and preferences, variability across patients was addressed for each KQ, the proposed target audience is physicians who care for patients with hiatal hernias, and patients may also use the guideline as a reference in discussion with their physicians.

Guideline methods and scope—The statements included in this guideline are the product of a systematic review of published literature on the topic, and the recommendations are explicitly linked to the supporting evidence. The strengths and weaknesses of the available evidence are highlighted, and expert opinion was sought where the evidence is lacking. This is a complement to the previous guidelines on this topic, last revised in 2013, and the guideline panel utilized the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach to determine the certainty of the underlying evidence and the strength and direction of recommendations. Given that a patient-surgeon perspective was taken, and not a population perspective, considerations such as resources required, certainty of evidence of required resources, cost effectiveness, and equity were not evaluated.

SAGES guidelines—adult type II, III, or IV hiatal hernia: The guideline committee could not make an evidence-based recommendation in adult patients with type II, III, or IV hiatal hernia who are candidates for mesh placement for the use or non-use of mesh in surgical repair, citing equivocal outcome data and low certainty of evidence for the intervention compared to non-intervention. In asymptomatic type II, III, or IV hiatal hernia, the committee relied on expert opinion to propose repair can be offered based on patient and surgeon discussion of future risks considering hernia size and patient condition, and the expert opinion emphasizes that patients with objective findings of GERD and patients with non-GI symptoms such as shortness of breath or exercise intolerance should be offered repair in the appropriate setting.

- chronic GERD for at least 6 months

- chronic PPI use (≥ 6 months) for GERD symptoms

### Hiatal hernia repair with tension-free mesh or crural sutures alone in antireflux surgery (...) [^b0005874]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Results Of 145 available patients, follow-up data were obtained from 103, with 53 initially randomly assigned to mesh reinforcement, and 50 to crural suture alone. Members of our team previously reported the results of a double-blind randomized clinical trial with 3 years’ follow-up in 159 patients with chronic GERD and a hiatal hernia with axial length longer than 2 cm who underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery. 27 That study showed no difference between tension-free polytetrafluoroethylene mesh reinforcement and suture-only cruroplasty in terms of radiologically verified hiatal hernia recurrence. Study inclusion criteria were being older than 17 years, having objectively verified GERD, and having a hiatal hernia longer than 2 cm in axial length.

Included patients were randomly assigned to either hiatal closure with interrupted sutures either with or without tension-free reinforcement with a PTFE mesh. For patients allocated to the suture group, the crural defect was closed using at least 3 interrupted nonabsorbable sutures, with caution taken not to strangulate the crural muscle when the sutures were tightened. In the mesh group, the pillars were approximated only when the maximal transverse width of the hiatus was more than 5 cm. If so, the hiatal opening was reduced to 5 cm using sutures as described above. The PTFE mesh was placed on the crus behind the esophagus and secured with at least 3 sutures and 10 to 15 ProTack staples. Finally, in both groups, a Nissen fundoplication was constructed, without the use of a bougie, as described previously.
27. The sizes of most recurrent hiatal hernia were small and not different between the 2 repair groups.

In this long-term follow-up of a double-blind randomized clinical trial for patients with chronic GERD who underwent laparoscopic fundoplication, the durability of the repair of type 1 hiatal hernia of more than 2 cm in axial length with either crural sutures alone or by a tension-free repair reinforced with a nonabsorbable mesh was compared.

### SAGES guidelines for the surgical treatment of hiatal hernias [^347fa258]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

SAGES guidelines for type II, III or IV hiatal hernia repair—fundoplication benefits, dysphagia harms, and evidence certainty are described as follows: In one observational study with 58 patients, quality of life was improved by 1.5 on the GERD Health Related Quality of Life scale, but was not statistically significant, and the combined magnitude of these favorable effects was determined to be large by the panel. Harms focused on dysphagia, where in two RCTs with 157 pooled patients, the RR for dysphagia in the late postoperative period was 2.94, which would translate to 25 more patients with dysphagia per 1,000 treated with fundoplication (95% CI 7 fewer to 225 more), yet overall, the panel felt the magnitude for these undesirable effect for fundoplication was small. The certainty of the above evidence was low based on outcomes deemed critical by the panel. The recommendation basis was data exclusively on complete fundoplication with no partial fundoplication data available, and indirect evidence from GERD without hiatal hernia indicates dysphagia rates are lower with partial fundoplication than complete fundoplication. The panel concluded that in patients undergoing type II, III or IV hiatal hernia repair the balance of desirable effects, judged to be large, outweighed undesirable effects, judged to be small, which favored fundoplication, while prior GERD studies suggest partial fundoplication may be a better option with regards to postoperative dysphagia and the panel felt it was reasonable to apply this indirect evidence despite no high-level evidence in the hiatal hernia repair population.

Surgical decision factors in hiatal hernia repair—Management is complex and based on multiple factors including size and type of hiatal hernia, degree of symptoms, and associated failure of symptom control by non-surgical means. Deciding whether to proceed with surgical repair of an asymptomatic hiatal hernia can be difficult, and technical decisions that may affect the outcome of hiatal hernia repair need to be considered as well. These include whether or not to use mesh or perform a fundoplication in primary hiatal hernia repair and whether a conversion to RYGB or reattempting fundoplication in patients without obesity and with recurrent hiatal hernia is most appropriate. These guidelines aim to provide recommendations on the aforementioned dilemmas.

### Surgical considerations in treatment of esophageal hiatal hernia (...) [^d7153bb9]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

• Operations to correct esophageal hiatal hernia were done in 113 patients. Symptoms ascribed to it were present before operation in 78% of the patients, and there had been gastrointestinal bleeding in 19%. The hernia proved to be of the sliding type in 97 patients and of the paraesophageal type in 16. Surgical repair can be done from either a thoracic or an abdominal approach. The latter was used in 57% of the cases and has the advantage that it may lead to the recognition and correction of intra-abdominal disease. Relief of symptoms was accomplished in most patients. The observed recurrence rate of 10% or more was such as to discourage attempts to repair small, asymptomatic esophageal hiatal hernias. Myre TT, Kirklin JW, Andersen HA, Clagett OT.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the diagnosis and management of GERD: methodology and review of evidence [^46480d05]. VideoGIE (2025). Medium credibility.

Certainty of the evidence

Overall, the quality of evidence was very low primarily because of inconsistency (high heterogeneity) and imprecision (low sample size)

Discussion

The panel considered the evidence as important despite inadequacies due to small size studies. The panel also acknowledged the fact that the majority of patients with GERD contain a hiatal hernia >2 cm and that TIF 2.0 alone has shown evidence of efficacy in patients with small hiatal hernias (≤2 cm and Hill grade I or II). Therefore, the panel believed that if correction of a larger hiatal hernia (≥2 cm) is done surgically and subsequently if TIF 2.0 is performed, outcomes may be similar to those achieved in patients undergoing TIF 2.0 with a small hiatal hernia. In addition, the panel also discussed that combined endoscopic-surgical intervention cTIF could serve as an alternative to existing surgical therapies or serve as an additional option in the armamentarium. Evidence for surgical therapies have been established, and whether combined endoscopic-surgical therapy with cTIF is comparable has not yet been demonstrated. The panel made a “conditional” recommendation suggesting either cTIF or surgical therapies based on multidisciplinary review for patients with confirmed GERD and large hiatal hernia (>2 cm) and Hill grade III or IV.

Question 6: In patients with persistent GERD, how does radiofrequency energy to the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) compare to standard medical therapy for GERD management?

Best practice advice:

In patients with confirmed GERD, small hiatal hernia (<2 cm), and Hill grade I or II, radiofrequency energy to the LES can be considered when other alternatives (endoscopic or surgical fundoplication) are not available or feasible.

Background

Hiatal hernia (HH) is a common condition. A multidisciplinary expert panel was convened to develop evidence-based recommendations to support clinicians, patients, and others in decisions regarding the treatment of HH.

Methods

Systematic reviews were conducted for four key questions regarding the treatment of HH in adults: surgical treatment of asymptomatic HH versus surveillance; use of mesh versus no mesh; performing a fundoplication versus no fundoplication; and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) versus redo fundoplication for recurrent HH. Evidence-based recommendations were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology by subject experts. When the evidence was insufficient to base recommendations on, expert opinion was utilized instead. Recommendations for future research were also proposed.

Results

The panel provided one conditional recommendation and two expert opinions for adults with HH. The panel suggested routinely performing a fundoplication in the repair of HH, though this was based on low certainty evidence. There was insufficient evidence to make evidence-based recommendations regarding surgical repair of asymptomatic HH or conversion to RYGB in recurrent HH, and therefore, only expert opinions were offered. The panel suggested that select asymptomatic patients may be offered surgical repair, with criteria outlined. Similarly, it suggested that conversion to RYGB for management of recurrent HH may be appropriate in certain patients and again described criteria. The evidence for the routine use of mesh in HH repair was equivocal and the panel deferred making a recommendation.

Conclusions

These recommendations should provide guidance regarding surgical decision-making in the treatment of HH and highlight the importance of shared decision-making and consideration of patient values to optimize outcomes. Pursuing the identified research needs will improve the evidence base and may allow for stronger recommendations in future evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of HH.

Hiatal hernia surgery—introduction and management controversies note that surgical management options include repair with or without mesh and with or without a fundoplication; literature on routine mesh placement is conflicting, with some studies suggesting decreased postoperative recurrence while others report similar recurrence and symptom resolution with or without mesh but increased postoperative complications and more challenging revisional surgery; most prior studies were retrospective with selection bias and existing randomized controlled trials are limited by small sample sizes and short follow up; proposed strategies for recurrence include redo repair or conversion to a Roux-en-Y reconstruction, which proponents recommend for patients with obesity and bariatric indications, though it is unclear whether conversion should be chosen for patients without obesity; for incidentally detected asymptomatic hiatal hernia, some now advocate observation until symptoms occur, and previous Society of the American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) guidelines could make only a weak recommendation to repair a completely asymptomatic hiatal hernia.

### SAGES guidelines for the surgical treatment of hiatal hernias [^3db7ce0f]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

SAGES guidelines—management when no objective evidence is present explains that the management of patients without any objective evidence of reflux or micro-aspiration is controversial and there is no strong data on which to base decision-making. A thorough discussion of the potential to develop an acute gastric volvulus is essential, and the panel considers pre-existing organo-axial rotation a concerning feature. Modeling studies found mixed results, with two studies finding overall benefits in favor of the watchful waiting arm and a third study finding quality of life favored operative intervention. If the diagnostic workup is unrevealing and the patient understands and accepts the risk of developing gastric volvulus, it is reasonable to pursue a strategy of watchful waiting, and shared decision-making and thorough discussion are essential at all decision points of the evaluation for optimal outcomes.

The management of the patient with an asymptomatic type II, III, or IV hiatal hernia is challenging given the poor evidence base, and the first step is to ensure the patient is truly asymptomatic.

### SAGES guidelines for the surgical treatment of hiatal hernias [^b387a190]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

SAGES hiatal hernia repair—mesh placement versus primary repair—harms and certainty are as follows: Among outcomes deemed critical or important, repair without mesh was favored on four outcomes, none of which reached statistical significance, namely Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or greater complications, early new dysphagia, early total dysphagia, and late unresolved dysphagia. For Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or greater complications, four RCTs with a total sample size of 462 patients reported a RR of 1.36, translating to 19 more such complications per 1,000 patients with the routine use of mesh. New onset dysphagia in the early postoperative period was reported by one RCT with 37 patients with a RR of 4.75 based on 2/19 in the mesh group versus 0/18 in the primary repair group, and this new dysphagia resolved in all patients on longer-term follow-up. For total dysphagia in the early postoperative period, one RCT with 100 patients reported a RR of 3.00, which would translate to 80 more patients with dysphagia in the early postoperative period per 1,000 undergoing routine mesh repair (95% CI 14 fewer to 526 more); total dysphagia in the late postoperative period was less common in the mesh group. For unresolved dysphagia late postoperatively, two RCTs with 38 pooled patients reported a RR of 1.51, translating to 161 more patients with unresolved dysphagia per 1,000 patients undergoing routine mesh repair (95% CI 92 fewer to 698 more). Across three RCTs with 270 patients, there were no episodes of mesh erosion. Overall, the panel felt the combined magnitude for these undesirable effects for mesh placement was small, and the certainty of the above evidence was evaluated as low, with limitations primarily from imprecision and one high risk of bias study due to concerns over the randomization process. The recommendation does not address differences when the crura could be reapproximated versus use of mesh to bridge a crura that could not be closed.

### Management of paraesophageal hiatus hernia: recommendations following a European expert Delphi consensus [^c4ec2022]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Optimal treatment of paraesophageal hiatus hernia (pHH) remains a highly debated topic in upper-gastrointestinal (UGI) surgery. Numerous aspects regarding both the diagnostic work-up and the surgical management of this clinical entity are not broadly accepted, and even experts disagree on critical components including the application of surgical meshes for hiatal reinforcement, the indication for complementary sphincter augmentation and the diagnosis and treatment of short esophagus.

Based on our own clinical experience, we hypothesized that the current surgical practice may reflect those uncertainties. Since there are no uniform recommendations from national or international societies on this topic, we found it pertinent to perform a Delphi survey among recognized experts in UGI-surgery to identify recommended strategies.

### Management of symptomatic, asymptomatic, and recurrent hiatal hernia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c3d217e1]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Hiatal hernia management—systematic review conclusions state that mesh placement during primary repair results in fewer early recurrences but does not impact late recurrences, complications, or post operative symptoms, and that fundoplication during hiatal hernia repair increases early dysphagia but decreases post operative reflux without reducing symptomatic recurrence risk. For asymptomatic disease, caution should be exercised when deciding between surgery and observation, evidence for the superiority of one over another is severely lacking, and clinicians should continue to engage patients in shared decision making. For recurrent hiatal hernia in patients without obesity, it remains unclear which surgical option is the best, and because all outcomes were comparable across both groups except late reintervention, clinicians should rely on their own expertise and comfort levels when deciding on the procedure. More research is required to determine the best strategy for managing asymptomatic and recurrent hiatal hernias.

Discussion

The panel acknowledged that available evidence consists of studies with varying patient populations and varying definitions of outcomes; however, overall, TIF 2.0 showed short-term improvement of GERD symptoms and durable symptom remission for up to 5 years with low serious adverse event rates. One possible explanation for the heterogeneity of outcomes could also be that the studies were performed over a decade with 3 to 4 different iterations of TIF devices and 3 TIF techniques used.The panel discussed the role of TIF 2.0 for a subset of patients. This included patients with chronic GERD symptoms for at least 6 months, refractory GERD (defined as presence of persistent troublesome GERD symptoms despite double-dose PPI for at least 8 weeks in the setting of ongoing documented pathologic reflux),regurgitation predominant symptoms,those who have intolerance to PPI or wanting to be off of PPI, patients with Hill grade I or II, and hiatal hernia <2 cm. The panel evaluated established benefits and the lower noninvasive risk profile of existing medical therapy for the majority of the GERD population compared with invasive therapy, with the majority of the data on the short-term benefit for a subset of the population. The panel voiced concerns on appropriate selection of patients with GERD with persistent or refractory symptoms, need for objective confirmation study and other appropriate testing. Therefore, the panel made a “conditional” recommendation suggesting evaluation for TIF 2.0 among patients with chronic GERD with objectively confirmed disease, refractory GERD, patient preference to be off of PPI, small hiatal hernia (≤2 cm) or Hill grade I or II who are otherwise eligible as an alternative to long-term medical therapy.

Question 5(b): In patients with confirmed GERD and a large hiatal hernia, how does hiatal hernia repair combined with TIF (cTIF) compare to standard medical therapy for GERD management?

Recommendation 5(b):

In patients with confirmed GERD with large hiatal hernia (>2 cm) and Hill grade III or IV, ASGE suggests evaluation for cTIF in a multidisciplinary review.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most frequent problem seen in the esophageal clinic and laboratory Most patients who have a small hiatal hernia or an occasional reflux require only symptomatic treatment and some lifestyle modifications. However, prolonged medical treatment becomes mandatory in more severe cases, and these patients must significantly modify their lifestyle and try to correct the underlying causes of their condition.

### Hiatal hernia and related disorders of the esophagogastric junction (...) [^b2c07261]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

• In hiatal hernia of the sliding type the esophagogastric junction is drawn upward through the stretched esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm; in the rolling type, the esophagogastric junction is normally situated but an adjacent portion of the cardiac part of the stomach is squeezed in beside it. The two types therefore cause different symptoms. Although the most frequent symptoms are dysphagia, heartburn, and pain, they vary widely and are sometimes absent. The treatment depends on the symptoms, for hiatal hernias are rarely responsible for severe illness or complications. In the first case cited, reflux of gastric contents had caused burning sensations that were explained by the finding of esophagitis by direct esophagoscopic examination. The hernia was of the sliding type, and the symptoms subsided during five months of conservative treatment with a bland diet and antacids. The second case was complicated by the presence of a duodenal ulcer.

Measurements of motility and the use of drugs to abolish hypermotility showed that both chemical and mechanical factors were involved in the causation of symptoms, and the heartburn was relieved by the patient sitting up, drinking water, or taking an antacid.

### Giant paraesophageal hernia: what do we really know? [^15dca70b]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

Indications for Surgical Treatment of GPEH

While a sliding hiatal hernia can be managed nonoperatively in the absence of symptoms, it is less clear that GPEH can be left alone once discovered.In addition, very few patients are truly asymptomatic if they have a GPEH; they are more likely to be accustomed to symptoms than to be asymptomatic. The natural history of GPEH is ill-defined; one Finnish study showed an in-hospital mortality of 16.4% in patients with paraesophageal hernia treated with conservative therapy.Other studies endeavored to compare watchful waiting versus elective laparoscopic repair and concluded that patients would benefit more from watchful waiting. At this point, we can make some recommendations based on what we understand about GPEH. First, symptomatic GPEH warrants consideration of surgical treatment since symptoms will only worsen with time; second, a patient with a GPEH and crescendo symptoms requires surgical repair in the short term because it may portend an incarceration; third, a patient with an incarcerated or strangulated GPEH needs urgent intervention; fourth, patients with type II hiatal hernia, regardless of size, should be treated surgically whenever possible; and, fifth, patients with minimal or no symptoms should be considered for surgical repair, but with limited understanding of the natural history of untreated GPEH, we allow room for individualization and conservative management with regular follow-up. As a reflection of these heterogeneous indications for surgery, the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) guideline suggests careful evaluation on an individual-case basis.

### Morbidity and mortality following hiatal hernia repair in geriatric patients: a multicenter research network study [^e362cee0]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Hiatal hernia is a common surgical pathology, with over 60,000 repairs performed in the United States in 2018. Many such hernias are found incidentally, leaving the surgeon and patient with a difficult management decision. Given the association between age and size of hiatal hernia, this will become a more frequent dilemma as the population continues to age. Data on the effects of age on the outcomes of hiatal hernia repair may help inform the decision-making process.

The management of hiatal hernia has undergone many iterations over the last century. In 1919, Dr. Soresi published the first account of elective repair of hiatal hernias and advocated for the routine repair of even very small hernias. Fifty years later, some surgeons advocated for observation of minimally symptomatic hernias while others, including Dr. Belsey, advocated for the repair of every paraesophageal hernia. This recommendation was largely born out of concern regarding the risk of gastric volvulus with strangulation.

In 2013, the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) published its Guidelines for the Management of Hiatal Hernia. One of its recommendations was that “Routine elective repair of completely asymptomatic paraesophageal hernias may not always be indicated.” This recommendation was made on the basis of a Markov Monte Carlo decision analytic model by Stylopoulos et al. that found the average 65 year-old patient with a minimally symptomatic paraesophageal hernia would benefit more from a strategy of watchful waiting than operative management.

This model assumed 13.87% of the observation population would crossover into surgical management due to symptom progression each year. However, it did not account for worse outcomes in this scenario due to elective repair at an older age. Additionally, outcomes of paraesophageal hernia repair have improved as cases centralize to high volume centers and care improves.

This study was undertaken to delineate the modern outcomes of hiatal hernia repair in an elderly patient cohort compared to a younger cohort to help describe the potential consequences of delaying elective hiatal hernia repair until later in life.

Given these uncertainties, the decision for the use of mesh must continue to be a joint decision between surgeon and patient.

Hiatal hernia surgery (SAGES)—KQ4 on conversion to RYGB: In adult patients without obesity and with recurrent type II, III, or IV hiatal hernia, the literature search only yielded two retrospective cohort studies and five single arm, observational studies, and the panel decided that this evidence was too weak to utilize for an evidence-based recommendation. Despite this, the panel of experts agreed that conversion to RYGB may be considered an appropriate treatment option in select patients without obesity and with recurrent type II, III, or IV hiatal hernia. In a patient with a recurrent hiatal hernia after a previous uncomplicated hiatal hernia repair with fundoplication, redo hiatal hernia repair and fundoplication is appropriate. Greater consideration for RYGB would be made in the following circumstances: patients with diabetes mellitus, severe esophageal dysmotility, short esophagus, or gastroparesis, patients with previous complicated hiatal hernia repair with fundoplication who now have poor quality tissue of the fundus, and patients who have undergone multiple recurrent hiatal hernia failures by an expert, and such patients should be evaluated in a multidisciplinary fashion prior to proceeding with RYGB.

### Treatment of esophageal hiatal hernia (...) [^e03e0e32]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Esophageal hiatal hernia is now being accorded its rightful importance as a frequent cause of lower thoracic and upper abdominal complaints. Prior to 20 years ago, the roentgen demonstration of an esophageal hiatal hernia was looked upon as a medical curiosity. It is now well established that the symptomatology produced by the herniation may at times mimic that of cardiac disorders, biliary colic, duodenal ulcer, or even pulmonary disease. Many patients have been treated for the above-named disorders for varying periods of time before the correct diagnosis was arrived at. Internists are becoming more aware of the symptomatology produced by hiatal hernia, and an increasing number of patients are being referred for surgical correction of the anatomic defect. Also, the results following surgical repair have improved over the past decade due to a better understanding of the anatomic and physiologic derangements produced by the herniation. However, in spite of the. HERRINGTON JL.

### Evolution and development of surgery for large paraesophageal hiatus hernia [^f48c49e8]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic repair is the standard surgical approach to the problem of large paraesophageal hiatus hernia. It is associated with low risks of morbidity and mortality, although there is a small risk (less than 5%) of a clinically significant recurrent hernia. Various techniques have been proposed to minimise this risk, including esophageal lengthening procedures and mesh reinforcement of the hiatus. Both remain controversial. Radiological outcomes from randomised trials suggest that a reduction in hernia recurrence rates can be achieved with the use of mesh repair, although these trials have not demonstrated any clinically significant benefits for mesh repair. The risk of complications following mesh placement at the esophageal hiatus or an esophageal lengthening procedure needs to be balanced against potential benefits. More work is required to define the optimal approach to repair of large paraesophageal hiatus hernias.

### What are the differences in the outcome of laparoscopic axial (I) versus paraesophageal (II-IV) hiatal hernia repair? [^17748301]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Four anatomic patterns of hiatal hernia can be recognized. Axial or sliding (type I) hernia, in which the gastroesophageal junction migrates into the thorax, is the most common type of hiatal hernia (95%) and may predispose to gastroesophageal reflux. Type II represents a true paraesophageal hernia with herniation of the gastric fundus anterior to a normally positioned esophagogastric junction. Type III, with both elements of types I and II hiatal hernia, tends to be large with more than 50% of the stomach within the mediastinal sac. In type IV hernias, the stomach, sometimes with other viscera such as the colon or spleen, migrates completely in the hernia sac, which may result in an “upside-down stomach”. Patients with an axial/sliding or type I hernia and long-term treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and continuous reduced quality of life, persistent troublesome symptoms, and/or progression of disease despite adequate proton pump inhibitor therapy in dosage and intake are the best candidates for surgery. Although paraesophageal hernias types II–IV account for only 5% of all hiatal hernias, their detection is important because of potentially life-threatening complications, such as obstruction, acute dilatation, perforation, or bleeding of the stomach mucosa. In essence, no conventional options are available for the treatment of paraesophageal hernia, so surgical repair is recommended for relief of symptoms.

Laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair is as effective as open transabdominal repair, with a reduced rate of perioperative morbidity and with shorter hospital stays. It is the preferred approach for the majority of hiatal hernias. Laparoscopic posterior fundoplication is given preference over laparoscopic anterior fundoplication due to a lower recurrence rate in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Thirteen randomized controlled trials with 1564 patients showed for Toupet versus Nissen fundoplication significantly lower rates of adverse results involving dysphagia, gas-bloat syndrome, inability to belch, and reoperation due to severe dysphagia. Mesh application should be considered for large hiatal hernia repair because it reduces recurrences, at least in the midterm. Overall, procedure-related complications and mortality do not seem to be increased despite potential mesh-associated complications.

### Giant hiatal hernia [^cecd7a46]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

A giant hiatal hernia (HH) is a hernia that includes at least 30% of the stomach in the chest, although a uniform definition does not exist; most commonly, a giant HH is a type III hernia with a sliding and paraesophageal component. The etiology of giant HH is not entirely clear, and two potential mechanisms exist: (1) gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) leads to esophageal scarring and shortening with resulting traction on the gastroesophageal junction and gastric herniation; and (2) chronic positive pressure on the diaphragmatic hiatus combined with a propensity to herniation leads to gastric displacement into the chest, resulting in GERD. The short esophagus and GERD are key concepts to understanding the pathophysiology of giant HH, and these concepts are critical to address this problem appropriately. A successful repair of giant HH requires adherence to basic hernia repair principles (ie, hernia sac excision, tension-free repair), recognition and correction of a short esophagus, and a well-performed antireflux procedure. Recurrence rates for open giant HH repairs in expert hands range between 2% and 12%; large series have demonstrated that meticulous laparoscopic surgical technique can emulate the results of open giant HH repair.

### What are the differences in the outcome of laparoscopic axial (I) versus paraesophageal (II-IV) hiatal hernia repair? [^1d9ef8bf]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

In the literature, there is only one publication with a large case series which compares the patient collective, treatment, and the outcome of laparoscopic repair of type I hiatal hernias with those of paraesophageal hiatal hernias (types II–IV). In that study, most of the complications occurred in patients with paraesophageal compared with axial hernia (10 vs 1%, respectively). This variation reflects significant differences between patients with axial hiatal hernia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, and those with paraesophageal hernia; it also highlights the increased complexity of the laparoscopic repair procedure used for paraesophageal hernia. Based on data from the Herniamed Hernia Registry, this paper now explores the differences between these patients in terms of demographic characteristics, treatment, and outcome.

### Management of paraesophageal hiatus hernia: recommendations following a European expert Delphi consensus [^ce24293b]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We performed this comprehensive survey among experts for UGI-surgery with the aim to identify recommended strategies for the treatment of pHH repair. As a result, we were able to identify high rates of concordance regarding indications for surgery, preoperative work-up, and several technical-surgical steps of hiatal dissection and reconstruction. However, an important lesson from this survey is that only few basic strategies for pHH are currently unanimously “recommended” or “discouraged”. Thus, huge uncertainties remain for many classical adjuncts such as the use of meshes, sphincter augmentation, and gastropexy, but also for the management of Short Esophagus and the correct definition and diagnosis of recurrence or failure. The limited concordance across elementary steps of pHH treatment observed in this European expert Delphi may reflect the influence of different surgical schools, but certainly mirrors a general therapeutic uncertainty caused by a notorious lack of reliable data and scientific evidence in the field.

### Managing gastroesophageal reflux disease for the lifetime of the patient: evaluating the long-term options [^732a0e54]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Lifetime management goals of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are to control esophageal as well as extraesophageal symptoms, maintain a stable noninflamed esophageal mucosa, and prevent complications. Large randomized clinical trials and >16 years of worldwide experience have confirmed the high rate of efficacy and excellent safety profile of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in individuals with all grades of GERD, making these agents the mainstay of treatment. Despite these outcomes, some individuals may desire an alternative to pharmacologic therapy. In such patients, laparoscopic fundoplication may produce symptom relief and healing of esophagitis, but its invasiveness, cost, and inherent surgical risks have created an interest in a variety of endoscopic therapies for reflux disease. Several short-term uncontrolled trials of these endoscopic therapies have reported encouraging preliminary results; however, careful patient selection as well as clinician experience is critical for their success. In addition to clinician expertise with the procedure, success has been observed only in patients with nonerosive GERD and a hiatal hernia <3 cm, abnormal pH monitoring, and normal esophageal motility studies, as well as in those who have experienced at least partial symptom relief with PPI therapy. Endoscopic therapy should not be considered the standard of care in patients with erosive disease or large hiatal hernias.

### The status of endoscopic therapies for gastroesophageal reflux disease [^34987249]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is exceedingly common and can significantly impact quality of life through heartburn, troublesome regurgitation, or atypical symptoms. The initial approach is conservative lifestyle changes followed by medications with escalation to antireflux surgery as needed. Endoscopic therapy may represent a bridge between pharmacotherapy and surgery and represents an appropriate option for select individuals.

Recent Findings

Appropriate patient selection for endoscopic antireflux therapies is critical to the success of the intervention. Candidates for endoscopic treatment with trans-oral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) include those with a small (<2cm) or no hiatal hernia and a Hill valve grade 1 or 2. Transoral incisionless fundoplication with concomitant hiatal hernia repair (cTIF) is a safe and effective option that addresses both the crural diaphragm and gastroesophageal flap valve (GEFV).

Summary

Endoscopic interventions for GERD continue to evolve and are not all created equal. Given our current understanding of the mechanisms of GERD, the TIF procedure stands out in its ability to re-create the optimal GEFV. In those patients with altered anatomy, endoscopic approaches may offer at least partial benefit.

Evidence

We performed a systematic review of the published literature on this topic using Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane for studies published through December 2022. We used major search terms and subheadings including “gastroesophageal reflux disease,” “endoscopic therapy,” “combined transoral incisionless fundoplication,” “hiatal hernia repair,” and “plication.” The systematic review was restricted to studies assessing the efficacy and safety of combined TIF and hiatal hernia repair (cTIF) for GERD compared with PPI and/or sham intervention. Our literature search identified 7 cohort studies (3 prospective, 4 retrospective),,,,,,and an ongoing multicenter RCT (Clinical trials identifier: NCT04795934). Details on outcomes of cTIF compared with PPI and/or sham intervention on GERD symptoms were collected from existing cohort studies. Outcomes of interest included PPI discontinuation, reduction in acid exposure time (percentage of time pH was <4), normalization of esophageal acid exposure time (per patient), symptom resolution (per patient), durable symptom resolution, GERD score improvement (using GERD-HRQL or similar scales), and adverse events (including severe adverse events and post-TIF dysphagia). All of the included cohort studies scored ≥7 on the Qumseya scale.

A summary of outcomes and their assessment can be seen in Table 9.

### Should small sliding hiatal hernias be reported at CT colonography? [^e8fb81af]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of our study was to determine whether colonic distention at CT colonography (CTC) induces small incidental sliding hiatal hernias.

Materials and Methods

This study evaluated for the presence and, if present, the size (small, moderate, or large) of sliding (type 1) hiatal hernias in 3126 consecutive asymptomatic adults (mean age ± SD, 57.0 ± 7.4 years) undergoing screening CTC. Colonic distention was achieved with automated continuous CO(2) delivery. As an internal control, standard CT studies (i.e., without colonography technique) were available for comparison in 123 individuals with a hernia present at CTC. In addition, the prevalence of hiatal hernia was assessed in an external control group of 488 adults (mean age, 60.8 years) undergoing abdominal CT without colonic distention. The Fisher exact test was used to test for statistical significance.

Results

Hiatal hernias were present in 47.8% (1495/3126) of adults at screening CTC (86% small, 13% moderate, 1% large). Abdominal CT of the 123 internal control subjects showed resolution of the hernia in 64.2% (79/123) of cases and was smaller in an additional 12 cases. The prevalence of sliding hiatal hernias in the external control group was 23.8% (116/488), significantly lower than in the CTC screening cohort (p < 0.0001). After applying an empiric correction factor based on results from the internal control group to account for technique-induced hernias, the estimated prevalence for the CTC cohort more closely matched that for the external control subjects.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that small sliding hiatal hernias are commonly induced by colonic distention at CTC and should probably not be reported to avoid inappropriate diagnosis, workup, or treatment.

The panel also discussed the newer potassium channel competitive acid blockers (PCABs) and their positioning in the GERD management. These agents were not readily available in North America at the time of evidence review and panel meeting. A recent RCT demonstrated effectiveness of Vonoprazan over lansoprazole for healing and maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis.A recent systematic review and meta-analysis (19 studies, 7023 subjects) also showed that Vonoprazan is superior to PPI in first-line Helicobacter pylori eradication and erosive esophagitis but noninferior in other gastric acid–related diseases.Panel agreed unanimously that existing data do not show superiority of PCABs for PPIs overall for GERD but likely that PCABs are more potent for erosive esophagitis and that their long-term adverse event data are not available. The panel, however, also agreed that with evolving data, PCABs likely will be used for confirmed patients with GERD after discussion of existing data and risks and benefits.

Recommendation 5(a):

In patients with confirmed GERD with small hiatal hernia (≤2 cm) and Hill grade I or II who meet any of the following criteria, the ASGE suggests evaluation for TIF as an alternative to long-term medical management.

Criteria:
- Chronic GERD (at least 6 months)
- Long-term proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use (at least 6 months) for management of GERD symptoms
- Refractory GERD
- Regurgitation-predominant GERD
- Patient prefers to avoid long-term PPI use (Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)

Decision criteria and additional considerations—No evidence was found for adult patients and the panel did not think that pediatric findings would be generalizable to adult patients. The panel was in agreement that the evidence clearly favors minimal dissection, though some minority of the panel members felt the degree of certainty in the evidence may warrant a less definitive recommendation. The panel made recommendations that research priorities include the need for studies in adults, additional studies with longer follow-up and minimal attrition to determine long-term failure rates, and additional research on the degree of mobilization appropriate in the setting of concomitant hiatal hernia.

### Lessons learned from revision procedures: a case series pleading for reinforcement of the anterior hiatus in recurrent hiatal hernia [^4d0fd50c]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

The finding that the left anterior quadrant is involved in 80% in recurrent hiatal hernia is an important step in developing new effective treatment strategies to reduce the recurrence rate. Recurrence after large hiatal hernia repair is relatively common with numbers increasing up to 57% on long term follow-up. Most recurrent HH are small and may be asymptomatic or will result minor symptoms. A significant part of recurrent HH will require medication, mainly proton-pump inhibitors. When symptom are insufficiently controlled by medication, surgical revision. Several treatment strategies to reduce recurrence rates have been deployed in the past. A commonly used strategy is to reinforce the crural repair with a (non-) absorbable onlay mesh. This strategy does not pursue tension-free repair, but tends to create extra tensile strength at the hiatus. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials investigated the effect of mesh reinforcement of crural repair on short- and long-term recurrence rates. In almost all included studies, the mesh was positioned and fixated at the posterior hiatus, leaving the anterior part untouched (see Table 4). Our results suggest that this strategy is not effective to prevent recurrence, as the majority of these recurrences is located anteriorly. It is therefore not surprising that no significant difference was found in the recurrence rate between primary crural repair and onlay mesh reinforcement at long-term follow up.
