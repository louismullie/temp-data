## Question

what other test i can perform to confirm the positive tppa

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what other tests can be performed to confirm a positive TPPA result. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the testing algorithm context and whether TPPA was the initial screen or the confirmatory test. Then, I should verify the role of nontreponemal testing and how to interpret discordant results. Next, I will consider when a second treponemal assay is warranted and which ones to choose. After that, I need to check for special situations like neurosyphilis, pregnancy, and HIV. Finally, I will integrate clinical history and outline a practical, stepwise approach with clear actions and follow-up timing.

> Let me first confirm the testing context, because I need to ensure I'm not mixing up the sequence. TPPA is a treponemal test, and if it was used as the initial screening assay in a reverse sequence algorithm, then the next step is to obtain a quantitative nontreponemal test (RPR or VDRL) with titer to assess disease activity and guide management, whereas if TPPA was already used as a confirmatory test after a reactive nontreponemal screen, then the diagnosis is already presumptive and staging should proceed clinically [^d8c70202] [^5be53c46].

> Wait, let me verify the role of nontreponemal testing because I should not jump to conclusions. A reactive treponemal test alone cannot distinguish current from past infection, so a quantitative RPR or VDRL is essential to determine activity; if the nontreponemal test is reactive, that supports active infection and provides a baseline titer for monitoring, whereas if it is nonreactive, that creates discordance that needs resolution with a second treponemal assay and clinical correlation [^d8c70202] [^c7ef6c4c].

> I will now examine discordant scenarios, because this is where errors often occur. If TPPA is positive and RPR/VDRL is negative, I should confirm with a different treponemal test that uses distinct antigens or a different platform, preferably TP-PA if not already used, or an EIA/CIA with different antigenic targets; this helps adjudicate false positives from automated treponemal screens and clarifies whether this reflects past treated infection, very early primary disease, or late latent infection [^d8c70202] [^ed0dd557] [^c30afff2].

> Hold on, I should verify which second treponemal assays are reasonable alternatives when TP-PA is unavailable or already used. FTA-ABS is an option, but I need to remember it is more subjective and less favored than TP-PA; alternatively, a different treponemal immunoassay with different antigens can be used, and some laboratories may leverage high signal-to-cutoff values from EIA/CIA to predict TP-PA positivity, though thresholds vary by platform and should be interpreted cautiously [^c30afff2] [^1e1c1354].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, discordant treponemal-positive, nontreponemal-negative results warrant a second treponemal test on the same specimen and careful maternal–neonatal management planning. In people with HIV, interpretation is the same as in those without HIV, but prozone can occur and CSF evaluation is indicated if neurosyphilis is suspected. For neurosyphilis, CSF-VDRL is specific but insensitive, so CSF FTA-ABS or TP-PA may be needed when clinical suspicion remains high despite a negative CSF-VDRL [^d6096408] [^d0c0e45e] [^f1f4ec65] [^d7282114].

> Let me consider direct detection options, because I should not rely solely on serology in early disease. If there is a suspicious lesion, darkfield microscopy or locally validated T. pallidum PCR can provide organism-level confirmation in primary syphilis, but availability of validated PCR is limited and darkfield requires appropriate specimens and expertise; these are most useful when serology is negative but suspicion is high or when distinguishing syphilis from other genital ulcers [^cb3f6606] [^002a1294].

> I need to ensure I integrate clinical history and risk, because serology without context misleads. I should confirm prior treatment history, document symptoms and signs, assess sexual exposures and timing, and consider epidemiology; in low-prevalence settings, isolated treponemal positivity is more likely to be false positive, whereas in high-prevalence or high-risk populations it more often reflects current or past infection, and repeat serology in 2–4 weeks can help if early infection is suspected [^d8c70202] [^78dc336b].

> But wait, what if the patient is asymptomatic and the treponemal test is only weakly positive? I should double-check for biologic false positives and repeat testing, because weak reactivity on some automated treponemal assays correlates with lower confirmation rates on TP-PA, and a subset of discordant results serorevert on repeat testing, especially in low-risk individuals; documenting this prevents overtreatment and unnecessary anxiety [^32095b85] [^55119671].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. If TPPA was the initial screen, obtain a quantitative RPR or VDRL now. If TPPA was already the confirmatory test after a reactive nontreponemal, proceed to staging and treatment. If TPPA is positive and RPR/VDRL is negative, perform a second treponemal assay different from the initial platform, interpret in light of history and risk, and if early infection remains possible, repeat RPR/VDRL in 2–4 weeks. If neurosyphilis is suspected, add CSF analysis with CSF-VDRL and consider CSF FTA-ABS or TP-PA when CSF-VDRL is negative but suspicion persists [^d8c70202] [^f1f4ec65] [^d7282114].

> In summary, I should confirm a positive TPPA by obtaining a quantitative nontreponemal test to assess activity, and if discordant, adjudicate with a different treponemal assay and clinical correlation. Direct detection from lesions can help in early disease, and management must be anchored to history, exam, and epidemiology rather than a single serologic result [^d8c70202] [^cb3f6606] [^78dc336b].

To confirm a positive TPPA, order a **quantitative nontreponemal test (RPR or VDRL)** to assess disease activity and guide management [^d8c70202] [^5be53c46]. If the nontreponemal test is negative or discordant, perform a **second treponemal assay** (FTA-ABS or a different EIA/CIA) to resolve ambiguity [^d8c70202] [^ed0dd557]. In pregnancy, always confirm with a nontreponemal test and, if discordant, add a second treponemal test [^d6096408] [^a600e4ac]. For neurosyphilis suspicion, include CSF analysis (CSF-VDRL, cell count, protein) and consider CSF FTA-ABS or TP-PA if CSF-VDRL is negative but suspicion remains [^f1f4ec65] [^d7282114]. No single test suffices; interpret results with clinical context and, if early infection is possible, repeat serology in 2–4 weeks [^cb3f6606] [^78dc336b].

---

## Recommended confirmatory tests

### Nontreponemal tests (RPR or VDRL)

- **Purpose**: Quantitative RPR or VDRL assess disease activity and treatment response; titers typically decline after therapy [^d8c70202] [^3fafff2f].
- **Interpretation**: A reactive nontreponemal test with a positive TPPA confirms active infection; a nonreactive nontreponemal test with a positive TPPA may indicate past/treated infection or early/late disease [^d8c70202] [^78dc336b].
- **Limitations**: False positives can occur (e.g. pregnancy, autoimmune disease, recent vaccination, HIV) [^098c3902].

---

### Second treponemal test (FTA-ABS or different EIA/CIA)

- **Purpose**: Resolve discordant results (TPPA positive, RPR/VDRL negative) and distinguish false positives from true infection [^d8c70202] [^ed0dd557].
- **Interpretation**: A positive second treponemal test supports current or past infection; a negative second test suggests a false-positive TPPA, especially in low-risk settings [^d8c70202] [^32095b85].
- **Limitations**: FTA-ABS is less specific and not recommended for primary confirmation; TP-PA is preferred when available [^c30afff2].

---

## Special considerations

### Pregnancy

In pregnancy, **confirm a positive TPPA with a quantitative nontreponemal test** (RPR or VDRL) [^d6096408] [^a600e4ac]. If the nontreponemal test is negative, perform a **second treponemal test** (preferably TP-PA) on the same specimen to adjudicate discordant results [^d6096408] [^d0c0e45e].

---

### Neurosyphilis

For neurosyphilis, **obtain CSF analysis** (CSF-VDRL, cell count, protein) when neurologic, ocular, or otic symptoms are present [^f1f4ec65] [^d7282114]. If CSF-VDRL is negative but suspicion remains, perform **CSF FTA-ABS or TP-PA**, recognizing limited specificity and the need for clinical correlation [^f1f4ec65] [^953ef56e].

---

### HIV infection

In HIV infection, interpret serology as in HIV-negative patients, but maintain a **higher suspicion for false positives** and prozone phenomena; consider repeat testing or alternative algorithms if results are discordant [^01aba5e7] [^b0f4898e].

---

## Clinical context and follow-up

Always interpret results with **clinical history, exam, and risk assessment** [^d8c70202] [^78dc336b]. If early infection is suspected, **repeat serology in 2–4 weeks**, as antibodies may not yet be detectable [^d8c70202] [^78dc336b].

## Summary of confirmatory testing algorithm

| **Step** | **Test** | **Purpose** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Quantitative RPR or VDRL | Assess activity; monitor response | Reactive = active; nonreactive = past/early/late |
| 2 | Second treponemal test (FTA-ABS or different EIA/CIA) | Resolve discordance | Positive = true infection; negative = false-positive |
| 3 | CSF analysis (CSF-VDRL, cell count, protein) | Neurosyphilis evaluation | Abnormal + symptoms = neurosyphilis |
| 4 | CSF FTA-ABS or TP-PA | Confirm neurosyphilis if CSF-VDRL negative | Positive + clinical context = neurosyphilis |

---

A positive TPPA requires a **nontreponemal test** (RPR or VDRL) to confirm activity, with a **second treponemal test** if results are discordant. Add CSF testing for neurosyphilis suspicion and interpret all results in clinical context, repeating serology if early infection is possible.

Acquired syphilis — diagnosis requires that a reactive nontreponemal test must be confirmed by a specific treponemal test such as FTA-ABS or TP-PA; treponemal tests usually remain positive for life, even with successful treatment, the prozone phenomenon is more likely in HIV-infected patients, and treponemal antibody titers do not correlate with disease activity and should not be used to monitor treatment response.

Syphilis screening tests in pregnancy — Screening should include both a treponemal and nontreponemal test, with initial screening followed by a nontreponemal test for reactive samples; discordant results in the reverse sequence are resolved with a second confirmatory treponemal test (TP-PA preferred). Point-of-care tests for antibodies to T pallidum are available that can be performed in a clinical setting or at home using fingerstick blood samples that do not require laboratory processing, but it is unclear how results from these tests alone, without additional confirmatory testing, should guide treatment decisions.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^d8c70202]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Syphilis — treponemal tests and reverse sequence algorithm — 15%–25% of patients treated during the primary stage revert to being serologically nonreactive after 2–3 years, and treponemal antibody titers should not be used to predict treatment response. For a positive treponemal screening test, the laboratory should have a standard quantitative nontreponemal test with titer performed reflexively. If the nontreponemal test is negative, the laboratory should perform a treponemal test different from the one used for initial screening, preferably TP-PA or a treponemal assay based on different antigens, to adjudicate results. If the second treponemal test is positive (e.g. EIA reactive, rapid plasma reagin [RPR] nonreactive, or TP-PA reactive), persons with a history of previous treatment will require no further management unless sexual history indicates a reexposure, and a repeat nontreponemal test 2–4 weeks after a confirmed medical history and physical examination is recommended to evaluate for early infection; those without a history of treatment should be offered treatment and, unless history or examination indicates recent infection, should be treated for syphilis of unknown duration or late latent syphilis. If the second treponemal test is negative (e.g. EIA reactive, RPR nonreactive, TP-PA nonreactive) and epidemiologic risk and clinical probability are low, further evaluation or treatment is not indicated.

Treponemal Tests and Reverse Sequence Algorithm

The majority of patients who have reactive treponemal tests will have reactive tests for the remainder of their lives, regardless of adequate treatment or disease activity. However, 15%–25% of patients treated during the primary stage revert to being serologically nonreactive after 2–3 years. Treponemal antibody titers do not predict treatment response and therefore should not be used for this purpose.

Clinical laboratories sometimes screen syphilis serologic samples by using automated treponemal immunoassays, typically by EIA or CIA. This reverse sequence algorithm for syphilis testing can identify persons previously treated for syphilis, those with untreated or incompletely treated syphilis, and those with false-positive results that can occur with a low likelihood of infection. Persons with a positive treponemal screening test should have a standard quantitative nontreponemal test with titer performed reflexively by the laboratory to guide patient management decisions. If the nontreponemal test is negative, the laboratory should perform a treponemal test different from the one used for initial testing, preferably TP-PA or treponemal assay based on different antigens than the original test, to adjudicate the results of the initial test.

If a second treponemal test is positive (e.g. EIA reactive, RPR nonreactive, or TP-PA reactive), persons with a history of previous treatment will require no further management unless sexual history indicates a reexposure. In this instance, a repeat nontreponemal test 2–4 weeks after a confirmed medical history and physical examination is recommended to evaluate for early infection. Those without a history of treatment for syphilis should be offered treatment. Unless a medical history or results of a physical examination indicate a recent infection, previously untreated persons should be treated for syphilis of unknown duration or late latent syphilis.

If the second treponemal test is negative (e.g. EIA reactive, RPR nonreactive, TP-PA nonreactive) and the epidemiologic risk and clinical probability for syphilis are low, further evaluation or treatment is not indicated.

Multiple studies demonstrate that high quantitative index values or high signal-to-cutoff ratio from treponemal EIA or CIA tests correlate with TP-PA positivity, which might eliminate the need for additional confirmatory testing; however, the range of index values varies among different treponemal immunoassays, and the values that correspond to high levels of reactivity with confirmatory testing might differ by immunoassay (,–).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^19b7b37d]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Syphilis in people with HIV — treponemal-positive follow-up and treatment states that with a positive treponemal test in someone previously treated appropriately, they will require no further treatment unless sexual risk history suggests likelihood of re-exposure or there is a sustained fourfold increase in nontreponemal antibody titers; in such cases, a repeat nontreponemal test 2 to 4 weeks after the most recent possible exposure is recommended to evaluate for early infection. Those without prior treatment should be offered treatment and, unless history or physical exam suggests recent infection, previously untreated people should be treated for late latent syphilis. If a second treponemal test is negative and risk is low, no treatment is indicated, whereas if risk is high, treatment should be considered. High quantitative index values or high signal-to-cutoff ratios on treponemal enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA) correlate with TP-PA positivity and might eliminate the need for additional confirmatory testing, although index value ranges and corresponding thresholds may differ by immunoassay.

### Screening for syphilis infection in nonpregnant adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^5be53c46]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) syphilis screening in nonpregnant adolescents and adults — recommendation, population, risk assessment, testing options, and interval are specified: "Screen for syphilis in persons at increased risk for infection. Grade A." The recommendation applies to "Adults and adolescents who have ever been sexually active and are at increased risk for syphilis infection," and "It does not apply to pregnant persons, who are discussed in a separate recommendation statement" or "to persons who have signs or symptoms of syphilis." Risk is higher in "men who have sex with men; persons with HIV infection or other sexually transmitted infections; persons who use illicit drugs; and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service," and "clinicians should be aware of how common syphilis infection is in their community and assess patients' individual risk." Testing options include a "Traditional screening algorithm" with an initial nontreponemal test (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] or rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) and treponemal confirmation (Treponema pallidum particle agglutination [TP-PA]), or a "Reverse sequence algorithm" starting with an automated treponemal test (enzyme-linked or chemiluminescence immunoassay) followed by a nontreponemal test if positive. For interval, "men who have sex with men or persons with HIV infection may benefit from screening at least annually or more frequently (eg, every 3 to 6 months) if they continue to be at high risk," and "Screening and follow-up treatment can cure syphilis and prevent complications."

Pregnancy — reverse sequence and discordant serology management specify that if a treponemal EIA or CIA test is used for antepartum syphilis screening, all positive EIA or CIA tests should be confirmed with a quantitative nontreponemal test (RPR or VDRL). If the nontreponemal test is negative and the prozone reaction is ruled out, then the results are discordant and a second treponemal test should be performed, preferably on the same specimen. If the second treponemal test is negative (EIA positive, RPR negative, and TP-PA negative), the positive EIA or CIA is more likely to represent a false-positive test result for people who are living in communities with low rates of syphilis, have a partner who is uninfected, and have no history of treated syphilis. During pregnancy, if follow-up is likely, risk is low, there are no signs or symptoms of primary syphilis, and the partner has no clinical or serologic evidence of syphilis, then repeat serologic testing within 4 weeks can be considered to determine whether the EIA or CIA remains positive or whether the RPR, VDRL, or TP-PA result becomes positive. If both the RPR and TP-PA remain negative, no further treatment is necessary; if follow-up is not likely, treatment appropriate for the stage of syphilis is recommended for people with an isolated reactive treponemal test without a history of syphilis treatment.

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^6447ef18]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We conducted a systematic review of relevant syphilis diagnostic literature to address the question, "What is the sensitivity and specificity of the treponemal tests currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the diagnosis of syphilis (by stage)?" There were 16 treponemal assays evaluated: 13 immunoassays and 3 manual assays (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test [FTA-ABS], microhemagglutination assay for Treponema pallidum antibodies [MHA-TP], Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay [TP-PA]). MHA-TP and FTA-ABS were less sensitive in primary and secondary syphilis than TP-PA; TP-PA is the most specific manual treponemal assay. There is insufficient evidence to recommend one particular treponemal immunoassay (eg, enzyme immunoassays, chemiluminescence immunoassays, microbead immunoassays) over another based on published performance data. For diagnosis of neurosyphilis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) TP-PA has similar performance to CSF FTA-ABS in studies with patients with definitive or presumptive neurosyphilis. However, CSF treponemal testing has limitations in its sensitivity and specificity and should be interpreted within the context of the clinical scenario, additional CSF test results and syphilis prevalence.

Diagnostic Considerations

Pregnant women seropositive for syphilis should be considered infected unless an adequate treatment history is clearly documented in the medical records and sequential serologic antibody titers have decreased as recommended for the syphilis stage. The risk for antepartum fetal infection or congenital syphilis at delivery is related to the syphilis stage during pregnancy, with the highest risk occurring during the primary and secondary stages. Quantitative maternal nontreponemal titer, especially if > 1:8, might be a marker of early infection and bacteremia. However, risk for fetal infection is still substantial among pregnant women with late latent syphilis and low titers. Pregnant women with stable, serofast low nontreponemal titers who have previously been treated for syphilis might not require additional treatment; however, increasing or high antibody titers in a pregnant woman previously treated might indicate reinfection or treatment failure, and treatment should be offered.

If an automated treponemal test (e.g. EIA or CIA) is used for antepartum syphilis screening, all positive tests should be reflexed to a quantitative nontreponemal test (e.g. RPR or VDRL). If the nontreponemal test is negative, the results are considered discrepant and a second treponemal test (TP-PA is preferred) should be performed, preferably on the same specimen.

If the second treponemal test is positive (e.g. EIA positive, RPR negative, or TP-PA positive), current or previous syphilis infection can be confirmed. For women with a history of adequately treated syphilis who do not have ongoing risk, no further treatment is necessary. Women without a history of treatment should have the syphilis stage determined and should be treated accordingly with a recommended penicillin regimen.

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^a919bf92]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

We conducted a systematic review of relevant syphilis diagnostic literature to address the question, "What is the sensitivity and specificity of the treponemal tests currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the diagnosis of syphilis (by stage)?" There were 16 treponemal assays evaluated: 13 immunoassays and 3 manual assays (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test [FTA-ABS], microhemagglutination assay for Treponema pallidum antibodies [MHA-TP], Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay [TP-PA]). MHA-TP and FTA-ABS were less sensitive in primary and secondary syphilis than TP-PA; TP-PA is the most specific manual treponemal assay. There is insufficient evidence to recommend one particular treponemal immunoassay (eg, enzyme immunoassays, chemiluminescence immunoassays, microbead immunoassays) over another based on published performance data. For diagnosis of neurosyphilis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) TP-PA has similar performance to CSF FTA-ABS in studies with patients with definitive or presumptive neurosyphilis. However, CSF treponemal testing has limitations in its sensitivity and specificity and should be interpreted within the context of the clinical scenario, additional CSF test results and syphilis prevalence.

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^d508a0b0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Laboratory diagnosis of syphilis has traditionally involved an algorithm beginning with a nontreponemal test (eg, rapid plasma regain [RPR]) followed by a manual Treponema pallidum– specific assay (eg, T. pallidum particle agglutination assay [TP-PA]) for confirmation of reactive nontreponemal serology. Currently, various treponemal-specific immunoassays are increasingly being used for syphilis screening and diagnosis, including enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIAs), and microbead immunoassays (MBIAs), among others. These assays can be automated, reducing labor and turnaround time. Because some of these assays are relatively nonspecific, a reverse-sequence algorithm has been employed beginning with a treponemal immunoassay, followed by reflex nontreponemal testing (eg, RPR) on initially reactive specimens. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends conducting a TP-PA if there are discordant results between the immunoassay and RPR (eg, EIA-reactive, RPR-nonreactive). Regardless of which algorithm is used, for laboratories to select the most appropriate treponemal test(s) it is important to consider the sensitivity and specificity of these assays in clinically characterized sera, stratified by stage of syphilis.

We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the test performance of treponemal-specific tests, and results of this review were presented to a national consultation of experts in November 2017. Our review was based on a single key question: What is the sensitivity and specificity of the treponemal tests currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the diagnosis of syphilis (by stage)? Our objective of this review was to inform the selection of the appropriate confirmatory treponemal test for laboratories using the traditional algorithm. These data will assist laboratories in their selection of an initial treponemal test when the reverse sequence algorithm is used for diagnosis of syphilis. Additionally, the data will facilitate selection of the appropriate second treponemal test for patients with initially discordant treponemal and nontreponemal serology (eg, CIA-reactive, RPR-nonreactive).

Syphilis diagnostic modalities — PCR and serologic tests: Some laboratories provide locally developed and validated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for the direct detection of T. pallidum, and a presumptive serologic diagnosis is possible using non-treponemal tests such as VDRL and RPR and treponemal tests including FTA-ABS, TP-PA, enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIA), immunoblots, and rapid treponemal assays; serologic diagnosis traditionally involves screening for non-treponemal antibodies with confirmation by treponemal-based assays.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^d6096408]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Syphilis in pregnancy — diagnostic considerations and serologic testing guidance emphasize that pregnant women seropositive for syphilis should be considered infected unless an adequate treatment history is clearly documented and sequential serologic antibody titers have decreased as recommended for the syphilis stage; the risk for antepartum fetal infection or congenital syphilis at delivery is related to the syphilis stage during pregnancy, with the highest risk occurring during the primary and secondary stages, and a quantitative maternal nontreponemal titer, especially if ≥ 1:8, might be a marker of early infection and bacteremia, though risk for fetal infection is still substantial among pregnant women with late latent syphilis and low titers; pregnant women with stable, serofast low nontreponemal titers who have previously been treated for syphilis might not require additional treatment, whereas increasing or high antibody titers in a previously treated pregnant woman might indicate reinfection or treatment failure, and treatment should be offered. For laboratories using an automated treponemal test for antepartum screening, all positive tests should be reflexed to a quantitative nontreponemal test; if the nontreponemal test is negative, the results are considered discrepant and a second treponemal test (TP-PA is preferred) should be performed, preferably on the same specimen. If the second treponemal test is positive, current or previous syphilis infection can be confirmed; for women with a history of adequately treated syphilis who do not have ongoing risk, no further treatment is necessary, whereas women without a history of treatment should have the syphilis stage determined and should be treated accordingly with a recommended penicillin regimen. If the second treponemal test is negative, the positive EIA or CIA is more likely to represent a false-positive test result for women who are living in communities with low rates of syphilis, have a partner who is uninfected, and have no history of treated syphilis; if the woman is at low risk and likely to follow up, repeat serologic testing within 4 weeks can be considered to determine whether the EIA or CIA remains positive or if the RPR, VDRL, or TP-PA result becomes positive, and if both the RPR and TP-PA remain negative, no further treatment is necessary; if follow-up is not likely, women with an isolated reactive treponemal test and without a history of treated syphilis should be treated according to the syphilis stage.

Future Needs and Recommendations

Performance data are needed for the immunoassays using clinically characterized specimens, stratified by stage of syphilis. Studies should include sufficient numbers to stratify by HIV status so that performance among persons living with HIV can be assessed in the era of combined antiretroviral therapy. Many assays currently in use had no published data of this kind. This is particularly an issue with early primary and late latent disease.
Additional data are needed on the performance of treponemal tests in latent syphilis based on the CDC case definitions for latent syphilis.
Additional data are needed on the comparative performance of assays for diagnosis of neurosyphilis: CSF FTA-ABS, CSF TP-PA, and treponemal CIA/EIA in CSF.
Performance data are needed for the immunoassays (in serum) among patients with neurosyphilis.
There is a need to define serologic windows using modern treponemal and nontreponemal tests.

Some of these research and programmatic goals could be facilitated by the creation or resurrection of the CDC Syphilis Serum Bank with validated specimens, characterized by stage using standardized criteria, including seronegative, dark-field–positive primary syphilis specimens. This should also include specimens among patients without syphilis for specificity evaluations.

Other facilitators would include harmonization of criteria for evaluating performance of treponemal and nontreponemal tests, in particular characterization of true/false positives. Several newer immunoassays (eg, Elecsys Syphilis, Architect Syphilis TP, Lumipulse G TP-N) achieved this through a consensus of testing with a predicate immunoassay, plus RPR, plus TP-PA, where any 2 of 3 reactive specimens would be considered a true positive. More data are needed to determine whether this approach should become the common reference standard or predicate against which new immunoassays should be measured.

### Improving global estimates of syphilis in pregnancy by diagnostic test type: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a8e9ec2a]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2015). Low credibility.

1. Background

In 2088, WHO estimated that, worldwide, approximately 1.4 million pregnant women had "probable active syphilis" (PAS) or syphilis infections sufficiently active to result in mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) and with the potential of subsequent adverse pregnancy outcomes. Syphilis in pregnancy can be devastating and is associated with poor fetal or infant outcomes in the majority of cases, with an estimated 52% of PAS cases resulting in an adverse perinatal outcome attributable to syphilis. PAS (defined as seroreactivity for both non-treponemal and treponemal tests) is used as the reporting measure by WHO since surveillance data typically do not include clinical information.

Currently, no single test or combination of tests accurately predicts the extent to which maternal syphilis infection in pregnancy will affect the fetus. However, serologic tests can be suggestive; the combination of a reactive non-treponemal test (e.g. rapid plasma regain [RPR], venereal disease research laboratory [VDRL]) and a reactive treponemal test (e.g. Treponema pallidum particle agglutination [TP-PA], T. pallidum hemagglutination assay), defined in the 2008 WHO estimates as PAS, is compelling evidence for an infection that may result in MTCT. Neither type of test is both sensitive and specific on its own. A reactive, but unconfirmed, non-treponemal test may represent a biological false-positive result, whereas a reactive treponemal test alone may represent an old or previously treated infection that poses little exposure risk for the fetus. Considered schematically (Table 1), individuals with a positive result in both test types are likely to have syphilis (Cell A). Those with a single positive result in either test type could have syphilis, but might have false-positive or past-treated infection (Cells B and C). Those with negative results in both test types are unlikely to have syphilis (Cell D).

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^f1f4ec65]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Syphilis — cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation — CSF evaluation is warranted for persons with clinical signs of neurosyphilis, and all patients with ocular symptoms and reactive syphilis serology need a full ocular examination; if cranial nerve dysfunction is present, a CSF evaluation is needed, whereas among persons with isolated ocular symptoms, confirmed ocular abnormalities, and reactive syphilis serology, a CSF evaluation is unnecessary before treatment. No single test can be used to diagnose neurosyphilis in all instances; diagnosis depends on a combination of CSF tests with reactive serologic test results and neurologic signs and symptoms. CSF-VDRL is highly specific but insensitive, and for a person with neurologic signs or symptoms, a reactive CSF-VDRL (in the absence of blood contamination) is considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis; when CSF-VDRL is negative despite clinical signs, reactive serology, lymphocytic pleocytosis, or protein, neurosyphilis should be considered and CSF fluorescent treponemal-antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) or TP-PA testing might be warranted, noting that the CSF FTA-ABS test is less specific for neurosyphilis than the CSF-VDRL but is highly sensitive.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^465f233b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Conducting a treponemal test (e.g. TP-PA, immunoassay-EIA, CIA, or microbead immunoassay) on neonatal serum is not recommended because it is difficult to interpret, as passively transferred maternal antibodies can persist for > 15 months. Commercially available IgM tests are not recommended.

All neonates born to women who have reactive nontreponemal serologic tests for syphilis at delivery should be examined thoroughly for evidence of congenital syphilis (e.g. nonimmune hydrops, conjugated or direct hyperbilirubinemia † or cholestatic jaundice or cholestasis, hepatosplenomegaly, rhinitis, skin rash, or pseudoparalysis of an extremity). Pathologic examination of the placenta or umbilical cord using specific staining (e.g. silver) or a T. pallidum PCR test using a CLIA-validated test should be considered; direct fluorescence antibody (DFA-TP) reagents are unavailable. Darkfield microscopic examination or PCR testing of suspicious lesions or body fluids (e.g. bullous rash or nasal discharge) also should be performed. In addition to these tests, for stillborn infants, skeletal survey demonstrating typical osseous lesions might aid in the diagnosis of congenital syphilis because these abnormalities are not detected on fetal ultrasound.

The following scenarios describe the recommended congenital syphilis evaluation and treatment of neonates born to women who had reactive nontreponemal and treponemal serologic tests for syphilis during pregnancy (e.g. RPR reactive, TP-PA reactive or EIA reactive, RPR reactive) and have a reactive nontreponemal test at delivery (e.g. RPR reactive). Maternal history of infection with T. pallidum and treatment for syphilis should be considered when evaluating and treating the neonate for congenital syphilis in most scenarios, except when congenital syphilis is proven or highly probable.

### Discordant results from reverse sequence syphilis screening – five laboratories, United States, 2006–2010 [^823a0ae8]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

CDC recommends syphilis serologic screening with a nontreponemal test, such as the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, to identify persons with possible untreated infection; this screening is followed by confirmation using one of several treponemal tests. Recently, the availability of automatable treponemal enzyme and chemiluminescence immunoassays (EIA/CIA) has led some laboratories to adopt a reverse sequence of screening in which a treponemal EIA/CIA is performed first, followed by testing of reactive sera with a nontreponemal test. To better understand the performance of reverse sequence screening for syphilis, CDC analyzed data from five laboratories that used reverse sequence screening during 2006–2010. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that among sera reactive on initial screening with a treponemal EIA/CIA, 56.7% had a nonreactive RPR test. Among these discordant sera, 31.6% also were nonreactive by treponemal testing using Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) or fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed (FTA-ABS) tests. Among discordant sera, the rate of nonreactive confirmatory treponemal tests was 2.9 times higher in a population with low prevalence of syphilis, suggesting that the low-prevalence population had a higher percentage of false-positive test results. Although CDC continues to recommend the traditional algorithm with reactive nontreponemal tests confirmed by treponemal testing, in this report CDC offers additional recommendations if reverse sequence syphilis screening is used.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Congenital syphilis diagnosis in neonates — The standard serologic tests for syphilis are based on measurement of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, and because IgG in an infant reflects transplacental passively transferred maternal antibody, interpretation of reactive serologic tests for infants is difficult; all infants born to women with reactive nontreponemal and treponemal test results should be evaluated with a quantitative nontreponemal test (e.g. Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] slide test, rapid plasma reagin [RPR], the automated reagin test) from the infant and compared with the same test done at the same laboratory on the mother's serum; umbilical cord specimens should not be tested because of potential maternal blood contamination; specific treponemal tests such as fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) and T. pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) are not necessary to evaluate congenital syphilis in the neonate; there is no commercially available IgM test recommended for diagnostic use; some laboratories use treponemal tests for initial screening and nontreponemal tests for confirmation of positive specimens, however such an approach with congenital syphilis has not been published.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^34a8c72c]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Congenital and acquired syphilis — diagnosis and evaluation are outlined as follows: Congenital syphilis can be definitively diagnosed if T. pallidum is detected by darkfield microscopy or special stains of infant lesions or body fluids, but failure to detect T. pallidum does not definitively rule out infection because false-negative results are common. A quantitative nontreponemal serologic titer in an infant that is fourfold higher than the mother's is suggestive of infection, and infection also should be assumed in infants born to mothers who were untreated or inadequately treated prior to delivery, including non-penicillin regimen or treatment completion < 30 days before delivery, regardless of lack of findings. Evaluation of suspected cases should include a careful and complete physical examination with signs such as nonimmune hydrops, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, rhinitis, skin rash, and pseudoparalysis, and further evaluation may include a complete blood count and differential and platelet count, long bone radiographs, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis for VDRL, cell count, and protein; a positive CSF VDRL test, elevated CSF protein, and/or elevated CSF white blood cell count without other causes may be due to congenital syphilis. For diagnosis of acquired syphilis, a reactive nontreponemal test must be confirmed by a specific treponemal test such as FTA-ABS or TP-PA, treponemal tests usually remain positive for life even with successful treatment, the prozone phenomenon is more common in HIV-infected patients, and treponemal antibody titers do not correlate with disease activity and should not be used to monitor treatment response.

### Development of a novel magnetic particle-based agglutination immunoassay for anticardiolipin antibody detection in syphilis [^fade339e]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The aetiological agent of syphilis, Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum, can be transmitted through sexual contact, from an infected mother to her child, and through blood transfusion or other non-sexual contact. Untreated syphilis progresses through multiple stages — primary, secondary, latent and tertiary — progressing from infectious and symptomatic stages to a latent asymptomatic phase, with the tertiary stage affecting multiple body organs. A recent surveillance report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed a rise in primary and secondary syphilis cases in the USA particularly among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. A resurgence in syphilis cases globally has also been described in recent years.

Due to a lack of sustainable in vitro culture techniques for T. pallidum, unavailability of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared molecular tests and limitations associated with direct detection tests such as dark field microscopy, indirect serological tests that detect non-treponemal and treponemal antibodies remain the mainstay for routine syphilis detection. Non-treponemal tests include Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) slide test, rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and unheated serum reagin that detect antibodies to lipoidal moieties derived from damaged host cells and treponemes as a result of the host immune response. Owing to the non-specific nature of these tests, the traditional algorithm requires confirmation of a reactive non-treponemal result with a treponemal-specific test that includes T. pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA), T. pallidum haemagglutination assay, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption or other automated treponemal assays. Most treponemal tests use whole bacterial lysate or a combination of recombinant and/or purified peptides and proteins to capture the antibody. Treponemal tests have become more mainstream for syphilis screening due to ease of use, high throughput and ability to improve workflow efficiency using automated systems. A caveat is that treponemal antibodies persist in successfully treated patients which means the treponemal test cannot distinguish current infection from infections that have been successfully treated in the past. Confirmatory testing with non-treponemal tests is recommended when using the reverse sequence screening algorithm, followed by reflex testing with another treponemal assay to verify discordant results if any. None of the serological tests currently approved for use is sufficient as a stand-alone assay for definitive diagnosis of syphilis.

### Clinical development and performance of the first to know syphilis self-test for over-the-counter usage: arapid test for treponemal antibody [^be753209]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The laboratory diagnosis of syphilis is complex and necessitates a combination of clinical and laboratory criteria to differentiate current or past infection and absence of infection. Culture for T. pallidum is cumbersome and is available only in selected research laboratories, and there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared PCR test for syphilis at present. Darkfield microscopy is a direct detection test for T. pallidum that can diagnose early primary syphilis (sensitivity 75% to 100%); however, it requires samples from moist lesions or exudates, along with highly trained technicians and specialized equipment. It is not recommended for secondary syphilis due to low sensitivity. Serological testing remains the mainstay for diagnosing syphilis infection. Serology is divided into two different types of tests: non-treponemal tests (NTTs), such as the rapid plasma regain [RPR] test and the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), and treponemal tests (TTs), such as the T. pallidum particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) and Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption (FTA-ABS). While TT is often positive for life, NTT titers usually decrease after treatment. However, in certain cases, especially in late stages of syphilis, non-treponemal antibodies may persist at low levels for extended periods. The traditional NTTs are cost-effective and useful for initial screening and monitoring of syphilis treatment; however, they can be affected by false-positive and false-negative results. TTs provide higher specificity and sensitivity for confirming syphilis but cannot effectively monitor the disease activity after treatment or differentiate between active and past infections. Thus, both TTs and NTTs have inherent limitations due to variability in their diagnostic performance, hampering syphilis control and prevention efforts in real-world settings. A single serologic NTT or TT is not sufficient for diagnosis, and therefore a combination of positive TT and reactive NTT is required for the diagnosis of syphilis infection. In the past, syphilis screening mainly followed a traditional testing algorithm, starting with NTT, and the positive results required further confirmation through more specific TTs. With increased availability of various treponemal-specific immunoassays including enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIAs), recently, many laboratories are increasingly adopting a "reverse sequence screening" algorithm, which begins the screening with a TT, followed by confirmation of the reactivity with an NTT. When the NTT is non-reactive, a second but different treponemal test is performed to determine if the first treponemal test was a false positive. Regardless of which algorithm is used, it is important to consider the sensitivity and specificity of these assays in clinically characterized sera, stratified by the stage of syphilis, and all screening results must be correlated with clinical diagnosis, which includes patients' symptoms, previous history, and sexual risk factors to make an accurate diagnosis.

### Development of the perceived risk of HIV scale [^11b907d6]. AIDS and Behavior (2012). Low credibility.

Procedure

Participants met individually with a trained interviewer. After reviewing the informed consent form (approved by the California State University, Long Beach, Institutional Review Board) the interviewer administered the HIV perceived-risk items followed by the risk behavior assessment (RBA). The RBA includes items assessing frequency of different types of sex, number of sex partners, sex trading behaviors, use of drugs immediately before or during sex and a single item measure of HIV risk perception. The RBA has been found to have good reliability and validity. Following completion of the questionnaires, participants received HIV prevention counseling and/or HIV/STD testing. Participants received a small non-cash incentive for participating in the study. A total of 652 participants underwent HIV testing, the majority of these tests were performed using the OraQuick Advance ® Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test (OraSure Technologies, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania) (n = 601), and all preliminary positive results were confirmed with an HIV-1 Western blot. Participants who received HIV testing were also offered antibody tests for syphilis using both non-Treponemal (RPR) and Treponemal (TP-PA) tests. Participants who received HIV rapid testing were provided with the results at the end of the session. Participants who received standard testing for HIV and/or syphilis testing were asked to return in 1 week to receive the results of these tests.

### Screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^ffaf3b18]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Practice considerations — population and screening approach — This recommendation applies to all adolescents and adults who are pregnant, whether or not risk factors for syphilis are present. Screening for syphilis involves a blood test that detects antibodies that may reflect infection with Treponema pallidum, the organism that causes syphilis. Treponemal tests, such as the T pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) test, detect an antibody response to antigens specific to T pallidum, whereas nontreponemal tests, such as the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory or rapid plasma reagin test, detect antibodies that may reflect tissue damage. A 2-step process is used to improve diagnostic accuracy; a traditional screening algorithm is a 2-step process that begins with a non-treponemal test followed by a confirmatory treponemal test for persons with positive nontreponemal test results, and a reverse sequence algorithm uses an automated treponemal test.

HIV neurosyphilis diagnostic evaluation — cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing should be interpreted with clinical context: the diagnosis "depends on a combination of CSF tests (CSF cell count, CSF protein, and CSF-VDRL) in the setting of reactive serologic test results and neurologic signs and symptoms." CSF may show mononuclear pleocytosis "6–200 cells/mm3," and among people with HIV the CSF leukocyte count can be elevated "(> 5 white blood cell count [WBC]/mm3); using a higher cutoff (> 20 WBC/mm3) may improve the specificity of neurosyphilis diagnosis." In symptomatic people, "a reactive CSF-VDRL (in a specimen not contaminated with blood) is considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis" but has "very low sensitivity," so neurosyphilis should be considered even when CSF-VDRL is negative in the presence of "reactive serologic test results, lymphocytic pleocytosis, or elevated protein," and "additional evaluation by using FTA-ABS or TP-PA testing on CSF might be warranted." CSF FTA-ABS "is less specific" but "is highly sensitive," fewer data exist for CSF TP-PA though "the sensitivity and specificity appears similar to the CSF FTA-ABS," and "Neurosyphilis is highly unlikely with a negative CSF FTA-ABS or TP-PA test." RPR tests of CSF "have been associated with a high false-negative rate and are not recommended," and "PCR-based diagnostic methods are not currently recommended as diagnostic tests for neurosyphilis"; moreover, "a CSF examination has not been associated with improved clinical outcomes."

Congenital syphilis — diagnosis in neonates and infants: The standard serologic tests for syphilis are based on measurement of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, and because IgG in an infant reflects transplacental passively transferred maternal antibody, interpretation of reactive serologic tests for infants is difficult; therefore the diagnosis of neonatal congenital syphilis depends on a combination of physical, laboratory, radiographic, and direct microscopic examinations. All infants born to women with reactive nontreponemal and treponemal test results should be evaluated with a quantitative nontreponemal test from the infant and compared with the same test done at the same laboratory on the mother's serum, and umbilical cord specimens should not be tested because of the potential for maternal blood contamination. Specific treponemal tests, such as fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) and T. pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA), are not necessary to evaluate congenital syphilis in the neonate, and there is no commercially available IgM test recommended for diagnostic use; some laboratories use treponemal tests for initial screening and nontreponemal tests for confirmation of positive specimens, but such an approach with congenital syphilis has not been published.

Discussion

Among the numerous treponemal assays currently approved by the FDA, comparison of performance characteristics was more robust for the manual assays because there were few studies of the immunoassays that included clinically characterized specimens, stratified by stage. Among the manual treponemal assays included in this review (ie, MHA-TP, FTA-ABS, TP-PA), MHA-TP demonstrated poorer sensitivity for all stages of syphilis. Between the FTA-ABS and TP-PA, the 2 studies that compared their performance found lower sensitivity for the FTA-ABS for primary and secondary syphilis. Given the subjective nature of FTA-ABS interpretation, lack of quality control for FTA-ABS reagents, and the need for microbiologist experience, it is not recommended for use. TP-PA is the recommended assay among the manual treponemal tests.

Among the treponemal immunoassays, there were few published data on test performance stratified by stage, and sample sizes for Premarket FDA 510K data were small. There are insufficient data to distinguish differences in performance between treponemal immunoassays (eg, EIAs, CIAs, MBIAs) for laboratory diagnosis of syphilis. Of note, 2 studies found that TrepSure had poor sensitivity for primary syphilis and significantly lower specificity than other immunoassays.

Several factors should be considered when interpreting these test performance data. Most studies were retrospective and used reactive serology as part of the inclusion criteria, which would bias sensitivity estimates towards 100%, particularly for primary syphilis. Studies utilizing previously banked specimens (both CDC and commercial serum banks) were included in this analysis, but the quality of staging/characterization of these specimens could not be assessed. For primary syphilis, it was unclear whether studies using banked specimens included dark-field positive-seronegative cases or just cases with reactive nontreponemal and/or treponemal serology. For latent syphilis, most studies combined early and late latent into a single category defined as "combined latent syphilis" or used a 2-year cutoff for defining early versus late latent disease. Some studies included prior treated cases and untreated (current) syphilis cases. When possible, our evaluation focused on untreated or current syphilis because the time between treatment and specimen collection was not described.

### Dual screen and confirm rapid test does not reduce overtreatment of syphilis in pregnant women living in a non-venereal treponematoses endemic region: a field evaluation among antenatal care attendees in Burkina Faso [^66f88dfa]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

For each eligible pregnant woman who provided informed consent, DPP tests were administered by medical staff (a midwife or other auxiliary health staff) and used blood obtained through a finger prick in the ANC consultation room. T-RDT (SD Bioline Syphilis 3.0, Standard Diagnostics) and DPP testing were performed in parallel using whole blood obtained by venipuncture in the clinic's laboratory. Then, plasma was used to perform qualitative RPR (Macro-Vue, Becton Dickinson, USA) in case of a positive T-RDT result in the clinic's laboratory. As a quality control measure, a photograph of each DPP test was sent for additional interpretation by study investigators. All plasma samples, regardless of testing results at the clinical site, were sent for reference testing in an external laboratory (Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium) using reference methods: Treponema pallidum passive particle agglutination (SeroDia TP-PA, Fujirebio Diagnostics, Japan) and quantitative RPR (Macro-Vue). Medical staff, the laboratory technician and the reference laboratory were blinded to each others' results. Women with both T-RDT and qualitative RPR-positive results were treated using therapeutic protocols established by MSF and the Burkina Faso Ministry of Health. Presumptive active syphilis is serologically defined here as being both TPPA-positive and quantitative RPR-reactive at any titre. Data analysis was conducted using STATA V.12 using descriptive statistics (frequencies and proportions) for categorical variables. Means are presented with their SD and medians with their IQR. Cohen's kappa coefficient (k) was used to evaluate interuser agreement between medical staff and the laboratory technician for DPP testing. McNemar's test for paired samples was used to compare proportions of unnecessarily treated cases and incorrectly undiagnosed cases between DPP and T-RDT (significance level p = 0.05).

Care was provided free of charge regardless of a patient's participation in the study. All data are available on reasonable request to the corresponding author at the contact provided.

Diagnostic Considerations

Darkfield examinations and molecular tests for detecting T. pallidum directly from lesion exudate or tissue are the definitive methods for diagnosing early syphilis and congenital syphilis. Although no T. pallidum direct-detection molecular NAATs are commercially available, certain laboratories provide locally developed and validated PCR tests for detecting T. pallidum DNA. A presumptive diagnosis of syphilis requires use of two laboratory serologic tests: a nontreponemal test (i.e. Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] or rapid plasma reagin [RPR] test) and a treponemal test (i.e. the T. pallidum passive particle agglutination [TP-PA] assay, various EIAs, chemiluminescence immunoassays [CIAs] and immunoblots, or rapid treponemal assays). At least 18 treponemal-specific tests are cleared for use in the United States. Use of only one type of serologic test (nontreponemal or treponemal) is insufficient for diagnosis and can result in false-negative results among persons tested during primary syphilis and false-positive results among persons without syphilis or previously treated syphilis.

Neurosyphilis

FTA-ABS

Thirteen studies described CSF FTA-ABS test performance (not all studies included both sensitivity/specificity) and were summarized in a prior systematic review. In 3 studies of patients with definitive neurosyphilis (reactive CSF Venereal Disease Research Laboratory Test), the sensitivity of CSF FTA-ABS was 90.9–100%. Among those with presumptive neurosyphilis where diagnosis was made based on reactive serology, other abnormal CSF indices, and clinical signs/symptoms, the sensitivity ranged widely (22.2–100%). A study by Luger et al of 60 symptomatic patients defined neurosyphilis by comparing ratios of serum protein and CSF protein with a ratio of serum treponemal antibody and CSF treponemal antibody; in this study, the sensitivity of the CSF FTA-ABS was 100%. Another large study by Hooshmand et al (n = 156) also found 100% sensitivity of CSF FTA-ABS, but a reactive CSF FTA-ABS was part of the case definition, thus the sensitivity results cannot be interpreted. The specificity of FTA-ABS varied greatly depending on whether true negatives were patients without syphilis or patients with syphilis, but not neurosyphilis. Six studies included patients without syphilis as true negatives, and the specificity of FTA-ABS was 100%; however, a study by Jaffe et al found that CSF FTA was reactive in 5 of 15 patients with syphilis who had no other evidence of neurosyphilis. Eleven studies included patients with syphilis, but not neurosyphilis, and the specificity ranged from 55% to 100%.

For CSF TP-PA, 4 studies described test performance. A study by Castro et al reported a sensitivity of 100% for the CSF TP-PA but the clinical characterization of true positives could not be interpreted given the data provided. The other 3 studies reported a sensitivity of 75.6–95.0%, with the highest sensitivities when using reactive CSF VDRL as the criterion for true positivity. Specificities ranged from 85.5% to 100% and were highest if a titer of 1:640 or greater was used to define neurosyphilis. Based on these limited data, CSF TP-PA appears to have similar performance to CSF FTA-ABS in studies with a mixed population of patients with definitive/presumptive neurosyphilis.

### Performance characteristics of the reverse syphilis screening algorithm in a population with a moderately high prevalence of syphilis [^4742836d]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

With the recent introduction of automated treponemal tests, a new reverse syphilis algorithm has been proposed and now used by many clinical laboratories. We analyzed the impact of instituting the reverse screening syphilis algorithm in a laboratory that serves a geographic area with a moderately high prevalence of syphilis infection.

Methods

Serum samples sent for syphilis testing were tested using a treponemal enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as the screening assay. EIA reactive samples were tested by rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and titered to end point if reactive. RPR nonreactive samples were analyzed by the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination test (TP-PA). Pertinent medical records were reviewed for false-reactive screens and samples with evidence of past syphilis infection.

Results

Among 10,060 patients tested, 502 (5%) were reactive on the initial EIA screen. The RPR was reactive in 150 (1.5%). TP-PA testing determined that 103 (1.0%) were falsely reactive on initial EIA screen. The reverse screening algorithm, however, identified 242 (2.4%) with evidence of latent, secondary, or past syphilis, 21 of whom had no or unknown prior treatment with antibiotics.

Conclusions

Despite a 1.0% false-reactive rate, the reverse syphilis algorithm detected 21 patients with possible latent syphilis that may have gone undetected by traditional syphilis screening.

### Use of Treponema pallidum PCR in testing of ulcers for diagnosis of primary syphilis [^002a1294]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Incidence of syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, has increased steadily worldwide since the early 2000s, especially in at-risk populations. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently updated the definitions for confirmed cases of primary and secondary syphilis and now considers Treponema pallidum PCR (Tp -PCR) to be a valid diagnostic method along with darkfield microscopy (DFM), which is still considered the reference test (although it remains imperfect). In diagnosis of sexually transmitted ulcerative disease, a positive DFM result confirms syphilis because other T. pallidum subspecies are not sexually transmitted and have a different geographic distribution. However, the meaning of a negative DFM result is more uncertain. Samples from up to 20% of case-patients with syphilis may show negative DFM results when the test is performed by technicians who are not fully trained or when it is performed in suboptimal conditions. Tp -PCR is clinically useful for testing of ulcers or skin lesions in areas where syphilis prevalence is high, but uncertainties remain because of the variability in the reference tests used in the different diagnostic studies. Moreover, the risk for misclassification by DFM diminishes the apparent value of Tp -PCR when DFM is the reference test because samples from syphilis patients that yield a negative DFM result, but a positive Tp -PCR result, are currently considered false-positive.

We conducted a multicenter study in France and Switzerland to evaluate the accuracy of Tp -PCR compared with DFM and serologic testing. To resolve the difficulty of assessing a new diagnostic test against an imperfect standard, in addition to the standard DFM diagnostics, we used an enhanced definition for the diagnosis of syphilis that combines clinical information with DFM, serologic testing, or both, to enable a fair assessment to be made of the diagnostic performance of Tp -PCR.

### Recommendations for next-generation sequencing germline variant confirmation: a joint report of the Association for Molecular Pathology and National Society of Genetic Counselors [^54e5a863]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2023). High credibility.

NGS germline variant confirmation — Recommendation 5 states: Laboratories Should Perform Confirmatory Testing For Reported Germline Variants with Significant Clinical Implications, Except for Variant Calls Meeting Technical Criteria Rigorously Demonstrated to Ensure High Positive Predictive Value from NGS Alone. The ultimate decision about which variants require orthogonal confirmation will depend on two types of criteria: Technical criteria (how likely is this variant call to be an analytic TP versus FP based on the available data) and Medical criteria (how likely is this variant to have a significant clinical impact on the patient's care). There is currently no generalized standard for what constitutes an acceptable FP rate, and for each test this should be guided by the clinical PPV in the population indicated for testing and the medical impact(s) of the test's results. For Technical Criteria, strict criteria may be developed to identify variant calls that are highly unlikely to be FPs, using combinations that include quality metrics, variant type, genomic context, and variant allele fraction; for example, SNVs are far more prevalent than indels and indel variant calls tend to have much higher error rates than SNV calls, genomic context can identify regions prone to FPs, and skewed allele fractions include heterozygotes far from 50:50 variant allele.

### Improving global estimates of syphilis in pregnancy by diagnostic test type: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2d46995e]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2015). Low credibility.

2.1. Inclusion criteria

To be included, eligible studies must have tested pregnant or puerperal women for both non-treponemal and treponemal serology and reported at least one of the following: the proportion of pregnant or puerperal women with reactive non-treponemal tests that had reactive treponemal tests (correction factor for Category 2 countries) or the proportion of pregnant or puerperal women with reactive treponemal tests that had reactive non-treponemal tests (correction factor for Category 3 countries). Studies were included regardless of type of non-treponemal (e.g. RPR, VDRL) or treponemal (e.g. fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption, TP-PA) test used, publication language, country, or age of subjects.

We used these data to estimate maternal syphilis seropositivity for countries reporting data to WHO based on a single test type (Categories 2 and 3), or that did not report the test type used (Category 4; Table 2). For Category 1 countries, we assumed that reported data should be used without correction since these are the best possible estimates for PAS cases in pregnancy when only test type (no clinical or titer) data are available. For Category 2 countries, we used the published literature to calculate estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the proportion of pregnant women with reactive non-treponemal tests that also had reactive treponemal tests (i.e. A/(A + B) from Table 1). For Category 3 countries, we used the published literature to calculate estimates and CIs for the proportion of pregnant women with reactive treponemal tests that also had reactive non-treponemal tests (i.e. A/(A + C) from Table 1). For Category 4 countries, we assumed an equal probability of having used only non-treponemal, only treponemal, or a combined test strategy. Thus, we used the average of the estimates for the three correction factors for Categories 1–3 to estimate the number of PAS cases ((Category 1 correction factor + Category 2 correction factor + Category 3 correction factor)/3). The estimated proportions for each WHO reporting category represent the correction factors to be used for their respective categories.

### A standardized framework for the validation and verification of clinical molecular genetic tests [^0c2b748b]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

Qualitative tests

This is the extreme form of a categorical test, in which there are only two result categories, positive and negative. This binary categorization can be based either on a cutoff applied to a quantitative result, for example, peak height or a mathematical measure representing peak shape, or on direct qualitative observation by the analyst, for example, the presence or absence of a peak (in the latter case, as discussed in the section 'Types of test', the underlying data will generally be quantitative in nature, even though no formal quantification is performed). In terms of accuracy, categorization can be either correct or incorrect with respect to the 'true' (reference) result. A simple contingency table can be used to describe the four possible outcomes (Table 3).

The diagnostic accuracy of a qualitative test can be characterized by two components, both of which can be calculated from the figures in the contingency table:
Sensitivity – the proportion of positive results correctly identified by the test = TP/(TP+FN);
Specificity – the proportion of negative results correctly identified by the test = TN/(TN+FP).

In addition, the overall accuracy can be characterized by the total number of true results as a proportion of the total results ((TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)), although, in practice, this parameter is rarely used. For comparison with quantitative tests (Figure 3), the relationship between the components of accuracy is depicted in Figure 6.

There is an inverse relationship between sensitivity and specificity (Figure 7). As more stringent cutoffs are used to reduce the number of false positives (ie, increase specificity), the likelihood of false negatives increases. Therefore, the desirable characteristics of a test must be considered in the context of the required outcome and the diagnostic consequences. For example, laboratory procedures for mutation scanning tests often involve a primary screen to determine which fragments carry mutations, followed by a second confirmatory test by sequencing to characterize the mutations present. In the primary screen, sensitivity is much more critical than specificity, to avoid missing mutations that are present; the only consequence of poor specificity is increase in the workload for confirmatory sequencing. Obviously, there is a limit to the lack of specificity that can be tolerated, even if only on the grounds of cost and efficiency.

### Novel point-of-care test for simultaneous detection of nontreponemal and treponemal antibodies in patients with syphilis [^2d49b4d7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

We describe a point-of-care immunochromatographic test for the simultaneous detection of both nontreponemal and treponemal antibodies in the sera of patients with syphilis that acts as both a screening and a confirmatory test. A total of 1,601 banked serum samples were examined by the dual test, and the results were compared to those obtained using a quantitative rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test and the Treponema pallidum passive particle agglutination (TP-PA) assay. Compared to the RPR test, the reactive concordance of the dual test nontreponemal line was 98.4% when the RPR titers of sera were ≥ 1:2 and the nonreactive concordance was 98.6%. Compared to the TP-PA assay, the reactive and nonreactive concordances of the treponemal line were 96.5% and 95.5%, respectively. These results indicate that the dual test could be used for the serological diagnosis of syphilis in primary health care clinics or resource-poor settings and therefore improve rates of treatment where patients may fail to return for their laboratory results.

### Screening for syphilis with the treponemal immunoassay: analysis of discordant serology results and implications for clinical management [^32095b85]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Screening for syphilis with treponemal chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIA) identifies patients with discordant serology who are not identified with traditional screening methods (eg, CIA-positive, rapid plasma regain (RPR)-negative). We sought to describe the clinical characteristics and management of patients with discordant syphilis serology.

Methods

From August 2007-October 2007, patients with CIA-positive, RPR-negative serology were tested with the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Clinical and demographic characteristics, prior syphilis history and CIA index values were compared for CIA-positive, RPR-negative patients according to TP-PA status.

Results

Of 21,623 assays, 439 (2%) were CIA-positive and 255/439 (58%) were RPR-negative; subsequently, 184 (72%) were TP-PA-positive and 71 (28%) were TP-PA — negative. TP-PA — positive patients were more likely to be male, HIV-positive, homosexual, previously treated for syphilis (57% versus 9%), with higher median CIA index values (9.8 versus 1.6) (all P < .0001). After repeat testing, 7/31 (23%) CIA-positive, RPR-negative, TP-PA — negative patients seroreverted to CIA-negative.

Conclusions

TP-PA results in conjunction with clinical/behavioral assessment helped guide the management of patients with CIA-positive, RPR-negative serology. TP-PA-positive patients were both highly likely to have prior syphilis and major epidemiologic risk factors for syphilis. CIA-positive, RPR-negative, TP-PA-negative serology may represent a false-positive CIA in low-prevalence populations.

### Correlation of treponemal immunoassay signal strength values with reactivity of confirmatory treponemal testing [^1e1c1354]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Automated treponemal immunoassays are used for syphilis screening with the reverse-sequence algorithm; discordant results (e.g., enzyme immunoassay [EIA] reactive and reactive plasma reagin [RPR] nonreactive) are resolved with a second treponemal test. We conducted a study to determine automated immunoassay signal strength values consistently correlating with reactive confirmatory treponemal testing. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of four automated immunoassays (BioPlex 2200 microbead immunoassay [MBIA], Liaison chemiluminescence immunoassay [CIA], Advia-Centaur CIA, and Trep-Sure EIA) and three manual assays (Treponema pallidum particle agglutination [TP-PA], fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption [FTA-ABS] test, and Inno-LIA line immunoassay). We compared signal strength values of automated immunoassays and positive and negative agreement. Among 1,995 specimens, 908 (45.5%) were true positives (≥ 4/7 tests reactive) and 1,087 (54.5%) were true negatives (≥ 4/7 tests nonreactive). Positive agreement ranged from 86.1% (83.7 to 88.2%) for FTA-ABS to 99.7% (99.0 to 99.9%) for Advia-Centaur CIA; negative agreement ranged from 86.3% (84.1 to 88.2%) for Trep-Sure EIA to 100% for TP-PA (99.6 to 100%). Increasing signal strength values correlated with increasing reactivity of confirmatory testing (P < 0.0001 for all automated immunoassays by Cochran-Armitage test for trend). All automated immunoassays had signal strength cutoffs corresponding to ≥ 4/7 reactive treponemal tests. BioPlex MBIA and Liaison CIA had signal strength cutoffs correlating with ≥ 99% and 100% TP-PA reactivity, respectively. The Advia-Centaur CIA and Trep-Sure EIA had signal strength cutoffs correlating with at least 95% TP-PA reactivity. All automated immunoassays had signal strength cutoffs correlating with at least 95% FTA-ABS reactivity. Assuming that a 95% level of confirmation is adequate, these signal strength values can be used in lieu of confirmatory testing with TP-PA and FTA-ABS.

### Ocular vs neurosyphilis. are they the same? A guide to investigation and management [^3f47818b]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Uveitis

Uveitis is the major manifestation of ocular syphilis. As any clinical phenotype of uveitis can develop secondary to syphilis infection, clinical signs are of little diagnostic use in patients with syphilitic uveitis with the possible exception of placoid syphilis. Indeed, the SUN (Standardisation of Uveitis Nomenclature) classification system recommends that the diagnosis of syphilis be based on positive serological testing rather than clinical signs (Table 1). It is now a widely accepted practice to test all patients with uveitis for syphilis. SUN recommends using a reverse sequence syphilis screening algorithm from the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in the USA which is being increasingly adopted in centres outside the USA (Table 2).

Syphilitic anterior uveitis may present with a broad range of clinical features. In a series of patients presenting with acute anterior uveitis, there were only two patients diagnosed with syphilis from 241 patients (0.8%). Anterior segment clinical signs which might heighten the suspicion of syphilis include hypertensive anterior uveitis, the presence of iris nodules or of roseola (Fig. 2).

### Improving the coverage and accuracy of syphilis testing: the development of a novel rapid, point-of-care test for confirmatory testing of active syphilis infection and its early evaluation in China and South Africa [^312f8364]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our evaluation studies showed that the prototype TP-IgA has met the WHO TPP performance criteria for a POCT for confirmatory diagnosis of active syphilis infections. The test demonstrated its potential utility as an accurate confirmatory test when used in combination with a treponemal total antibody-screening test. Further study is warranted to assess diagnostic performance of the final manufactured test as well as its clinical utility in real world settings.

### Evaluation of the passive particle agglutination test in the serodiagnosis and follow-up of syphilis [^4ce58c61]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

We performed the present study to determine the rate of concordance of the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS) and of the microhemagglutination assay for antibodies to Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP) with the passive particle agglutination test (TP.PA) in patients with early syphilis and to observe the reactivity of the rapid plasma reagin (RPR), MHA-TP, and the TP.PA tests for 1 year after therapy. The study included 449 people who were given therapy if they had syphilis and followed up for 1 year. The rate of concordance of the TP.PA with the MHA-TP was 98.4%, and it was 98.9% with the FTA-ABS. During follow-up, a significant decrease of antibodies was found in 56%, 26%, and 70% of the patients when using the RPR, the MHA-TP, and the TP.PA, respectively. The TP.PA seems to be an adequate routine assay for the diagnosis of syphilis, being as sensitive as the FTA-ABS test in primary syphilis and as useful as the RPR test in monitoring therapy.

### Evaluation of treponemal serum tests performed on cerebrospinal fluid for diagnosis of neurosyphilis [^719aa842]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

We evaluated the use of treponemal serum tests in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to diagnose neurosyphilis since CSF-Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) is specific but lacks sensitivity.

Methods

We tested CSF specimens using the following treponemal serum tests: INNO-LIA, Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA), Trep-Sure, and Maxi-Syph. The reference standard to calculate sensitivity and specificity was having two or more reactive/positive tests on CSF.

Results

The reference standard group included 11 cases that fulfilled the definition of neurosyphilis (reactive CSF-VDRL plus symptoms) and three cases that did not fulfill the definition: two cases had neurologic symptoms but a nonreactive CSF-VDRL, and one had several positive CSF syphilis tests (reactive VDRL and positive treponemal and syphilis polymerase chain reaction) but no history (referred sample). Controls included 18 patients in whom a CSF-VDRL was performed the same week as patients in the reference group. The sensitivity was 85.7% (12/14) for CSF-VDRL, 92.9% (13/14) for Trep-Sure, 100% (10/10) for Maxi-Syph, 92.3% (12/13) for INNO-LIA, and 83.3% (10/12) for TP-PA. Specificity was 100% for all tests.

Conclusions

Treponemal serum tests performed on CSF were useful in identifying two patients with nonreactive CSF-VDRL.

### Discordant syphilis immunoassays in pregnancy: perinatal outcomes and implications for clinical management [^55119671]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The reverse sequence algorithm is often used for prenatal syphilis screening by high-volume laboratories, beginning with a treponemal test such as the chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA), followed by testing of CIA-positive (CIA(+)) specimens with the rapid plasma reagin test (RPR). The clinical significance of discordant serology (CIA(+)/RPR(-)) for maternal and neonatal outcomes is unknown.

Methods

From August 2007 to August 2010, all pregnant women at Kaiser Permanente Northern California with discordant treponemal serology underwent reflexive testing with Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) and were categorized as "TP-PA confirmed" (CIA(+)/RPR(-)/TP-PA(+)) or "isolated CIA positive" (CIA(+)/RPR(-)/TP-PA(-)). Demographic variables and clinical data were abstracted from the medical record and compared by TP-PA status.

Results

Of 194 pregnant women, 156 (80%) were CIA(+)/RPR(-)/TP-PA(-) and 38 (20%) were CIA(+)/RPR(-)/TP-PA(+). Among the 77 (49%) CIA(+)/RPR(-)/TP-PA(-) women who were retested, 53% became CIA(-). CIA(+)/RPR(-)/TP-PA(+) (n = 38) women were more likely to be older, have a prior history of sexually transmitted infections, and receive treatment for syphilis during pregnancy than women who were CIA(+)/RPR(-)/TP-PA(-) (all P < .005). Most pregnancies (189/194 [97.5%]) resulted in a live birth; there was no difference in birth outcomes according to TP-PA status and no stillbirths attributable to syphilis.

Conclusions

Most pregnant women with discordant serology were CIA(+)/RPR(-)/TP-PA(-); more than half who were retested became CIA(-). CIA(+)/RPR(-)/TP-PA(-) serology in pregnancy is likely to be falsely positive. Reflexive testing of discordant specimens with TP-PA is important to stratify risk given the likelihood of false-positive results in this population.

### Improving the coverage and accuracy of syphilis testing: the development of a novel rapid, point-of-care test for confirmatory testing of active syphilis infection and its early evaluation in China and South Africa [^131a1812]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Findings from our studies have some clinical implications for potential use of the TP-IgA POCT in field settings.

First, for the diagnosis of active syphilis with high RPR titre (≥ 8), the use of TP-IgA POCT as a confirmatory test in combination with a syphilis total antibody POCT could potentially deliver 96% to 100% sensitivity. This level of sensitivity meets the WHO TPP and is similar to that of other rapid POCTs for syphilis available on the market that cannot discriminate past/treated from active syphilis. Diagnosis of active syphilis, however, could be challenging due to variation in patient's clinical manifestations and immune responses at different stages of syphilis. Subjects with a positive treponemal total antibody test but negative non-treponemal (or in this case TP-IgA) test for syphilis could have past/treated syphilis, or in a small proportion could have very early syphilis, long-standing latent syphilis or active syphilis with negative non-treponemal test. Those latter cases could potentially be detected using a second but different treponemal test, and those with two positive treponemal test results and no history of treated syphilis are candidates for treatment. Although clinics in resource-constrained settings may find this challenging, it could still be worth doing given the risk and potential associated cost of missing cases of untreated infection. Results from our study in China indicated that six out of 153 active syphilis cases would have been missed and three out of 151 "no syphilis" cases would have been unnecessarily treated if only the TP-IgA POCT had been used. However, if used together with other rapid tests the first six cases would be deemed as requiring treatment and the later three cases would be deemed biological false positives. We therefore suggest that the TP-IgA POCT would be most suitable for use in combination with a standard rapid treponemal total antibody test for diagnosis of active syphilis infections in clinic settings. This would be an effective and efficient testing algorithm in settings with limited laboratory capacity. (Fig. 2)

Regarding diagnostic investigations for antiphospholipid syndrome, more specifically with respect to confirmatory testing, BSH 2012 guidelines recommend to perform a confirmatory test (e.g., using a high phospholipid concentration, platelet neutralizing reagent or a lupus-anticoagulant insensitive reagent) to definitively establish the presence of lupus anticoagulant.

### Evaluation of the lumipulse G TP-N chemiluminescent immunoassay as a syphilis screening test [^b87a6090]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

A syphilis diagnosis is often aided by the detection of treponemal and nontreponemal antibodies. Automated treponemal antibody detection systems enable high-volume clinical laboratories to perform syphilis screening at a faster pace with lower labor costs. The Lumipulse G TP-N chemiluminescent immunoassay is an automated system that qualitatively detects IgG and IgM antibodies against Treponema pallidum antigens in human serum and plasma. To assess performance characteristics and workflow efficiency, the Lumipulse G TP-N assay was compared to the Bioplex 2200 Syphilis IgG multiplex flow immunoassay. Among the 4,134 routine and HIV samples tested by the two automated assays, the percentage of agreement was excellent at 99.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 98.6% to 99.2%; κ, 0.89), with the Lumipulse G TP-N having a shorter time to first and subsequent results. All specimens with reactive syphilis screening results were further tested by rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP·PA) testing (n = 231). The results from the RPR-reactive samples (n = 82) showed complete concordance with the two automated assays, while the TP·PA assay displayed some discrepancies. The positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) between the TP·PA test and the Lumipulse G TP-N test were 98.9% and 77.3%, respectively. The Bioplex 2200 Syphilis IgG immunoassay displayed a similar PPA (100%) but a substantially lower NPA (15.9%). Patient chart reviews of discrepant results suggested that the Lumipulse G TP-N assay produced 27 fewer falsely reactive results and can reduce the amount of additional confirmatory RPR and TP·PA testing needed. The analogous performance characteristics of the two automated systems indicate that the Lumipulse G TP-N assay is suitable for high-throughput syphilis screening.

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^098c3902]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Biologic False Positive

A nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) test that is reactive for conditions other than syphilis is referred to as a biologic false positive (BFP). Persons with antibodies that are reactive in the nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests, but are nonreactive in a confirmatory treponemal test, are defined as BFP reactors. Health departments frequently retain records of persons with known BFP reactions; these data can assist clinicians in a future evaluation of possible syphilis infection in such persons. Reactive nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests attributable to BFP have been estimated to occur in 0.2%–0.8% of the population and are associated with medical conditions other than syphilis. BFP reactions are attributable to other infections including malaria, leprosy, and HIV; recent vaccinations; autoimmune disorders; and injection drug use.

Treponemal Tests

Treponemal tests are clinically used to confirm results of reactive nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests and evaluate patients with signs suggestive of syphilis in early primary infection when nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests might not yet be reactive. Treponemal tests can also be automated for high throughput screening in blood banks and in large laboratories for routine screening using the reverse sequence algorithm. Antibodies detected in treponemal tests typically persist for life despite treatment unless treatment occurs early in the course of infection; approximately 15%–25% of patients treated for primary syphilis can revert to a nonreactive treponemal test (FTA-ABS and MHA-TP) result within 2–3 years after treatment. In these two studies, no patients treated for secondary syphilis or stages of longer duration of infection seroreverted the reactive treponemal test. Seroreversion of treponemal tests can also occur in patients with advanced HIV disease and AIDS.

### A modern reassessment of glycoprotein-specific direct platelet autoantibody testing in immune thrombocytopenia [^bd05fc83]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Platelet autoantibody (PA) testing has previously shown poor sensitivity for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) diagnosis, but no previous study used both 2011 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for ITP diagnosis and 2012 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) PA testing recommendations. We therefore performed a comprehensive retrospective study of PA testing in adult patients with ITP strictly applying these criteria. Of 986 PA assays performed, 485 assays in 368 patients met criteria and were included. Sensitivity and specificity of a positive test result for diagnosis of active ITP (n = 228 patients) were 90% and 78%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of a negative test result for clinical remission (n = 61 assays) were 87% and 91%. Antibodies against both glycoprotein IIb (GPIIb)/IIIa and GPIb/IX were required for the presence of antibodies against GPIa/IIa in patients with ITP. Logistic regression analysis revealed that more positive autoantibodies predicted more severe disease (relative to nonsevere ITP, relative risk ratio for severe ITP and refractory ITP was 2.27 [P < .001] and 3.09 [P < .001], respectively, per additional autoantibody); however, serologic testing did not meaningfully predict treatment response to glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or thrombopoietin receptor agonists. Sixty-four patients with ITP had multiple PA assays performed longitudinally: all 10 patients achieving remission converted from positive to negative serologic results, and evidence for epitope spreading was observed in 35% of patients with ongoing active disease. In conclusion, glycoprotein-specific direct PA testing performed using ISTH recommendations in patients meeting ASH diagnostic criteria is sensitive and specific for ITP diagnosis and reliably confirms clinical remission. More glycoproteins targeted by autoantibodies predicts for more severe disease.

Second, the diagnosis of syphilis infection with low RPR titre (TPHA/TPPA +, RPR < 8) would be of clinical interest. Although this serological category is not included in the WHO TPP because RPR remains stable at low titre in many cases of successfully treated syphilis (serofast reaction), clinical guidelines in many countries dictate that all patients reactive to both treponemal (TPHA or TPPA) and non-treponemal tests (RPR) at any titre are considered to have active syphilis and should be treated. Results of our South Africa study suggested that the TP-IgA POCT could potentially be sensitive enough to pick up syphilis cases with low RPR titre, enabling same day testing and treatment at the point-of-care. In addition, the use of the TP-IgA test in combination with another standard screening test would further identify 71% of past-treated syphilis, significantly reducing overtreatment. It is noted that the DPP Syphilis Screen & Confirm test, although meeting the WHO TPP with a sensitivity of > 85% for detecting samples with high RPR titre (≥ 8), does not appear to reduce over treatment of syphilis.

### Is It possible to screen for primary aldosteronism effectively in primary care? [^bcf8e5b9]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Comparison of test performance (sensitivity and negative predictive value) was made using data from individuals who had a diagnosis of PA confirmed or PA excluded, and ARR tests in both primary and secondary care settings. Among the 455 individuals referred to secondary care, 400 individuals had a confirmed outcome (confirmed PA [n = 107] or PA excluded [n = 293]). Thirty‐nine individuals with 'possible PA' diagnosis and 16 individuals with unknown final diagnosis were excluded from this analysis. Among the 400 individuals with confirmed outcome, primary and secondary care ARR data were available from 364 (secondary care ARR test results were not available in 36 individuals due to the test not being done or data missing). Among the 364 individuals included in this analysis, sensitivity in detecting confirmed PA was comparable between primary care (91.7% [95% CI 87.3–96.2]) and secondary care (92.1% [95% CI 87.2–97.1])) (p = 0.467). Similarly, negative predictive values were also comparable between primary care (93.6% [95% CI 90.0–97.1]) and secondary care (96.0% [95% CI 93.5–98.6]) (p = 0.191) (Supporting Table S2). Changing the laboratory assay methods in 2015 did not affect the comparability of primary and secondary care test results. Using different definitions for positive ARR result (i.e. including aldosterone or renin thresholds) did not change the test performance (Supporting Table S3). The percentage of individuals with false positive and false negative primary care ARR screening has varied over time with no clear trend (Supporting material Figure S3).

### Point-of-care diagnosis and monitoring of fibrinolysis resistance in the critically ill: results from a feasibility study [^665d57c5]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Of the 23 cases who had plasminogen 147 μg/mL added to the TPA-test (Additional file 1: Table S1, Column D), 8 (35%) cases demonstrated a median reduction in LT of 69 [44–77]%. All these cases had a baseline TPA-test LT (Additional file 1: Table S1, Column A) of > 1000 s (Cases 1, 5, 10, 25–28, 32). Two of these cases (25 and 26) who registered a LT between 1000 and 2400 s, responded to additional t-PA supplementation (Additional file 1: Table S1, Column B), as well as to plasminogen supplementation of the TPA-test (Additional file 1: Table S1, Column D). In contrast, 15 (65%) cases demonstrated a median 51 [37–125]% prolongation of the lysis time in response to 147 μg/mL plasminogen supplementation (Additional file 1: Table S1, Column D). All these patients had a baseline TPA-test LT (Additional file 1: Table S1, Column A) of < 1000 s and all had responded to additional t-PA supplementation (Additional file 1: Table S1, Column B) when tested. Additional file 1: Fig. S2 illustrates the effect of plasminogen supplementation on the TPA-test LT in patients with a baseline TPA-test LT > 1000 s vs those with a LT < 1000 s. No such inhibitory effect on the LT was observed in 9 cases where the TPA-test was supplemented with the lower concentration of 59 μg/mL plasminogen (Additional file 1: Table S1, Column C) with reductions in LT observed irrespective of the baseline TPA-test LT (Additional file 1: Table S1, Column A); however, the reductions measured were not as substantial as those achieved with 147 μg/mL plasminogen, median 12 [7.5–32.5]%.

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^34a63bb7]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

The sensitivity of manual treponemal tests in primary syphilis has been estimated from studies that used reference standards such as darkfield microscopy (,–), clinical findings, or stored serum collected from patients staged as having primary syphilis, although the criteria used to stage the disease were not fully described (Supplementary Table 2). MHA-TP had a sensitivity of 53.0%, 72.5%, and 88.6% in studies that used darkfield microscopy as the reference standard. In studies that used stored sera collected from patients who were clinically classified as having primary syphilis, MHA-TP had a sensitivity of 45.9%, 64% and, 88.6%. A 2019 study involving 959 patients, 55 of whom were classified as having primary syphilis (on the basis of serology, physical findings, and positive or negative darkfield microscopy) reported a sensitivity of 78.2% (95% CI = 65.0%–88.2%) and 94.5% (95% CI = 84.9%–98.9%) for FTA-ABS and TPPA, respectively. Other studies with fewer patients, different reference standards, or both are more difficult to compare; sensitivities of FTA-ABS and TPPA have ranged from 88.4% to 100% and 86.2% to 100%, respectively, for primary syphilis (,–).

### Syphilis [^78dc336b]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

What should I do with inconclusive results?

Generally, inconclusive results arise in early infection or from waning antibody levels in late infection. The most common combinations are:

A positive RPR with negative treponemal screening (EIA/CLIA) and confirmatory tests (TPPA) suggests the RPR result is a false positive
A positive screen (EIA/CLIA) with negative confirmatory test (TPPA) and negative RPR is likely a false positive but could indicate early infection
A positive screen (EIA/CLIA) with indeterminant confirmatory test (TPPA) and negative RPR could represent waning antibody levels after a previous, treated infection or a new infection.

When results are inconclusive, clinicians should inquire about previous syphilis infection and treatment, and, if early syphilis is possible, retest in two to four weeks. If results are unchanged, interpretation is based on history — consider the possibility of late untreated infection, treated infection, or non-venereal treponemal disease in adults from endemic countries in South and Central America, South-East Asia, and Africa.

### Diagnostic performance ofparticle agglutination tests against electrochemiluminescence immunoassays for the detection of anti-TP antibodies: evaluation study [^3ea2be3b]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

In general, the current study evaluated the performance of the index test TPPA against the reference test. It is already known that TPPA is a treponemal test mostly used as a confirmatory test. It is often employed when initial screening tests, such as non-treponemal tests, are positive. However, this test is not in use in Ethiopia and there was a need to evaluate it in-country before use. Therefore, the only treponemal test we have in use and can be used as confirmatory is ECLIA. Keeping in mind the TPPA can be used as a confirmatory test, we evaluated it in an Ethiopian setting to generate evidence of the performance characteristics of the index test. The results of the present study suggest that TPPA can be used as equivalent to the ECLIA. This helps to ensure accurate and reliable results in the diagnosis of syphilis in low-income countries particularly where there is no electric utility.

Our study demonstrated that the diagnostic performance of the TPPA test is comparable to that of the ECLIA for the detection of syphilis. Thus, TPPA could be used as an equivalent to ECLIA and an equally effective alternative and cost-effective tool for syphilis diagnosis.

Results

Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics

A total of 581 participants were included in this performance evaluation study. Of the total participants, two-thirds (65.4%) were female. The mean age of the participants was 39.7 years (± SD 16.6), with an age range of 18–94 years. The majority (45.3%) of the participants were aged 26–35 years. Among the 380 female participants, 77 (20.3%) were pregnant.

Clinical performance of the TPPA test

A total of 581 specimens were tested by both index test and reference test. According to the results of the reference test, 151 specimens were positive (table 1). The sensitivity of the index test against the reference test was 99.4% (95% CI 96.4% to 100%), while the specificity was 100% (95% CI 99.2% to 100%) (table 1). The positive predictive value of the index test compared with that of the reference test was 100% (95% CI 97.6% to 100%), while the negative predictive value was 99.8% (95% CI 98.4% to 100%) (table 1). There were 0% invalid test results.

Table 1
Performance characteristics of the index test compared with those of the reference test

Analysis of discordant results

Among the 581 participants, one test was discordant between the reference test and index test methods. An alternative method such as western blotting or immunoblotting is recommended to investigate the discrepant results. However, we do not have these methods in our country. Thus, to explore this discrepancy, the participant had a history of syphilis infection with no notable current symptom which seems latent syphilis, and further testing was conducted by repeating both the reference test and index test. The repeated test result confirmed the discordant result in which the index test yielded a false negative result for a single sample.

### Diagnostic tests: how to estimate the positive predictive value [^7ea4931e]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2015). Low credibility.

When a patient receives a positive test result from a diagnostic test they assume they have the disease. However, the positive predictive value (PPV), ie the probability that they have the disease given a positive test result, is rarely equal to one. To assist their patients, doctors must explain the chance that they do in fact have the disease. However, physicians frequently miscalculate the PPV as the sensitivity and/or misinterpret the PPV, which results in increased anxiety in patients and generates unnecessary tests and consultations. The reasons for this miscalculation as well as three ways to calculate the PPV are reviewed here.

### Extending the role of tryptase in perioperative anaphylaxis: predicting positive results in basophil activation tests [^b5cdcadc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations to this study. The performance of BAT is dependent on multiple other factors, including individual laboratory variations, basophil counts, patient comorbidities, and specific culprits, which were not studied. It should be noted that BAT has varying sensitivity and specificity for different causes of PA, with fairly satisfactory performance against, for instance, neuromuscular-blocking agents and chlorhexidine, but not β-lactam antibiotics., We did not specifically look into potential differences in CD63 and CD203c expression. The exact timing of tryptase sampling (within the 4-hour window) was not available either. Furthermore, not all identified culprits were confirmed by drug provocation tests. Despite the fact that all included patients had an exact culprit identified by multiple diagnostic modalities, which were concordant with a clinical diagnosis made by an allergist, there remains a possibility of false-positive results. Prospective and multicenter studies will be required to overcome these limitations and evaluate this novel utility of tryptase results. Regardless, we believe that our findings are of empirical value and could help inform clinicians planning their investigations in real-life practice.

In conclusion, we observed that tryptase elevation is a very sensitive predictor of BAT positivity among patients with identified culprits of PA. Given the additional utility of tryptase levels in predicting BAT positivity, we strongly reinforce the importance of measuring acute tryptase in all instances of suspected PA. Acute elevation of tryptase would not only aid in confirming anaphylaxis but may also help guide the decision toward selecting labor-intensive and costly in vitro tests such as BAT.

### Meta-analysis of studies on biochemical marker tests for the diagnosis of premature rupture of membranes: comparison of performance indexes [^13e5c6da]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Data extracted from each study included: year of publication, inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study (e.g. active bleeding), gestational age at test performance (range), number of women excluded and rationale for exclusion, reference method used to confirm PROM, condition of women at the beginning of the study (total women with suspected and confirmed or non-confirmed PROM), rapid test results and diagnosis (ruptured membranes or intact membranes) at final evaluation. When values of true positive (TP), false negative (FN), true negative (TN) and false positive (FP), were not explicitly reported, these were estimated based on sensitivity and specificity values and confidence intervals reported in the original publications.

To provide an estimation of the predictive performance of the tests, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV results for each study were calculated according to the Newcombe efficient-score method (corrected for continuity), taking into account only the number of women with confirmed diagnosis of rupture according to the reference method in each study (per protocol, cases of suspected PROM without later confirmation of the diagnosis were not included in the final analysis). To further explore the results of this pooled analysis, a post-hoc comparison along with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) was also performed using the chi-square test, between each test result for subgroups whose membrane status was known and those who had a suspected membrane rupture, in order to explore reasons for potential differences. In this comparison, known membrane status refers to those women for whom membrane integrity status was clearly defined, i.e. women without any symptoms or suspicion of PROM and women who had an artificial rupture. Suspected membrane rupture refers to women whose membrane status was not known upon study entry and who were being evaluated for a suspected rupture. All probability values were 2-tailed and were corrected for multiple testing, and p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All the statistical analyses were performed using Excel 2007 and SPSS 19.0 for Windows.

The results are presented for each test considering the pooled data and then stratified according to whether the membrane status was known (intact or ruptured) or PROM was clinically suspected.

Materials and methods

Study design and site

We conducted a multicentre cross-sectional study in five selected public (three) and private (two) health facilities in Addis Ababa to evaluate the diagnostic performance of TPPA from November 2021 to February 2022.

Study population

All patients visiting sexual and reproductive health clinics and pregnant women attending antenatal care in selected health facilities of Addis Ababa were the study population.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Patients who have current clinical symptoms of syphilis and a history of syphilis, and pregnant women with first antenatal visit and follow-up visit were included in the study. Some participants included were laboratory-tested positive with RPR. However, severely sick individuals, individuals who were participating in another study, vulnerable groups (under 18 years of age, mentally incapable and prisoners) and individuals who have received treatment for syphilis or other antibiotics that could affect the study outcomes in the last 30 days were excluded from this study.

Sample size and sampling method

We used the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) User Protocol for Evaluation of Qualitative Test Performance guidelines to determine the sample size for this study. The guidelines state that:

The options available to the evaluator are to test specimens until the desired number of positive and negative results with the comparative method is obtained, or to test specimens until a desired number of specimens with positive results is obtained with the comparative method, using all accumulated specimens with negative results in the analysis. As a minimum guideline, testing should continue until results from at least 50 positive specimens are obtained with both the new test and reference methods.

CLSI also recommended using a higher sample size to narrow the CI. Thus, to obtain sufficient positive specimens and include more pregnant women in the study, we screened 581 eligible patients with suspected syphilis or who had a history of syphilis. We included more pregnant women as they are at a higher risk for syphilis than the general population and to help prevent congenital diseases that could lead to severe health outcomes for infants. All the screened participants were included in the analysis as per the recommendation of CLSI. We selected the study sites purposely based on their syphilis case loads at reproductive and antenatal clinics of the health facilities to obtain the required sample size in the set study period.

### Influence of population prevalences on numbers of false positives: an overlooked entity [^3d0115cc]. Academic Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Disease prevalence alters the number of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false negatives (FN), and false positives (FP), even if the sensitivity and specificity of a test stays the same.

Methods and Materials

We illustrate this using data for the detection of suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE) from the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis II (PIOPED II). We chose PE because of the clinical significance of the disease, the low prevalence of PE in the patient population being tested with CTPA with the widespread adoption of CTPA, and the serious clinical consequences of anticoagulation therapy in FP patients.

Results

Based on PIOPED II data (sensitivity 83%, specificity 96%), at a disease prevalence of approximately 5%, the number of FP patients is greater than the number of TP patients. Scaled to the US population, at a disease prevalence of 5%, there would be 139,800 FPs and 3,356,200 TNs. Assuming a mortality rate of 0.5% and a 3.0% rate of major bleeding secondary to anticoagulation therapy for well-controlled patients, if all FP patients received anticoagulation, there would be 699 deaths and 4194 major bleeding complications.

Conclusions

At a prevalence of approximately 5% for PE, the number of FPs approaches or is greater than the number of TPs for CTPA for the detection of suspected acute PE. Patients with FP results may receive unnecessary, potentially harmful treatment with anticoagulation therapy. Population prevalence of disease needs to be taken into account along with the diagnostic accuracy of a test, because this may significantly affect downstream patient outcomes.

### Syphilis predicts HIV incidence among men and transgender women who have sex with men in a preexposure prophylaxis trial [^8eb4d0db]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Participants diagnosed with prevalent and incident syphilis (see definitions below) were treated in accordance with local guidelines, or if not available, according to the 2006 sexually transmitted disease guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Evaluation and treatment were managed by the local treating physician under the supervision of the site investigator. Each incident case was also reviewed by a studywide clinical monitoring committee to ensure that appropriate guidance for clinical management was provided.

Definitions

At screening, we examined the number of participants with a positive RPR result and a positive confirmatory test, which was defined as syphilis prevalence. Patients newly diagnosed with syphilis were treated and their serological response was subsequently monitored. At follow-up, incident syphilis was defined as (1) a change in serology from negative to positive with confirmation by FTA-ABS, or (2) at least a 4-fold increase in serological titer from prior test with documentation of prior treatment appropriate for the stage of syphilis.

Person-time was calculated for participants with incident syphilis as time between enrollment and first episode and for HIV as the time between enrollment and first evidence of HIV infection. For participants without syphilis, person-time was calculated as years between enrollment and the date of last syphilis test. Those with confirmed syphilis at screening without clear documentation of prior effective treatment were treated and were excluded from the analysis of syphilis incidence, unless clear documentation of prior effective treatment was available.

Detected drug was defined as the detection of FTC or TDF in plasma or FTC-TP or TFV-DP in PBMCs regardless of level.

### Clinical and laboratory diagnosis for tuberculosis… [^2b184ed6]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- All persons with signs or symptoms of TB disease, or a positive result from a TB blood test or skin test should be medically evaluated for TB disease.
- Latent TB infection is diagnosed if the person has a positive result from a TB blood test or skin test and a medical evaluation does not indicate TB disease.
- TB disease is diagnosed by medical history, physical examination, chest x-ray, and other laboratory tests, including culture. Considerations All persons with signs or symptoms of TB disease or a positive result from a TB blood test or tuberculin skin test should be medically evaluated for TB disease.

Diagnosis A complete medical evaluation for TB disease has five components:

- Medical history
- Physical examination
- TB blood tests or TB skin test
- Chest radiograph
- Bacteriologic examination When conducting a medical history, the health care provider should ask about the following: Some signs of extrapulmonary TB disease may be observed during a physical examination. There are two tests that are used to determine if a person has been infected with TB bacteria:

- TB blood test
- TB skin test. Interpreting test results A positive TB blood test result or TB skin test result usually means TB infection. More tests, such as a chest radiograph, are needed to rule out TB disease.

Some people with TB disease may have a negative TB blood test or TB skin test result. If a patient has signs or symptoms of TB disease, health care providers should not wait for TB blood test or TB skin test results before starting other diagnostic tests. Normal findings on chest radiography generally can be used to rule out pulmonary TB in a person who has had a positive reaction to a TB blood test or TB skin test and no symptoms of disease. Rare exceptions have been noted in patients with HIV whose immune status has not been restored by anti-viral treatment. Examinations of clinical specimens are of critical diagnostic importance. The specimens should be examined and cultured in a laboratory that specializes in testing for.

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^01aba5e7]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Although data suggest that nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) test performance sensitivities do not significantly differ between persons living with and without HIV infection, studies have reported increased likelihood of BFP in HIV-positive persons. In studies with samples sizes that ranged from 789 to 300,000, serum testing by VDRL or RPR indicated that the rate of BFP results was 2.5–34.5 times higher among HIV-positive persons than HIV-negative persons. These studies were conducted in populations before antiretroviral therapy was widely available or in populations where viral load was not assessed. BFP rates in persons living with HIV infection who are virally suppressed have not been studied.

Treponemal test positivity generally persists after previously treated infection, unless the infection is treated before the secondary stage, as has been previously described in persons without HIV infection. Before modern antiretroviral therapy, seroreversion of either the MHA-TP or FTA-ABS test was found to vary by severity of HIV disease in two studies and was lower for asymptomatic HIV infection (five of 69 patients) than symptomatic HIV/AIDS (eight of 21 patients) in one study. In another study, seroreversion was identified in 14% of 29 patients with asymptomatic HIV infection and 41% of 29 patients with symptomatic HIV infection. However, two subsequent studies including 31 and 104 patients found no difference in seroreversion of treponemal tests by HIV status in patients previously treated for syphilis. In a more recent study of 294 patients with previous syphilis followed for ≥ 6 months after treatment and with no signs of syphilis during the follow-up interval, 87% were reactive for FTA-ABS, 92% for TPPA, and 96%–99% for one of four treponemal immunoassays. Treponemal immunoassays were statistically significantly more likely to remain reactive compared with FTA-ABS.

Recommendation for syphilis serologic testing in persons living with HIV/AIDS. Nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) and treponemal tests should be interpreted in the same manner regardless of HIV status (Box).

Comment and evidence summary. On the basis of existing data, nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) and treponemal tests should be interpreted the same for patients with and without HIV infection.

What about follow-up?

Because syphilis has no test-of-cure, conversion to a non-reactive RPR is the best evidence of successful treatment. Patients should be tested at the start of treatment and monitored at six and 12 months. No clinical data guide interpretation of RPR titres after treatment, and guidelines are based on expert opinion. See table 3 for recommendations from European, UK, US, Canadian, and WHO guidelines.

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: a retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^8dee8d49]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent review suggested that the sensitivity and specificity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and chemiluminescent assays (CLIAs) may be comparable to agglutination assays. Updated national guidelines in regions where TPPA has been discontinued suggest that confirmatory testing may be performed with treponemal ELISA/CLIA. However, to maximize specificity, testing and confirmation with two treponemal assays with different antigens is recommended. There are many commercially available treponemal ELISA/CLIA, most using recombinant treponemal antigens (Tp15, Tp17, and Tp47) to detect IgM and/or IgG antibodies. However, since most of these assays share a common antigen (Tp17), selecting a confirmatory test with distinct antigens can be difficult. Additionally, these assays often require significant specimen volumes, making them impractical as a third test in syphilis serology, particularly in pediatric testing, where sample volumes are often low. Further, many of these assays require expensive instruments, making them unfeasible for smaller clinical laboratories due to high initial costs and ongoing maintenance.

Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the performance of alternative syphilis confirmatory assays, including four Treponema pallidum hemagglutination tests (TPHAs) and one T. pallidum IgG ELISA, to address knowledge gaps in confirmatory testing pathways. Our work provides valuable data on the performance of syphilis serology assays, helping to improve testing strategies and address limitations in current diagnostic practices.

The 4 (19%) cases who had no response to additional t-PA supplementation responded to plasminogen supplementation of the TPA-test resulting in a median 68.5 [61–81.3]% reduction in LT (examples depicted in Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
Example of patients requiring the combination of t-PA and plasminogen. Cases 27 and 28 (top two rows, Additional file 1: Table S1) demonstrated above normal values in the clot amplitude (A5, A10) and maximum clot firmness (MCF) on both FIB-test and EX-test. The first of the TPA-tests was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions and hence contained t-PA 650 ng/mL blood. In both cases, little to no lysis occurred; hence, a LT was not registered. In the second of the TPA-tests, the t-PA dose was doubled as described in Fig. 3. In both cases, the increased t-PA dose did alter observed fibrinolysis and a LT was not registered. In the final TPA-tests on the right-hand side in cases 27 and 28, the blood was passed through a tip containing plasminogen 147 μg/mL as described in Fig. 3. In both cases, the addition of plasminogen induced clot lysis significantly shortening the LT which overall remained above normal. Case 5 (third row, Additional file 1: Table S1) demonstrates that on the standard TPA-test (650 ng/mL), the double-dose TPA-test (1.3 μg/mL) and even a triple-dose TPA-test (1.95 μg/mL), a concentration-dependent reduction in the MCF was observed but did not reach 50%, and therefore, no lysis time was registered. When plasminogen 59 μg/mL was added to the triple-dose TPA-test, a significant increase in clot lysis occurred and a LT was registered

### Syphilis-STI treatment guidelines… [^c7ef6c4c]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

A presumptive diagnosis of syphilis requires use of two laboratory serologic tests: a nontreponemal test and a treponemal test. At least 18 treponemal-specific tests are cleared for use in the United States. Use of only one type of serologic test is insufficient for diagnosis and can result in false-negative results among persons tested during primary syphilis and false-positive results among persons without syphilis or previously treated syphilis. 566, 569). Therefore, persons with a reactive nontreponemal test should always receive a treponemal test to confirm the syphilis diagnosis.

Nontreponemal test antibody titers might correlate with disease activity and are used for monitoring treatment response. If the nontreponemal test is negative, the laboratory should perform a treponemal test different from the one used for initial testing, preferably TP-PA or treponemal assay based on different antigens than the original test, to adjudicate the results of the initial test. Multiple studies demonstrate that high quantitative index values or high signal-to-cutoff ratio from treponemal EIA or CIA tests correlate with TP-PA positivity, which might eliminate the need for additional confirmatory testing; however, the range of index values varies among different treponemal immunoassays, and the values that correspond to high levels of reactivity with confirmatory testing might differ by immunoassay.

When CSF-VDRL is negative despite clinical signs of neurosyphilis, reactive serologic tests results, lymphocytic pleocytosis, or protein, neurosyphilis should be considered. In that instance, additional evaluation by using fluorescent treponemal-antibody absorption or TP-PA testing on CSF might be warranted.

3.3 Factors Predicting PA During Primary Care Assessment

Predictors of final diagnosis were determined using data from 400 individuals with confirmed outcome (PA confirmed or PA excluded). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, hypertension, male sex, hypokalaemia and high ARR were independent predictors of confirmed PA (as opposed to no PA) (Table 3).

Table 3
Predictors of confirmed PA, as determined at the time of primary care assessment.

Amongst biochemical tests performed in primary care, area under the ROC curve for diagnosing PA was statistically significantly higher for ARR (0.81, 95% CI 0.77–0.86) (Supporting Table S4 (a) and (b)). Aldosterone to renin ratio > 34.7 (sensitivity 87.9%, specificity 64.8%), aldosterone level > 418 pmol/L (Sensitivity 75.7%, specificity 51.9%), direct renin concentration < 21.9 mIU/L (sensitivity 88.8%, specificity 51.5%) and potassium level < 3.5 mmol/L (sensitivity 78.6%, specificity 48.0%) were the optimum independent cut‐off thresholds for predicting PA at primary care assessment (Supporting Table S5). (Note that results of direct renin concentration derived from iSYS assay in our reference laboratory are approximately equivalent to twice the value derived from most other assays [see Section 1 in Supporting material]).

On multivariable logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex, and use of different antihypertensive medications, use of beta‐blocker was associated with higher risk of false positive test result (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.1–12.0, p = 0.042, when compared to true positive result). The association between false negative test result in primary care and use of ACEI/ARBs did not reach statistical significance (OR 3.6, 95% CI 0.8–16.7, p = 0.104 when compared to true negative result) (Supporting Tables S6 and S7). Diuretics did not show an association with false positive or false negative results, but only 8.7% of patients were on diuretics at the time of primary care testing. Three patients had secondary care tests done while on interfering medications (beta blockers) as it was not possible to stop the medication due to other compelling indications. Excluding them from the analyses did not alter the results.

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^ec837ec3]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

No published data are available that examined whether reversion to a nonreactive treponemal test occurs with an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or a chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIA) after treatment for syphilis. Treponemal tests, unlike nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests, cannot be used to monitor response to therapy because they remain reactive indefinitely. In patients with a history of treated syphilis and reactive treponemal test results, additional treponemal testing is not helpful for detecting reinfection and is not recommended. In this case, nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) testing titers along with clinical history of syphilis, physical examination, and sexual risk assessment, including contact history, must be used to determine infection status.

Manual treponemal tests include FTA-ABS, TPPA, Captia Syphilis IgG EIA, Trep-Sure EIA, and Zeus Scientific EIA. Manual assays are typically used as reflex tests to confirm reactive nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) specimens in the traditional testing algorithm. The FTA-ABS test is based on florescence microscopy and uses a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antihuman immunoglobulin to detect antibody binding to whole T. pallidum that has been fixed on a glass slide. TPPA is an indirect agglutination assay with T. pallidum antigens bound to gelatin particles.

The manual TPHA and MHA-TP tests are no longer available for in vitro diagnostics in the United States but are still used in certain international settings. TPHA and MHA-TP are indirect agglutination with T. pallidum antigens bound to avian or ovine erythrocytes. MHA-TP is a microplate version of TPHA.

As of December 31, 2021, a total of 12 FDA-cleared automated treponemal immunoassays were available for clinical use, including EIA, CIA, and multiplex flow (microbead) immunoassays (MFIA). In contrast to the manual assays, the treponemal immunoassays are often run as the initial test in a reverse sequence screening algorithm. All FDA-cleared treponemal tests can be performed on serum; certain tests also can be performed on plasma, including heparin, EDTA, and citrate plasma. Certain laboratories also have also validated use of treponemal tests with dried blood spots (DBS); however, no available tests have been cleared by FDA for this specimen type, nor have data been published on DBS specimens collected in the United States to aid in the diagnosis of syphilis.

### Point-of-care diagnosis and monitoring of fibrinolysis resistance in the critically ill: results from a feasibility study [^e9fc05ec]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The data obtained in the ex vivo supplementation experiments identified two states of fibrinolysis resistance: (i) one that could be corrected with t-PA supplementation alone, thus suggesting reduced t-PA activity such as due to an excess of PAI-1, and (ii) the other that required the addition of t-PA and plasminogen, thus suggesting reduced plasmin activity on its own, due to excessive consumption or inhibition by α2-antiplasmin, or in combination with reduced t-PA activity. As part of the acute phase inflammatory response, endothelial cells and platelets release t-PA and plasminogen activator-1 (PAI-1), the principal inhibitor of t-PA. Thus, an imbalance of t-PA:PAI-1 levels may rapidly develop resulting in fibrinolysis resistance that correlates with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome and death in bacterial and viral infection. Moreover, in a study of 29 patients critically ill with COVID-19, the ClotPro TPA-test LT was found to significantly correlate with plasma PAI-1 levels (r = 0.70; p < 0.0006).

Syphilis Laboratory Test Reporting

Reporting to Public Health Departments

Syphilis has important public health implications, and cases are required to be reported to state or local health departments by the health care provider, laboratory, or both, depending on the state public health reporting statutes. Because clinical information might be unavailable to the laboratory, all positive syphilis direct detection tests, along with specimen site and positive syphilis serologic tests, should be reported to state and local health departments. State laws detail which syphilis test results to report and time frames for reporting laboratory results.

Both probable and confirmed cases of syphilis should be reported by health care providers to the local or state health department. Clinical criteria used to stage patients with syphilis might differ from public health surveillance case definitions. Current case definitions are available at. For surveillance purposes, probable cases are defined as the patient having signs or symptoms consistent with the stage of syphilis and having supportive laboratory test results (e.g. serology) that detect an immune response to the pathogen. A confirmed case is similar except that the presence of the organism is verified by a direct detection method specific for T. pallidum.

Reporting to Health Care Providers

When reporting results to health care providers, laboratories should list all tests used, report each result with an interpretation, and document the syphilis algorithm applied to render the interpretation, when appropriate. Any changes in the test algorithm should be communicated to the submitter and include information about differences in interpretation depending on the test algorithm. Preliminary results released to the submitter should list tests that are pending. All the tests and results should be listed in the final report, even if one or more tests (e.g. the nontreponemal [lipoidal antigen] tests or TPPA) were sent to an outside laboratory.

### Diagnostic performance ofparticle agglutination tests against electrochemiluminescence immunoassays for the detection of anti-TP antibodies: evaluation study [^f97a751d]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

Although the burden of syphilis is slightly increasing worldwide, there are a limited number of rapid, simple-to-use, accurate and cost-effective diagnostic tools available. Thus, we aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) test (hereafter called index test) against an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) (hereafter called reference test). We selected the available treponemal reference test (ECLIA) to evaluate the index test (TPPA) which is not currently in use in Ethiopia.

Methods

We conducted a multicentre cross-sectional study to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the index test against the reference test. We enrolled 581 syphilis-suspected cases from the five selected health facilities in Addis Ababa in this study. We collected data on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and whole blood from each participant. We estimated the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of the index test.

Results

Of the 581 participants, 380 (65.4%) were female. The mean age of the participants was 39.7 years (± SD 16.6), with an age range of 18–94 years. The sensitivity of the index test was 99.4% (95% CI 96.4% to 100%), while the specificity was 100%. The positive predictive value of the index test was 100%, and the negative predictive value was 99.8% (95% CI 98.4% to 100%). There was no invalid test result.

Conclusions

The diagnostic performance of TPPA for syphilis was equivalent to that of ECLIA. Thus, TPPA can be used for the diagnosis of syphilis at the health facility level equivalent to a reference test.

### Open access online calculator predicts peanut-allergic reactions with high accuracy [^95cfe9a0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The Peanut Allergy Prediction Web Tool is a newly developed online aid, which calculates the probability of an individual's allergic reaction based on their SPT, Ara h 2-specific IgE (Ara h 2-sIgE) and/or basophil activation test (BAT) results.

Objective

To validate the diagnostic performance of the online tool and assess its ability to discriminate between peanut-allergic (PA) and peanut-sensitised tolerant (PST) cases.

Methods

Demographical data, clinical history, results for SPT, Ara h 2-sIgE, BAT and oral food challenge (OFC) outcomes were collected for paediatric cases with a confirmed peanut allergy status (PA or PST). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, area under the curve (AUC) and sensitivity (S), specificity (Sp) positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were determined to assess the diagnostic performance of the tool using variations of one, two or three test results.

Results

AUC value for all test results combinations exhibited excellent degrees of discriminative performance between PA and PST individuals. The BAT was the greatest single test performer (AUC = 0.945; S = 85%; Sp = 97%; PPV = 99%; NPV = 71%). The two-test combination of Ara h 2-sIgE and BAT, (AUC = 0.959; S = 87%; Sp = 97%; PPV = 99%; NPV = 74%) and the three-test combination (AUC = 0.949; S = 88%; Sp = 89%; PPV = 96%; NPV = 74%) demonstrated the highest discriminatory ability and diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion

The Peanut Allergy Prediction Web Tool's diagnostic performance proves highly accurate using several different combinations of test results when classifying PA and PST cases. Future validation is needed to assess the tool's performance in predicting PA severity in comparison to OFC outcomes.

### Diagnostic performance ofparticle agglutination tests against electrochemiluminescence immunoassays for the detection of anti-TP antibodies: evaluation study [^38acd355]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of TPPA against ECLIA. The sensitivity of the index test was 99.4%, while the specificity was 100%. The positive predictive value of the index test was 100%, and the negative predictive value was 99.8%. Moreover, 0% of the test results were invalid.

In the present study, the index test could detect 100% of true negatives and 99.4% of true positives for diagnosing syphilis which favours the use index test equivalent to a reference test. This finding is similar to those of a previous study in which the agreement between the two methods was high (100%). In different studies, ECLIA was compared against TPPA and reported high agreement in both sensitivity and specificity between the two methods. Of course, in some of these studies, TPPA was considered a reference test in which high agreement between TPPA and ECLIA was reported. This finding is comparable with the findings of the current study, in which the sensitivity and specificity of TPPA were high (99.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity), which is highly comparable with the reference test ECLIA in our case. Therefore, TPPA is an ideal diagnostic tool for syphilis with high-performance characteristics compared with the reference test.

A previous study reported six invalid test results for TPPA that were positive for ECLIA. This result is inconsistent with the findings of the present study, in which no invalid results were observed. This discrepancy between the current and previous studies regarding the validity of the results could be due to sample volume, testing procedures and technician competency.

The traditional algorithms (non-treponemal test followed by confirmatory treponemal test) and/or reverse (initial screening by treponemal followed by non-treponemal test) screening algorithms for syphilis diagnosis are used in different parts of the world. Totten et al reported that the sensitivity of the reverse algorithm was 98.3%, whereas the traditional algorithm was 72.9%, which indicates reverse algorithm is better than the traditional algorithm. Moreover, Nah et al showed patients diagnosed with latent syphilis could be diagnosed by the reverse screening algorithm but not by the traditional algorithm.

INTRODUCTION

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum. In 2019, the estimated global prevalence of syphilis was 49.7 million, a 61% increase from 1990. Rates of syphilis have risen significantly in many high- and middle-income countries over the past decade. In England, notifications more than doubled between 2013 and 2022 (6.2–15.4 per 100,000), while they more than tripled in Australia and the United States (US) (7.6–24.3 per 100,000 and 5.5–17.7 per 100,000, respectively). Rates of congenital syphilis have also surged, with a 755% increase reported in the US between 2012 and 2021. Syphilis can present with numerous symptoms and lead to severe conditions including neurosyphilis. In pregnancy, syphilis infection can be transmitted vertically, causing neonatal morbidity and mortality.

Serological testing is the primary method for diagnosing syphilis, involving multiple tests to screen, confirm, and stage the infection. The reverse screening algorithm is commonly used in high-volume laboratories. This algorithm begins with a sensitive treponemal antibody immunoassay. If this assay is positive, it is followed by non-treponemal antibody tests. If the treponemal and non-treponemal results are discordant, a second confirmatory treponemal test is performed. In the United Kingdom and Australia, if the screening treponemal antibody result is positive, national guidelines recommend concurrent performance of non-treponemal and treponemal tests. The Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) assay is considered the preferred assay for confirmatory treponemal testing in international guidelines. However, due to regulatory restrictions, this test has been withdrawn from some regions, including Europe and Australia. This has necessitated rapid updates to guidelines and evaluations of alternative tests and diagnostic algorithms. Although the TPPA remains available in other regions including the US, there is currently only one TPPA manufacturer worldwide. As such, there are potential weaknesses in the supply chain for this important test.

### Diagnostic accuracy of a point-of-care syphilis test when used among pregnant women in Bolivia [^3f201c35]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the performance of a point-of-care (POC) syphilis test when used in urban Bolivian maternity hospitals.

Methods

We tested 8892 pregnant women for syphilis using the Abbott Determine Syphilis TP rapid POC test and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) in the laboratory of four large urban maternity hospitals where national statistics reported a syphilis prevalence of at least 3%. Sera were stored and transferred to the national reference laboratory (INLASA) where RPR testing was repeated. When the reference laboratory staff observed a positive RPR result, a Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA) was performed to confirm these findings. We calculated test performance characteristics for the POC test and hospital RPR using RPR performed at the reference laboratory confirmed by TPPA as the reference standard. Participants received treatment during their initial visit based on the POC test results.

Results

The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive values of the POC syphilis test were: 91.8% (95% confidence intervals 88.4% to 94.5%), 98.5% (98.2% to 98.8%), 71.0% (66.6% to 75.2%), and 99.7% (99.5% to 99.8%), respectively. The RPR values were 75.7% (70.8% to 80.2%), 99.0% (98.9% to 99.3%), 76.9% (72.0% to 81.3%), and 99.0% (98.8% to 99.2%), respectively.

Conclusion

The Abbott Determine Syphilis TP test proved to be more sensitive than routine RPR and had comparable specificity. POC testing may be a simple way to expand syphilis screening to clinics with no laboratory facilities, improve case detection, and facilitate treatment delivery.

### Improving the coverage and accuracy of syphilis testing: the development of a novel rapid, point-of-care test for confirmatory testing of active syphilis infection and its early evaluation in China and South Africa [^87defda8]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Current point-of-care tests (POCT) for syphilis, based on the detection of Treponema pallidum (TP) total antibodies, have limited capacity in distinguishing between active and past/treated syphilis. We report the development and early evaluation of a new prototype POCT based on the detection of TP-IgA antibodies, a novel biomarker for active syphilis.

Methods

The TP-IgA POCT (index test) was developed in response to the World Health Organisation (WHO) target product profile (TPP) for a POCT for confirmatory syphilis testing. Two sub-studies were conducted consecutively using 458 pre-characterised stored plasma samples in China (sub-study one, addressing the criteria for the WHO TPP), and 503 venous blood samples collected from pregnant/postpartum women in South Africa (sub-study two, addressing potential clinical utility). Performance of the index test was assessed against standard laboratory-based serology using a combination of treponemal (TPHA) and non-treponemal (rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) tests.

Findings

In sub-study one, the index test demonstrated 96·1% (95%CI = 91·7%-98·5%) sensitivity and 84·7% (95%CI = 80·15–88·6%) specificity for identification of active syphilis (TPHA positive, RPR positive). It correctly identified 71% (107/150) samples of past-treated syphilis (TPHA positive, RPR negative). In sub-study two, the index test achieved 100% (95%CI = 59%-100%) sensitivity for active syphilis and correctly identified all nine women with past syphilis.

Interpretation

The TP-IgA POCT has met the WHO TPP for a POCT for diagnosis of active syphilis and demonstrated its potential utility in a clinical setting. Future studies are warranted to evaluate field performance of the final manufactured test.

Thus, we aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) test (hereafter called index test) against an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) (hereafter called reference test). We selected the available treponemal reference test (ECLIA) to evaluate the index test (TPPA) which is not currently in use in Ethiopia.

Methods

We conducted a multicentre cross-sectional study to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the index test against the reference test. We enrolled 581 syphilis-suspected cases from the five selected health facilities in Addis Ababa in this study. We collected data on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and whole blood from each participant. We estimated the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of the index test.

Results

Of the 581 participants, 380 (65.4%) were female. The mean age of the participants was 39.7 years (± SD 16.6), with an age range of 18–94 years. The sensitivity of the index test was 99.4% (95% CI 96.4% to 100%), while the specificity was 100%. The positive predictive value of the index test was 100%, and the negative predictive value was 99.8% (95% CI 98.4% to 100%). There was no invalid test result.

Conclusions

The diagnostic performance of TPPA for syphilis was equivalent to that of ECLIA. Thus, TPPA can be used for the diagnosis of syphilis at the health facility level equivalent to a reference test.

### Comparison of six automated Treponema-Specific antibody assays [^d48772d7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Six different Treponema (TP)-specific immunoassays were compared to the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test. A total of 615 samples were tested. The overall percent agreement, analytical sensitivity, and analytical specificity of each assay compared to the FTA-ABS test were as follows: Architect Syphilis TP, 99.2%, 96.8%, and 100%; Cobas Syphilis, 99.8%, 99.4%, and 100%; ADVIA Centaur Syphilis, 99.8%, 99.4%, and 100%; HISCL Anti-TP assay kit, 99.7%, 98.7%, and 100%; Immunoticles Auto3 TP, 99.0%, 97.5%, and 99.6%; Mediace TPLA, 98.0%, 98.1%, and 98.0%. All results that were discrepant between the TP-specific assays were associated with samples from noninfectious cases (11 immunoassay false positives and 7 from previous syphilis cases). Our study demonstrated that TP-specific immunoassays generally showed high sensitivities, specificities, and percentages of agreement compared to FTA-ABS, with rare cases of false-positive or false-negative results. Therefore, most TP-specific immunoassays are acceptable for use in screening for syphilis. However, it is important to perform a thorough review of a patient's clinical and treatment history for interpreting the results of syphilis serology.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^81aa5994]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyria genetic confirmation — Best Practice Advice 3 states that genetic testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of AHP in patients with positive biochemical testing. Once biochemical tests indicate AHP, confirmation of the specific type is usually established by genetic testing, and when whole-gene sequencing is performed, 95%–99% of cases can be identified; first-degree family members should be screened with genetic testing once the familial pathogenic variant has been identified and those who are mutation carriers should be counseled.
