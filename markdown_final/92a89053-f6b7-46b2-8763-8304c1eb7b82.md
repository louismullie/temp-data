## Question

What is Santa Clause's A1c

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what Santa Claus's hemoglobin A1c would be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any credible medical literature has actually measured Santa's A1c. Then, I should verify what the provided sources say about Santa Claus and whether they include any metabolic or laboratory data. Next, I will review authoritative A1c thresholds and what constitutes normal, prediabetes, and diabetes. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion and note any assumptions or limitations in the reasoning.

> Let me first confirm whether any of the supplied references provide Santa's A1c value. Wait, let me verify the Santa Claus–related material: the BMJ papers analyze Santa's hospital visitation patterns and geographic reach but do not report any physiologic measurements, including A1c, so there is no direct measurement of Santa's A1c in the provided sources [^116XLvWF] [^112Y7kVS] [^113pNGRU] [^112TTqmN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check whether any adjacent documents might have slipped in metabolic data. I need to ensure I'm not overlooking a figure or table that lists Santa's A1c alongside visit frequencies or distances to the North Pole. After reviewing the Santa studies and the surrounding context, I find no physiologic or laboratory data for Santa Claus, reinforcing that there is no measured A1c to cite here [^notfound].

> Next, I should review what A1c represents and the standard diagnostic thresholds so I can frame any hypothetical estimate properly. A1c reflects average glycemia over approximately 2–3 months, with < 5.7% typically considered normal, 5.7–6.4% indicating high risk for diabetes (prediabetes), and ≥ 6.5% meeting a diagnostic criterion for diabetes when confirmed, per ADA Standards of Care and related guidance [^11683ts9] [^115PDvtC] [^113yhvTU].

> I will now examine whether there are any indirect clues about Santa's metabolic health in the provided materials. Hmm, wait a minute, the BMJ papers focus on equitable access to Santa's visits and debunk the "naughty or nice" myth, but they do not provide anthropometrics, diet, activity, or glucose-related information, so I cannot infer an A1c from those data points [^116XLvWF] [^112Y7kVS] [^113pNGRU].

> Let me consider a cautious, hypothetical approach grounded in population norms. If I assume Santa is a healthy, non-diabetic adult with normal BMI and regular physical activity (e.g., chimney climbing and reindeer wrangling), his A1c might plausibly fall within the non-diabetic range, often around 4.5–5.6% in many adults, though I should emphasize this is speculative and not evidence-based for Santa himself [^113yhvTU] [^115PDvtC].

> But wait, what if I tried to anchor this to a Christmas-themed activity intervention? The Active Advent trial uses a Santa-themed exercise program and shows increased physical activity, which in general can improve glycemic metrics, yet it still does not provide Santa's A1c or any individual-level A1c outcomes tied to Santa, so I should not over-interpret that as evidence of Santa's glycemic status [^116G8kXm].

> I should confirm limitations and potential confounders for A1c even if we had Santa's sample. A1c can be influenced by hemoglobin variants, altered red cell turnover, anemia, and certain therapies; without knowing Santa's hematologic profile or ancestry-specific glycation dynamics, any A1c estimate would be uncertain even if a measurement existed, which it does not in these sources [^115GbubZ] [^114mu8U3] [^114dkPgY].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise: there is no measured A1c for Santa Claus in the provided literature, so I cannot state a definitive value. If pressed for a clinical, population-based guess under ordinary assumptions of health, an A1c in the non-diabetic range (roughly 4.5–5.6%) would be plausible, but this remains speculative and unsupported by direct evidence in these documents [^113yhvTU] [^115PDvtC].

---

I can't provide Santa's actual A1c because **no medical data exist** for a fictional character. If we imagine Santa as a healthy, active older adult with a balanced diet and regular exercise, his A1c would likely be in the **normal range (4.0–5.6%)**. However, if he indulges in cookies and milk at every stop, his A1c could be higher, potentially entering prediabetes (5.7–6.4%) or diabetes (≥ 6.5%) territory. Ultimately, Santa's A1c is a fun thought experiment, not a measurable clinical value [^115PDvtC] [^113yhvTU].

---

## A1c measurement and clinical significance

A1c is a **well-established marker** of average blood glucose over approximately three months [^11683ts9], reflecting the percentage of hemoglobin glycated by glucose. It is widely used to diagnose and monitor diabetes, with the following clinical thresholds:

- **Normal A1c**: < 5.7%
- **Prediabetes**: 5.7%–6.4%
- **Diabetes**: ≥ 6.5%

These thresholds are based on extensive clinical research and are endorsed by major diabetes organizations, including the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) [^115PDvtC] [^113yhvTU].

---

## Factors influencing A1c levels

Several factors influence **A1c levels**, including:

- **Diet**: High sugar and carbohydrate intake can elevate A1c levels.
- **Physical activity**: Regular exercise lowers A1c by improving insulin sensitivity.
- **Age**: A1c levels tend to increase slightly with age.
- **Genetics**: Individual genetic variations can affect glycation rates and A1c levels [^114Tmwq6].

---

## Hypothetical assessment of Santa's A1c

Given Santa's fictional nature, any assessment of his A1c is purely hypothetical. However, we can consider two scenarios based on his traditional lifestyle:

---

### Scenario 1: healthy Santa

In this scenario, Santa maintains a balanced diet, engages in regular physical activity (delivering presents worldwide), and manages stress effectively. Based on these assumptions, his A1c level would likely fall within the **normal range** of 4.0%–5.6% [^115PDvtC].

---

### Scenario 2: indulgent Santa

In this scenario, Santa consumes cookies and milk at every household, leading to a high sugar intake. This dietary pattern could elevate his A1c into the **prediabetes or diabetes range**, depending on the frequency and quantity of sugary treats consumed [^113yhvTU].

---

## Conclusion

There is **no medical data** or scientific evidence regarding Santa Claus's A1c level. Any assessment of his A1c is purely speculative and based on fictional assumptions. If Santa were a real individual, his A1c level would depend on his diet, physical activity, and overall health status.

This is the first of a series of articles based on presentations at the American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions held 5–9 June 2009 in New Orleans, Louisiana.

A series of elegant investigations some 4 decades ago led to the realization that elevated levels of certain hemoglobin components are found in individuals with diabetes. The useful measurement of A1C became standard in assessment of glycemia. A1C, rather than direct measures of glycemia, is now used as the "goal" for diabetes treatment.

Summary

A1C does reflect the phenomenon of greater hemoglobin glycation at higher mean glycemia and is certainly useful as an objective measure of long-term glycemia in subjects with diabetes. The related concepts that A1C can be used rather than the results of actual patient glucose measurements in accurately ascertaining mean glycemia and that A1C might be useful in the diagnosis of diabetes are therefore highly appealing. One should not, however, expect all subjects to glycate hemoglobin to the same degree for a given level of glycemia, given that a number of lines of evidence indicate that in clinical populations there is heterogeneity in the degree to which this occurs. A1C may not, then, be sufficiently accurate to allow its clinical use in the diagnosis of diabetes in populations of varying age and ethnic background and with illnesses affecting erythrocyte turnover. Moreover, caution appears reasonable before adoption of terminology such as eAG. We need to develop and validate new approaches to understanding glycemic exposure of subjects with diabetes and to develop better approaches to assessment of glycemia among subjects at risk of diabetes. As an example, individuals with increasing fasting glucose when monitored over time appear to be at particularly high risk of developing diabetes, and this may be a promising approach to diagnosis.

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes [^1131r8Wn]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Notwithstanding the above limitations of A1C testing, the assay has numerous important advantages compared with the currently used laboratory measurements of glucose (Table 1). The prevalence of diabetes in some populations may not be the same when diagnosis is based on A1C compared with diagnosis with glucose measurements, and one method may identify different individuals than the other. Because the measurements of glucose levels and A1C reflect different aspects of glucose metabolism, this is to be expected. However, establishing identical prevalences should not be the goal in defining a new means of diagnosing diabetes. The ultimate goal is to identify individuals at risk for diabetes complications so that they can be treated. The A1C diagnostic level of 6.5% accomplishes this goal.

### Frequent monitoring of A1c during pregnancy as a treatment tool to guide therapy [^112RrAwa]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

No guidelines for A1C measurement exist for women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The aim of this study was to document the rate of A1C decline in women with GDM.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Women with GDM in the Santa Barbara County Endocrine Clinic are managed with a carbohydrate-restricted diet and self-monitored blood glucose before and 1-h postprandial. Insulin is started if the preprandial glucose concentration is ≥ 90 mg/dl and/or a 1-h postprandial glucose concentration is ≥ 120 mg/dl. Capillary A1C was tested weekly using the DCA2000+ analyzer.

RESULTS

Twenty-four women with GDM (aged 29.0 ± 7.3 years) with initial A1C ≥ 7.0% were recruited. Baseline A1C was 8.8 ± 1.8%. Mean A1C decline was 0.47% per week (range 0.10–1.15%); the maximum was 4.3% in 4 weeks.

CONCLUSIONS

This study documents rapid decline in A1C during pregnancy and the utility of weekly A1C to guide therapy.

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes [^114cyxjt]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Should A1C testing be used to identify individuals at high risk for diabetes?

The screening tests to identify individuals at elevated risk for diabetes are the same as the diagnostic tests; therefore, the technical advantages of A1C testing compared with glucose testing apply to the detection of individuals at high risk as they do to the diagnosis of diabetes. Therapeutic decisions should be based on how close A1C levels are to the diagnosis of diabetes. In the absence of a specific identifiable lower threshold defining when prevention efforts should be implemented, and with potentially limited resources taken into consideration, individuals whose A1C values are close to the 6.5% A1C threshold of diabetes (i.e. ≥ 6.0%) should receive demonstrably effective interventions. By identifying this very high-risk subdiabetic group, the International Expert Committee is implying not that populations at lower A1C levels are not at risk but, rather, that they are at lower risk. All individuals at risk for diabetes should receive counseling to maintain normal weight, lose weight if necessary, and become more physically active.

Other risk factors for diabetes development in addition to A1C have been identified, including elevated levels of triglycerides, blood pressure, BMI, and family history of diabetes, and these should be taken into account in determining when to initiate interventions in individuals with A1C < 6.0%. The use of well-validated risk assessment tools may be valuable in that regard. At the population level, the A1C value at which prevention services are provided will depend on the resources available, the size of the target population, and the nature of the intervention.

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes [^115zDRad]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

For the identification of individuals at high risk for diabetes

Individuals with an A1C level ≥ 6% but < 6.5% are likely at the highest risk for progression to diabetes, but this range should not be considered an absolute threshold at which preventative measures are initiated.
The classification of subdiabetic hyperglycemia as pre-diabetes is problematic because it suggests that all individuals so classified will develop diabetes and that individuals who do not meet these glycemia-driven criteria (regardless of other risk factor values) are unlikely to develop diabetes — neither of which is the case. Moreover, the categorical classification of individuals as high risk (e.g. IFG or IGT) or low risk, based on any measure of glycemia, is less than ideal because the risk for progression to diabetes appears to be a continuum. The glucose-related terms describing subdiabetic hyperglycemia will be phased out of use as clinical diagnostic states as A1C measurements replace glucose measurements for the diagnosis of diabetes.
When assessing risk, implementing prevention strategies, or initiating a population-based prevention program, other diabetes risk factors should be taken into account. In addition, the A1C level at which to begin preventative measures should reflect the resources available, the size of the population affected, and the anticipated degree of success of the intervention. Further analyses of cost-benefit should guide the selection of high-risk groups targeted for intervention within specific populations.

### Frequent monitoring of A1c during pregnancy as a treatment tool to guide therapy [^117Gyn71]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This was an observational study of pregnant women attending the Santa Barbara County Health Care Services Obstetrics Clinic for care who have the diagnosis of GDM (diabetes first diagnosed during pregnancy) and who were referred to the Prenatal Diabetes/Endocrine Clinic for management. Because of the high rates of diabetes in this largely Latino population and because many of the women only seek medical attention during pregnancy, women are screened for GDM very early in pregnancy. Many women found to have diabetes early in pregnancy undoubtedly have preexisting type 2 diabetes, which falls under the classification of GDM when first identified during pregnancy. Treatment consists of a carbohydrate-restricted meal plan and fingerstick blood glucose monitoring before and 1-h after each meal. Insulin is initiated if the diet does not achieve premeal glucose concentrations < 90 mg/dl and/or 1-h postprandial glucose concentrations < 120 mg/dl within 1 week of the carbohydrate restriction prescription. For simplicity in the clinic and to impress upon the diabetic women the importance of tight glucose control, a point of care A1C by fingerstick is routinely obtained at every weekly visit and analyzed immediately using the DCA2000+ analyzer. The DCA A1C is a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-waived test with a coefficient of variation of 2.3–3.3% at a normal A1C concentration of 5.2 and of 2.8–3.7% at an elevated A1C concentration of 11.9%.

### Dispelling the nice or naughty myth: retrospective observational study of santa claus [^116XLvWF]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

A surprising finding was that Santa Claus does not discriminate against children based on country or region (for example, we hypothesised that he would prefer to visit Wales and Scotland owing to these countries seemingly more habitable climates for reindeers). Indeed this study shows that distance from the North Pole was not a factor that influenced whether Santa Claus visited a hospital and confirms the widely held belief that he is not limited by distance or time and is capable of delivering gifts across the globe within a 24 hour period.

It is the authors' anecdotal experience that children rarely voluntarily admit to being naughty. Our study therefore included two potential indicators of child naughtiness: regional primary school absenteeism and conviction rates in young people. Neither is ideal as they are measured at a relatively coarse level of geographical aggregation, and in the case of conviction rates are subject to uneven reporting across the regions. The fact that we found no significant associations with either indicator suggests that the "nice or naughty" myth can be dispelled, but future research should attempt to obtain better individual level estimates of naughtiness in children to confirm this finding. We must also acknowledge the limitations of these ecological variables: we would hope that Santa Claus makes his decisions to visit sick children in hospital independent of the naughtiness of other children in the region. There are also other potential predictors of his visits that could not be included in our analysis. For example, despite the authors' best efforts, information on the size and characteristics of paediatric wards was not available for further analysis of the data. A response to the authors' freedom of information request to NHS England was that this information was not available. We also caution that although our study shows that Santa Claus is less likely to visit paediatric wards in more deprived areas, we cannot conclude from our correlational study why this association exists. Finally, other variables such as the quality of whisky left for him in hospitals, availability of Christmas dinners, availability of chimneys, and free NHS parking spaces for reindeers may need to be explored. Whether Santa Claus actively discriminates or whether deeper structural factors are at play needs to be examined through further studies.

### A1c level and future risk of diabetes: a systematic review [^113W5Yjc]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Incidence of diabetes associated with A1C levels

Among the eight studies that reported A1C categories (,–) (Table 2), the range of A1C from 4.5 to 7.1% was associated with diabetes incidences ranging from 0.1% per year to 54.1% per year. In general, studies that categorized A1C across a full range of A1C values (,–) showed that 1) risk of incident diabetes increased steeply across the A1C range of 5.0 to 6.5%; 2) both the relative and absolute incidence of diabetes varied considerably across studies; 3) the A1C range of 6.0 to 6.5% was associated with a highly increased risk of incident diabetes, frequently 20 or more times the incidence of A1C < 5.0%); 4) the A1C range of 5.5 to 6.0% was associated with a substantially increased relative risk (frequently five times the incidence of A1C < 5.0%); and 5) the A1C range of 5.0 to 5.5% was associated with an increased incidence relative to those with A1C < 5% (about two times the incidence of A1C < 5.0%).

Can A1C measurements define a specific subdiabetic "high-risk" state?

The 2003 International Expert Committee report reduced the lower bound of IFG from 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) to 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) on the grounds that the lower level optimized the sensitivity and specificity for predicting future diabetes and also increased the proportion of those with IGT who could be identified with an FPG test. While previous studies have shown a powerful effect of IFG and/or IGT on the subsequent development of diabetes diagnosed with glucose values, recent reports have demonstrated a graded risk of diabetes development at glycemic levels well within what was previously considered "normal", i.e. FPG < 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) and A1C < 6.0%. In addition, metabolic derangements related to diabetes have been documented at similarly low glycemic levels, increasing in severity with higher glucose values within the nondiabetic range.

As with measures of glucose, a continuum of risk for the development of diabetes based on A1C levels has been demonstrated. Thus, while there appears to be an approximate glycemic threshold above which the risk for retinopathy escalates, there does not appear to be a specific level at which risk for diabetes clearly begins. A continuum of risk for the development of diabetes across a wide range of subdiabetic A1C levels may make the classification of individuals into categories similar to IFG and IGT equally problematic for A1C, as it implies that we actually know where risk begins or becomes clinically important. The continuum of risk in the subdiabetic glycemic range argues for the elimination of dichotomous subdiabetic classifications, such as "pre-diabetes", IFG, and IGT. However, as A1C levels approach the diagnostic level for diabetes, the risk of developing diabetes becomes greatest.

### American diabetes association postgraduate meetings – 2011 [^116iwNu6]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Sheldon Greenfield, Irvine, California, distinguished clinical practice guidelines from quality of care or performance measures, noting that the former are recommendations, or "guides", and are meant to be overridden by clinical circumstances and judgment, whereas quality of care measures should be seen as being more of a standardized test so that clinical circumstances must be part of the measure, with flexibility included in the scoring methodology for the measure to be appropriately designed. Patient preferences should also be taken into account, and one must avoid the scores becoming "very rigidified". Guidelines are applied by health-care practitioners and do not require specifications, while quality of care measures can be applied by nonpractitioners based on precise specifications. Quality of care measures should be based on the highest levels of evidence, while guidelines can be based on clinical recommendations. The Institute of Medicine committee on setting standards for guidelines, which he chairs, aims to "try to make sense of the chaos". As an example, Greenfield pointed out that the evidence that A1C should be tested at least twice yearly is level E, which he termed "fine for providers, [but] not fine for quality". We are realizing that less stringent A1C goals are appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia or with limited life expectancy or extensive complications, but, Greenfield asked, "how can a person abstracting data" know this for a given charted patient? Quality measures are developed by multiple organizations, then endorsed, and then adopted, and in part because of these efforts, the frequency of blood pressure measurement, A1C, and nephropathy testing and eye examination has gradually increased, whereas the prevalence of poor glycemic and blood pressure control has decreased, with individuals having Medicaid insurance lagging behind those with Medicare and commercial insurance, suggesting that further efforts will be important. He wondered whether we are quibbling about whether A1C levels should be 6, 6.5, or 7%, while "there's a lot to do at the upper end" with many individuals having levels > 9%, and similarly blood pressure and lipid control are often far above desirable levels. A given person's degree of control is often "not under our control", and, rather, requires a great deal of patient adherence.

### A1c: recommendations, debates, and questions [^111KGBWC]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Kilpatrick suggested that eAG is no more than "a consensus compromise" of multiple groups endeavoring to communicate the new methodology of A1C measurement. He reviewed the acceptance criteria used in the ADAG study that 90% of patients should have mean glucose within 15% of the eAG based on A1C, pointing out that these limits are "too wide". If we accept that 90% of patients said to have an eAG of 200 have actual mean glucose as low as 170 mg/dl or as high as 230 mg/dl (this in itself allows variability exceeding 25%), the mathematics of normal distributions (which are somewhat inaccurate for glycemia) would lead the 99% confidence limits to be within 24%, allowing a range from 152 to 248 mg/dl. Kilpatrick reviewed his analysis of variability of glycated hemoglobin in nondiabetic individuals, occurring in a fashion unrelated to mean glycemia. While individuals are quite consistent, the interindividual variability of the A1C in subjects not having diabetes suggested that A1C in diabetic subjects with similar mean glycemia would likely vary by 1–2%. Furthermore, he showed evidence of imprecision of A1C measurement between laboratories both in the U.K. and in the U.S. based on a CAP report from May 2009, so that the 99% confidence limits of an eAG of 200 might in actuality be from 135 to 265 mg/dl.

Other A1C topics at the ADA Scientific Sessions

At a National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program review at the ADA Scientific Sessions, Little discussed interesting observations based on CAP surveys of A1C assay performance. Average CV decreased from 6 to 7% in 2003 to current mean levels around 4%. An important statistical notion is that of critical difference — the difference for a given patient between two test results that should be considered significant. For A1C, at an average method CV of 4%, the critical difference is 0.8%, suggesting that the typical approach of clinicians in considering relatively small changes to be of consequence may not be statistically accurate. In fact, even if an A1C method had a 1% CV, the critical difference would still be an A1C change of at least 0.3%. In grading of the CAP A1C survey, the acceptable limit in 2009 is ± 10%, although the plan is to reduce this to ± 6% over coming years. Other characteristics of A1C assays were discussed at the session. Many methods do not show assay interference with hemoglobin variants, but 6.5% of labs use methods for which A1C of samples with hemoglobin S or C is incorrect by > 10%, 20% of labs use methods in which hemoglobin E causes interference, and 6% of labs use methods in which hemoglobin D causes interference. It should be noted that the CAP surveys do not include information on "point of care" A1C methods, as this is a "waived" test for quality standardization; the use of such methods may, if accuracy is limited, further limit the value of A1C.

### Translating "Nondiabetic" A1c levels to clinical practice: the art of medicine [^113g2XiQ]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

With the above data outlining the clinical significance of "nondiabetic" hyperglycemia and that the A1C level appears to be a reasonable marker at this stage, is it time to make firm recommendations for clinicians to initiate interventions for A1C in this range? If that happens, it would clearly represent a huge leap in clinical translation of research data. The problem, as clearly understood, is that we have no evidence suggesting that treatment of nondiabetic glycemia based on a single A1C level < 6.5% will ultimately have benefits on CVD. To gather such evidence, prospective studies will need to be done that will take years to complete, will involve a large number of subjects, and will take significant resources. However, for now, we can't ignore the recent data that an A1C level in the high-normal nondiabetic range may indeed serve as a simple clinical marker that heightens our awareness of individuals at increased CVD risk.

With knowledge of this information, shouldn't providers now be encouraged to provide a comprehensive evaluation for other comorbidities, i.e. hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia, that are present in individuals at levels of A1C suggestive of increased risk? Would it not make sense to strongly encourage providers to aggressively treat these risk factors based on intervention trials that have demonstrated effectiveness? At this stage, shouldn't the A1C in the high-normal nondiabetic range also signal the need for comprehensive education of the patient regarding CVD risk and allow for initiation of effective lifestyle modification? Such a strategy appears to be an extremely reasonable and rational approach, and, based on known evidence, such clinical translation of current A1C data in the "nondiabetic" range to clinical practice will be truly representative of the "art of medicine".

### Glycemic control and type 2 diabetes mellitus: the optimal hemoglobin A1c targets. A guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^115brj8g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

This guidance statement is derived from other organizations' guidelines and is based on an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the available guidelines. We used the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation in Europe (AGREE) appraisal instrument to evaluate the guidelines from various organizations. On the basis of the review of the available guidelines, we recommend: STATEMENT 1: To prevent microvascular complications of diabetes, the goal for glycemic control should be as low as is feasible without undue risk for adverse events or an unacceptable burden on patients. Treatment goals should be based on a discussion of the benefits and harms of specific levels of glycemic control with the patient. A hemoglobin A1c level less than 7% based on individualized assessment is a reasonable goal for many but not all patients. STATEMENT 2: The goal for hemoglobin A1c level should be based on individualized assessment of risk for complications from diabetes, comorbidity, life expectancy, and patient preferences. STATEMENT 3: We recommend further research to assess the optimal level of glycemic control, particularly in the presence of comorbid conditions.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^1151qPSn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Today's guidelines not only generally have the proviso that patients who do not meet the A1C goal be followed every 2–3 months to enable adjustment of the ongoing treatment regimen, but also indicate that clinical judgment should be individually tailored. However, this case-by-case approach may not be the best practice tactic for the vast majority of patients, since the progressive nature of diabetes demands prompt and consistent therapeutic attention.

A well-controlled A1C of < 7.0% with oral monotherapy for up to 3 years is typically achieved by ~50% of type 2 diabetic patients. It has been suggested that this unsatisfactory outcome is partly the consequence of first-line therapy being begun only after A1C reaches levels higher than those at which the expected glucose-lowering from monotherapy could be expected to return glucose control to target levels. This result has been attributed in part to physicians — both specialists and those in primary care — not being well prepared for early interventions and therefore often missing the critical window to launch effective management. Despite poor and worsening A1C, many people are kept on the same medications, thus aggravating their glycemic burden and risking worsening health problems. Interestingly, a recent survey of awareness and attitudes in eight countries found that 51% of patients had never heard of A1C and that > 10% of physicians measured it less than once a year.

Before the recent enhanced focus on more structured guidelines with specific recommended A1C targets, diabetes management with antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy was often inadequate, with appropriate changes in medical regimens implemented only when A1C levels were > 9.0% and/or several months to years after ascertaining that A1C readings were higher than acceptable. As a result of incremental treatment not keeping abreast with degenerating glycemic status (Fig. 2) and most individuals who managed to successfully achieve recommended A1C targets demonstrating an inability to maintain glycemic status, glycemic burden was unnecessarily extended in parallel with a substantial increase in CV risk. For example, Alvarez Guisasola et al. reported that 26% of the 2,025 people that they monitored from seven European countries had an average A1C of 7.2% after 2.6 years of metformin-sulfonylurea or metformin-thiazolidinedione combinations. After 5 years, 20% of the 176 patients with A1C assessments were under control (mean A1C 7.4%), with 30% of this subgroup on insulin, resonating the often-observed temporal decline in glycemic management.

Standards of Care in Diabetes-2025 — A1C clinical characteristics note that "A1C has several advantages compared with FPG and OGTT, including greater convenience (fasting is not required), greater preanalytical stability, and fewer day-to-day perturbations during stress, changes in nutrition, or illness", yet there is "lower sensitivity of A1C at the designated cut point compared with an FPG of 126 mg/dL". A1C reflects erythrocyte life span "(~120 days)" yielding a weighted average, and "clinically meaningful changes in A1C can be seen in < 120 days".

### Hemoglobin A1c: need to standardize the term [^113Bsc8r]. Endocrine Practice (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To discuss studies that investigate the understanding of patients with diabetes and the information provided by physicians regarding the terminology and meaning of tests for glycated hemoglobin.

Findings

Patients with diabetes seldom know or remember the terminology for glycated hemoglobin assay techniques, even when they are participating in self-monitoring of blood glucose. Physicians use a variety of terms for the glycated hemoglobin test and are not consistent in their terminology.

Conclusion

One term for glycated hemoglobin assay should be used and promoted by all health-care professionals and patients. Because it is most readily remembered, "A1C" is the preferred lay term.

Limitations of A1C as the recommended means of diagnosing diabetes

The A1C assay is the test of choice for the chronic management of diabetes and is now being recommended for its diagnosis; however, there are parts of the world where the costs of providing the assay preclude its routine use. In such circumstances, clinicians should continue to use the previously recommended approaches to diagnose diabetes based on glucose measurements. The International Expert Committee encourages clinicians worldwide to move as quickly as possible to A1C testing using standardized methods and instrumentation. However, the decision to change to A1C assays as the means of diagnosing diabetes should take into account the performance of local A1C assays and the local prevalence of conditions that may interfere with the assay. (See below.)

Although the discussion above argues for using the A1C assay for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals, there are patient conditions that either will require a specific A1C assay method or will preclude A1C testing. First, some hemoglobin traits, such as HbS, HbC, HbF, and HbE, interfere with some A1C assay methods. Currently, many assay methods can correct for the presence of the most common hemoglobin traits, and affinity assays that are unaffected by hemoglobin traits may be used. Second, any condition that changes red cell turnover, such as hemolytic anemia, chronic malaria, major blood loss, or blood transfusions, will lead to spurious A1C results. Clinicians must be aware of these conditions, particularly in populations in which they are more prevalent. As in the setting where A1C assays are unavailable, the traditional diagnostic tests (e.g. FPG, 2HPG) must be used in individuals in whom interpreting the A1C is problematic. Third, A1C levels appear to increase with age, but the extent of the change, whether it relates to factors other than glucose metabolism, and the effect of the age-related increases on the development of complications are not sufficiently clear to adopt age-specific values in a diagnostic scheme. Similarly, racial disparities in A1C, based on putative differences in the relationship between glucose levels and A1C, have been suggested; however, here too, their etiology and significance are unclear, and it is premature to establish race-specific diagnostic values. Finally, there are rare clinical settings, such as rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes, where the A1C level will not have had time to "catch up" with the acute elevations in glucose levels; however, in these very rare cases, diabetes should be diagnosable with typical symptoms and casual glucose levels > 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) despite a nondiagnostic A1C level.

### A1c to detect diabetes in healthy adults: when should we recheck? [^116tCPiL]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Since fasting and post-glucose challenge blood glucose levels were found to predict the risk of diabetic retinopathy, they have been the international standard for diagnosis. Recently, a shift to A1C for diagnosis has been proposed because A1C integrates longer-term glucose levels and has better preanalytic stability. The proposed diagnostic threshold of 6.5% was based on retinopathy risk at different levels of A1C. However, optimal frequency for repeating A1C has not been determined. We used a large, longitudinal dataset to explore the value of repeating A1C at different intervals to identify subjects who might progress above the threshold (≥ 6.5%).

### Haemoglobin A1c in the diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes mellitus [^116pDsu3]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) is due to celebrate its 40th birthday. Many people would argue that the clinical studies relating the test to diabetes complications while in its late 20s are likely to be its finest ever achievement. However, this article looks at how HbA(1c) has matured since then and discusses in detail how its many strengths and idiosyncrasies as a marker of glycaemic risk have, as a 30-something, become more clearly understood. As HbA(1c) approaches middle age, this paper also describes how the test appears to be developing a mid-life crisis, as debate over how its results should be expressed seems likely to divide opinion among clinicians for some time to come.

RESULTS

From January 2005 to July 2008, 16,313 people of the enrolled population of 39,284 underwent annual checks. Mean age (± SD) of participants was 49.7 ± 12.3 years, and 53% were male. Mean BMI was 22.5 ± 3.2 kg/m 2; fasting plasma glucose was 99.2 ± 12.7 mg/dl; A1C at baseline was 5.4 ± 0.5%; total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol levels at baseline were 204.3 ± 33.8 mg/dl, 117.6 ± 29.7 mg/dl, and 62.4 ± 15.8 mg/dl, respectively; and systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 119 ± 18 mmHg and 73 ± 11 mmHg, respectively. The trends of mean A1C levels for the entire cohort from 2005 to 2008 slightly increased over 3 years (0.05% per year). The demographic characteristics of nonparticipants and participants were similar.

At 3 years, the cumulative incidence of diabetes was 3.2% (95% CI 3.0–3.4). However, this varies greatly by initial level of A1C. At 3 years, for those with A1C of < 5.0%, 5.0–5.4%, 5.5–5.9%, and 6.0–6.4% at baseline, cumulative incidence (95% CI) was 0.05% (0.001–0.3), 0.05% (0.01–0.11), 1.2% (0.9–1.6), and 20% (18–23), respectively, and adding FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl to the diagnostic criteria showed similar results (Fig. 1). Logistic regression suggested that only BMI (odds ratio 1.14/kg/m 2) and FPG (1.06/mg/dl) added to the baseline A1C; age, sex, systolic blood pressure, and LDL were not significant. The average CV of A1C stratified by baseline A1C was 2.7% and did not differ among these subgroups.

### Translating "Nondiabetic" A1c levels to clinical practice: the art of medicine [^111Pfq11]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

It is well recognized that there is a significant delay from the time clinical research findings are first reported and when the results become an integral part of clinical care. With the understanding that the prevalence and incidence of diabetes is increasing worldwide, and that the resulting complications are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality, the need for more rapid clinical translation of research findings for diabetes could not be greater.

Specifically, a large amount of clinical research data has been reported in the recent past that is of great interest to the provider caring for individuals with diabetes. Much of the emphasis for research has been devoted to understanding the contribution of hyperglycemia and its treatment on macrovascular disease. For example, within the last decade, we have not only recognized the pivotal role that chronic hyperglycemia, as assessed with A1C levels, contributes to the development of microvascular complications, but we have recognized the importance of glycemia in contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Observations from large-scale prospective trials over the last couple of years have reported that in high-risk subjects, intensive therapy to lower A1C levels below suggested targets may not be beneficial or may increase mortality. However, as observed from these studies, we also learned that certain subsets of patients with type 2 diabetes may actually benefit from intensive glycemic control. The most recent analysis, reported in May 2010, has now suggested that mortality may actually be greater for those who maintain a higher A1C level despite attempts at intensive glycemic management. Interestingly, the excess mortality in the group randomized to intensive glycemic management was only seen at A1C levels greater than 7%. Thus, the findings regarding A1C targets for selected patient populations with type 2 diabetes continue to evolve to this day and remain important data for clinicians.

### Dispelling the nice or naughty myth: retrospective observational study of santa claus [^112Y7kVS]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine which factors influence whether Santa Claus will visit children in hospital on Christmas Day.

Design

Retrospective observational study.

Setting

Paediatric wards in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.

Participants

186 members of staff who worked on the paediatric wards (n = 186) during Christmas 2015.

Main Outcome Measures

Presence or absence of Santa Claus on the paediatric ward during Christmas 2015. This was correlated with rates of absenteeism from primary school, conviction rates in young people (aged 10–17 years), distance from hospital to North Pole (closest city or town to the hospital in kilometres, as the reindeer flies), and contextual socioeconomic deprivation (index of multiple deprivation).

Results

Santa Claus visited most of the paediatric wards in all four countries: 89% in England, 100% in Northern Ireland, 93% in Scotland, and 92% in Wales. The odds of him not visiting, however, were significantly higher for paediatric wards in areas of higher socioeconomic deprivation in England (odds ratio 1.31 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.71) in England, 1.23 (1.00 to 1.54) in the UK). In contrast, there was no correlation with school absenteeism, conviction rates, or distance to the North Pole.

Conclusion

The results of this study dispel the traditional belief that Santa Claus rewards children based on how nice or naughty they have been in the previous year. Santa Claus is less likely to visit children in hospitals in the most deprived areas. Potential solutions include a review of Santa's contract or employment of local Santas in poorly represented regions.

### A1c level and future risk of diabetes: a systematic review [^116cyp5T]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

We examined ranges of A1C useful for identifying persons at high risk for diabetes prior to preventive intervention by conducting a systematic review. From 16 included studies, we found that annualized diabetes incidence ranged from 0.1% at A1C < 5.0% to 54.1% at A1C ≥ 6.1%. Findings from 7 studies that examined incident diabetes across a broad range of A1C categories showed 1) risk of incident diabetes increased steeply with A1C across the range of 5.0 to 6.5%; 2) the A1C range of 6.0 to 6.5% was associated with a highly increased risk of incident diabetes, 25 to 50% incidence over 5 years; 3) the A1C range of 5.5 to 6.0% was associated with a moderately increased relative risk, 9 to 25% incidence over 5 years; and 4) the A1C range of 5.0 to 5.5% was associated with an increased incidence relative to those with A1C < 5%, but the absolute incidence of diabetes was less than 9% over 5 years. Our systematic review demonstrated that A1C values between 5.5 and 6.5% were associated with a substantially increased risk for developing diabetes.

### Distribution of capillary glycated hemoglobin among adolescents of high school age [^1139ZQyc]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the distribution of glycated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c or A1C) in whole blood collected from a cohort of high school students with use of a capillary method.

Methods

Students were recruited from the Diabetes Risk Factor Screening Study conducted in Santa Barbara, California, high schools. Height and weight were measured on portable equipment. Blood was collected by finger stick and analyzed immediately for A1C on the DCA 2000+ analyzer. Students also completed a brief survey that included specification of race or ethnicity and family history of diabetes.

Results

Between the years 2001 and 2005, A1C was measured in 2,640 14- to 18-year-old high school students. The mean A1C was 4.91%, SE was 0.01%, and range was from 3.5% to 8.5%, including 2 outliers. Both of these students were found to have previously unrecognized type 2 diabetes mellitus. Male subjects had an A1C that was slightly but significantly higher than that in female subjects (difference = 0.05%; P < .001), subjects with a family history of diabetes in a first-degree relative had higher A1C values than those without such a family history (difference = 0.10%; p = 0.001), and subjects with a body mass index ≥ 95% had higher A1C values than did those with a lower body mass index (difference = 0.011%; P < .001). Non-Hispanic white students had A1C concentrations that were significantly lower than those of African American or Latino students. Age had little effect on the A1C.

Conclusion

The A1C distribution in the total study population in this survey was identical to the distribution reported previously with use of the high-performance liquid chromatographic method. This survey establishes standards for capillary A1C in high school students from several racial or ethnic groups.

### Can' personalized diagnostics' promote earlier intervention for dysglycaemia? Hypothesis ready for testing [^114Jt8NH]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

The risk associated with progression to diabetes as well as for cardiovascular complications increases along a continuum, rather than being threshold-dependent. How can we identify those with glucose levels in the upper reaches of normal who are most in need of a preventive intervention? With present criteria, we are likely excluding many individuals who have heightened risk. We introduce here the possibility of using a "personalized" glucose profile to encourage early intervention in subjects in whom glucose metabolism is deteriorating (on an individual level) but not yet abnormal on a population-based norm. We further suggest that "personalized profiles" of hemoglobin A1c and basal plasma insulin may also help encourage appropriately early intervention. That the first line therapies are so effective, safe and simple make these more sensitive approaches very attractive.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^1137C1Mm]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

As A1C is used more commonly to diagnose diabetes in individuals with risk factors, it will also identify those at higher risk for developing diabetes in the future. When recommending the use of the A1C to diagnose diabetes in its 2009 report, the International Expert Committee stressed the continuum of risk for diabetes with all glycemic measures and did not formally identify an equivalent intermediate category for A1C. The group did note that those with A1C levels above the laboratory "normal" range but below the diagnostic cut point for diabetes (6.0 to < 6.5%) are at very high risk of developing diabetes. Indeed, incidence of diabetes in people with A1C levels in this range is more than 10 times that of people with lower levels. However, the 6.0 to < 6.5% range fails to identify a substantial number of patients who have IFG and/or IGT. Prospective studies indicate that people within the A1C range of 5.5–6.0% have a 5-year cumulative incidence of diabetes that ranges from 12 to 25%, which is appreciably (three- to eightfold) higher than incidence in the U.S. population as a whole. Analyses of nationally representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate that the A1C value that most accurately identifies people with IFG or IGT falls between 5.5 and 6.0%. In addition, linear regression analyses of these data indicate that among the nondiabetic adult population, an FPG of 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) corresponds to an A1C of 5.6%, while an FPG of 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) corresponds to an A1C of 5.4% (R.T. Ackerman, personal communication). Finally, evidence from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), wherein the mean A1C was 5.9% (SD 0.5%), indicates that preventive interventions are effective in groups of people with A1C levels both below and above 5.9%. For these reasons, the most appropriate A1C level above which to initiate preventive interventions is likely to be somewhere in the range of 5.5–6%.

### Brazilian guideline for screening and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes: a position statement from the Brazilian diabetes society [^112QexWM]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

How to screen for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes:

R3: For the diagnosis of T2D, it is RECOMMENDED to use Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), HbA1c, 1-h OGTT or 2 h-OGTT. The diagnostic criteria are FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL, HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, 1-h OGTT glucose ≥ 209 mg/dL, or 2-h OGTT glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (Table 4).

Table 4
Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes:

Summary of evidence:
In 1997, The Report of the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes defined the FPG and 2-h OGTT (2 h-OGTT) cutoffs for diagnosing diabetes and prediabetes based on three population cohorts that assessed the association between glycemic levels and the development of diabetic retinopathy.
A cohort study demonstrated a continuous relationship between glycemic levels and the development of diabetic retinopathy. However, a threshold differentiates individuals at higher risk for diabetes-related complications from those at lower risk, which establishes the diagnostic cutoff for diabetes. Notably, this threshold is inconsistent across studies, and variations in retinopathy prevalence between populations may partly account for the differing thresholds. These variations highlight the need for population-specific research to understand better the optimal thresholds for diagnosing and managing diabetes-related complications like retinopathy.
The Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration study, which evaluated 121 prospective studies involving 1.27 million adults with individual records of cardiovascular complications, showed that in individuals without a history of diabetes, the risk of coronary heart disease was significantly higher in those with FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL compared to those with FPG ≤ 100 mg/dL. Known diabetes diagnosis or FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL, regardless of other factors, doubled the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and vascular-related deaths.
FPG and HbA1c are complementary measures, as subjects may have elevated levels of one or both biomarkers. FPG reflects glucose homeostasis in the post-absorptive state, and HbA1c reflects average glycemia over 2–3 months. The FPG value is strongly correlated with the HbA1c value.
The use of HbA1c ≥ 6.5% as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes was suggested in 2009 by the International Expert Committee based on population studies that evaluated fasting glucose and 2 h-OGTT. An analysis of data from nine studies across five countries, with 44,623 participants aged 20 to 79 years, showed an increased odds ratio (OR) between HbA1c levels and the presence of diabetic retinopathy (OR for HbA1c 6.5–6.9% vs HbA1c 4–4.4% = 16.8 [95% CI: 2.3–123.7]; p = 0.01).
The HbA1c cutoff of 6.5% has a sensitivity (Se) of 47–67% and a specificity (Sp) of 98–99% for diagnosing diabetes, compared to the 2 h-OGTT. Brazilian data also corroborate the low Se and high Sp of HbA1c for diagnosing diabetes relative to the 2 h-OGTT.
A meta-analysis of 17 studies evaluating the accuracy of HbA1c and FPG for diabetes diagnosis, using the 2 h-OGTT as the gold standard, showed that the Se, Sp, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of HbA1c ≥ 6.5% were 50% (95% CI 42–59%), 97.3% (95% CI 95.3–98.4), 18.3% (95% CI 11.1–30.5), and 51% (95% CI 43–60%), respectively. For FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL, the respective values were 59.4% (95% CI 46.6–71%), 98.8% (95% CI 96.5–99.6%), 47.82% (95% CI 19.1–119.7%), and 41.1% (95% CI 30.5–55.5%).
HbA1c levels may also vary according to ethnicity and the studied population due to factors independent of medication adherence and access to healthcare, like differences in red cell survival, intra and extracellular glucose balance, and genetic determinants of hemoglobin glycation. African-descendant individuals may have higher HbA1c levels than expected for their glycemic profile, resulting in false-positive diabetes diagnoses.
The HbA1c measurement can avoid the risk of intra-individual variability observed in plasma glucose (PG) measurements and the need to fast. The values of HbA1c, regardless of the methodology used, may not be reliable in the presence of some conditions that alter the life expectancy of erythrocytes (for example, the use of erythropoietin, hemolytic anemia), severe iron deficiency anemia, and recent blood transfusions. Sickle cell anemia or other hemoglobin variants, such as fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and hemoglobins S, C, D, and E, can also interfere with HbA1c results. The factors that may interfere in the glycation of hemoglobin and, therefore, may limit the use of HbA1c for the diagnosis of diabetes are summarized in Table 5. To use HbA1c values as a diagnostic tool for diabetes, it is necessary to employ the global standardization method proposed by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP).
Recently, an IDF expert committee re-evaluated the accuracy and applicability of the 1 h-OGTT for diagnosing prediabetes and diabetes. 1 h-OGTT is more practical than 2 h-OGTT. A meta-analysis of 15 studies, with 35,551 individuals of Caucasian, Native American, Asian, and Mexican American descent, identified that the 1 h-OGTT cutoff of 209 mg/dl is equivalent to the 2 h-OGTT cutoff of 200 mg/dl for diagnosing diabetes. The IDF recommends that 1 h-OGTT glucose ≥ 209 mg/dl should be a criterion for diagnosing diabetes.
All diagnostic methods have methodological limitations. FPG requires fasting, can be affected by acute conditions, and has lower reproducibility than HbA1c. The OGTT is more costly, uncomfortable, and time-consuming, but has higher Se. For its use, a diet including at least 150 g of carbohydrates per day is required for three days before the test. HbA1c is more expensive, does not account for individual variability in the protein glycation process, and has lower diagnostic Se than other methods.
Diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes have not been investigated specifically in children and adolescents and are based on adult definitions. However, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is recognized by the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) as a valid diagnostic tool. Kim et al. evaluated 190 children and adolescents with obesity or asymptomatic glucosuria who underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to assess the accuracy of HbA1c as a diagnostic tool for diabetes. The study concluded that an HbA1c threshold of ≥ 6.5% was appropriate for diagnosing type 2 diabetes in this population, although the ideal cutoff was identified as 6.15%. A study involving a multiethnic cohort of 1,156 children and adolescents with obesity assessed the utility of HbA1c for diagnosing diabetes and associated risks. Participants underwent HbA1c measurement and a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (2 h-OGTT), with 218 followed up for approximately two years. Results showed that 47% of those with HbA1c levels in the "at risk" range (5.7–6.4%) and 62% with HbA1c ≥ 6.5% were classified as having prediabetes or diabetes by 2 h-OGTT. The optimal HbA1c threshold for detecting diabetes was 5.8% (78% specificity, 68% sensitivity), while a 1% increase in baseline HbA1c was associated with a 13-fold higher risk of prediabetes or diabetes. This study indicates that HbA1c can be a useful clinical tool for identifying T2D when combined with FPG and 2 h-PG. However, relying solely on HbA1c for diagnosing prediabetes and T2D may be insufficient, to avoid missed or delayed identification. Although a lower cutoff might be more appropriate for this age group, setting the HbA1c threshold at 6.5% for diagnosing diabetes, in conjunction with other criteria, is unlikely to result in an excessive number of inappropriate diabetes diagnoses.
A longitudinal study (1965–2007) of a high-risk Indigenous American cohort examined the relationship between childhood HbA1c, 2 h-PG levels, and diabetes-related complications. Children with overweight and obesity that had HbA1c compatible with pre-diabetes levels had a higher incidence of retinopathy than those with normal HbA1c (7.9 vs. 2.5 cases per 1,000 person-years; risk difference 5.4; P = 0.002). Elevated HbA1c levels, analyzed as a continuous variable, were also significantly linked to increased retinopathy risk (HR 1.53 per %). While A1c, 2 h-PG, and FPG were similarly effective in predicting albuminuria, 2 h-PG slightly outperformed HbA1c in predicting retinopathy (AUC 0.73 vs. 0.69; P = 0.046). Overall, higher childhood glycemia was associated with an increased risk of albuminuria and retinopathy.

### A1c for screening and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in routine clinical practice [^116MAg9S]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Our study supports recommendations to use A1C for diabetes screening and diagnosis. Using two, rather than one, cut off values for A1C achieved high sensitivity for screening plus optimal specificity for diabetes diagnosis. We also show the high probability that those with impaired A1C have abnormal glucose status.

Single A1C cut offs have limited clinical utility in identifying those people with abnormal blood glucose levels. The most commonly reported single A1C cut off obtained from reported receiver-operated characteristic (ROC) curves was ∼6.1%, which gives sensitivities of 78–81%, with specificities of 79–84%. In our MP population, the ROC curve–identified optimal A1C of 6.2% gave a sensitivity of 82.2% and specificity of 78.8% (Z.X.L, unpublished data) but yielded a reduced PPV (67.2%) and NPV (89.3%).

### A1c versus glucose testing: a comparison [^1143QmbE]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

PERSPECTIVE

Notwithstanding the use of glucose (FPG and/or the OGTT) as the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of diabetes for many years, glucose testing suffers from several deficiencies. The requirement that the subject be fasting at the time the blood is drawn is a considerable inconvenience. While our ability to measure glucose has improved, inherent biological variability can produce very large differences within and among individuals. In conjunction with lack of sample stability, which is difficult to overcome in clinical practice, these factors results in lack of reproducibility of glucose testing.

A1C, which reflects chronic blood glucose values, is routinely used in monitoring glycemic control and guiding therapy. The significant reduction in microvascular complications with lower A1C and the absence of sample lability, combined with several other advantages (Table 3), have led to the recommendation by some organizations that A1C be used for screening and diagnosis of diabetes. Accumulating evidence suggests that racial differences in A1C values may be present, and the possible clinical significance of this needs to be determined. Importantly, A1C cannot be measured in certain conditions. Despite these caveats, A1C can be measured accurately in the vast majority of people. A comprehension of the factors that influence A1C values and the conditions where it should not be used will produce accurate and clinically meaningful results. The convenience of sampling at any time without regard to food ingestion makes it likely that measurement of A1C will result in the detection of many of the millions of people with diabetes who are currently undiagnosed.

### A1c level and future risk of diabetes: a systematic review [^115yYrcQ]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Several studies found that A1C is particularly predictive of future diabetes after prior stratification of fasting plasma glucose. This is consistent with prior observations that elevated fasting and 2-h glucose in combination indicates greater risk than either fasting plasma glucose or A1C alone. This improved predictability may be a function of reducing error variance; in other words, conducting a follow-up test clarifies the group with more stable hyperglycemia, and is the main reason that a second test is recommended for a full clinical diagnosis.

Our most important limitation was the lack of original data to model the continuous association between A1C values and incidence. This lack of original data required us to use a modeling approach with which many readers are unfamiliar. Nevertheless, our modeling of average studies resulted in an average incidence value of roughly 1% per year for persons with normal A1C values, an incidence estimate that is consistent with numerous other estimates of the general population. The lack of access to raw data also prevented us from conducting formal ROC analyses of A1C cut-off points to distinguish between eventual cases/noncases or to quantitatively assess the impact of variation in population characteristics on the relationship between A1C and incidence. Our findings could also be influenced by the choice of outcome definition. A1C is more apt to predict diabetes if the outcome is also A1C-based. We did not detect major differences in the A1C/diabetes incidence association according to the choice of glycemic test. Since identifying A1C to predict diabetes defined by glycemic indicators is ultimately circular, future studies should examine the relationship of glycemic markers and later diabetes risk by using several glycemic markers to define incident diabetes, as well as to consider morbidity outcomes.

The growth of diabetes as a national and worldwide public health problem, combined with strong evidence for the prevention of type 2 diabetes with structured lifestyle intervention and metformin, have placed a new importance on the efficient determination of diabetes risk. The selection of specific thresholds, however, will ultimately depend on the interventions likely to be employed and the tradeoffs between sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. These findings support A1C as a suitably efficient tool to identify people at risk and should help to advance efforts to identify people at risk for type 2 diabetes for referral to appropriate preventive interventions.

### A1c and diabetes diagnosis: the rancho bernardo study [^11758DzH]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the sensitivity and specificity of A1C as a diagnostic test for type 2 diabetes in older adults.

Research Design and Methods

Cross-sectional study of community-dwelling adults without known diabetes who had an oral glucose tolerance test and A1C measured on the same day.

Results

Mean age of the 2,107 participants was 69.4 ± 11.1 years; 43% were men. Based on the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria, 198 had previously undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. The sensitivity/specificity of A1C cut point of 6.5% was 44/79%. Results were similar in age- and sex-stratified analyses. Given the A1C cut point of 6.5%, 85% of participants were classified as nondiabetic by ADA criteria.

Conclusions

The limited sensitivity of the A1C test may result in delayed diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, while the strict use of ADA criteria may fail to identify a high proportion of individuals with diabetes by A1C ≥ 6.5% or retinopathy.

### Dispelling the nice or naughty myth: retrospective observational study of santa claus [^113pNGRU]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine which factors influence whether Santa Claus will visit children in hospital on Christmas Day.

Design Retrospective observational study.

Setting Paediatric wards in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.

Participants 186 members of staff who worked on the paediatric wards (n = 186) during Christmas 2015.

Main outcome measures Presence or absence of Santa Claus on the paediatric ward during Christmas 2015. This was correlated with rates of absenteeism from primary school, conviction rates in young people (aged 10–17 years), distance from hospital to North Pole (closest city or town to the hospital in kilometres, as the reindeer flies), and contextual socioeconomic deprivation (index of multiple deprivation).

Results Santa Claus visited most of the paediatric wards in all four countries: 89% in England, 100% in Northern Ireland, 93% in Scotland, and 92% in Wales. The odds of him not visiting, however, were significantly higher for paediatric wards in areas of higher socioeconomic deprivation in England (odds ratio 1.31 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.71) in England, 1.23 (1.00 to 1.54) in the UK). In contrast, there was no correlation with school absenteeism, conviction rates, or distance to the North Pole.

Conclusion The results of this study dispel the traditional belief that Santa Claus rewards children based on how nice or naughty they have been in the previous year. Santa Claus is less likely to visit children in hospitals in the most deprived areas. Potential solutions include a review of Santa's contract or employment of local Santas in poorly represented regions.

### Pitfalls in hemoglobin A1c measurement: when results may be misleading [^114dkPgY]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Since the beginning of clinical use in the 1970s, hemoglobin A1c (A1c) has become the standard tool for monitoring glycemic control in patients with diabetes. The role of the A1c test was broadened in 2010, when the American Diabetes Association added A1c as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes. Because of hemoglobin A1c's integral role in diagnosis and treatment, it is important to recognize clinical scenarios and interfering factors that yield false results. The purpose of this review is to describe the A1c measurement, outline clinical scenarios or factors that may yield false results, and describe alternative laboratory biomarkers.

### Translating the A1c assay [^111wrFq7]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

What emerged was not only the recommendation that DCCT-derived numbers should be maintained if possible but also that an international study should commence to look more closely at the relationship between A1C and mean blood glucose. If the study was "successful", at least we could adopt an A1C-derived unit (e.g. "estimated average glucose" in milligrams per deciliter or millimoles per liter) that would obviate the IFCC objection to having laboratory results expressed as a percentage. This path forward was then ratified in an official consensus statement issued by all four organizations.

The rationale for another study examining the relationship between mean blood glucose and A1C stemmed from the belief that the previously published reports used a variety of measures of glucose concentration, recruited only small numbers of subjects (and mostly those with type 1 diabetes), performed measurements over a relatively short time period, and, most notably, performed relatively infrequent sampling of blood glucose (mostly during the daytime). For example, the often-cited conversion table in the American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes — 2007 was based on very limited capillary glucose sampling in the DCCT, and the study was actually not intended to establish the relationship between average glucose and A1C. Thus, greater confidence was needed that A1C truly represents an average glucose.

The results of the international study are now reported and confirm and extend previous findings. The strengths of the study are that it examined the relationship between average glucose and A1C across a wide spectrum of A1C values — from ∼5% to as high as 13% — and in more people than ever before studied. Also, both normal subjects and subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes were enrolled in numbers sufficient to conclude that the relationship between the two variables was consistent between these subgroups and also in relation to other important variables (i.e. age, ethnicity, smoking). Finally, the study obtained ∼2,700 glucose measurements in each participant, which is far greater than the number obtained in nearly all previous studies. The results clearly support the hypothesis that there is a strong linear relationship between mean blood glucose and A1C, with a coefficient of correlation R² of 0.84.

### Glycemic control, complications, and death in older diabetic patients: the diabetes and aging study [^112GVrkc]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the range of glycemic levels associated with the lowest rates of complications and mortality in older diabetic patients.

Research Design and Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study (2004–2008) of 71,092 patients with type 2 diabetes, aged ≥ 60 years, enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We specified Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the relationships between baseline glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and subsequent outcomes (nonfatal complications [acute metabolic, microvascular, and cardiovascular events] and mortality).

Results

The cohort (aged 71.0 ± 7.4 years [means ± SD]) had a mean A1C of 7.0 ± 1.2%. The risk of any nonfatal complication rose monotonically for levels of A1C > 6.0% (e.g., adjusted hazard ratio 1.09 [95% CI 1.02–1.16] for A1C 6.0–6.9% and 1.86 [1.63–2.13] for A1C ≥ 11.0%). Mortality had a U-shaped relationship with A1C. Compared with the risk with A1C < 6.0%, mortality risk was lower for A1C levels between 6.0 and 9.0% (e.g., 0.83 [0.76–0.90] for A1C 7.0–7.9%) and higher at A1C ≥ 11.0% (1.31 [1.09–1.57]). Risk of any end point (complication or death) became significantly higher at A1C ≥ 8.0%. Patterns generally were consistent across age-groups (60–69, 70–79, and ≥ 80 years).

Conclusions

Observed relationships between A1C and combined end points support setting a target of A1C < 8.0% for older patients, with the caution that A1Cs < 6.0% were associated with increased mortality risk. Additional research is needed to evaluate the low A1C-mortality relationship, as well as protocols for individualizing diabetes care.

### A1c to detect diabetes in healthy adults: when should we recheck? [^115et1FF]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This study confirms that the rise in A1C in a nondiabetic population is slow. Participants who are well under the diagnostic threshold of A1C 6.5% are unlikely to exceed this within several years of follow-up.

Much of the increased detection of diabetes in those with a higher baseline A1C was at 1 year and may be attributable to measurement error and short-term variation in A1C. The CV (including within-subject variation) varies between 2 and 5%; a CV of 5% would mean that a 95% measurement interval of a single A1C in this range would be ± 0.6%. This degree of variation would lead to some individuals having sequential tests from just below to just above 6.5%. Although the variation could occur at all time points, this is much less likely in the 5.0–5.9% range.

Our findings echo the slow rise of A1C found in trials with diabetic patients. For example, in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, the patients on diet alone had a rise of < 0.2% per year. Our nondiabetic cohort had an even lower average change in A1C of 0.05% per year.

This study has several limitations. First, the follow-up is incomplete because not all participants came back every year. This could be addressed by other analysis, such as a linear mixed model. However, any bias would be likely to favor those developing diabetes to reattend. Second, a few participants (1.1%) began taking glucose-lowering drugs, but this is unlikely to make a large difference to our conclusions. Third, our data are from one institution in Tokyo, Japan, and might not generalize to other populations. For example, adult mean BMI levels of 22–23 kg/m 2 are found in Africa and Asia, while levels of 25–27 kg/m 2 are prevalent across North America and Europe, and then BMI level could be related to the cumulative incidence of diabetes. Finally, although the American Diabetes Association criteria recommend a repeat A1C test to confirm the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, our study included only a single measurement of A1C.

In conclusion, for the purpose of detecting new cases of diabetes, in those with an initial A1C < 6.0%, rescreening at intervals shorter than 3 years identifies few individuals (∼ ≤ 1%) with an A1C ≥ 6.5%. At A1C ≥ 6%, rescreening even at a 1-year interval would be reasonable strategy to identify disease.

### Implications of using hemoglobin A1c for diagnosing diabetes mellitus [^114HbEug]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Until 2010, the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was based solely on glucose concentration, but the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommendations now include a new criterion: hemoglobin A1C ≥ 6.5%. Because this change may have significant implications for diabetes diagnosis, we conducted a comprehensive literature review including peer-reviewed articles not referenced in the ADA report. We conclude that A1C and plasma glucose tests are frequently discordant for diagnosing diabetes. A1C ≥ 6.5% identifies fewer individuals as having diabetes than glucose-based criteria. Convenience of A1C test might increase the number of patients diagnosed, but this is unproven. Diagnostic cut-points for both glucose and A1C are based on consensus judgments regarding optimal sensitivity and specificity for the complications of hyperglycemia. A1C may not accurately reflect levels of glycemia in some situations, but in comparison with glucose measurements, it has greater analytic stability and less temporal variability. When choosing a diagnostic test for diabetes, the limitations of each choice must be understood. Clinical judgment and consideration of patient preference are required to appropriately select among the diagnostic alternatives.

### The pros and cons of diagnosing diabetes with A1c [^1167EaU2]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

An International Expert Committee was convened in 2008 by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, and the International Diabetes Federation to consider the means for diagnosing diabetes in nonpregnant individuals, with particular focus on the possibility to indicate A1C as an alternative if not a better tool. After reviewing the available literature and a thorough discussion on the advantages and the limits of previous diagnostic strategies (essentially based on fasting glucose assessment) and the considered alternative approach (based on A1C measurement), a consensus was reached that the latter (i.e. A1C) should be included among diagnostic tools for diabetes and, with the exception of a number of clinical conditions, should even be preferred in diabetes diagnosis in nonpregnant adults.

The main conclusion of the International Expert Committee was implemented in the most recent clinical recommendations issued by the ADA. However, in these guidelines, A1C is indicated as a diagnostic tool alternative but not superior to blood glucose, leaving to the health care professional the decision about what test to use in an individual.

The World Health Organization is currently examining the proposal made by the International Expert Committee and is carefully addressing the controversial issues still remaining, most of which have been the subject of letters to the editor and articles recently published in the literature. Nevertheless, the use of A1C for diagnosing diabetes is rapidly becoming a reality in many Western countries.

In the text that follows, one of us (E.B.) will present the main points supporting A1C (pros) and the other (J.T.) will illustrate the main counterpoints challenging A1C (cons) as the primary tool for diabetes diagnosis. The text has been prepared in full coordination and the final conclusions represent the opinion of both authors. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the pros and cons.

### Glycemic goals and hypoglycemia: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115fjCzy]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

A1C-based glycemic assessment — In people with diabetes, A1C reflects average glycemia over approximately 2–3 months, and measurement approximately every 3 months is used to determine whether glycemic goals have been reached and maintained. A1C does not provide a measure of glycemic variability or hypoglycemia, and for individuals prone to glycemic variability (especially type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes with insulin deficiency and/or intensive insulin therapy) glycemic status is best evaluated by the combination of results from blood glucose monitoring (BGM) or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and A1C, because discordant results between A1C and BGM or CGM can occur due to high glycemic variability, inaccurate BGM or CGM measurement, or inaccurate A1C.

### The correlation of hemoglobin A1c to blood glucose [^114js3PP]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

The understanding that hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) represents the average blood glucose level of patients over the previous 120 days underlies the current management of diabetes. Even in making such a statement, we speak of "average blood glucose" as though "blood glucose" were itself a simple idea. When we consider all the blood glucose forms-arterial versus venous versus capillary, whole blood versus serum versus fluoride-preserved plasma, fasting versus nonfasting-we can start to see that this is not a simple issue. Nevertheless, it seems as though HbA1c correlates to any single glucose measurement. Having more than one measurement and taking those measurements in the preceding month improves the correlation further. In particular, by having glucose measurements that reflect both the relatively lower overnight glucose levels and measurements that reflect the postprandial peaks improves not only our ability to manage diabetes patients, but also our understanding of how HbA1c levels are determined. Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices may take thousands of glucose results over a week. Several studies have shown that CGM glucose averages account for the vast proportion of the variation of HbA1c. The ability to relate HbA1c to average glucose may become a popular method for reporting HbA1c, eliminating current concerns regarding differences in HbA1c standardization. Hemoglobin A1c expressed as an average glucose may be more understandable to patients and improve not only their understanding, but also their ability to improve their diabetes management.

### Elevated A1c in adults without a history of diabetes in the U.S [^115nQQ4H]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

A1C is an integrated measure of circulating glucose levels and tracks well in individuals over time. Epidemiological studies have shown that A1C values in nondiabetic adults predict incident diabetes, cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, and total mortality. In these studies, A1C values well within in the "normal" range (i.e. A1C < 6%) were independently associated with clinical outcomes. There is currently renewed interest in using A1C for diagnosis and/or screening for diabetes; however, there have been few epidemiological investigations of A1C in nondiabetic adults. The objective of the present study was to examine the prevalence and correlates of elevated A1C in a large, nationally representative sample of U.S. adults without diagnosed diabetes who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (1999–2006). We hypothesized that 1) elevated A1C levels (e.g. A1C > 6%) are common in the general population of nondiabetic adults in the U.S. and 2) A1C levels would be associated with risk factors for type 2 diabetes and its complications even in the absence of elevated glucose levels.

### Translating the A1c assay into estimated average glucose values [^115xCu1c]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

The A1C assay is widely accepted and used as the most reliable means of assessing chronic glycemia. Its close association with risk for long-term complications, established in epidemiologic studies and clinical trials, has lead to the establishment of specific A1C targets for diabetes care with the goal of preventing or delaying the development of long-term complications (,–). Diabetes treatment is adjusted based on the A1C results, expressed as the percentage of hemoglobin that is glycated. The vast majority of assays have been standardized worldwide, through the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program, to the assay used in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), which established the relationship between A1C levels and risk for long-term diabetes complications.

A new, more stable and specific method of standardization of the A1C assay, which is not intended for use in routine assays, has been developed and proposed to be used for global standardization by the International Federation of Clinical Chemists. However, the new method results in values that are 1.5–2.0 percentage points lower than current National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program values, potentially causing confusion for patients and health care providers. Moreover, the International Federation of Clinical Chemists results would be expressed in new units (millimoles per mole), which would add to the confusion. Chronic glycemia (A1C) is usually expressed as a percentage of hemoglobin that is glycated, whereas the day-to-day monitoring and therapy of diabetes are based on acute glucose levels expressed as milligrams per deciliter or millimoles per liter. This discrepancy has always been problematic. If we could reliably report chronic metabolic control and long-term management goals as average glucose (AG), i.e. in the same units of measurement as acute glycemia, it would eliminate these potential sources of confusion.

The relationship between A1C and chronic glycemia has been explored in several studies that have supported the association of A1C with AG levels over the preceding 5–12 weeks. However, the older studies have been limited, including relatively small homogeneous cohorts of patients, usually with type 1 diabetes. Moreover, almost all of the prior studies have relied on infrequent measures of capillary glucose levels, calling into question the validity of their assessment of chronic glycemia. We performed an international multicenter study to examine the relationship between average glucose, assessed as completely as possible with a combination of continuous glucose monitoring and frequent fingerstick capillary glucose testing, and A1C levels over time to estimate the relationship between the two.

### Relationship between A1c and glucose levels in the general Dutch population: the new hoorn study [^115BKC1E]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Fasting glucose levels and glucose levels 2 h after a glucose tolerance test (postload glucose levels) are used for diagnosis and management of diabetes. In addition, the A1C level is used to monitor glycemia in patients with diabetes because it has less day-to-day variability than glucose levels and is thought to reflect chronic glycemia.

In 2007, a consensus statement reported on the worldwide standardization of the A1C measurement. One of the conclusions was that glycemic goals in clinical practice should be expressed in three types of units, one of which is the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine standardized method. Use of this method implies that the unit of measurement of A1C will change from a percentage to millimoles per mole. The introduction of this new unit of measurement may be confusing for patients and health care providers. Therefore, the A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) Study Group investigated whether A1C can be translated into average blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes. A major advantage of using the average glucose level for chronic glycemia is that it has the same unit of measurement (millimoles per liter) as that for acute glycemia. The ADAG Study Group concluded that the average glucose level was strongly correlated with A1C and that the translation of A1C into average glucose levels was therefore possible. Moreover, Saudek et al. recommended 1) the use of an A1C level of ≥ 6.0% as a screening standard for the detection of individuals at high risk of developing diabetes, 2) an A1C level of ≥ 6.5% confirmed by a glucose test (fasting or oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]) for the diagnosis of diabetes, and 3) A1C levels of ≥ 7.0% measured twice or confirmed by a glucose test for the diagnosis of diabetes. During the review process for the present article, a consensus statement from an International Expert Committee that recommended the use of A1C levels ≥ 6.5% for the diagnosis of diabetes instead of glucose measures was published. A1C levels between 6.0 and 6.5% are proposed to identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes. It may, however, be questioned whether A1C is a good indicator of glucose in individuals with normal or moderately elevated glucose levels and whether it can therefore be used to identify those with intermediate hyperglycemia or undiagnosed diabetes. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the relationship between glucose and A1C in the general population and to evaluate the use of A1C for the screening and diagnosis of diabetes.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115GbubZ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

A1C assay limitations and ancestry considerations in diabetes diagnosis: A1C may not be a suitable diagnostic test in people with anemia, those treated with erythropoietin, or those undergoing hemodialysis or HIV treatment, and some hemoglobin variants can interfere with A1C test results depending on the specific assay. The glucose-independent racial difference in A1C is small (~0.3 percentage points) and may reflect genetic differences in hemoglobin or red cell turnover that vary by ancestry; accordingly, the text emphasizes that we do not use race or ancestry as proxies for poorly understood genetic differences, while noting that the field lacks adequate genetic data in diverse populations.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2009 [^1117Q148]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The A1C test is subject to certain limitations. Conditions that affect erythrocyte turnover (hemolysis, blood loss) and hemoglobin variants must be considered, particularly when the A1C result does not correlate with the patient's clinical situation. In addition, A1C does not provide a measure of glycemic variability or hypoglycemia. For patients prone to glycemic variability (especially type 1 patients, or type 2 patients with severe insulin deficiency), glycemic control is best judged by the combination of results of SMBG testing and the A1C. The A1C may also serve as a check on the accuracy of the patient's meter (or the patient's reported SMBG results) and the adequacy of the SMBG testing schedule.

Table 8 contains the correlation between A1C levels and mean plasma glucose levels based on data from the international A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) trial utilizing frequent SMBG and continuous glucose monitoring in 507 adults (83% Caucasian) with type 1, type 2, and no diabetes The ADA and American Association of Clinical Chemists have determined that the correlation (r = 0.92) is strong enough to justify reporting both an A1C result and an estimated average glucose (eAG) result when a clinician orders the A1C test. The table in previous versions of the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes describing the correlation between A1C and mean glucose was derived from relatively sparse data (one seven-point profile over 1 day per A1C reading) in the primarily Caucasian type 1 participants in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) trial. Clinicians should note that the numbers in the table are now different, as they are based on ∼2,800 readings per A1C in the ADAG trial.

In the ADAG study, there were no significant differences among racial and ethnic groups in the regression lines between A1C and mean glucose, although there was a trend toward a difference between African/African-American and Caucasian participants' regression lines that might have been significant had more African/African-American participants been studied. A recent study comparing A1C to CGM data in 48 type 1 children found a highly statistically significant correlation between A1C and mean blood glucose, although the correlation (r = 0.7) was significantly lower than in the ADAG trial. Whether there are significant differences in how A1C relates to average glucose in children or in African-American patients is an area for further study. For the time being, the question has not led to different recommendations about testing A1C or to different interpretations of the clinical meaning of given levels of A1C in those populations.

### Everything causes cancer? Beliefs and attitudes towards cancer prevention among anti-vaxxers, flat earthers, and reptilian conspiracists: online cross sectional survey [^1153rqdj]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020. Between 30% and 50% of diagnosed cancer is preventable through lifestyle changes and existing evidence based prevention strategies, such as maintaining a healthy weight, partaking in physical activity, eating fruits and vegetables, limiting consumption of alcohol and red and processed meat, avoiding excess sun exposure and active and passive smoking, and participating in vaccination programmes against human papillomavirus and hepatitis. Adherence to recommendations on cancer prevention is directly related to beliefs about cancer. Therefore, identifying these beliefs and their underlying factors can help to inform prevention efforts.

Although communication technologies and social media provide new opportunities to access health information, they also have a pervasive effect. They open a direct avenue of misinformation (false information that is spread, regardless of intent to mislead) and disinformation (misinformation that is circulated intentionally for secondary gains — namely, money, reputation, or power), posing health concerns. Conspiracy beliefs are the extreme results of misinformation and widespread suspicions of the real world. These include the beliefs that the earth is flat, that humanoids take reptilian forms to manipulate human societies, or that condensation trails from planes are "chemtrails" comprising agents sprayed for evil purposes. Some myths also relate to Santa Claus — some people think that Santa is an anagram of Satan and brings corruption and greed during Christmas, whereas others believe that Santa Claus is a giant lie that was started by the Illuminati for mind control. The covid-19 pandemic also caused multiple conspiracies, mainly related to its origin and vaccines, undermining preventive health responses and leading some people to undertake risky alternative treatments.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^114LCLN7]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

As was the case with FPG and 2-h PG, defining a lower limit of an intermediate category of A1C is somewhat arbitrary, as the risk of diabetes with any measure or surrogate of glycemia is a continuum, extending well into the normal ranges. To maximize equity and efficiency of preventive interventions, such an A1C cut point should balance the costs of "false negatives" (failing to identify those who are going to develop diabetes) against the costs of "false positives" (falsely identifying and then spending intervention resources on those who were not going to develop diabetes anyway).

As is the case with the glucose measures, several prospective studies that used A1C to predict the progression to diabetes demonstrated a strong, continuous association between A1C and subsequent diabetes. In a systematic review of 44,203 individuals from 16 cohort studies with a follow-up interval averaging 5.6 years (range 2.8–12 years), those with an A1C between 5.5 and 6.0% had a substantially increased risk of diabetes with 5-year incidences ranging from 9 to 25%. An A1C range of 6.0–6.5% had a 5-year risk of developing diabetes between 25 and 50% and relative risk 20 times higher compared with an A1C of 5.0%. In a community-based study of black and white adults without diabetes, baseline A1C was a stronger predictor of subsequent diabetes and cardiovascular events than was fasting glucose. Other analyses suggest that an A1C of 5.7% is associated with similar diabetes risk to the high-risk participants in the DPP. Hence, it is reasonable to consider an A1C range of 5.7–6.4% as identifying individuals with high risk for future diabetes, to whom the term prediabetes may be applied.

### Dispelling the nice or naughty myth: retrospective observational study of santa claus [^116NKczM]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Determinants

We used the website FreeMapTools to record the distance (km) between the hospital (closest city or town to the hospital) and North Pole, as the reindeer flies. We considered two sources of data as potential indicators of naughtiness. Firstly, rates of absenteeism from primary school as a proxy for child behaviour were obtained from national government databases in 2015, available online for each respective country (England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales) and regions within England. School absenteeism was defined by the total number of authorised and unauthorised absences, counted in sessions where each session is equivalent to half a day. Secondly, we obtained data from the Ministry of Justice on the conviction rate for crimes by young people per 1000 of the 10–17 year old population. Data were unavailable for Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Thames Valley, Wessex, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. For regions within London we assigned values based on the conviction rate for ages 10–17 years in all of London. Contextual socioeconomic deprivation was characterised by the index of multiple deprivation, which combines data on seven domains of deprivation: income, employment, health deprivation and disability, education skills and training, barriers to housing and services, crime, and living environment, as calculated by each of the four countries. Each hospital was assigned a score based on the decile ranking of the area in which it is located. Since publically available index of multiple deprivation deciles in Wales are classed into broader categories (deciles 1, 2, 3–5, 6–10), paediatric wards in Wales were assigned to the midpoint of their deprivation category. We carried out subanalyses restricted to regions within England, and for analyses involving conviction data to selected regions within England as well as Wales. Table 1presents the summary statistics for the determinants.

For modeling purposes we reversed the coding of the deprivation variable (making 10 most deprived and 1 least deprived) so that our odds ratios could be interpreted in relation to the effect of increased deprivation on the odds of Santa's visit.

### A1c versus glucose testing: a comparison [^112sPeR8]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Diabetes was originally identified by the presence of glucose in the urine. Almost 2,500 years ago it was noticed that ants were attracted to the urine of some individuals. In the 18th and 19th centuries the sweet taste of urine was used for diagnosis before chemical methods became available to detect sugars in the urine. Tests to measure glucose in the blood were developed over 100 years ago, and hyperglycemia subsequently became the sole criterion recommended for the diagnosis of diabetes. Initial diagnostic criteria relied on the response to an oral glucose challenge, while later measurement of blood glucose in an individual who was fasting also became acceptable. The most widely accepted glucose-based criteria for diagnosis are fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 126 mg/dL or a 2-h plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) on more than one occasion. In a patient with classic symptoms of diabetes, a single random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL is considered diagnostic. Before 2010 virtually all diabetes societies recommended blood glucose analysis as the exclusive method to diagnose diabetes. Notwithstanding these guidelines, over the last few years many physicians have been using hemoglobin A1C to screen for and diagnose diabetes. Although considered the "gold standard" for diagnosis, measurement of glucose in the blood is subject to several limitations, many of which are not widely appreciated. Measurement of A1C for diagnosis is appealing but has some inherent limitations. These issues have become the focus of considerable attention with the recent publication of the Report of the International Expert Committee that recommended the use of A1C for diagnosis of diabetes, a position that has been endorsed (at the time of writing) by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the Endocrine Society, and in a more limited fashion by American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology. This review will provide an overview of the factors that influence glucose and A1C testing.

### Elevated A1c in adults without a history of diabetes in the U.S [^115395iu]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Count in millions (95% CI) of persons at different A1C cut points in the U.S. 2000 Census population aged ≥ 20 years without diabetes.

Figure 2 displays the distributions of A1C in individuals with normal fasting glucose (fasting glucose < 100 mg/dl), IFG (fasting glucose 100– < 126 mg/dl), and undiagnosed diabetes (fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl), revealing substantially overlapping distributions in individuals with normal glucose and IFG but a right-skewed distribution in individuals with undiagnosed diabetes. The mean A1C levels in individuals with normal fasting glucose, IFG, and undiagnosed diabetes were 5.2 ± 0.01, 5.5 ± 0.01, and 6.9 ± 0.16%, respectively (not shown). Similarly, the distribution of individuals in the fasting glucose categories (< 100, 100–125, and ≥ 126 mg/dl) varied substantially, depending on the A1C cut point. For instance, among individuals with A1C > 6.0%, 45.6% had undiagnosed diabetes, 45.3% had IFG, and 9.1% had normal fasting glucose. In contrast, among individuals with an A1C ≥ 7.0%, 91.7% had undiagnosed diabetes, 6.6% had IFG, and only 1.7% had normal glucose levels. A comparison of the distribution of fasting glucose categories among individuals with A1C > 6.1% and A1C ≥ 6.5% yielded intermediate results. Among individuals with A1C > 6%, 53.3% had undiagnosed diabetes, 38.6% had IFG, and 8.1% had normal fasting glucose. Among individuals with A1C ≥ 6.5%, 76.7% had undiagnosed diabetes, 19.6% had IFG, and 1.7% had normal fasting glucose (supplementary Figure A, available in an online appendix at).

### A1c to detect diabetes in healthy adults: when should we recheck? [^116nWy28]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To evaluate the optimal interval for rechecking A1C levels below the diagnostic threshold of 6.5% for healthy adults.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This was a retrospective cohort study. Participants were 16,313 apparently healthy Japanese adults not taking glucose-lowering medications at baseline. Annual A1C measures from 2005 to 2008 at the Center for Preventive Medicine, a community teaching hospital in Japan, estimated cumulative incidence of diabetes.

RESULTS

Mean age (± SD) of participants was 49.7 ± 12.3 years, and 53% were male. Mean A1C at baseline was 5.4 ± 0.5%. At 3 years, for those with A1C at baseline of < 5.0%, 5.0–5.4%, 5.5–5.9%, and 6.0–6.4%, cumulative incidence (95% CI) was 0.05% (0.001–0.3), 0.05% (0.01–0.11), 1.2% (0.9–1.6), and 20% (18–23), respectively.

CONCLUSIONS

In those with an A1C < 6.0%, rescreening at intervals shorter than 3 years identifies few individuals (∼ ≤ 1%) with an A1C ≥ 6.5%.

### Association of A1c and fasting plasma glucose levels with diabetic retinopathy prevalence in the U.S. population: implications for diabetes diagnostic thresholds [^114Tmwq6]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) population, there was a continuous relation between prevalent retinopathy (defined as ETDRS level ≥ 20) and A1C and, based on change point analysis, no clear evidence of a threshold. Moreover, retinopathy in the absence of diabetes (FPG < 7 mmol/l) was more frequent among individuals of minority racial groups than whites, suggesting a higher likelihood of retinopathy not due to hyperglycemia among minority populations. This may have influenced the capacity of identifying a clear A1C threshold. In our study, minorities represented 30% of the population, but in MESA they represented 60% of the population.

In the overall population, retinopathy prevalence increased precipitously after FPG levels of 5.8 mmol/l, but the change point was higher (7.0 mmol/l) among those not receiving hypoglycemic treatment. This suggests that treatment affects FPG level and shifts the FPG distribution among people with diabetes to the left. The FPG change points observed in our study span the range of levels observed in previous studies, including the Pima Indian (6.8 mmol/l) and the Egyptian studies (6.4 mmol/l). However, in contrast with our findings, a recent analysis of three population-based studies (Blue Mountains Eye Study, Australian Diabetes Obesity and Lifestyle Study, and MESA) did not detect a clear FPG threshold for the prevalence of any or moderate retinopathy. Demographic differences (age, sex, and race/ethnicity), differences in status of hypoglycemic treatment, and criteria of diagnosis of retinopathy could explain these discrepancies.

There are several advantages to A1C as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes. A1C is less affected by short-term lifestyle changes, and its measurement has been improved and standardized during the last decade. While hemoglobinopathies and race/ethnicity may reduce the validity of A1C as a diagnostic tool, A1C level has less variability than FPG. Nevertheless, the interindividual variability of A1C is far more complicated than that of FPG. Genetic factors account for a significant part of the variation in A1C among people without diabetes. Glycation rate is also influenced by factors other than the level of plasma glucose. In our study, A1C had a smaller CV and a larger AUC than FPG. Though FPG had a similar level of AUC after adjusting for other variables, these adjustments are not practical in clinical practice. These results suggested that in some circumstances A1C may discriminate prevalent retinopathy better than FPG.

### Children and adolescents: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111gDBwj]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Children and adolescents — A1C targets and individualization: A1C goals must be individualized and reassessed over time, with an A1C of < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) appropriate for many children and adolescents; less stringent A1C goals such as < 7.5% [< 58 mmol/mol] may be appropriate for youth with factors like hypoglycemia unawareness, inability to check blood glucose regularly, or nonglycemic factors that increase A1C; even less stringent A1C goals such as < 8% [< 64 mmol/mol] may be appropriate for individuals with a history of severe hypoglycemia or limited life expectancy or where the harms of treatment are greater than the benefits; health care professionals may reasonably suggest more stringent A1C goals such as ≤ 6.5% [< 48 mmol/ mol] for selected individuals if they can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia, excessive weight gain, negative impacts on well-being, or undue burden of care; and lower goals may also be appropriate during the honeymoon phase.

### Elevated A1c in adults without a history of diabetes in the U.S [^117U5J1X]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This analysis suggests that elevated A1C (> 6%) is common in the general population of nondiabetic adults. The overall prevalence of A1C > 6% was 3.8%, corresponding to 7.1 million individuals in the U.S. population. Approximately 45% of these individuals have IFG and 45% have fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl. Elevated A1C levels were particularly common among older adults, non-Hispanic blacks, and obese individuals. We found that demographic characteristics and risk factors for type 2 diabetes and its complications including older age, male sex, nonwhite race/ethnicity, lower attained education level, adiposity, and hypercholesterolemia were associated with elevated A1C even in the presence of normal fasting glucose.

Significant advantages of adopting A1C for the screening and diagnosis of diabetes are the high repeatability of the measurement and the high specificity of elevated values for detecting undiagnosed diabetes. Recent recommendations have stated that diagnosis based on A1C should be confirmed using a glucose-dependent test (FPG or OGTT) or by a second A1C. However, glucose-dependent tests are less reliable (repeatable) than A1C. Requiring confirmation of a highly reliable test by one that is less reliable poses problems for the interpretation of any discrepancy between the two values. In a previous study, we analyzed repeated measurements taken ∼2 weeks apart on an unselected sample of individuals without diabetes and found that 100% of individuals with A1C ≥ 7% had a second A1C measurement of ≥ 7% ∼2 weeks later and 80% of individuals with A1C ≥ 6.5 had an A1C level ≥ 6.5% 2 weeks later (Pearson's r = 0.95). There is little marginal gain to repeating the A1C test within a short (several week) time period. Furthermore, we show in the present study that 92% of individuals with A1C ≥ 7.0% also had FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl and 77% of individuals with A1C ≥ 6.5% had FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl. At the population level, elevated A1C is rare in the absence of elevated fasting glucose. Additional advantages to using A1C for screening and/or diagnosis of diabetes include national standardization of the assay, the low analytic variability (high methodological quality of the assay, even when compared with glucose), the widespread availability of the A1C test and its current use in the management and treatment of diabetes, and the fact that the patient does not need to fast.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^113yhvTU]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

AACE 2022 diabetes guideline — glucose testing and hemoglobin A1C (A1C) interpretation defines normal, prediabetes, and diabetes thresholds using fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG), random plasma glucose (PG), and A1C. Normal: FPG < 100 mg/dL, 2-h PG < 140 mg/dL, and A1C < 5.5%. Prediabetes: impaired fasting glucose (IFG) with FPG ≥ 100 to 125 mg/dL, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) with 2-h PG ≥ 140 to 199 mg/dL, and A1C 5.7% to 6.4% for screening of prediabetes. Diabetes: FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL; 2-h PG ≥ 200 mg/dL or random PG ≥ 200 mg/dL + symptoms; and A1C ≥ 6.5% (secondary). A1C should be used only for screening prediabetes and diagnosis should be confirmed with glucose testing; for diabetes, glucose criteria are preferred, the same test should be repeated on a different day, two abnormal test results from the same sample confirm diagnosis, and a glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL in the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) symptoms does not need confirmation.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1167MvKp]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to HbA1c and blood glucose, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to evaluate for the possibility of a problem or interference with either test when there is consistent and substantial discordance between blood glucose values and A1C test results.

---

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^116roF7q]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

ADA has not previously recommended the use of A1C for diagnosing diabetes, in part due to lack of standardization of the assay. However, A1C assays are now highly standardized, and their results can be uniformly applied both temporally and across populations. In a recent report, after an extensive review of both established and emerging epidemiological evidence, an international expert committee recommended the use of the A1C test to diagnose diabetes with a threshold of ≥ 6.5%, and ADA affirms this decision. The diagnostic test should be performed using a method certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and standardized or traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) reference assay. Point-of-care A1C assays are not sufficiently accurate at this time to use for diagnostic purposes.

Epidemiologic datasets show a relationship between A1C and the risk of retinopathy similar to that which has been shown for corresponding FPG and 2-h PG thresholds. The A1C has several advantages to the FPG, including greater convenience, since fasting is not required; evidence to suggest greater preanalytical stability; and less day-to-day perturbations during periods of stress and illness. These advantages must be balanced by greater cost, limited availability of A1C testing in certain regions of the developing world, and incomplete correlation between A1C and average glucose in certain individuals. In addition, the A1C can be misleading in patients with certain forms of anemia and hemoglobinopathies. For patients with a hemoglobinopathy but normal red cell turnover, such as sickle cell trait, an A1C assay without interference from abnormal hemoglobins should be used (an updated list of A1C assays and whether abnormal hemoglobins impact them is available at). For conditions with abnormal red cell turnover, such as pregnancy or anemias from hemolysis and iron deficiency, the diagnosis of diabetes must use glucose criteria exclusively.

### Physiologic concepts that may revise the interpretation and implications of HbA1c in clinical medicine: an American perspective [^112MpBcB]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

HbA1c, a routinely used integrated measure of glycemic control, is traditionally thought to be equivalent to mean blood glucose in hematologically normal individuals. Therefore, particularly as the methodology of measuring HbA1c has been standardized, clinical decisions dependent on mean blood glucose are often predominantly decided based on the interpretation of measured HbA1c. In this commentary, however, now that a more routine method of measuring red cell life span has been developed, we present evidence that the relationship between HbA1c and mean blood glucose is influenced by variation in red blood cell survival even in the hematologically normal. This variation has consequences for the appropriate interpretation of HbA1c in diverse clinical conditions such as the diagnosis of diabetes and management of diabetes in chronic kidney disease.

Correlation between A1C and glucose monitoring (ADAG) — Table 6.1 provides rough equivalents of A1C and mean glucose levels based on the International A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study, which assessed the correlation between A1C and frequent BGM and CGM in 507 adults (83% non-Hispanic White). The American Diabetes Association and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry determined that the correlation (r = 0.92) in the ADAG trial is strong enough to justify reporting both the A1C result and the estimated average glucose (eAG) when a clinician orders the A1C test, and clinicians should note that the mean plasma glucose numbers in Table 6.1 are based on ~2,700 glucose measurements using intensive capillary BGM and capillary glucose, intermittently, during a 3-month period.

### A1c to detect diabetes in healthy adults: when should we recheck? [^11259X8k]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the optimal interval for rechecking A1C levels below the diagnostic threshold of 6.5% for healthy adults.

Research Design and Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study. Participants were 16,313 apparently healthy Japanese adults not taking glucose-lowering medications at baseline. Annual A1C measures from 2005 to 2008 at the Center for Preventive Medicine, a community teaching hospital in Japan, estimated cumulative incidence of diabetes.

Results

Mean age (± SD) of participants was 49.7 ± 12.3 years, and 53% were male. Mean A1C at baseline was 5.4 ± 0.5%. At 3 years, for those with A1C at baseline of < 5.0%, 5.0–5.4%, 5.5–5.9%, and 6.0–6.4%, cumulative incidence (95% CI) was 0.05% (0.001–0.3), 0.05% (0.01–0.11), 1.2% (0.9–1.6), and 20% (18–23), respectively.

Conclusions

In those with an A1C < 6.0%, rescreening at intervals shorter than 3 years identifies few individuals (approximately ≤ 1%) with an A1C ≥ 6.5%.

### Translating the A1c assay into estimated average glucose values [^111XYuEL]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Our results strongly support a simple linear relationship between mean glucose and A1C levels in a clinically relevant range of glycemia. Our data fulfilled the a priori quality criterion; i.e. 90% of the estimates fell within the ± 15% range of the regression line. This criterion was considered realistic, allowing for the imprecision of the A1C assay, CGM, and self-monitored blood glucose tests.

The large population allowed us to demonstrate that the relationship between A1C and AG was consistent across prespecified subgroups. The tight relationship and the consistency of the relationship across different subgroups suggest that for many, if not most, patients with diabetes, there are no important factors that affect the relationship between mean glucose levels and A1C. There was a suggestion (P = 0.07) that the regression line was different for African Americans such that for a given value of A1C, African Americans might have a slightly lower mean glucose level. This borderline result requires further study to be confident that there is no relationship between ethnicity and the relationship between mean glucose and A1C. There was also a suggestion that age may affect the relationship between AG and A1C; however, the effect was not monotonic. The regression lines for each age-group crossed at A1C of 7%, with the first and last tertile being similar and the middle tertile being different. We suspect that this is a spurious finding. There are other well-recognized clinical factors, such as anemia and altered erythrocyte turnover, which can affect A1C results measured with all assay methods, and hemoglobinopathies, which interfere with the measurement of A1C with specific methods. Potential subjects with these conditions were excluded from the study.

Diagnosis of DM requires 2 abnormal test results from the same sample or on different days; however, a glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL in the presence of symptoms confirms DM.

### Hemoglobin A (₁ C) criterion for diabetes diagnosis among hispanic and non-hispanic populations [^117XiPio]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To report on the performance of the recently recommended hemoglobin A(₁c) (A1C) criterion for diabetes diagnosis in comparison with the standard fasting plasma glucose and 2-hour post-glucose challenge (PG) test criteria across racial and ethnic groups.

Methods

We evaluated local and national survey data from 689 Dominican, 4,862 Hispanic, 4,694 African American, and 6,883 white study subjects. We compared rates of diabetes classification by diagnostic criteria, agreement and disagreement between A1C and PG criteria for diagnosing diabetes, and differences in cardiometabolic risk among the 3 diagnostic groups across racial and ethnic stratifications.

Results

The A1C-based diabetes diagnoses were higher among Dominican and African American study subjects (81.6% and 67.0%, respectively), and lower among Hispanic and white subjects (46.0% and 37.9%, respectively). Among those not meeting any PG criterion for diabetes, the A1C criterion identified diabetes in 8.3% of Dominican, 3.5% of African American, 0.9% of Hispanic, and 0.5% of white study subjects. The A1C criterion, however, did not identify diabetes in 64.5% of white, 46.1% of Dominican, 44.0% of African American, and 41.9% of Hispanic subjects who were diagnosed with diabetes by a PG criterion. For single tests, the agreement was greatest between A1C and fasting plasma glucose test criteria among Dominican, Hispanic, and African American study populations-76.9%, 65.6%, and 60.7%, respectively. There was no clear difference in selected cardiometabolic risks between A1C and PG-only diabetes diagnoses across racial and ethnic groups.

Conclusion

The A1C criterion yields racial- and ethnic-specific differences in diagnosing diabetes and in test agreements with PG-based criteria. Furthermore, diagnostic differences were observed between the Dominican subgroup and the Hispanic study population, of whom 91.5% were Mexican American.

### Type 2 diabetes in the pediatric population: are we meeting ADA clinical guidelines in Ohio? [^114Cxt2M]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Several studies have demonstrated the importance of achieving the American Diabetes Association (ADA) clinical guidelines in adults. However, research is limited on adherence to these guidelines in the pediatric population. This retrospective chart review examined 56 charts from 6 physician offices and 1 multispecialty health care system in Ohio. Variables of interest included recommendations from the 2007 ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes. HgA1c was measured every 3 months in 44.6% of patients, while 55% achieved A1c goal. Blood pressure was monitored in all patients, with 57% meeting goal. Lipids and urine microalbumin were tested annually in 51.7% and 26.7% of patients, respectively. Dilated eye and foot exams were performed on 53.5% and 37.5% of patients, respectively. Adherence to ADA clinical guidelines for pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes is suboptimal. The authors recommend that specific evidence-based guidelines be evaluated for children with type 2 diabetes.

### A christmas themed physical activity intervention to increase participation in physical activity during advent: pilot randomised controlled trial [^116G8kXm]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Intervention and control

The intervention group received the Active Advent intervention between the 1 and 24 December 2021 (three weeks and three days). Participants received an email each day that contained a Christmas themed physical activity idea to be completed that day. Each physical activity idea was divided into three levels of physical activity intensity, and participants selected which level was most suitable for them: Easy Elf (light intensity), Moderate Mrs Claus (moderate intensity), or Strenuous Santa (vigorous intensity). Participants were free to choose the intensity level of their physical activity each day as they wished. The duration of each physical activity idea varied and was determined by the activity type and intensity. For example, a Strenuous Santa physical activity idea might have been shorter in duration than the Easy Elf activity on a given day because the activity might have required participants to be physically active at a higher intensity (fig 1). Supplementary file S1 provides an overview of each Active Advent activity, as well as two examples of the intervention emails received by participants in the intervention group. The intervention was developed in line with the COM-B model, with a particular emphasis on increasing competence, opportunity, and motivation to be physically active. Each activity was designed by the research team, who made pragmatic decisions in determining the intensity of the activities based on previous workand their expertise. Each activity was accompanied with a detailed description of how to complete it correctly and safely (supplementary file S1). For safety and competency, some of the more complex activities were accompanied with a brief video showing how to complete them (supplementary file S2).

### Public health implications of recommendations to individualize glycemic targets in adults with diabetes [^1132N5ii]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

For nearly a decade, diabetes care guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) have recommended that the goal of glycemic control should be to lower the A1C to < 7.0% for adults living with diabetes. This recommendation currently motivates diabetes public health programs and diabetes care translational research. All of these efforts have the overall intention of shifting the national distribution of A1C levels downward in order to improve diabetes outcomes and may lead to overtreatment of A1C levels in certain diabetes populations.

Although the standard A1C target of < 7.0% is probably the best-known feature of the ADA guidelines, the ADA guidelines also recommend that A1C targets should be based on individual clinical circumstances. Similar recommendations for individualized targets have been supported by the Veterans Health Administration-Department of Defense (VA-DoD), American Geriatric Society, American College of Physicians (ACP), and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE). Recommendations to individualize targets are based on major type 2 diabetes trials that found different levels of benefit, and even harm, from lower A1C levels depending on diabetes population characteristics (e.g. duration of diabetes, age, and comorbidity). According to the ADA, lower A1C targets are recommended for patients with a short duration of diabetes, long life expectancy, and no significant cardiovascular disease. Conversely, higher A1C targets are recommended for patients with longstanding diabetes, advanced age, limited life expectancy, a history of macrovascular or advanced microvascular complications, extensive comorbidities, or a high risk for severe hypoglycemia. Although guidelines have identified these special populations, recommendations on how to set individualized A1C targets have been open to interpretation.

American Optometric Association — ADA diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus include A1C ≥ 6.5 percent performed using a method that "should be performed using a method that is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program and standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial assay (point-of-care A1C assays are not sufficiently accurate to use for diagnostic purposes)"; fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), with "Fasting… defined as no caloric intake for at least eight hours"; two-hour plasma glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) where "The test should be performed as described by the World Health Organization using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75-g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water"; or random plasma glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) "in a person with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss) or hyperglycemic crisis", with "Random… defined as any time of the day without regard to time since the last meal". In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, "these results should be confirmed by repeat testing".

### Dispelling the nice or naughty myth: retrospective observational study of santa claus [^112TTqmN]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Results

Santa Claus visited 168 (90%) of the 186 paediatric hospital wards in the UK. Of the original 191 paediatric wards obtained from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, we excluded five. Of those five (all in England), staff of one ward declined to answer and four wards had closed or been transferred to another hospital.

All eight of the paediatric wards in Northern Ireland were visited by Santa Claus, representing the most successful coverage of visits by Santa. Scotland achieved second place, with 93% coverage (14/15 wards), and Wales came third with 92% coverage (11/12 wards). Notably, the proportion of wards visited in Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales was higher than the 89% (135/151 wards) visited in England (although relatively smaller numbers of paediatric wards led to Fisher's exact P values of 0.42 for Northern Ireland, 0.53 for Scotland, and 0.64 for Wales compared with England) (table 2). Within England, regional variation was observed in the proportion of paediatric wards visited (from a minimum of 50% in the north east to 100% in south London, Thames Valley, and Wessex, fig 2). The low proportions of paediatric wards visited in the north east (50%) and in north west London (71%) point to the need for urgent corrective action by Santa Claus.

Fig 2 Regional variations in visits by Santa Clause in England, 2015

Naughty or nice?

Based on the results of logistic regression models summarised in table 3, regional rates of school absenteeism were not statistically significantly associated with the odds of no visit by Santa Claus in either the full UK analysis or the England subanalysis, although the point estimate in the England subanalysis was substantially higher than in the UK analysis. Furthermore, we found no association between conviction rates in young people and visits from Santa Claus in the subanalysis of English regions and Wales.

Distance between hospital and North Pole

In neither the UK analysis nor England subanalysis did distance (km) of hospital to the North Pole have a statistically significant effect on whether Santa Claus would or would not visit a paediatric ward (table 3).

Table 3 — estimates linking %TIR to A1C and estimated average glucose (EAG): The averaged mapping from Beck 2019 and Vigersky 2019 shows 50% %TIR corresponds to A1C 8.1 and EAG 185 mg/dL; 70% %TIR corresponds to A1C 6.9 and EAG 151 mg/dL; and 90% %TIR corresponds to A1C 5.6 and EAG 113 mg/dL. Study-specific rows include Vigersky 2019 — 70% %TIR: A1C 6.7, EAG 147 mg/dL — and Beck 2019 — 70% %TIR: A1C 7.0, EAG 154 mg/dL. The text reinforces that "observation of 70% of time spent in the 70 to 180 mg/dL range was found to be nearly equivalent to an average A1C value of 7.0%".

### The clinical use of hemoglobin A1c [^113c9PEV]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has been accepted as an index of glycemic control since the mid-1970s and is the best marker for diabetic microvascular complications. Clinically, it is now used to assess glycemic control in people with diabetes. Assays are most reliable when certified by the National Hemoglobin Standardization Program but are subject to confounders and effect modifiers, particularly in the setting of hematologic abnormalities. Other measures of chronic glycemic control-fructosamine and 1,5-anhydroglucitol-are far less widely used. The relationship of HbA1c to average blood glucose was intensively studied recently, and it has been proposed that this conversion can be used to report an "estimated average glucose, eAG" in milligrams/deciliter or millimolar units rather than as per cent glycated hemoglobin. Finally, HbA1c has been proposed as a useful method of screening for and diagnosing diabetes.

### Translating the A1c assay into estimated average glucose values [^114gKbcS]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The A1C assay, expressed as the percent of hemoglobin that is glycated, measures chronic glycemia and is widely used to judge the adequacy of diabetes treatment and adjust therapy. Day-to-day management is guided by self-monitoring of capillary glucose concentrations (milligrams per deciliter or millimoles per liter). We sought to define the mathematical relationship between A1C and average glucose (AG) levels and determine whether A1C could be expressed and reported as AG in the same units as used in self-monitoring.

Research Design and Methods

A total of 507 subjects, including 268 patients with type 1 diabetes, 159 with type 2 diabetes, and 80 nondiabetic subjects from 10 international centers, was included in the analyses. A1C levels obtained at the end of 3 months and measured in a central laboratory were compared with the AG levels during the previous 3 months. AG was calculated by combining weighted results from at least 2 days of continuous glucose monitoring performed four times, with seven-point daily self-monitoring of capillary (fingerstick) glucose performed at least 3 days per week.

Results

Approximately 2,700 glucose values were obtained by each subject during 3 months. Linear regression analysis between the A1C and AG values provided the tightest correlations (AG(mg/dl) = 28.7 × A1C − 46.7, R² = 0.84, P < 0.0001), allowing calculation of an estimated average glucose (eAG) for A1C values. The linear regression equations did not differ significantly across subgroups based on age, sex, diabetes type, race/ethnicity, or smoking status.

Conclusions

A1C levels can be expressed as eAG for most patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

### Glycemic goals and hypoglycemia: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^116S7LcM]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Serum glycated proteins as alternatives to A1C — Fructosamine and glycated albumin are alternative measures of glycemia that are approved for clinical use for monitoring glycemic status in people with diabetes and, due to serum protein turnover, reflect glycemia over the past 2–4 weeks. However, there have been few clinical trials and the evidence base supporting their use to monitor glycemic status is much weaker than that for A1C, though in people with diabetes where A1C interpretation may be problematic or when A1C cannot be measured (e.g., homozygous hemoglobin variants), fructosamine or glycated albumin may be useful alternatives to monitor glycemic status.

### Sociodemographic factors associated with HbA1c variability in type 2 diabetes: a prospective exploratory cohort study [^115GTv3D]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2017, the worldwide estimated number of people with diabetes was 425 millions, and in the same year diabetes accounted for 10.7% of global all-cause mortality among people aged 20–79 years. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% of all cases of diabetes, and is most commonly found in older adults, although increasingly seen in children and younger adults. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by chronically elevated blood glucose levels, due to inadequate production of insulin and an inability of the body to effectively respond to insulin. Today, type 2 diabetes is a leading cause of cardiovascular disorders, blindness, end-stage renal failure, amputations and hospitalizations, as well as associated with increased risk of other disabling or deadly conditions such as cancer, chronic liver disease and cognitive decline.

HbA1c reflects the average glucose level over the past 8–12 weeks, and is commonly used both in research and in clinical settings as a measure of glycemic control. Attaining an ideal HbA1c level demonstrates control over the disease and enables prevention of its complications. Target levels for HbA1c in type 2 diabetes are individual, but a general aim stated by the National Institute for Health and Excellence is 6.5–7.0% (48–53 mmol/mol). In recent years there has been an increased focus on adverse outcomes associated with glycemic variability. Glycemic variability can be a sign of excess glycemic excursions, and, consequently, a risk of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. Greater HbA1c variability is associated with adverse outcomes in several micro- and macrovascular end-points, as well as with mortality. Long-term glycemic variability is usually based on serial measurement of HbA1c, which reveals a general pattern of glycemic control over time. Previous studies indicate that HbA1c variability could possibly be superior for predicting diabetes-related complications compared to mean HbA1c. Hence, considering HbA1c variability in clinical risk assessment may be beneficial. It has been suggested that the association between HbA1c variability and diabetic complications may be explained by confounding factors, such as poor self-management or lack of support. Recent guidelines from both the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes acknowledge the need for personalized care regarding both lifestyle advice and pharmacological treatment, recognizing that the experience of diabetes differs across roles, phase of the disease, the patient's stage in life, accumulated experience of the disease over time, and a person's cultural, political, economic and social context. Level of education reflects one aspect of an individual's socioeconomic position, and is presumed to influence access to and quality of care, diabetes-related knowledge and ability to adhere to treatment regimen by turning information into health enhancing behaviors. Spousal support may affect weight status and diabetes control, but the evidence is mixed and unclear. Sex and age are both important factors influencing health, either independently or as covariates. Excess bodyweight, as indicated by increased BMI, is an important risk factor for both mortality and numerous health issues. However, the associations between sociodemographic factors and HbA1c variability are less well explored compared to other diabetes risk factors, and not as extensively studied in longitudinal studies. Studying group differences in HbA1c variability based on these factors, may help identify patient characteristics related to long-term diabetes management, and enable a more focused approach to health care support of patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim of the present study was to examine differences in glycemic control related to sociodemographic factors. More specifically, the study aimed at exploring differences regarding baseline level HbA1c as well as HbA1c variability over 24 months, between different groups with respect to sex, level of education, civil status, age, and BMI. A further objective was to examine whether any potential effect on HbA1c variability was modified by sex.

### American Geriatrics Society identifies five things that healthcare providers and patients should question [^112nSCZM]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

American Geriatrics Society — glycemic targets in older adults with diabetes — states: "Avoid using medications to achieve hemoglobin A1c < 7.5% in most adults age 65 and older; moderate control is generally better". The rationale indicates "There is no evidence that using medications to achieve tight glycemic control in older adults with type 2 diabetes is beneficial" and that "using medications to achieve glycated hemoglobin levels less than 7% is associated with harms, including higher mortality rates". It further notes "Tight control has been consistently shown to produce higher rates of hypoglycemia in older adults". Suggested targets are specified: "Reasonable glycemic targets would be 7.0–7.5% in healthy older adults with long life expectancy, 7.5–8.0% in those with moderate comorbidity and a life expectancy < 10 years, and 8.0–9.0% in those with multiple morbidities and shorter life expectancy".

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — achieved HbA1c levels in major trials and interpretation of intensive therapy indicate that "only ACCORD and ADVANCE reached and sustained HbA1c levels between 6–7% in the intensive therapy group through the end of the study (e.g., average HbA1c 6.5%; interquartile range 6.0–6.8%)". In contrast, "The UKPDS initially lowered HbA1c below 7%, but values steadily increased to approximately 7% after 6 years and subsequently remained between 7–8% through completion". Consequently, "the results from ADVANCE and ACCORD should be weighted more heavily when interpreting the relative benefits and risks of intensive glucose lowering, if defined as HbA1c < 7%".

Key Points for Practice
- Goals of glycemic control should be individualized to each patient, after discussing harms and benefits, preferences, overall health status, treatment burden, and expense.
- An A1C target of 7% to 8% is recommended for most patients, because targets of 7% or less do not appear to result in reduced risk of mortality or macrovascular events. In a review of these guidelines, the authors found no studies indicating that A1C targets less than 6. 5% improve clinical outcomes. Moreover, using medication to achieve this level had associated harms. Guidance Statements Goals of glycemic control via medication should be individualized to each patient, after talking about benefits and harms of more vs. less control, preferences, overall health status, treatment burden, and expense. Because targets of 7% or less vs.

approximately 8% do not appear to result in reduced risk of mortality or macrovascular events, an A1C target of 7% to 8% is recommended for most patients. However, variability in A1C measurements should still be considered when making treatment decisions. Taking into account patient preference, a stricter A1C target can be considered in persons who are expected to live at least 15 more years. A lower target can be considered in patients who can achieve it with diet and lifestyle changes. Because there is no evidence that an A1C level lower than 6. 5% has clinical benefit, and evidence has shown associated harms, the medication regimen may be de-escalated in patients who achieve an A1C level lower than
6. 5%. Treatment in older persons and those with a shorter life expectancy should aim to reduce symptoms of hyperglycemia, rather than to achieve A1C targets.

In addition, because achieving certain A1C targets is associated with more harm than good, these targets are not recommended in any patient expected to live fewer than 10 years because of older age, living in a long-term care facility, or with a chronic condition. Shared decision making, based on a shared understanding of the possible risks and benefits of specific goals, should replace strict A1C targets. — Allen F. Shaughnessy, PharmD, AFP Assistant Medical Editor.
