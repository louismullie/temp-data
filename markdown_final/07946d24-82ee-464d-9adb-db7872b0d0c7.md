## Question

A 60-year-old diabetic male presents to your clinic for right ear pain. The patient reports noting worsening right ear pain for three weeks, purulent otorrhea initially which has resolved, and facial asymmetry for the past several days. He reports being poorly compliant with his diabetes medication regimen. His temperature is 100.4 deg F (38 deg C), blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical exam, the patient's right external auditory canal is noted to have granulation tissue at the bony cartilaginous junction. He is also noted to have right facial droop. Which of the following is the best next step in treatment?
A. Intravenous ciprofloxacin for 6 weeks
B. Topical polymyxin and neosporin for 14 days
C. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment for 4 weeks
D. Surgical intervention

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which single best next step to choose for a 60-year-old man with diabetes, right ear pain, purulent otorrhea, and new right facial droop, with granulation tissue at the osseocartilaginous junction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this presentation fits malignant otitis externa (necrotizing otitis externa). Then, I should verify red flags and staging implications, especially cranial nerve involvement. Next, I will compare the offered options against guideline-based care: IV antibiotics, topical therapy, hyperbaric oxygen, and surgery. Finally, I need to check the most urgent intervention and what to do immediately in the ED/clinic before definitive inpatient management begins.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis pattern. The triad of severe otalgia, granulation tissue at the osseocartilaginous junction, and diabetes is classic for malignant otitis externa, and the addition of facial nerve palsy indicates advanced disease with skull base extension, not just a routine otitis externa. This is a red flag that mandates urgent management and typically admission for systemic therapy and imaging [^114W1WdF] [^111wNmKS].

> Wait, let me verify the severity and prognostic implications of facial nerve involvement. Facial nerve palsy in MOE correlates with more aggressive disease and higher morbidity, and in several classification schemes, cranial nerve involvement moves the disease into advanced or severe categories that may influence escalation strategies; I should not minimize this finding or delay appropriate therapy [^116Dbu39] [^114W1WdF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any single option before mapping what guideline-concordant care looks like. The contemporary standard is early systemic antipseudomonal therapy plus aggressive local care, with CT imaging to define extent, and consideration of hyperbaric oxygen or surgery in select refractory or complicated cases; surgery is reserved for failure of appropriate antibiotics or specific anatomic indications, not as first-line [^111wNmKS] [^115xJLLy] [^1165oZb6].

> I will now examine Option A, IV ciprofloxacin for 6 weeks. At first glance, that seems too short for MOE, but wait, I should double-check the typical durations. While some reports cite averages near 15 weeks overall, the key point is that facial nerve palsy indicates advanced disease that warrants immediate IV therapy with pseudomonal coverage and prolonged total treatment, commonly weeks to months depending on clinical and imaging response, so choosing a long-duration IV regimen aligns with best practice even if the exact 6-week number varies by case [^1145Nidq] [^111wNmKS].

> Let me consider Option B, topical polymyxin/neomycin for 14 days. This is insufficient and inappropriate for MOE with facial palsy. Topical therapy alone is reserved for uncomplicated AOE, and guidelines explicitly call for systemic antibiotics when there is extension beyond the canal or host factors like diabetes or cranial nerve involvement, so choosing this would undertreat a potentially life-threatening skull base osteomyelitis [^115Fetqo] [^111wNmKS].

> Next, I should review Option C, hyperbaric oxygen for 4 weeks. HBOT is an adjunct, not first-line, and the Cochrane review found no randomized evidence to support routine HBOT over antibiotics. It may be considered in refractory or severe cases with tissue hypoxia, but it does not replace prompt systemic antipseudomonal therapy and is not the best next step right now [^111xpjYp] [^1165oZb6].

> I need to ensure I'm not over-calling surgery. Option D suggests surgical intervention as the next step; however, current best practice reserves surgery for nonresponders after 3–4 weeks of appropriate antibiotics, for culture-directed indications, or for complications such as abscess or refractory granulation, not as the immediate next step before IV therapy and imaging are in place; therefore, choosing surgery now would be premature [^115xJLLy] [^113bnj8L].

> Let me reconsider the hierarchy to avoid a mistake. The best next step is immediate initiation of systemic antipseudomonal therapy with admission, urgent CT of the temporal bones with contrast to delineate disease extent, and ENT consultation. Within the choices provided, the option that best maps to that standard is IV ciprofloxacin for 6 weeks, acknowledging that the duration is representative of prolonged therapy and should be individualized to clinical and imaging response, and that initial IV therapy is appropriate before stepping down to oral once stable [^111wNmKS] [^1145Nidq].

> But wait, what about cultures and diabetes optimization. I should confirm that ear drainage should be cultured before starting antibiotics when feasible, and that strict glycemic control is integral to recovery. ESR and CRP can guide response, and pain and inflammatory markers typically improve as infection control takes effect, which supports using them to monitor therapy once treatment is underway [^114W1WdF] [^111wNmKS].

> Final check: choosing IV ciprofloxacin addresses the likely pathogen (Pseudomonas), the need for systemic therapy in advanced MOE with facial palsy, and the necessity for timely, aggressive treatment to prevent intracranial complications. This is the most defensible single next step among the choices, with the understanding that care will also include imaging, local debridement, and close multidisciplinary follow-up [^111wNmKS] [^116Dbu39].

---

The best next step is **IV ciprofloxacin for 6 weeks** [^1145Nidq] because the patient has malignant otitis externa with facial nerve involvement, and pseudomonal coverage with prolonged therapy is essential [^116oXW2E]. Topical therapy alone is inadequate [^114vbcw2], and surgery is reserved for refractory cases or diagnostic uncertainty [^115xJLLy]. Hyperbaric oxygen is adjunctive and not first-line [^115tKgMV]. Immediate **ENT consultation**, imaging (CT/MRI) [^111wNmKS], and strict glycemic control are critical [^112EK59k] [^115f7AyF].

---

## Clinical diagnosis and risk factors

Malignant otitis externa is an invasive infection of the **external auditory canal and skull base**, most often in elderly diabetic men [^1118uZcV] [^112EK59k]. Classic findings include severe nocturnal otalgia, purulent otorrhea, **granulation tissue at the osseocartilaginous junction**, and cranial nerve palsies — particularly the facial nerve [^114W1WdF] [^1173pfEF]. Risk factors include **diabetes mellitus**, immunosuppression, and advanced age [^116oXW2E] [^111wNmKS].

---

## Pathophysiology and complications

MOE spreads from the external auditory canal to the temporal bone and skull base, causing **osteomyelitis** and cranial nerve involvement [^116oXW2E]. Facial nerve palsy indicates **advanced disease** and higher morbidity [^116Dbu39] [^111wNmKS]. Intracranial complications include meningitis, brain abscess, and **venous sinus thrombosis** [^111wNmKS].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Clinical examination**: Otoscopy reveals granulation tissue at the osseocartilaginous junction and edema of the external auditory canal [^114W1WdF] [^112EK59k].
- **Laboratory tests**: Elevated ESR and CRP are common; white blood cell count may be normal or mildly elevated [^114W1WdF] [^112EK59k].
- **Imaging**: CT scan is the initial modality to assess bony erosion and disease extent; MRI is superior for soft tissue and intracranial extension [^112JCJBz] [^116oXW2E].
- **Microbiology**: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common pathogen; cultures should be obtained before antibiotics [^114W1WdF] [^111wNmKS].

---

## Treatment options

### Medical management

Medical management is **first-line** therapy for MOE:

- **Systemic antibiotics**: Antipseudomonal fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin) are preferred due to efficacy, oral bioavailability, and penetration into bone and soft tissues [^1145Nidq] [^115xJLLy].
- **Duration**: Prolonged therapy (typically 6 weeks) is recommended to ensure eradication and prevent recurrence [^notfound].
- **Adjunctive measures**: Topical antiseptics, aural toilet, and strict glycemic control are essential [^111wNmKS] [^115f7AyF].

---

### Surgical management

Surgery is reserved for specific indications, including **refractory disease** despite appropriate antibiotics, diagnostic uncertainty (e.g. to exclude malignancy), or **intracranial complications** (e.g. abscess drainage) [^115xJLLy] [^115PcmEb].

---

### Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)

HBOT is an **adjunctive therapy** for refractory or severe cases, particularly with poor wound healing or tissue hypoxia. Evidence is limited and it is not first-line therapy [^111xpjYp] [^1165oZb6].

---

## Analysis of treatment options

| **Treatment option** | **Indication** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|-|-|-|-|
| IV ciprofloxacin for 6 weeks | First-line therapy for MOE with facial nerve involvement | - Effective against Pseudomonas <br/> - Good bone penetration <br/> - Oral bioavailability | - Risk of resistance <br/> - Potential adverse effects |
| Topical polymyxin and Neosporin for 14 days | Uncomplicated otitis externa | - Minimal systemic absorption <br/> - Low adverse effects | - Inadequate for MOE <br/> - Cannot address bone infection |
| Hyperbaric oxygen treatment for 4 weeks | Adjunctive therapy for refractory cases | - Improves tissue oxygenation <br/> - May enhance healing | - Limited evidence <br/> - Expensive <br/> - Not first-line |
| Surgical intervention | Refractory disease, diagnostic uncertainty, intracranial complications | - Direct source control <br/> - Diagnostic clarification | - Invasive <br/> - Potential complications <br/> - Not first-line |

---

## Recommended treatment plan

Given the patient's presentation of MOE with facial nerve involvement, the **recommended treatment plan** is:

- **Immediate initiation of IV ciprofloxacin for 6 weeks**: This provides effective antipseudomonal coverage and penetrates bone and soft tissues adequately [^1145Nidq] [^116oXW2E].
- **Adjunctive topical therapy and aural toilet**: Topical antiseptics and debridement of granulation tissue to reduce bacterial load [^115xJLLy].
- **Strict glycemic control**: Essential to optimize immune function and wound healing [^115f7AyF].
- **ENT consultation and imaging**: CT or MRI to assess disease extent and guide management [^112JCJBz].
- **Monitor for response**: Clinical improvement, normalization of ESR/CRP, and resolution of facial nerve palsy indicate treatment success [^1145Nidq].

---

## Conclusion

The best next step is **IV ciprofloxacin for 6 weeks** because it provides effective antipseudomonal coverage, penetrates bone and soft tissues, and addresses the underlying infection. Topical therapy alone is inadequate, surgery is reserved for refractory cases, and HBOT is adjunctive. Immediate ENT consultation, imaging, and strict glycemic control are essential to optimize outcomes [^111wNmKS] [^116oXW2E].

### Case report: a parotid abscess with otorrhea, drainage via the fissure of santorini [^116FjmDk]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

We report a case of a healthy 62-year-old male with no identifiable risk factors who presented with a 2-week history of progressive unilateral parotid gland enlargement and tenderness followed by subsequent otorrhea. A computed tomography scan and ultrasound confirmed a markedly enlarged posterior aspect of the parotid gland with the evidence of necrosis. The culture of aspirated fluid grew Staphylococcus aureus. Purulent fluid was then noted draining from the external auditory canal, via the fissure of Santorini. The patient was treated with antibiotics, pain management, and daily parotid massage with complete resolution of the parotitis. Acute bacterial parotitis with subsequent drainage and otorrhea through the fissures of Santorini is rare, with only a few reported cases in the literature.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^115MZnsD]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — patient-specific and anatomic modifying factors and related precautions are detailed as follows: The purpose of this statement is to identify patient-specific and anatomic factors that may alter the management of cerumen impaction to achieve safer outcomes. Medical factors that should influence treatment choice for managing cerumen impaction include coagulopathy, immunocompromised state, and previous head and neck radiation. Coagulopathies may include extrinsic or intrinsic abnormalities to clotting, and history taking should include queries for antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulant medications, hepatic or renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hemophilia; these patients should be counseled about increased risk of ear bleeding, and special care should be taken to reduce the likelihood of abrading or bruising the ear canal. Clinicians should elicit histories of conditions that may compromise immune functioning, such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, prior organ transplant, concurrent chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS, and immunomodulating drugs; such individuals may be at higher risk for postprocedure otitis externa, especially when irrigation is employed. Irrigation with tap water has been implicated as an etiologic factor in necrotizing (malignant) external otitis, immunocompromised AIDS patients have also been reported to be at risk of necrotizing otitis externa, and the pH of diabetic cerumen is significantly higher than in persons without diabetes. Clinicians who utilize irrigation in this patient population must be especially careful to minimize trauma, consider using ear drops to acidify the ear canal postirrigation, and provide close follow-up. Prior history of head and neck radiation should be elicited; targeted radiation to any site in the head and neck may deliver a radiation dose sufficient to permanently affect the external auditory canals, and radiated external auditory canals undergo histologic changes, including epithelial thinning. The resulting cerumen is drier, more tenacious cerumen/keratin debris that requires delicate debridement, injury to the ear canals may be slow to heal or difficult to heal and could lead to osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the ear canal and temporal bone, and underlying ORN may present as recurrent cerumen impaction, and so specific care must be taken at the time of treatment to determine the health of the external auditory canal after successful disimpaction. The onset of ORN of the temporal bone may range from 1 year to decades posttreatment and appears to be correlated with the radiation dose to the temporal bone itself, with radiation to the parotid gland, nasopharynx, and preauricular skin noted in 2 contemporary case series as the most common radiation targets leading to ORN of the temporal bone. Dermatologic conditions such as eczema, seborrheic dermatosis, and ectodermal dysplasia can complicate management of cerumen and can increase the frequency of cerumen impaction and the risk of otitis externa if present. Narrowing of the ear canal limits visualization, increases the likelihood of trauma, and makes both irrigation and manual instrumentation more difficult. Narrow canals can be found in otherwise normal subjects and in patients with craniofacial disorders, Down syndrome, chronic external otitis, and posttraumatic states, and stenosis may be congenital or acquired, with congenital stenosis involving the lateral portion (cartilaginous) and the medial bony ear canal.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the management of patients with common otologic pathology toward European consensus: outline of approach [^113y7PsS]. Otology & Neurotology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To achieve a European consensus about the best-evidence informed-management of patients with common otologic-related problems.

Design

Consensus process, supported by the European Academy of Otology & Neuro-Otology.

Setting

The European Academy of Otology & Neuro-Otology.

Methods

A guideline of a specific disease should include evidence-informed recommendations about questions relating to treatment, prognosis, and diagnosis. A standardized method to design guideline questions to search for evidence and to grade the quality of available evidence results in an overview of the best available literature. Experts achieve a consensus on best practice and articulate recommendations on evidence-based actions to be taken in patient care accordingly. The assets of such evidence-based consensus usually are the opinion of experts and arguments on availability, transferability, applicability, and affordability.

Discussion

The volume of new information increases at a staggering pace. As a result, there is an increasing demand for consistent systematic management of the available evidence. Systematic filtering of available evidence will help clinicians to find and apply best available and latest evidence efficiently and quickly.

Conclusion

Despite the otologic line of approach, the present article provides a step-by-step "guideline development instruction manual", which could be used within other medical specialties.

### Multicentric case series and literature review of coccidioidal otomastoiditis [^112R32bb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Case 4

In 2014, a 22-year-old Hispanic man from Bakersfield, California, in the Cocciodioides epicenter of San Joaquin Valley, who had a medical history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type 1, received a diagnosis of pulmonary and osteoarticular coccidioidomycosis but was nonadherent to therapy with fluconazole and then posaconazole (substituted because of liver injury). Peak CF titer was 1:256. After 1 year of nonadherence, he sought care for left ear pain and purulent drainage for 5 days. Symptom onset was gradual, constant, aching, and sharp, with radiation to left jaw and left eye. Left otitis externa was diagnosed and treated with oral amoxicillin and topical neomycin, polymyxin B sulfates, and hydrocortisone otic solutions. He was unavailable for follow-up for another 6 months, at which point he sought care for progressive left-sided hearing loss of 1 week's duration and diffuse pounding headache, nausea, and vomiting for 1 month. Neurologic examination suggested left conductive hearing loss. Results for other cranial nerves were unremarkable. Otoscopic examination revealed that the left tympanic membrane was erythematous and bulging with a middle ear effusion. Results of lumbar puncture were unremarkable. Coccidioides CF at this time was 1:64. CT showed complete opacification of the mastoid air cell system on the left side with fluid in the middle ear (Figure 1, panel A). MRI showed left mastoiditis with an extradural collection of fluid. The patient underwent a left myringotomy with insertion of a tympanostomy tube. Ten days postoperatively, he remained symptomatic, reporting a constant headache radiating from his left eye to the occipital area, along with light-headedness and left ear hearing loss. Repeat CT imaging 2 weeks after the myringotomy suggested persistent left otomastoiditis. MRI showed heterogenous signal in the left mastoid and middle ear and discontinuity of the roof of the left mastoid but no temporal lobe or middle cranial fossa involvement (Figure 1, panel B). Because of the lack of response to tympanostomy tube placement, a left mastoidectomy and tympanoplasty were performed. Mastoid tissue was cultured, and C. immitis grew after 28 days. The patient was hospitalized, and a 6-week course of intravenous liposomal amphotericin B monotherapy was initiated, which he continued as an outpatient. At 6-week follow-up, his hearing had gradually increased. Antifungals were changed to posaconazole (400 mg/d orally). One year later, Coccidioides CF had improved to 1:8, and the patient remained well.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^114aCnLQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) outcome assessment — STATEMENT 8: The clinician should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. Recommendation based on observational studies and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Action statement profile notes Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, Level of confidence in evidence: Medium, Policy level: Recommendation, Exceptions: None, and Intentional vagueness: Time frame of 48 to 72 hours is specified since there are no data to substantiate a more precise estimate of time to improvement. Appropriate treatment of uncomplicated AOE should be followed by symptom improvement within 48 to 72 hours, although symptom resolution may take up to 2 weeks in some cases; patient-reported ear pain generally decreases after 1 day of treatment and most pain resolves within 4 to 7 days; a Cochrane review recommended follow-up in 2 weeks if any symptoms persist, while diary data showed most patients show rapid improvement within 72 hours even if complete resolution may take a week or more.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^115Fetqo]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical practice guideline is an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. This update provides evidence-based recommendations to manage acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The variations in management of AOE and the importance of accurate diagnosis suggest a need for updating the clinical practice guideline. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is clinical resolution of AOE.

Purpose

The primary purpose of the original guideline was to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials for AOE and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed because of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. The target patient is aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE. Differential diagnosis will be discussed, but recommendations for management will be limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. This guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. This guideline is applicable in any setting in which patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed.

Action Statements

The development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^1132DX9C]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes — recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) with middle ear effusion (MEE): Clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent AOM who have unilateral or bilateral MEE at the time of assessment for tube candidacy, with a Recommendation based on randomized controlled trials with minimal limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm; the aggregate evidence quality is Grade B, based on RCTs with minor limitations, and the level of confidence in evidence is Medium. Benefits include a mean decrease of approximately 3 episodes of AOM per year, ability to treat future episodes of AOM with topical antibiotics instead of systemic antibiotics, reduced pain with future AOM episodes, and improved hearing during AOM episodes, while risks are described as risks from anesthesia, sequelae of the indwelling tympanostomy tubes (otorrhea, granulation tissue, obstruction), complications after tube extrusion (myringosclerosis, retraction pocket, persistent perforation), tube medialization, procedural anxiety and discomfort, and direct procedural costs; overall, the benefit–harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. The method of confirming the presence of MEE should be based on clinician experience and may include tympanometry, simple otoscopy, and/or pneumatic otoscopy, and there is a substantial role for shared decision making regarding the decision to proceed with or decline tympanostomy tube insertion. Bilateral insertion of tympanostomy tubes is recommended even if only unilateral effusion is present, because more than 70% of children have similar eustachian tube function on the both sides.

### External and middle ear diseases: radiological diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms [^117TcAWZ]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Pathology of the external and middle ear is the most frequent reason to prescribe antibiotics and perform surgery in children and young adults. In the majority of cases imaging studies are not performed; the need for imaging comes when complications are suspected or when treatment is not effective. This paper discusses indications for temporal bone imaging studies and presents the most frequent pathological conditions, together with differential diagnosis, clinical symptoms and methods of treatment.

Methods and Results

This pictorial review describes major external and middle ear diseases, with special regard to clinical findings and appropriate reporting.

Conclusions

Apprehension of the complete clinical picture, together with imaging clues, narrows differential diagnosis and helps avoid mistakes. Evaluation of temporal bone pathologies requires close cooperation between the clinician and radiologist.

### Sudden hearing loss [^114EVcZf]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a medical emergency in search of an appropriate treatment. Almost all aspects of this disease process are disputed in the literature. The natural course of the disease process has not been well defined, although spontaneous recovery in a percentage of patients appears well accepted. Little scientific data exist to develop an evidence-based treatment protocol. The more common elements of treatment in the United States include oral steroid therapy, transtympanic steroid therapy, and potentially oral antiviral therapy. Other therapies are used with great frequency, and their potential should not be discounted.

### Cotton bud in external ear canal causing necrotising otitis externa and subdural abscess [^114FDzN5]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Necrotising otitis externa (NOE) is an infection originating in the soft tissues of the external auditory canal (EAC) spreading to the surrounding bone and rarely causing intracranial complications. It is usually caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and has historically occurred in elderly patients with diabetes or immunodeficiency. EAC foreign body is a risk factor for otitis externa but has not been described in NOE. A healthy 31-year-old man presented with new-onset seizures and worsening left-sided otalgia and otorrhoea. Brain imaging revealed left temporal subdural abscesses superior to the petrous bone. A retained cotton bud was identified in the left EAC, along with osseocartilaginous junction and mastoid granulation tissue. The foreign body was removed; a cortical mastoidectomy performed and intravenous antibiotic administered. At 10 weeks, the patient remained well, with no neurological deficit and no residual ear symptoms, and CT demonstrated complete resolution of the intracranial abscesses.

### Bilateral external ear canal duplication: a case report [^117K2xWE]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Herein described is an eight-year-old female patient presenting with bilateral external ear canal duplication and a history of recurrent postauricular abscesses, otorrhea, and moderate left-sided conductive hearing loss. Previous incision and drainage of the postauricular abscesses yielded little long-term success. Medical history was otherwise unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a cystic mass in the right ear and postauricular fibrosis, likely a result of previous surgical interventions. An audiogram revealed asymmetric hearing function, with mild-to-moderate conductive hearing loss in the left ear contrasting normal hearing in the right ear, while tympanometry confirmed an intact right tympanic membrane but was precluded on the left due to purulent otorrhea. A head CT scan revealed postauricular soft tissue swelling and well-pneumatized mastoid air cells. Both ears were explored intraoperatively via postauricular incisions. Surgical excision included removal of a cyst, cartilaginous remnants, and fibrotic tissue. The patient was followed up to assess for postsurgical complications. The surgical site healed uneventfully; no new symptoms or recurrences of past symptoms of otorrhea, cyst formation, or abscesses had developed within the twelve weeks post-surgery. Although external ear canal duplications are rare, it is imperative that early, accurate diagnoses be made to ensure optimal patient outcomes.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^1114su9G]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa guideline — recommendation strength categories and clinician implications are defined as follows: A strong recommendation means the benefits clearly exceed the harms and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present; a recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms but the quality of evidence is not as strong and clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences; an option means that either the quality of evidence is suspect or that well-done studies show little clear advantage to one approach versus another and clinicians should be flexible in their decision making with patient preference having a substantial influencing role; and no recommendation means there is both a lack of pertinent evidence and an unclear balance between benefits and harms and clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making while remaining alert to new published evidence, with patient preference having a substantial influencing role.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^114XRv3r]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Radiotherapy-related factors in AOE: Radiotherapy can damage the external ear by causing acute and late skin reactions involving the pinna, external canal, and periauricular region, with acute events including erythema, desquamation, or ulceration of the auricle and ear canal leading to pain and otorrhea and late changes including atrophy, necrosis or ulceration, external otitis, and external canal stenosis. Damage to the epithelium of sebaceous and apocrine glands can diminish cerumen production, and management of AOE in patients after radiotherapy may require systemic antimicrobials.

### Necrotizing (malignant) external otitis [^114vbcw2]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Necrotizing (malignant) external otitis, an infection involving the temporal and adjacent bones, is a relatively rare complication of external otitis. It occurs primarily in immunocompromised persons, especially older persons with diabetes mellitus, and is often initiated by self-inflicted or iatrogenic trauma to the external auditory canal. The most frequent pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Patients with necrotizing external otitis complain of severe otalgia that worsens at night, and otorrhea. Clinical findings include granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, especially at the bone-cartilage junction. Facial and other cranial nerve palsies indicate a poor prognosis; intracranial complications are the most frequent cause of death. Diagnosis requires culture of ear secretions and pathologic examination of granulation tissue from the infection site. Imaging studies may include computed tomographic scanning, technetium Tc 99m medronate bone scanning, and gallium citrate Ga 67 scintigraphy. Treatment includes correction of immunosuppression (when possible), local treatment of the auditory canal, long-term systemic antibiotic therapy and, in selected patients, surgery. Family physicians and others who provide medical care for immunocompromised patients should be alert to the possibility of necrotizing external otitis in patients who complain of otalgia, particularly if they have diabetes mellitus and external otitis that has been refractory to standard therapy. Susceptible patients should be educated to avoid manipulation of the ear canal (i.e., they should not use cotton swabs to clean their ears) and to minimize exposure of the ear canal to water with a high chloride concentration. Appropriate patients should be referred to an otolaryngologist.

### Hyperbaric oxygen as an adjuvant treatment for malignant otitis externa [^111xpjYp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Malignant, or necrotising, otitis externa is a potentially fatal infection of the external ear canal and surrounding soft tissue and bone. It may be complicated by involvement of cranial nerves, principally the facial nerves and the contents of the jugular foramen. It is an uncommon condition mainly found in the elderly or in diabetics.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen treatment for malignant otitis externa.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 4 April 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, involving adults, undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy in malignant otitis externa.

Data Collection and Analysis

No identified articles described randomised controlled trials of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of malignant otitis externa.

Main Results

Due to the lack of data we could present no results.

Authors' Conclusions

No clear evidence exists to demonstrate the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy when compared to treatment with antibiotics and/or surgery. We found no data to compare rates of complication between the different treatment modalities. Further research is required.

### Pathogenesis and clinical… [^112EK59k]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Necrotizing external otitis is an infection of otologic origin that has potentially life-threatening complications. It is considered a complication of external otitis 3 and occurs primarily in older persons who have diabetes mellitus or another condition that compromises the immune system. Family physicians must be able to recognize this infection, initiate treatment, and refer appropriate patients to an otolaryngologist. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is not a normal inhabitant of the auditory canal. 4 Other possible pathogens include Staphylococcus epidermidis, 5 gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. Patients with external otitis complain of otalgia and sensitivity to auricular movement. Otorrhea may be present, and obliteration of the external auditory canal by edema and secretions may cause hearing loss or a sensation of fullness in the ear.

5, 6 Although necrotizing external otitis can occur in immunocompetent persons, 7 it typically develops in persons with diabetes mellitus or another condition that compromises the immune system, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 8 malignancy, or chemotherapy. 9 In diabetes mellitus, poor vascular supply resulting from microvascular disease is aggravated by pseudomonal vasculitis, which further restricts tissue perfusion. Diabetes mellitus is also associated with impaired polymorphonuclear cell function and a higher pH of cerumen in the aural canal. These factors, along with the sensitivity of P. aeruginosa to low pH, further restrict bodily defenses against infection. LABORATORY TESTS Mandatory laboratory tests include an erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white and red blood cell counts, glucose and creatinine levels, and culture of ear secretions. The ESR is typically elevated in necrotizing external otitis; therefore, it is a useful indicator of treatment response.

Before topical or systemic antibiotic therapy is started, ear secretions should be cultured, because susceptibility patterns may change after the initiation of treatment. Treatment Treatment of necrotizing external otitis includes correction of immunosuppression, local treatment of the auditory canal, long-term systemic antibiotic therapy and, in selected patients, surgery. Strict control of diabetes mellitus is mandatory, although it can be difficult to achieve during the acute illness. Other immunosuppressive states and comorbid conditions also must be aggressively managed.

### Necrotizing otitis externa: a systematic review [^117VX4vw]. Otology & Neurotology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To carry out a systematic review of scientific evidence available about necrotizing otitis externa, emphasizing epidemiologic data, diagnosis criteria, treatment protocols, follow-up criteria, prognosis factors, and chronologic evolution.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for publications in English and French languages, between 1968 and October 1, 2011.

Study Selection

We included publications of all types including at least 6 cases. We excluded publications focused on cranial base osteomyelitis not originating from the external ear and publications limited to a specific population.

Data Extraction

We assessed publication quality according to international guidelines.

Data Synthesis

For each publication, data were entered in a spreadsheet software for analysis. We excluded individual data already published in other studies or reviews.

Conclusion

Our review revealed the absence of strong scientific evidence regarding diagnosis criteria, treatment protocols and follow-up criteria. This implies the use of highly empirical indexes of suspicion in clinical practice. Our review confirmed the existence of a typical but not exclusive population at risk (aged, male, and diabetic patient) and also revealed major issues: lack of primary prevention in population at risk, delays before referral and management, bacteriologic issues caused by antibiotic misuse (agent identification problems, rise of resistant strains), persistence of recurrent cases. A better diffusion of medical information should help improve the management of this severe disease.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^114CKcpD]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — definitions and pathophysiology specify that cerumen is defined as a mixture of secretions (sebum with secretions from modified apocrine sweat glands) and sloughed epithelial cells and is a normal substance in the external auditory canal, forming when glandular secretions from the outer two-thirds of the ear canal mix with exfoliated squamous epithelium and normally migrating out via a self-cleaning mechanism assisted by jaw movement. For this guideline, cerumen impaction is an accumulation of cerumen that causes symptoms or prevents a needed assessment of the ear canal, tympanic membrane, or audiovestibular system or both; although "impaction" usually implies cerumen is lodged, wedged, or firmly packed, the definition does not require a complete obstruction and implies the cerumen is associated with symptoms or prevents a necessary ear examination. The term is defined pragmatically to designate cerumen that requires management, whereas some patients have nonimpacted, "asymptomatic" cerumen that does not cause symptoms or prevent assessment, and asymptomatic cerumen does not require active management. Anatomically, cerumen is formed in the outer two-thirds (cartilaginous portion) of the ear canal, not the inner third (bony portion) that ends at the eardrum, and impacted cerumen can completely obstruct the ear canal.

### External auditory canal sebaceous carcinoma [^1136B9qG]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

The incidence of sebaceous carcinoma (SC) in the outer one-third of the external auditory canal is considered extremely rare, and only eight case reports have been published. We present a case of a male patient in his late 70s known case of hypertension on indapamide. His medical history included a postspinal tumour that had been treated with surgery and radiation more than 40 years ago and current complaints of right ear pain and purulent discharge. A right ear soft granular tissue mass was found. Complete debulking of the right ear mass was done in conjunction with middle ear exploration, moderately differentiated SC diagnosis was made based on the histopathological analysis. The patient was free of recurrence but then died of an unrelated pulmonary infection. SC should be suspected in elderly patients who present with long-term complaints of a mass with or without otalgia, and these patients should be examined for the presence of such tumours especially if they report a history of radiation. Additionally, more research is warranted to investigate the association of diuretics with SC.

### Malignant otitis externa [^113WpnrZ]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Malignant external otitis is a severe infection of the external auditory canal and skull base, which most often affects elderly patients with diabetes mellitus. This disease is still a serious disease associated with cranial nerve complications and high morbidity-mortality rate. Malignant otitis externa requires urgent diagnosis and treatment. The most effective treatment is to control the diabetes and to fight infection with the proper antibiotic and debridement necrotic tissue; sometimes, aggressive surgical management is done. We present our 5-year institutional experience in the management of this disease. The aim of this study was to present our experience with the management of malignant otitis externa.

Methods

All patients' records with malignant otitis externa during the last 5 years (2007–2012) were retrieved and reviewed. Diabetes mellitus profile, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ear swab for culture and sensitivity, computed tomography, and scintigraphy using technetium 99 and gallium 67 were investigated for all patients.

Results

During the last 5 years (2007–2012), 10 patients with the diagnosis of malignant otitis externa were admitted to our clinic for investigation and treatment. There were 7 men and 3 women, all between 64 and 83 years of age, with severe persistent otalgia, purulent otorrhea, granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, and diffuse external otitis, and there were 4 patients with facial nerve palsy. Nine patients were confirmed to have a diabetes, and 4 of these 9 cases just had chronic renal failure and underwent dialysis; the remainder 1 case had no diabetes mellitus, but with chronic renal failure on dialysis. Ear swabs for culture and sensitivity usually revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Local debridement and local and systemic antibiotic treatment were sufficient to control the disease. Facial nerve decompression was done in facial paralysis. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was performed in facial nervy palsy cases.

Conclusions

Malignant otitis externa is still a serious disease associated with cranial nerve complications and high morbidity-mortality rate. The most effective treatment is to control the diabetes and to fight infection with the proper antibiotic, debridement necrotic tissue, and sometimes aggressive surgical management. Monitoring of therapy response is done through normalization of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, control of diabetes mellitus, and improvement of computed tomography and radioisotope scanning.

Necrotizing (malignant) otitis externa — epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment: Necrotizing (malignant) otitis externa is an aggressive infection that predominantly affects elderly, diabetic, or immunocompromised patients, and P aeruginosa is isolated from exudate in the ear canal in more than 90% of cases. A clinical diagnosis can be confirmed with a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate plus an abnormal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan, with other imaging modalities including gallium scan, indium-labeled leukocyte scan, technetium bone scan, and single-photon emission tomograph. Treatment includes surgical debridement and systemic antibiotics adequate to cover pseudomonal and staphylococcal infection, including methicillin-resistant S aureus, and biopsy may be necessary to detect neoplasia if the diagnosis is uncertain or response to therapy is delayed.

### Malignant external otitis: what the diabetes specialist should know – A narrative review [^1145Nidq]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Several years ago, before the introduction of antipseudomonal antibiotics in the treatment of MEO, surgery was considered the main treatment modality with a mortality of 67%. This has entirely changed, however, since the introduction of antibiotics, while the role of surgery remains controversial.

It is very important to diagnose the disease in the early stages, because it progresses and spreads over time, greatly affecting the skull base with high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, family physicians treating patients with external otitis should be suspicious of MEO when nocturnal pain and symptoms persist despite treatment with antibiotics and when granulation tissue of the external auditory meatus is present. A bacterial culture should be obtained before prescription of antibiotic agents, and the patient should be referred to an ENT surgeon if the symptomatology persists for more than a week.

Currently, the standard of care includes antibiotics either at home or during hospitalization in more severe cases. Usually topical and systemic fluoroquinolones are administered. Ciprofloxacin has been widely used during the last years because of its antipseudomonal activity, but patients who present ciprofloxacin resistance are increasingly common. In such cases an antibiogram should provide answers, and it is not rare to combine an aminoglycoside with a semisynthetic penicillin against multidrug-resistant organisms.

Duration of antibiotic administration is not clearly defined in the literature because of the different factors affecting the disease. It can vary from 4 to 59 weeks with an average of 15 weeks. Gallium scan has been traditionally considered the imaging of choice for follow-up of MEO, and it has been proposed that antibiotics should be discontinued about 4 weeks after a negative scan. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is usually used for follow-up of the disease. Its normalization usually indicates resolution of MEO. Normalization of nocturnal ear pain appears to be a reliable indicator of resolution, too.

### Acute otitis externa: rapid evidence review [^113JAUMB]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute otitis externa:

- **Definition**: Acute otitis externa is defined as an infection of the cutis and subcutis of the external auditory canal, possibly involving the tympanic membrane and pinna as well.
- **Pathophysiology**: More than 90% of acute otitis externa cases are caused by bacteria, most commonly P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Polymicrobial infection is common. Fungi are a rare cause of acute otitis externa.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of acute otitis externa in the US is estimated at 810 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: The characteristic symptom of acute otitis externa is severe pain, which is typically worsened by pressure on the tragus or tension on the pinna. Other symptoms include otorrhea, itch, erythema, and swelling of the ear canal, potentially leading to conductive hearing loss. Inadequately treated acute otitis externa may lead to chronic otitis externa.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Early diagnosis and rapid initiation of a 4- to 6-week course of antibiotics help lower the morbidity and mortality, but recurrence is common.

### A case of direct intracranial extension of tuberculous otitis media [^113ype4W]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

We describe a very rare case of tuberculous otitis media (TOM) with direct intracranial extension. The patient was a 55-year-old man who presented to our ENT clinic for evaluation of severe headaches and right-sided otorrhea. A biopsy of granulation tissue obtained from the right external auditory canal demonstrated chronic inflammation that was suggestive of mycobacterial infection. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain indicated intracranial extension of TOM through a destroyed tegmen mastoideum. After 2 months of antituberculous medication, the headaches and otorrhea were controlled, and the swelling in the external ear canal subsided greatly. Rarely does TOM spread intracranially. In most such cases, intracranial extension of tuberculosis occurs as the result of hematogenous or lymphogenous spread. In rare cases, direct spread through destroyed bone can occur, as it did in our patient.

### Gradenigo's syndrome [^115AVFho]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The syndrome of constant otorrhea, headache, and diplopia, which is attributed to inflammation of the petrous apex, is known as Gradenigo's syndrome. It is often the result of chronic otitis media with long-standing purulent otorrhea. It has traditionally been treated surgically, but recent advances in imaging, allied with improved antibiotic treatment, have allowed for consideration of non-surgical management of these cases. A 60-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with 7 days of right-sided headache, facial pain, and diplopia. She awoke with the headache and facial pain 7 days earlier. She was without any preceding infectious symptoms including ear pain, sinus congestion, sore throat, and cough, and she denied fevers and chills. Examination demonstrated a right eye lateral gaze palsy and reproducible diplopia. Computed tomography studies demonstrated the possibility of fluid in the petrous apex of the temporal bone. A follow-up magnetic resonance imaging study confirmed a moderate amount of fluid in the right petrous apex consistent with Gradenigo's syndrome. Imaging with computed tomography and magnetic resonance is an important tool in the evaluation of petrous apex lesions. Gradenigo's syndrome is a rare condition that does not always present with the classical triad of otorrhea, headache, and diplopia. Appropriate management requires antibiotic treatment and possible surgical intervention.

Necrotizing external otitis

Definition

Infection involving primarily bony and cartilaginous external auditory canal and adjacent structures, being a relatively rare complication of external otitis. It occurs usually in immunocompromised persons, especially elderly patients with diabetes mellitus, and is often initiated by self-inflicted or iatrogenic trauma to the external auditory canal.

Symptoms

Clinically, patients complain of severe otalgia that worsens at night, and otorrhea. Otoscopic findings include granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, particularly at the bony-cartilaginous junction. On audiology there is conductive hearing loss.

Preferable imaging methods

Imaging modalities include CT and MRI. While CT scanning allows to determine the location and extent of disease, MRI is the method of choice in determining intracranial extension. Since malignant external otitis has potentially life-threatening complications, imaging studies are strongly advised.

Clinically relevant imaging findings

Thickened mucosa of the external auditory canal and auricle, enhancing after contrast medium administration (Fig. 4), together with destructive, osteomyelitis appearance of the tympanic and mastoid bone (Fig. 5), strongly suggest malignant external otitis. Subtle cortical erosions visible on CT are usually an early sign of evolving osteomyelitis, as well as infiltration of the temporomandibular fat pad. Meningeal enhancement, visible on MRI informs about intracranial extension. Focal areas of rim-enhancing fluid visible in adjacent soft tissues are consistent with abscesses. Absolutely critical is posteromedial extension to the jugular foramen or carotid space.

Malignant external otitis. a Axial contrast enhanced CT scan shows thickening and heterogenous contrast enhancement of the soft tissue around auricle and in masticator space (arrow). b In the bone window, subtle bone erosion is visible (arrow) and mastoid air cells are filled with fluid

Fig. 5
Malignant external otitis. Axial CT scan in bone window demonstrates destruction of mastoid segment of petrous bone. There were also subtle cortical destructions visible in tympanic bone

Differential diagnosis

Includes EAC cholesteatoma, post-inflammatory medial canal fibrosis, keratosis obturans and EAC squamous cell cancer.

Note: it may be very difficult to differentiate between EAC cholesteatoma and malignant external otitis, because of the same pattern of bony invasion and soft tissue mass. Attention should be paid to clinical history.

Treatment options

Surgical debridement of visible granulation plus systemic antibiotic therapy. Drainage of abscesses.

### Isolated temporomandibular joint involvement in a rare case of malignant otitis externa [^1143sijH]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Malignant otitis externa (MOE) is a potentially life-threatening infection of the external auditory canal that predominantly affects elderly, diabetic, or immunocompromised patients. Although the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is anatomically close to the external auditory canal, its involvement is rare.

Case Presentation

The authors present a 69-year-old male with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and stage 3 chronic kidney disease who was admitted to ENT clinic with persistent ear pain and otorrhea unresponsive to prior treatments. Ear swab cultures revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Despite prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy and hyperbaric oxygen treatment, the patient experienced recurrence 3 times and imaging revealed osteomyelitis of the TMJ. The patient improved after a further course of intravenous meropenem and hyperbaric oxygen therapy over 2 months.

Conclusion

MOE is a challenging, recurrent infection requiring early diagnosis and a multidisciplinary approach. Although TMJ involvement is rare, it should be considered in patients presenting with trismus and preauricular swelling. Imaging modalities, ear swab cultures with antibiogram-guided antibiotic therapy, and hyperbaric oxygen treatment may improve therapeutic outcomes.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^114aMwxC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — initial management and therapy selection begins with patients age 2 y or older with diffuse AOE, for whom clinicians prescribe analgesics based on pain severity. If there is extension outside the ear canal or host factors requiring systemic therapy, prescribe systemic antimicrobial active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, with or without topical therapy, plus other management based on underlying condition; factors requiring systemic therapy include diabetes, immune deficiency, or inability to effectively deliver topical therapy despite aural toilet. If no such extension or factors, assess for a perforated tympanic membrane (known or suspected) or tympanostomy tube; if present, prescribe topical therapy with a non-ototoxic preparation, and if absent, prescribe topical therapy based on benefits, cost, compliance, preference. If the ear canal is obstructed, perform aural toilet to remove obstructing debris and place a wick if edema prevents drug delivery; if not obstructed, educate the patient or caregiver on how to administer topical drops.

### Surgical management of chronic otitis media: beyond tympanotomy tubes [^113N8BUY]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic ear disease encompasses a wide range of clinical entities amenable to medical and surgical intervention. The otolaryngologist must always consider the goals of surgery — first and foremost to achieve a safe ear. The least invasive procedure capable of eradicating disease is generally chosen. During surgery, a delicate balance has to exist between the careful preservation of function and the aggressive prevention of potentially recurrent disease. Postoperatively, thorough follow-up and good judgment are paramount in avoiding complications and preventing unnecessary additional surgical procedures.

### Malignant external otitis: what the diabetes specialist should know – A narrative review [^115xJLLy]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Several surgical operations have been described in this patient category. Local debridement of the external ear canal is still largely carried out and can be accompanied by deep tissue biopsy. Other procedures, which conducted are currently under certain circumstances, are facial nerve decompression, canal wall-up or canal wall-down mastoidectomy and petrosectomy. The selection of the suitable surgical modality is determined mostly by the clinical and radiographic findings and the response to antibiotics.

On one hand, surgery can help reduce topical infective load, debride necrotic tissue and facilitate healthy tissue formation with better vascularization. On the other hand, however, it is believed to provoke disease progression through fascial and vascular planes; thus, open surgery, such as decompression in cases of facial nerve paralysis, should be avoided. Indeed, the role of surgical treatment of MEO has been revised and is no longer considered vital.

According to a recent review, antibiotics have proven to be the gold standard for MEO patients, while the role of extensive surgical treatment has significantly diminished during the last years. Antipseudomonal drugs are commonly implemented, with an increase in the use of ceftazidime, but a decrease of ciprofloxacin. Nevertheless, ciprofloxacin remains the most widely used antibiotic, with ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem following. Although MEO has been better described and understood, a significantly diminished cure rate has been observed since 2009, while disease-specific mortality has not changed.

According to Peled et al. surgery should be considered in certain conditions. Non-responsiveness to long-term antibiotic use (at least 3–4 weeks) in cases of resistant or undiagnosed bacteria in cultures, lack of proper antibiotic agents against specific microorganisms or diabetic microangiopathy is the main indication for surgery. Clinical findings along with erythrocyte sedimentation rate and CRP should be considered to assess unresponsiveness to treatment. Surgical treatment is also indicated when aggressive or severe disease, as defined by the above-mentioned stratification systems, is present. Additionally, sterile deep tissue cultures combined with poor response to conservative treatment could be a relative indication for surgery.

They also increase time to clinical cure and do not improve outcomes compared with a topical agent alone in uncomplicated otitis externa. 1, 6, 16, 22 Systemic antibiotics should be used only when the infection has spread beyond the ear canal, or when there is uncontrolled diabetes, immunocompromise, a history of local radiotherapy, or an inability to deliver topical antibiotics. 4, 14, 16. 12 Oral analgesics are the preferred treatment. First-line analgesics include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. When ongoing frequent dosing is required to control pain, medications should be administered on a scheduled rather than as-needed basis. Opioid combination pills may be used when symptom severity warrants.

Benzocaine otic preparations may compromise the effectiveness of otic antibiotic drops by limiting contact between the drop and the ear canal. The lack of published data supporting the effectiveness of topical benzocaine preparations in otitis externa limits the role of such treatments. CHRONIC OTITIS EXTERNA The treatment of chronic otitis externa depends on the underlying causes. Because most cases are caused by allergies or inflammatory dermatologic conditions, treatment includes the removal of offending agents and the use of topical or systemic corticosteroids. Chronic or intermittent otorrhea over weeks to months, particularly with an open tympanic membrane, suggests the presence of chronic suppurative otitis media. Initial treatment efforts are similar to those for acute otitis media. With control of the symptoms of otitis externa, attention can shift to the management of chronic suppurative otitis media.

Follow-up and Referral Most patients will experience considerable improvement in symptoms after one day of treatment. If there is no improvement within 48 to 72 hours, physicians should reevaluate for treatment adherence, misdiagnosis., sensitivity to ear drops, or continued canal patency. The physician should consider culturing material from the canal to identify fungal and antibiotic-resistant pathogens if the patient does not improve after initial treatment efforts or has one or more predisposing risk factors, or if there is suspicion that the infection has extended beyond the external auditory canal. There is a lack of data regarding optimal length of treatment; as a general rule, antimicrobial otics should be administered for seven to 10 days, although in some cases complete resolution of symptoms may take up to four weeks. 4, 15.

### External auditory canal sebaceous carcinoma [^116ZXdeq]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Case presentation

A male patient in his late 70s who was a known case of hypertension and controlled with indapamide was seen at our facility. His medical history included a postspinal tumour that had been treated with surgery and radiation more than 40 years ago and had a residual left-sided hemiplegia. He presented to the otolaryngology clinic at Al-Hada Armed Forces Hospital having right ear pain and purulent discharge. His pain had started 6 months before presenting to the clinic and was constant and progressive since then. The pain was associated with a bilateral decrease in hearing for a long time. Local right ear examination revealed a right ear soft granular tissue mass occupying the right EAC mainly in the posterior wall of the canal with bleeding on touch. The right tympanic membrane could not be visualised. The first clinical impression was otitis externa after which a culture was taken from the discharge. The patient was managed with betamethasone and fucidin and given an appointment to assess the response to local medications. By the time of the follow-up appointment, the culture showed no growth; however, the patient did not improve, and right ear otalgia and the purulent discharge had increased in severity. An examination revealed an oedematous canal with pus and a non-visible tympanic membrane.

### Malignant otitis externa [^115tKgMV]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Malignant otitis externa is an invasive, potentially life-threatening infection of the external ear and skull base that requires urgent diagnosis and treatment. It affects immunocompromised individuals, particularly those who have diabetes. The most common causative agent remains Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Definitive diagnosis is frequently elusive, requiring a high index of suspicion, various laboratory and imaging modalities, and histologic exclusion of malignancy. Long-term oral antipseudomonal agents have proven effective; however, pseudomonal antibiotic resistance patterns have emerged and therefore other bacterial and fungal causative agents must be considered. Adjunctive therapies, such as aggressive debridement and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, are reserved for extensive or unresponsive cases.

### Benign necrotizing otitis externa [^112a1m48]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Benign necrotizing otitis externa (BNOE) is a rare condition of the external acoustic meatus characterized by ulceration of the floor of the deep meatus overlying an area of bony necrosis. Recognition of this condition as different from malignant necrotizing otitis externa (MNOE) and carcinoma of the external ear is important because its treatment is very different. The best choice of treatment for BNOE is not clear because both long-term medical therapy and surgery have been advocated as first-line treatments. We describe a case involving a 50-year-old man and present what we believe to be the first published photographs of the surgical management of BNOE.

### Malignant external otitis: what the diabetes specialist should know – A narrative review [^115EqgZZ]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

MEO is an aggressive type of external otitis leading to osteomyelitis of the skull base bone. The usual microorganism involved is Pseudomonas species, and it usually affects individuals with diabetes mellitus. Treatment of the disease has changed over the years, today following conservative treatment modalities with antibiotics and conducting surgery under special circumstances. MEO is a rare but fatal disease, and the specialists involved in its diagnosis and treatment, namely ENT surgeons and diabetes specialists, should be aware of it.

### A case of atypical skull base osteomyelitis secondary to otitis media due to delayed diagnosis [^113GEc7Z]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Skull base osteomyelitis that is secondary to otitis media is extremely rare in the modern antibiotic era. The authors present an 84-year-old male with atypical skull base osteomyelitis that developed from otitis media during the COVID-19 pandemic due to delayed diagnosis and partial treatment which is blamed for development of skull base osteomyelitis. The atypical presentations of skull base osteomyelitis pose a diagnostic challenge. This case highlights that even otitis media is a potentially fatal infection in older patients with diabetes. Early diagnosis and aggressive management of skull base osteomyelitis are of upmost importance and will ensure a more favorable prognosis.

### Malignant external otitis: what the diabetes specialist should know – A narrative review [^117VhGKD]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Malignant external otitis (MEO) is a special type of external otitis associated with extensive inflammation and osteomyelitis. It is believed to originate from the external auditory meatus and advance regionally to the soft tissues and the bone, eventually involving the skull base. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and diabetes mellitus are factors commonly involved in the pathogenesis of MEO. Although its treatment has changed considerably during the last decades, morbidity and mortality of the disease remain high. Our aim was to review basic aspects of MEO, a disease unknown until 1968, which attracts great interest among Ears, Nose and Throat (ENT), diabetes and infectious diseases specialists.

Methods and Results

In this narrative review we mainly include relevant papers written in English or with an English abstract. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar, using the keywords malignant external otitis, malignant otitis externa, necrotizing external otitis, skull base osteomyelitis, diabetes mellitus and surgery up to July 2022. Some of the most recent articles, with specific references to earlier articles and a book reference regarding the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of MEO and its relationship to diabetes mellitus, were included.

Conclusion

MEO is not an uncommon disease and is principally treated by ENT surgeons. Nevertheless, diabetes specialists should be aware of the disease presentation and management, since they will often encounter patients with undiagnosed MEO or will need to manage glucose levels in patients hospitalized with the disease.

Diabetes and MEO

As already mentioned, patients with diabetes are at risk of MEO. This specific group presents microangiopathic changes in the external auditory meatus and hindering of the white blood cell chemotaxis, which leads to vulnerability to infections. Specifically, in a study by Guerrero-Espejo et al. 74.6% of patients with MEO had diabetes, while the disease predominantly affected patients > 84 years of age. In a population-based case control study, patients with MEO had a prevalence of diabetes mellitus of 54.8% and an adjusted odds ratio of diabetes for patients with MEO versus controls of 10.07 (95% CI). In an 11-year analysis of 8300 patients in the US, 55.1% had concomitant diabetes mellitus, while interestingly elderly patients, who are considered the main risk group with diabetes, constituted only 22.7% of cases.

Hyperglycemia and glucose variability in hospitalized patients with and without diabetes are linked to a notable increase in morbidity, mortality and health-care costs. Insulin therapy is recommended as the cornerstone of inpatient pharmacological treatment of MEO. Most clinical guidelines recommend stopping oral antidiabetic drugs during hospitalization. However, continuation of oral glucose-lowering medications is applied in some hospitalized patients in different countries. This is based on a variety of clinical trials that suggest that non-insulin antidiabetic agents, alone or in combination with basal insulin, can be used to achieve efficient glycemic control in selected populations. In stable patients who are adequately controlled on their outpatient regimen and are able to eat, oral agents may be continued.

A plethora of treatment options for diabetes exist. Modifications to diet or medication regimens may be used to improve high blood glucose level. Basal insulin or a basal plus bolus insulin correction regimen is the preferred treatment for noncritically ill hospitalized patients with inadequate oral intake. An insulin regimen including basal, prandial and correction components is the preferred choice for patients with sufficient nutritional intake. Insulin therapy should be initiated for the treatment of persistent hyperglycemia at the level of ≥ 180 mg/dl (10.0 mmol/l, confirmed on two occasions), targeting a glucose range of 140–180 mg/dl (7.8–10.0 mmol/l) for most critically ill and hospitalized patients. In the critical care setting, continuous intravenous insulin infusion is the best option for adequate glycemic control. Before intensive care unit discharge, stable patients can be transitioned to subcutaneous insulin regimens.

### External and middle ear diseases: radiological diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms [^117Gbrwm]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Many diseases of the external and middle ear are difficult to recognize and evaluate based on radiological images only, without knowledge concerning clinical symptoms and otoscopy findings. Apprehension of the clinical picture facilitates radiological investigation, substantially narrows differential diagnosis and helps avoid mistakes.

Many pathological conditions of the external and middle ear do not require diagnostic imaging; the need for imaging comes when complications are suspected or treatment is not effective. Evaluation of such cases requires close cooperation between the clinician and radiologist.

When malignancy is suspected or surgery is the treatment option, radiological report should include practical information necessary for the surgeon; this can be achieved by using international grading systems or classifications.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^113j2WXq]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) management terminology — Key terms are defined for consistent use: "Otitis externa — an infection of the external auditory canal", "Tympanometry — measuring acoustic immittance (transfer of acoustic energy) of the ear as a function of ear canal air pressure", and "Number needed to treat (NNT) — the number of patients who need to be treated to prevent 1 additional bad outcome". Initial antibiotic therapy is defined as "treatment of AOM with antibiotics that are prescribed at the time of diagnosis with the intent of starting antibiotic therapy as soon as possible after the encounter", whereas initial observation is "initial management of AOM limited to symptomatic relief, with commencement of antibiotic therapy only if the child's condition worsens at any time or does not show clinical improvement within 48 to 72 hours of diagnosis; a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and initiation of antibiotics if the child fails observation".

A 70-year-old Asian man with noninsulin-dependent diabetes presented with a 4-month history of left-sided otitis externa and right-sided facial palsy. Physical examination of the left ear revealed a punched-out ulcerative lesion on the tragus, an edematous and inflamed external auditory canal, and a purulent nonmucoid discharge. Computed tomography of the brain and neck demonstrated a large retropharyngeal abscess, an abscess in the left parapharyngeal space, and a small collection adjacent to the right carotid sheath at the level of C4; the cervical vertebrae and lungs were normal. Microscopy of drained pus and histology of left ear and neck node biopsies identified tuberculosis. The patient was started on antituberculosis drug therapy, but he died within 2 weeks of treatment. We discuss the characteristics of this unusual presentation of tuberculosis infection.

### Auritidibacter ignavus, an emerging pathogen associated with chronic ear infections [^113chGsG]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Right ears of 2 patients with chronic ear infections who were infected with Auritidibacter ignavus, Germany. A) Patient 1. Auditory canal was swollen and red and contained fungal spores. B) Patient 2. Fibrotic stenosis in the cartilaginous part of the ear canal, which was suggestive of a postinflammatory acquired atresia of the external auditory canal.

Patient 2 was a 72-year-old woman who sought care for slowly progressing conductive hearing loss of the right ear and occasional otorrhea. She denied any pain, dizziness, or tinnitus. Although an otologic examination of the left ear showed unremarkable findings, the right side showed a fibrotic, moist auditory canal with stenosis, which was suggestive of a postinflammatory acquired atresia of the external auditory canal (Figure 1, panel B). Audiometry showed an air bone gap of up to 20 dB on the right side with bilateral sensorineural normacusis. To exclude middle and inner ear affection or malformations, computed tomography was performed and showed a partial obstruction of the right external auditory canal by fibrous tissue without any additional pathologic findings. To widen the external auditory canal and to help with outer ear drainage, we performed a meatoplasty. Because the otorrhea did not subside postoperatively, we obtained a microbiological swab specimen, which grew A. ignavus. A topical therapy with ethanol drops and nourishing oil drops led to a long-lasting improvement of symptoms without recurring otorrhea.

Patient 3 was a 76-year-old man who had lichen planus and sought care for recurrent otorrhea of both ears for > 2 months. He reported no otalgia, vertigo, or tinnitus. A symmetric presbycusis had remained unchanged for years and was treated with conventional hearing aids. On examination, both auditory canals were moist and constricted, clinically manifesting as inflammatory meatal fibrosis, a common finding in patients who have lichen planus. Result of a computed tomography scan showed a bilateral circumferential bony overgrowth of the osseous external auditory canal. A microbiological swab specimen led to the identification of A. ignavus in both ears. Thus, a topical therapy with ethanol drops and a tincture of isopropyl alcohol, glycerin, acetic acid, and peppermint oil was initiated. At follow-up after 3 weeks, both auditory canals were dry and without signs of acute infection but with an unchanged fibrotic stenosis.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112G2Tdw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

Study Design

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

Results

The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group made recommendations that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The group made additional recommendations that: 4) the choice of topical antimicrobial therapy of diffuse AOE should be based on efficacy, low incidence of adverse events, likelihood of adherence to therapy, and cost; 5) clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops, and when the ear canal is obstructed, delivery of topical preparations should be enhanced by aural toilet, placing a wick, or both; 6) when the patient has a tympanostomy tube or known perforation of the tympanic membrane, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation; and 7) if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. And finally, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating patients with AOE. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of this problem.

Significance

This is the first, explicit, evidence-based clinical practice guideline on acute otitis externa, and the first clinical practice guideline produced independently by the AAO-HNSF.

Primary EAC neoplasms include benign and malignant lesions of bony, glandular or cutaneous origin. Small, benign slow growing bony neoplasms are often asymptomatic, diagnosed incidentally and might not require intervention. Both malignant and benign neoplasms of cutaneous and glandular origin can present with symptoms of chronic otitis externa, leading to delays in diagnosis. Prompt biopsy of soft tissue lesions associated with non-resolving otitis externa are warranted. Local and regional imaging is helpful to understand disease extent and origin, but even early-stage malignant neoplasms require aggressive surgical treatment.

### Cranial nerve involvement in malignant external otitis: implications for clinical outcome [^1173pfEF]. The Laryngoscope (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Malignant external otitis is an uncommon, potentially lethal infection of the temporal bone primarily affecting elderly diabetic patients.

Objective

To determine whether cranial nerve involvement in malignant external otitis affects or predicts the clinical outcome in terms of morbidity and mortality.

Methods

Diagnosis of malignant external otitis was established in 23 patients (average age, 71 yr; range, 39–87) based on inclusion criteria of severe pain, otitis externa refractory to conventional treatments, diabetes mellitus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa detection. Computed tomography confirmed temporal bone involvement extending outside the external auditory canal.

Data Analysis

Retrospective analysis of hospital records.

Results

Ten of 23 (43.5%) patients showed cranial nerve involvement. The following cranial nerves were affected: facial nerve (6/10), lower cranial nerves (combination of IX, X, XI, XII) (3/10), and extended nerve palsy (VI, VII, IX, X, XI) (1/10). Thirteen of 23 (56.5%) patients displayed no cranial nerve involvement. All patients were treated with long-term, high-dose antibiotic treatment dependent on the microbiological findings.

Conclusions

All patients with lower cranial nerve palsy recovered normal function; however, the facial nerve palsy was significantly less likely to improve by medical treatment. Cranial nerve involvement did not affect the patient survival rate under an optimized medical treatment in our series.

### Current indications for surgical intervention with lateral skull base osteomyelitis [^113bnj8L]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Lateral skull base osteomyelitis (SBO), also called malignant otitis externa or necrotitizing otitis externa, is a subacute yet relentless infection of the external auditory canal and skull base most often found in elderly males and diabetics. When SBO was first described in the 1950s, the first‐line therapy was surgical intervention. Over the past few decades, a transition toward culture‐directed antibiotics has shifted the treatment paradigm of SBO toward primary medical management, with mortality rates now decreased to 10%–20% compared to 50% initially.

Today, the treatment of SBO involves multidisciplinary coordination between otolaryngology and infectious disease. Although the introduction of quinolone antibiotics has significantly decreased mortality rate, the rate of surgical intervention has not drastically changed over time. Due to the rarity of this condition, there is significant variability in practice styles between individuals and institutions, and there is no consensus on the specific indications for surgical intervention. The purpose of this best practice review was to interpret the available evidence to better define contemporary indications for surgery.

Key points
- People with diabetes are at higher risk for hearing and balance complications.
- These can include hearing loss and higher risk of falls.
- Complications can be avoided or delayed with yearly ear care screenings and treatment. Audiologists in diabetes care Audiologists play a key role in detecting and treating diabetes-related hearing and balance complications. These include hearing loss and higher risk of falls. Complications can be avoided or delayed with yearly ear care screenings and treatment. Let patients know:

- People with diabetes may be prescribed ototoxic medications. This can lead to more severe hearing loss than by aging alone.
- Take medication as directed and talk to their provider if they develop difficulty hearing, balance problems, or ringing in the ears as a side effect.
- Diabetes-related hearing loss may reduce quality of life. Take these 5 actions to help your patients 1.

Know the risks of hearing and balance disorders for diabetes patients. People with diabetes are at a higher risk for hearing and balance complications. However, few older adults report having a yearly ear care screening. Diabetes can affect hearing by reducing cortical auditory processing and cerebral microcirculation in the auditory centers of the brain. Studies suggest that diabetes also affects the vestibular system and balance by damaging the inner ear's semicircular canals and otolith organs. Statistics
- Hearing loss is 30% higher in adults with prediabetes than in those without this condition.
- Hearing loss is twice as common in people with diabetes compared to people without.
- Vestibular dysfunction is 70% more likely in people with diabetes.
- The incidence of falls is 39% higher in people with diabetes.
2. Encourage patients to monitor their ear health. At each health care visit, tell your patients with diabetes about the signs of hearing and balance problems.

This will help them be aware of changes when they may start. You can make sure your patients understand the information by asking them to repeat what they heard. Common signs of ear health issues.

### Malignant otitis externa: an updated review [^116oXW2E]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

Malignant otitis externa is a progressive infection of the external auditory canal and skull base. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most isolated microorganism and it affects mostly to diabetic, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Non-resolving otalgia and chronic otorrhea are the clinical manifestations presented. Facial nerve palsy is a common and well recognized complication. (Computed tomography) CT scan is useful for initial assessment, Technetium-99m is highly sensitive and is part of the protocol for diagnosis. Treatment should be individualized, with multidisciplinary cooperation among specialties. Management involves systemic antipseudomonal antibiotics and monitoring with radiologic techniques, it also involves the strict control of diabetes. It is essential to follow up the patients for at least a year post-treatment. In refractory malignant otitis externa and affection of facial nerve, surgical management is recommended. We reviewed the most recent studies on epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment to provide an update on Malignant Otitis Externa that can offer an overview for clinical practice and future research.

### Malignant external otitis: what the diabetes specialist should know – A narrative review [^116EHk81]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

MEO, although rarer, presents similarities to the pathogenesis of and population involved in diabetic foot osteomyelitis. Specifically, microangiopathy and neuropathy are considered to play a key role in both. It is interesting to remember, however, that MEO is usually monomicrobial, while diabetic foot osteomyelitis is polymicrobial, and that an ear swab culture usually suffices for MEO, while in the latter bone biopsy is needed for diagnosis.

Diagnosis

MEO most commonly presents with non-resolving nocturnal ear pain, followed by exudate, hearing impairment and temporomandibular joint. Otoscopic findings include edema of the external ear canal with granulation tissue at the osseocartilaginous junction and more rarely only edema or aural polyps.

Palsies of the cranial nerves on the side of MEO are not unusual. Clinical evaluation should include examination of the cranial nerves, specifically the facial (VII), glossopharyngeal (IX), vagus (X), accessory (XI) and hypoglossal (XII) nerves. The facial nerve is most commonly while the hypoglossal nerve most rarely affected. It has been reported that facial nerve paralysis increases mortality by 50%. Facial nerve paralysis is considered to occur in 75% of individuals with Aspergillus infection, while only in 34% of those with Pseudomonas infection.

Blood inflammatory markers, such as white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (CRP), should be obtained. The two latter measurements are usually elevated, while the white blood cell count usually is normal or slightly elevated. The inflammatory markers can be used for disease monitoring and correspondence to treatment. Diabetes tests, such as blood glucose and HbA1c levels, are very important, since sufficient glucose and inflammation controls are milestones in the treatment of the disease. Patients without a known history of diabetes should, nevertheless, be tested. Fasting plasma glucose and glucose tolerance tests should be performed after reduction of the inflammation. Renal and liver function should also be monitored.

Next, culture of ear secretions should be obtained before initiation of antibiotics to assess both the pathogen and its resistance to treatment. A biopsy of the granulation tissue should also be performed for differential diagnosis among MEO, tumor and cholesteatoma. Culture of a superficial swab of the external auditory meatus is most commonly conducted, while deep biopsies can be selected in cases of refractory MEO or probable fungal infections.

### Surgical emphysema following canalplasty for aural exostoses [^112YgFj6]. Otology & Neurotology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the presentation and management of surgical emphysema involving the temporomandibular joint and deep neck following exostoses removal.

Patient

A 60-year-old male surfer presented with hearing loss and recurrent infections in the right ear. An examination revealed obstructing bony exostoses in the right external auditory canal. He underwent right canalplasty using a postauricular approach. At 5 weeks after surgery, he presented with right otalgia, swelling of the right face and neck, and complaints of a squeaking noise in the right ear with mandibular excursions. An otomicroscopic examination demonstrated a focal area of prolapsing soft tissue along the anterior bony external auditory canal with mandibular movement. The examination also revealed palpable crepitus of the right face and neck. Computed tomography was obtained of the temporal bones and neck confirming a focal anterior canal wall defect allowing communication between the glenoid fossa and external auditory canal with subcutaneous emphysema tracking around the temporomandibular joint into the masticator, parotid, and parapharyngeal spaces.

Intervention

Maxillomandibular fixation for 2 weeks with revision canalplasty using a split tragal cartilage graft.

Results

At 6 weeks after revision surgery, the patient reported complete resolution of all symptoms. Repeat imaging demonstrated complete resolution of subcutaneous and deep neck emphysema, and the otomicroscopic examination revealed a fully epithelialized external auditory canal with no further evidence of soft tissue prolapse.

Conclusion

Maxillomandibular fixation with autologous cartilage graft is an effective management strategy for complications of canalplasty resulting in exposure of the temporomandibular joint capsule and surgical emphysema.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^112RBEEj]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Modifying factors and cautions for ear irrigation — patient selection and aftercare are specified: Ear irrigation should not be performed in individuals who have a nonintact tympanic membrane or those who have had ear surgery; since the ear drum is frequently not visualized due to cerumen impaction, a detailed history should be obtained prior to the decision for irrigation, and if a small portion of the drum is visible and mobile with pneumatic otoscopy, it is safe to proceed; aural irrigation should be avoided in individuals with anatomic abnormalities of the ear canal that might trap water; among diabetic patients, a higher incidence of malignant otitis externa following aural irrigation with tap water has been reported, consequently aural irrigation, especially with water, should be performed with caution in diabetic patients and they should be instructed to report otorrhea and/or otalgia promptly; consideration should be given to reacidifying the ear canal since the slightly acidic pH of the normal external auditory canal may be a significant factor in producing resistance to external otitis and/or malignant otitis externa. This can be done with vinegar or acetic acid drops after treatment.

### An emergency medicine-focused review of malignant otitis externa [^111wNmKS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Malignant otitis externa (MOE) is a progressive infection of the external auditory canal (EAC). This disease is rare but has severe morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This narrative review provides an overview of malignant otitis externa for emergency clinicians.

Discussion

MOE is an invasive external ear infection that spreads to the temporal bone and can further progress to affect intracranial structures. Complications of advanced MOE include cranial nerve involvement, most commonly the facial nerve, and intracranial infections such as abscess and meningitis. The most common causative agent of MOE is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but others include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and fungi. Major risk factors for MOE include diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, and advanced age. Red flags for MOE include severe otalgia (pain out of proportion to exam) or severe otorrhea, neurologic deficits (especially facial nerve involvement), previously diagnosed otitis externa not responsive to therapy, and patients with major risk factors for MOE. Examination may show purulent otorrhea or granulation tissue in the EAC, and culture of EAC drainage should be performed. Diagnosis is aided by computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast, which may demonstrate bony destruction of the temporal bone or skull base. When suspecting MOE, early consultation with an otolaryngologist is recommended and antibiotics with pseudomonal coverage are needed. Most patients with MOE will require admission to the hospital.

Conclusions

MOE is a rare, yet deadly diagnosis that must be suspected when patients with immunocompromise, diabetes, or advanced age present with severe otalgia. Rapid diagnosis and treatment may prevent complications and improve outcomes.

### Malignant external otitis: what the diabetes specialist should know – A narrative review [^1118uZcV]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Malignant external otitis (MEO) — or malignant otitis externa or necrotizing external otitis — is an aggressive type of external otitis which shows an outspread of inflammatory activity towards the soft tissues of the external auditory meatus and bone of the skull base and presents severe morbidity and mortality. Use of the term malignant is unsuitable, since it does not describe the development of cancer but more the rapid local spread of the inflammation to healthy tissues. The first report of the disease is attributed to Toulmouche in 1838, while the term 'malignant otitis externa' was first used by Chandler in 1968.

Incidence rates of MEO vary with a population-based study held in Taiwan reporting 2.24 per million person-years of observation and another in Spain reporting 1.3 per million inhabitant per year. Individuals < 18 years old present with a very low incidence of the disease. MEO is more common in males than females (1.45 males:1 female).

Despite the advances in the treatment of MEO, incidence rates of 10–20% have been published, with a more recent study from the US reporting an overall mortality of 2.5% during the initial hospitalization. Existing diabetes and poor glycemic control are associated with longer hospitalization, increased healthcare costs and mortality in this patient category.

Our Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) Department has had long experience in handling these patients. Specifically, 11 cases of patients with MEO presented in 1977, one of the largest case series at that time. At this time quinolones were not yet widely used and these patients were treated with surgery and other antibiotics, with the report of five deaths. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

### Malignant external otitis: what the diabetes specialist should know – A narrative review [^116Dbu39]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Classification

The Carney clinicopathological classification of MEO is a useful tool (Table 1). In stage 1, there is clinical evidence of MEO with inflammation of soft tissues beyond the external acoustic meatus and a physiological 99Tc bone scan. In stage 2, soft tissue inflammation spreads beyond the external acoustic meatus, but with a pathological 99Tc bone scan. Stage 3 is similar to stage 2, but with cranial nerve palsies (3a single, 3b multiple nerve palsies). Stage 4 is accompanied by intracranial complications, such meningitis.

Table 1
Carney clinicopathological staging

Computed tomography is very important because, except for assistance in diagnosis and information on disease outspread and small cortical lesions, it can also help predict the clinical course and severity of the MEO according to Peleg et al. The Peleg is a 4-point score, as seen in Table 2, consisting of 1 point for diabetes mellitus type 1 and 1 point for involvement of one of each structure on CT: temporal bone, skull base bone and temporomandibular joint. Thus, patients with a score of 0–2 are considered non-severe patients, while those with a score of 3–4 severe patients.

Table 2
Peleg stratification

Soudry et al. in an effort to identify patients with aggressive MEO early, defined the following criteria: bilateral disease, cranial nerve involvement and CT findings. The latter include erosions of the infratemporal fossa and base of the skull and involvement of the nasopharynx. It is also important to diagnose and properly treat fungal infections.

A more recent stratification protocol by Stevens et al. introduces nine disease variables. Specifically, it contains four clinical variables, namely facial nerve palsy, relapse of MEO, need for surgery and fungal infection, and five radiographic variables, namely temporomandibular joint lesions, infratemporal fossa erosion, tegmen tympani erosion, nasopharynx and intracranial complications. Severe MEO is diagnosed when: (1) facial nerve involvement is present, (2) at least two clinical variables are present, (3) at least two radiological variables are present and (4) at least one clinical and one radiological variable are present. In cases of severe MEO, there is higher morbidity and usually need for surgical treatment.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) guideline — action statements report that the development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

Aspergillus ear infections — treatment differs by disease type: noninvasive Aspergillus otitis externa, also called otomycosis, is treated by thorough mechanical cleansing of the external auditory canal followed by topical antifungals or boric acid (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence), whereas we recommend that clinicians treat IA of the ear with a prolonged course of systemic voriconazole, usually combined with surgery (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Tissue-invasive Aspergillus otitis should be treated with prolonged systemic voriconazole, often necessitating surgical debridement, and in the absence of evidence of tissue invasion, we do not recommend that colonization should be treated.

Analgesics are an important factor in treating MEO, but they should normally be administered only for a few days, e.g. the first 5 days, since regression of pain should be monitored during the course of the disease and is an indicator of disease resolution.

According to a systematic review, hyperbaric oxygen therapy could be a significant adjunct in the treatment of refractory or chronic cases of MEO, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus. As already mentioned, patients with diabetes exhibit significant factors that contribute to MEO development like poor white blood cell chemotaxis and diabetic microangiopathy, which lead to tissue hypoxia. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, on the other hand, is considered to ameliorate oxygen partial pressure in the site of infection, increase bone and soft tissue healing and improve oxygen-mediated leucocyte function.

Different complications of MEO should receive more targeted treatment. For example, temporomandibular joint inflammation, which is rare and considered to have poor prognosis, can be treated with skeletal muscle relaxants for symptom relief. Facial nerve palsy as an indication for surgery is debatable, since according to several authors, many cases are associated with good response to conservative treatment. Thus, it is important to evaluate the overall clinical picture of the patient.

Overall, use of classification systems, e.g. the Peleg score, to classify patients as non-severe and severe could be implemented to decide proper treatment. Non-severe patients can be treated mainly with antibiotics and minimal surgery of the external acoustic meatus when needed. Severe patients should receive an aggressive therapy with multiple antipseudomonal antibiotics and early surgical debridement of the affected structures.
