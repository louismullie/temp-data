## Question

A presença de lesões hiperintensas em RNM de crânio em paciente com os critérios de hipermobilidade revela um subtipo vascular ou de hipermobilidade?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hyperintense lesions on brain MRI in a patient who meets hypermobility criteria indicate a vascular subtype of hypermobility or simply reflect the hypermobility spectrum itself. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entities involved and how hypermobility is classified. Then, I should verify what MRI hyperintensities typically represent and whether they are described in hypermobility syndromes. Next, I will examine whether any provided sources directly link MRI findings to a vascular subtype of hypermobility. After that, I need to check for indirect vascular mechanisms that could plausibly connect hypermobility to brain MRI changes. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically grounded conclusion and outline practical next steps, making sure I don't overstate claims beyond the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities. Hypermobility spectrum disorders include hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and other presentations of generalized joint hypermobility; diagnosis relies on clinical criteria and tools such as the Beighton score and the 2017 international diagnostic framework, with prevalence estimates around 0.013% for hEDS in Europe, underscoring that this is a recognized, albeit variably prevalent, connective tissue phenotype rather than a single disease with uniform organ involvement [^116ZJfj3].

> Now, I need to check what MRI hyperintensities imply. On brain MRI, hyperintense lesions on T2 or FLAIR generally reflect increased water content and can represent demyelination, ischemia, small vessel disease, or other parenchymal processes; however, I should confirm whether any of the supplied sources explicitly document such MRI findings in hypermobility cohorts, and I do not see direct MRI brain lesion descriptions in the provided hypermobility literature, which limits firm attribution here.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a vascular subtype. I should verify whether any of the references define or validate a vascular subtype of hypermobility. I find no provided source that delineates a vascular subtype of hypermobility or establishes MRI criteria for it, so claiming a vascular subtype based on MRI alone would be unsupported by this evidence set; the hypermobility literature emphasizes multisystem features but does not specify neurovascular imaging phenotypes in these documents.

> But wait, what if there are indirect vascular links that could explain MRI changes. Let me consider plausible mechanisms: connective tissue weakness in hEDS can affect vessel walls, and endothelial dysfunction is a recognized theme in vascular biology; E-selectin and other endothelial activation markers have been implicated in vascular cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative contexts, suggesting that if endothelial injury occurs in hEDS, it could theoretically contribute to small vessel changes visible on MRI, though this remains speculative in the absence of direct MRI-hyperintensity data in hEDS here [^1176p9BW] [^113E5Hen] [^113dLKrX].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence before concluding. The absence of direct MRI-hyperintensity reports in the supplied hypermobility sources means any inference to a vascular subtype is indirect and hypothesis-generating rather than diagnostic; therefore, I need to ensure I frame this as a possibility that warrants clinical correlation rather than a definitive subtype classification based on MRI alone.

> Next, I should review practical clinical steps. Let me verify the recommended evaluation: confirm hypermobility with standardized tools such as the Beighton score and the five-part questionnaire, screen for common extra-articular features, and consider vascular risk factors and neurologic symptoms; if MRI hyperintensities are present, interpret them in the context of age, cardiovascular risk, migraine, and other standard etiologies rather than immediately labeling them as a hypermobility vascular subtype, and escalate evaluation if there are red flags or progressive deficits.

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion matches the evidence. The provided sources do not establish that hyperintense MRI lesions define a vascular subtype of hypermobility; they remain nonspecific findings that may coexist with hypermobility but are not themselves diagnostic of a vascular subtype in this context, so the most accurate statement is that MRI hyperintensities are not, based on these materials, a validated marker of a vascular hypermobility subtype, and further targeted evaluation is warranted to determine etiology and clinical significance.

A presença de lesões hiperintensas em RNM de crânio em pacientes com critérios de hipermobilidade **não define um subtipo vascular** de hipermobilidade. Essas lesões são comuns em populações gerais e podem refletir alterações vasculares microscópicas, mas **não são específicas** para hipermobilidade vascular. A hipermobilidade vascular não é um subtipo reconhecido nos critérios atuais da hEDS/HSD, e a RNM não é um marcador diagnóstico para esse fim. A avaliação deve ser clínica, com RNM reservada para sintomas neurológicos específicos, e a interpretação das lesões deve considerar causas mais comuns como hipertensão, envelhecimento ou migraña.

## Características das lesões hiperintensas em RNM de crânio

As lesões hiperintensas em T2/FLAIR são **frequentes e inespecíficas**, refletindo aumento de sinal por água ou desmielinização:

- **Pequenas lesões hiperintensas brancas (WMH)**: comuns em adultos, associadas a microangiopatia, hipertensão, envelhecimento e fatores de risco cardiovascular [^notfound].

- **Lesões desmielinizantes**: vistas em esclerose múltipla e outras doenças desmielinizantes, mas também em processos inflamatórios ou isquémicos leves.

- **Hiperintensidades periventriculares e subcorticais**: frequentes em migrânea e em populações saudáveis, especialmente com fatores de risco vascular.

---

## Hipermobilidade e possíveis manifestações vasculares

A hEDS/HSD envolve alterações do tecido conectivo, incluindo vasculatura, mas **não há um subtipo vascular definido** nos critérios atuais. Manifestações vasculares descritas incluem:

- **Fragilidade vascular**: menor resistência da parede arterial, possível aumento de varizes e aneurismas pequenos.

- **Disautonomia e alterações hemodinâmicas**: hipotensão ortostática, taquicardia postural, que podem afetar perfusão cerebral.

- **Dor e fadiga crônicas**: comuns na hEDS/HSD, mas não específicas para comprometimento vascular cerebral.

---

## Relação entre lesões hiperintensas em RNM e hipermobilidade

Não há evidência de que lesões hiperintensas em RNM sejam **marcadores diagnósticos** de um subtipo vascular de hipermobilidade. Estudos não demonstram associação específica entre essas lesões e hEDS/HSD, e elas são comuns em populações sem hipermobilidade. Possíveis explicações para sua presença em hEDS/HSD incluem:

- **Alterações microvasculares**: fragilidade capilar ou endothelial leve, teoricamente aumentando WMH, mas não específicas.

- **Fatores de risco cardiovascular**: mais comuns em hEDS/HSD (p. ex. disautonomia, inatividade), podendo contribuir para WMH.

- **Migraña**: mais frequente em hEDS/HSD e associada a hiperintensidades periventriculares/subcorticais.

---

## Critérios diagnósticos para subtipos vasculares de hipermobilidade

Não há critérios diagnósticos reconhecidos para um **subtipo vascular** de hipermobilidade. Os critérios atuais (Beighton, Brighton, 2017) enfatizam hiperextensibilidade articular, sintomas sistêmicos e exclusão de outras causas, sem incluir achados de RNM cerebral. A RNM **não faz parte do diagnóstico** de hEDS/HSD e não define subtipos vasculares.

---

## Implicações clínicas e necessidade de investigação adicional

A presença de lesões hiperintensas em RNM em pacientes com hipermobilidade **necessita avaliação cuidadosa**:

- **Avaliação clínica**: história detalhada de sintomas neurológicos, cardiovasculares e autonômicos.

- **Exames complementares**: considerar ecocardiograma, medida de pressão arterial, avaliação de disautonomia, conforme sintomas.

- **Interpretação da RNM**: correlacionar com idade, fatores de risco vascular, história de migrânea e achados neurológicos.

- **Acompanhamento**: monitorar sintomas neurológicos e cardiovasculares, ajustando o plano terapêutico conforme necessário.

---

## Conclusão

As lesões hiperintensas em RNM de crânio em pacientes com critérios de hipermobilidade **não definem um subtipo vascular** de hipermobilidade. São achados inespecíficos, comuns em populações gerais, e não estabelecem diagnóstico de hEDS/HSD vascular. A avaliação deve ser clínica, com RNM reservada para sintomas neurológicos específicos, e a interpretação deve considerar causas mais comuns como hipertensão, envelhecimento ou migrânea.

### Consensus recommendations on the classification, definition and diagnostic criteria of hip-related pain in young and middle-aged active adults from the international hip-related pain research network, zurich 2018 [^117DsEp9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

There is no agreement on how to classify, define or diagnose hip-related pain-a common cause of hip and groin pain in young and middle-aged active adults. This complicates the work of clinicians and researchers. The International Hip-related Pain Research Network consensus group met in November 2018 in Zurich aiming to make recommendations on how to classify, define and diagnose hip disease in young and middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain as the main symptom. Prior to the meeting we performed a scoping review of electronic databases in June 2018 to determine the definition, epidemiology and diagnosis of hip conditions in young and middle-aged active adults presenting with hip-related pain. We developed and presented evidence-based statements for these to a panel of 37 experts for discussion and consensus agreement. Both non-musculoskeletal and serious hip pathological conditions (eg, tumours, infections, stress fractures, slipped capital femoral epiphysis), as well as competing musculoskeletal conditions (eg, lumbar spine) should be excluded when diagnosing hip-related pain in young and middle-aged active adults. The most common hip conditions in young and middle-aged active adults presenting with hip-related pain are: (1) femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome, (2) acetabular dysplasia and/or hip instability and (3) other conditions without a distinct osseous morphology (labral, chondral and/or ligamentum teres conditions), and that these terms are used in research and clinical practice. Clinical examination and diagnostic imaging have limited diagnostic utility; a comprehensive approach is therefore essential. A negative flexion-adduction-internal rotation test helps rule out hip-related pain although its clinical utility is limited. Anteroposterior pelvis and lateral femoral head-neck radiographs are the initial diagnostic imaging of choice-advanced imaging should be performed only when requiring additional detail of bony or soft-tissue morphology (eg, for definitive diagnosis, research setting or when planning surgery). We recommend clear, detailed and consistent methodology of bony morphology outcome measures (definition, measurement and statistical reporting) in research. Future research on conditions with hip-related pain as the main symptom should include high-quality prospective studies on aetiology and prognosis. The most common hip conditions in active adults presenting with hip-related pain are: (1) FAI syndrome, (2) acetabular dysplasia and/or hip instability and (3) other conditions without distinct osseous morphology including labral, chondral and/or ligamentum teres conditions. The last category should not be confused with the incidental imaging findings of labral, chondral and/or ligamentum teres pathology in asymptomatic people. Future research should refine our current recommendations by determining the clinical utility of clinical examination and diagnostic imaging in prospective studies.

### Are diagnostic criteria for general joint hypermobility and benign joint hypermobility syndrome based on reproducible and valid tests? A review of the literature [^114WLgT4]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

In this review we focus on current knowledge of the reliability of tests and diagnostic criteria for generalized joint hypermobility (GJH) and benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS).

Methods

Currently, The British Society of Rheumatology recommends the Beighton scoring system. With this approach, GJH is judged present when 4 or more of 9 tests are positive. Curiously, only one inter/intrarater reproducibility study is available and it uses a cutoff level of 6, rather than the Beighton-recommended 4 positive tests.

Results

Using a 6 cut level, intra- and interobserver kappa scores were 0.75 and 0.78, respectively. Beighton scoring recommendations have been correlated with a global joint mobility index as well as with 2 other scoring systems, the Carter and Wilkinson, and the Rotès-Quérol. All illustrate high concurrent validity with one another. For the recently proposed Brighton criteria diagnosing BJHS no reproducibility studies exist. In the latter, the recommendations reflect high nosographic sensitivity and specificity while predictive values for positive test scores are poor.

Conclusion

In general, the reproducibility of the various tests seems to be good, especially when performed by experienced rheumatologists.

Hip osteoarthritis (OA) clinical practice guideline — statement of intent clarifies appropriate use and documentation. This guideline is "not intended to be construed to or to serve as a standard of medical care", and "these parameters of practice should be considered guidelines only". Adherence "will not ensure a successful outcome in every patient" and does not exclude other acceptable methods of care. The ultimate judgment regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made in light of the clinical data presented by the patient, the diagnostic and treatment options available, and the patient's values, expectations, and preferences. However, "we suggest the rationale for significant departures from accepted guidelines be documented in the patient's medical records at the time the relevant clinical decision is made".

### New and emerging syndromes due to neuroendocrine tumors [^1165RuWE]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare, slow-growing neoplasms characterized by their ability to store and secrete different peptides and neuroamines. Some of these substances cause specific clinical syndromes whereas others are not associated with specific syndromes or symptom complexes. NETs usually have episodic expression that makes diagnosis difficult, erroneous, and often late. For these reasons a high index of suspicion is needed, and it is important to understand the pathophysiology of each tumor to decide which biochemical markers are more useful and when they should be used.

### Classification vs diagnostic criteria: the challenge of diagnosing axial spondyloarthritis [^1124ay7Q]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

In the classification approach, test parameters of the same level have the same value (e.g. inflammatory back pain and presence of peripheral arthritis), while the negative results of the tests are not considered. Negative results of the tests can also be ignored sometimes in the diagnostic approach – in the case of manifestations that are not necessarily present at the beginning of the disease and can evolve over time, such as peripheral and extra-musculoskeletal manifestations of SpA.

Finally, the outcome of the diagnostic approach is the diagnosis with a certain level of probability that can be expressed in percent or in categories such as diagnosis is unlikely, uncertain, possible, likely, etc. Often, the rheumatologist starts in a situation where the diagnosis is possible, but other tests are needed to confirm (or to exclude) it. There is normally no external reference for the diagnosis; the rheumatologist's opinion is, in fact, the 'gold standard' that can change over time with increasing experience and external factors such as new developments or concepts related to the diagnosis of a disease.

### Vascular endothelial growth factor synergistically enhances induction of E-selectin by tumor necrosis factor-alpha [^113dLKrX]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The regulation of endothelial cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was investigated in cell cultures and in a rabbit model of atherogenic neointima formation.

Methods and Results

VEGF regulation of vascular CAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule), intercellular CAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule), and E-selectin were investigated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and flow cytometry, and in the rabbit collar model of atherogenic macrophage accumulation by immunostaining. VEGF alone caused no significant induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, or E-selectin compared with tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In both hypercholesterolemic and normal rabbits, adenoviral VEGF-A165 expression caused no increase in endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 or E-selectin. In contrast, pretreatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with VEGF significantly increased E-selectin expression induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha, compared with tumor necrosis factor-alpha alone, whereas vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 were unaffected. VEGF similarly enhanced IL-1beta-induced E-selectin upregulation. VEGF also synergistically increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced E-selectin mRNA and shedding of soluble E-selectin. Synergistic upregulation of E-selectin expression by VEGF was mediated via VEGF receptor-2 and calcineurin signaling.

Conclusions

VEGF alone does not activate endothelium to induce CAM expression; instead, VEGF "primes" endothelial cells, sensitizing them to cytokines leading to heightened selective pro-inflammatory responses, including upregulation of E-selectin.

### Increased CSF E-selectin in clinical Alzheimer's disease without altered CSF A β 42 and tau [^113E5Hen]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically heterogeneous. In this multicenter cohort of 215 clinically diagnosed AD patients and 249 controls, E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VACM-1) were measured along with amyloid-β peptide 1–42 (Aβ42) and tau. We discovered that E-selectin, a biomarker of endothelial function/vascular injury, was inversely correlated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau/Aβ42 ratio and significantly elevated in clinical AD patients without the typical AD CSF biomarker signature (i.e., low tau/Aβ42 ratio) compared to those with the signature. These findings suggest that E-selectin may be an objective biomarker related to vascular mechanisms contributing to dementia.

### Sigmoid sinus diverticulum without pulsatile tinnitus occurring concurrently with chronic otitis media mucosal type [^1169g3UU]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Sigmoid sinus diverticulum is a rare vascular anomaly often associated with pulsatile tinnitus. It can occur in cases of chronic otitis media squamous type (unsafe type) due to dehiscence of the sigmoid sinus plate caused by cholesteatoma. The presentation of which is that of pulsatile tinnitus. However, we present an unusual case of sigmoid sinus diverticulum occurring concurrently with chronic otitis media mucosal type (safe type) but in the absence of pulsatile tinnitus. This case report highlights the diagnostic challenges and management of this rare clinical scenario.

### Hip pain and mobility deficits – hip osteoarthritis: clinical practice guidelines linked to the international classification of functioning, disability, and health from the orthopaedic section of the American Physical Therapy Association [^1136sjvX]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis — imaging studies and radiographic criteria: Imaging studies, specifically plain film radiographs, are confirmatory for moderate to severe hip OA; however, radiographs are less useful in demonstrating early osteoarthritic joint changes, and joint space narrowing detected on radiographs may be a relatively late stage phenomenon of OA. Joint space narrowing has been advocated as the best indicator and best predictor of arthritic change in patients with hip OA. The normal hip joint space is 3 to 5 mm, and a reduction of greater than or equal to 0.5 mm represents a clinically relevant and significant reduction in joint space width. Hip joint OA is considered moderate when joint space is less than 2.5 mm and severe when joint space is less than 1.5 mm. The development of newer imaging techniques, such as gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, has been suggested as a method to detect deficiencies in cartilage structure that may represent early arthritic changes in young patients. In addition to joint space narrowing, other criteria, including osteophyte formation and subchondral sclerosis, also are used to identify patients with hip OA, and the Kellgren/Lawrence scale has been used to classify degenerative findings associated with hip OA. The scale consists of 4 grades: grade 1, no radiographic evidence of OA; grade 2, doubtful narrowing of joint space and possible (minute) osteophytes; grade 3, moderate definite osteophytes, definite moderate narrowing of joint space; grade 4, large osteophytes, severe joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and definite deformity of bone contour; a potential caveat when using the Kellgren/Lawrence scale is spurs or osteophytes are emphasized and not all patients with hip OA have osteophytes.

### Single-center analysis of characteristics and outcomes of De novo, concurrent, and transformed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^112dJae1]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcomes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), either concurrent with or transformed from indolent lymphoma, treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone are described in retrospective studies. The efficacy of other regimens in transformed or concurrent DLBCL is largely unknown. In this single-center retrospective study, we present characteristics of concurrent and transformed DLBCL and outcomes after dose-adjusted etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, prednisone, and doxorubicin with rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) comparative with de novo DLBCL. Of 170 patients with DLBCL, 136 were de novo, 17 were concurrent, and 17 were transformed. Transformed DLBCL had significantly lower complete response rates and progression-free survival (PFS) but similar overall survival (OS) compared with de novo counterpart. There was no significant difference between de novo and concurrent DLBCL regarding response rates, PFS, and OS. DA-EPOCH-R was associated with inferior OS. Thus, intensified treatment with DA-EPOCH-R might not improve outcomes of transformed DLBCL.

### Classification vs diagnostic criteria: the challenge of diagnosing axial spondyloarthritis [^115TycyC]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Diagnostic and classification approaches are characterized by conceptional and operational differences. Although no universal diagnostic approach can be developed, the main diagnostic principles can be clearly defined: consider the pre-test probability of the disease, evaluate positive and negative results of the diagnostic test, exclude other entities, estimate the probability of the disease at the end. Classification criteria should only be applied to patients with an established clinical diagnosis and aimed at the identification of a more or less homogeneous group of patients for the conduction of clinical research. Thus, the correct diagnosis remains the main challenge in the clinical practice, while correct classification has a high relevance for research.

Hip osteoarthritis — body mass index: A few studies have shown body mass index (BMI) to be related to hip OA, whereas other studies have shown little to no association; the most current evidence shows BMI is not related to hip OA. What seems apparent is that obesity is probably associated with the progression of hip OA rather than onset, and the therapeutic value of weight loss is important.

Appendix G — procedures for assigning levels of evidence states that level of evidence is assigned based on the study design using the Levels of Evidence table, assuming high quality, and that study quality is assessed using the critical appraisal tool with assignment to 1 of 4 overall quality ratings; level of evidence is adjusted based on the overall quality rating. High quality retains the assigned level of evidence (eg, if the randomized clinical trial is rated high quality, its final assignment is level I) and high quality should include randomized clinical trial with greater than 80% follow-up, blinding, and appropriate randomization procedures; cohort study includes greater than 80% follow-up; diagnostic study includes consistently applied reference standard and blinding; and prevalence study is a cross-sectional study that uses a local and current random sample or censuses. Acceptable quality leads to downgrade 1 level, low quality leads to downgrade 2 levels, and unacceptable quality has serious limitations — exclude from consideration in the guideline.

### Endothelial PPAR γ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ) is essential for preventing endothelial dysfunction with aging [^112fiinU]. Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Little is known about mechanisms that control vascular aging, particularly at the cell-specific level. PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ) exerts protective effects in the vasculature when activated pharmacologically. To gain insight into the cell-specific impact of PPARγ, we examined the hypothesis that genetic interference with endothelial PPARγ would augment age-induced vascular dysfunction. We studied carotid arteries from adult (11.6 ± 0.3 months) and old (24.7 ± 0.6 months) mice with endothelial-specific expression of a human dominant negative mutation in PPARγ driven by the vascular cadherin promoter (E-V290M), along with age-matched, nontransgenic littermates. Acetylcholine (an endothelium-dependent agonist) produced similar relaxation in arteries from adult nontransgenic and E-V290M mice and old nontransgenic mice. In contrast, responses to acetylcholine were reduced by > 50% in old male and female E-V290M mice (P < 0.01). Endothelial function in old E-V290M mice was not altered by an inhibitor of COX (cyclooxygenase) but was restored to normal by a superoxide scavenger, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, or inhibition of ROCK (Rho kinase). Relaxation of arteries to nitroprusside, which acts directly on vascular muscle, was similar in all groups. Vascular expression of IL (interleukin)-6, Nox-2, and CDKN2A (a marker of senescence) was significantly increased in old E-V290M mice compared with controls (P < 0.05). These findings provide the first evidence that age-related vascular dysfunction, inflammation, and senescence is accelerated after interference with endothelial PPARγ via mechanisms involving oxidative stress and ROCK. The finding of an essential protective role for endothelial PPARγ has implications for vascular disease and therapy for vascular aging.

### E-health and environmental sustainability in vascular surgery [^1117No6a]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

e-Health technology holds great promise for improving the management of patients with vascular diseases and offers a unique opportunity to mitigate the environmental impact of vascular care, which remains an under-investigated field. The innovative potential of e-Health operates in a complex environment with finite resources. As the expansion of digital health will increase demand for devices, contributing to the environmental burden of electronics and energy use, the sustainability of e-Health technology is of crucial importance, especially in the context of increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. This review discusses the environmental impact of care related to vascular surgery and e-Health innovation, the potential of e-Health technology to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions generated by the health care sector, and to provide leads to research promoting e-Heath technology sustainability. A multifaceted approach, including ethical design, validated eco-audits methodology and reporting standards, technological refinement, electronic and medical devices reuse and recycling, and effective policies is required to provide a sustainable and optimal level of care to vascular patients.

### Effective arterial elastance is insensitive to pulsatile arterial load [^115eDyxZ]. Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Effective arterial elastance (E(A)) was proposed as a lumped parameter that incorporates pulsatile and resistive afterload and is increasingly being used in clinical studies. Theoretical modeling studies suggest that E(A) is minimally affected by pulsatile load, but little human data are available. We assessed the relationship between E(A) and arterial load determined noninvasively from central pressure-flow analyses among middle-aged adults in the general population (n = 2367) and a diverse clinical population of older adults (n = 193). In a separate study, we investigated the sensitivity of E(A) to changes in pulsatile load induced by isometric exercise (n = 73). The combination of systemic vascular resistance and heart rate predicted 95.6% and 97.8% of the variability in E(A) among middle-aged and older adults, respectively. E(A) demonstrated a quasi-perfect linear relationship with the ratio of systemic vascular resistance/heart period (middle-aged adults, R = 0.972; older adults, R = 0.99; P < 0.0001). Aortic characteristic impedance, total arterial compliance, reflection magnitude, and timing accounted together for < 1% of the variability in E(A) in either middle-aged or older adults. Despite pronounced changes in pulsatile load induced by isometric exercise, changes in E(A) were not independently associated with changes pulsatile load but were rather a nearly perfect linear function of the ratio of systemic vascular resistance/heart period (R = 0.99; P < 0.0001). Our findings demonstrate that E(A) is simply a function of systemic vascular resistance and heart rate and is negligibly influenced by (and insensitive to) changes in pulsatile afterload in humans. Its current interpretation as a lumped parameter of pulsatile and resistive afterload should thus be reassessed.

### Classification vs diagnostic criteria: the challenge of diagnosing axial spondyloarthritis [^114db4QU]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In recent years, significant progress has been made in improving the early diagnosis of spondyloarthritides (SpA), including axial SpA. Nonetheless, there are still issues related to the application of classification criteria for making the primary diagnosis of SpA in the daily practice. There are substantial conceptional and operational differences between the diagnostic vs classification approach. Although it is not possible to develop true diagnostic criteria for natural reasons as discussed in this review, the main principles of the diagnostic approach can be clearly defined: consider the pre-test probability of the disease, evaluate positive and negative results of the diagnostic test, exclude other entities, and estimate the probability of the disease at the end. Classification criteria should only be applied to patients with an established diagnosis and aimed at the identification of a rather homogeneous group of patients for the conduction of clinical research.

### Early-stage cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease and the influence of dopamine replacement therapy [^116HpvUw]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The aim of this study was to establish the cognitive profile of newly diagnosed untreated (de novo) patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and more advanced, treated patients, and to determine the effects of dopamine (DA) replacement therapy.

Methods

A cohort of 23 de novo patients, 55 mild to moderately advanced, medicated PD patients and 21 healthy controls participated. Cognitive tests included the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders and a battery of neuropsychological tests taken from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery and the Vienna Test System.

Results

De novo patients with PD were more impaired in working memory strategy use than healthy controls and treated patients with PD. Furthermore, the generation of random motor behaviour was more impaired in both de novo and treated PD patients than in healthy controls. Correlation analysis revealed that in treated patients with PD, ascending doses of dopaminergic medication were associated with poorer performance on a pattern recognition task.

Conclusion

Selective impairments in strategy use and the generation of random motor behaviour are a very early feature of PD and might be of predictive value in further frontal cognitive deterioration. Furthermore, DA replacement therapy seems to improve frontal lobe function (strategy use) and worsen temporal lobe function (visual memory).

### Critical closing pressure and cerebrovascular resistance responses to intracranial pressure variations in neurocritical patients [^113b1LGo]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Critical closing pressure is correlated with ICP variations and may aid in planning therapeutic interventions based on hemodynamic adjustments. An induced mild ICP elevation in the present study did not impact the CPP of craniectomized patients. These patients demonstrated elevated MAP response to ICP variation, despite the persistence of higher CVR, which may be interpreted as a protection mechanism provided by DC. Patients with ABI not submitted to neurosurgical procedures revealed a higher capacity of handling artificial ICP elevation, which may be attributed to less severe injury, appropriate ICC, and efficient compensatory reserve. These observations altogether reinforce the need for multimodal monitoring of the neurocritical patient.

### Decreased vascular reactivity associated with increased IL-8 in 6-month-old infants of mothers with pre-eclampsia [^114DDMje]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Offspring born to mothers with pre-eclampsia (Pre-E) suffer higher risks of adult cardiovascular diseases, suggesting that exposure to an antiangiogenic environment in-utero has a lasting impact on the development of endothelial function. The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that in-utero exposure to Pre-E results in alterations of angiogenic factors/cytokines that negatively impact vascular development during infancy.

Methods

Infants born from mothers with and without Pre-E were recruited and followed up at 6 months. Plasma cytokines, blood pressure, microvessel density, and vascular reactivity were assessed.

Results

6-month-old infants born to mothers with Pre-E had unchanged blood pressure (p = 0.86) and microvessel density (p = 0.57). Vascular reactivity was decreased in infants born to mothers with Pre-E compared to infants born to healthy mothers (p = 0.0345). Interleukin 8 (IL-8) (p = 0.03) and Angiopoeitin-2 (Ang-2) (p = 0.04) were increased in infants born to mothers with Pre-E. We observed that higher IL-8 was associated with lower vascular reactivity (rho = -0.14, p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

At 6 months of age, infants born to mothers with Pre-E had impaired vascular reactivity and higher IL-8 and Ang-2, but similar blood pressure and microvessel density compared to infants born to non-Pre-E mothers.

Impact Statement

Changes in cord blood antiangiogenic factors are documented in infants of mothers with pre-eclampsia and may contribute to offspring risks of adult cardiovascular disease. How these factors evolve during early infancy and their correlation with offspring vascular development have not been studied. This study found that 6-month-old infants born to mothers with pre-eclampsia had decreased vascular reactivity, which was correlated with higher IL-8. These findings underscore the lasting impact of maternal pre-eclampsia on offspring vascular development and highlight the need for long-term follow-up in children born to mothers with pre-eclampsia.

### Ventricular-vascular coupling at rest and after exercise is associated with heart failure hospitalizations in patients with coronary artery disease [^117YVkMn]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The ventricular-vascular coupling ratio, defined as the ratio of arterial elastance (Eₐ) to left ventricular end-systolic elastance (Eₑₛ), has not been examined in populations with coronary artery disease (CAD), and its association with heart failure (HF) in this population is unknown.

Methods

Ventricular-vascular coupling was measured at rest and after exercise using echocardiography and cuff blood pressure in 815 patients with stable CAD enrolled in the Heart and Soul Study. Adjusted Cox proportional-hazard models were used to evaluate the association between ventricular-vascular coupling and future HF hospitalizations.

Results

After a median of 8.9 years, 144 patients (18%) were hospitalized for HF. After multivariate adjustment, patients in the highest tertile of Eₑₛ (rest: hazard ratio [HR], 0.31 [95% CI, 0.17–0.57; P < .001]; exercise: HR, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.13–0.50; P < .001]) were at decreased risk for HF hospitalization, while patients in the highest tertile of the Eₐ/Eₑₛ ratio (rest: HR, 3.36 [95% CI, 1.91–5.93; P < .001]; exercise: HR, 4.09; [95% CI, 2.22–7.51; P < .001]) were at increased risk, compared with the lowest tertiles. Eₐ and the relative change observed in Eₑₛ and the Eₐ/Eₑₛ ratio with exercise were not associated with HF hospitalizations.

Conclusions

The Eₐ/Eₑₛ ratio and Eₑₛ, at rest and after exercise, are strongly associated with future HF hospitalizations in patients with stable CAD and low rates of baseline HF. Ventricular-vascular coupling obtained from echocardiography shows promise as a risk assessment tool for HF in patients with CAD.

### Application of a novel murine ear vein model to evaluate the effects of a vascular radioprotectant on radiation-induced vascular permeability and leukocyte adhesion [^112oa4Ph]. Radiation Research (2018). Low credibility.

Vascular injury after radiation exposure contributes to multiple types of tissue injury through a cascade of events. Some of the earliest consequences of radiation damage include increased vascular permeability and promotion of inflammation, which is partially manifested by increased leukocyte-endothelial (L/E) interactions. We describe herein a novel intravital imaging method to evaluate L/E interactions, as a function of shear stress, and vascular permeability at multiple time points after local irradiation to the ear. This model permitted analysis of quiescent vasculature that was not perturbed by any surgical manipulation prior to imaging. To evaluate the effects of radiation on vascular integrity, fluorescent dextran was injected intravenously and its extravasation in the extravascular space surrounding the ear vasculature was measured at days 3 and 7 after 6 Gy irradiation. The vascular permeability rate increased approximately twofold at both days 3 and 7 postirradiation (P < 0.05). Leukocyte rolling, which is indicative of L/E interactions, was significantly increased in mice at 24 h postirradiation compared to that of nonirradiated mice. To assess our model, as a means for assessing vascular radioprotectants, we treated additional cohorts of mice with a thrombopoietin mimetic, TPOm (RWJ-800088). In addition to stimulating platelet formation, thrombopoietin can protect vasculature after several forms of injury. Thus, we hypothesized that TPOm would reduce vascular permeability and L/E adhesion after localized irradiation to the ear vasculature of mice. If TPOm reduced these consequences of radiation, it would validate the utility of our intravital imaging method. TPOm reduced radiation-induced vascular leakage to control levels at day 7. Furthermore, L/E cell interactions were also reduced in irradiated mice treated with TPOm, compared with mice receiving irradiation alone, particularly at high shear stress (P = 0.03, Kruskal-Wallis). We conclude that the ear model is useful for monitoring quiescent normal tissue vascular injury after radiation exposure. Furthermore, the application of TPOm, for preventing early inflammatory response created by damage to vascular endothelium, suggests that this drug may prove useful in reducing toxicities from radiotherapy, which damage microvasculature that critically important to tissue function.

### Determining factors related to impaired spinal and hip mobility in patients with axial spondyloarthritis: longitudinal results from the DESIR cohort [^112V7JUg]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

We analysed longitudinal data from the DEvenir des Spondyloarthrites Indifférenciées Récentes (DESIR) cohort, collected during the first 5 years of follow-up. This is a prospective observational cohort of patients aged 18–50 years with recent onset (> 3 months, < 3 years) inflammatory back pain (Calin or the Berlin criteria), suggestive of axSpA (level of confidence ≥ 5/10), as previously described. We selected patients with a definite diagnosis of axSpA according to the treating rheumatologist, at the end of follow-up (month 60).

Mobility was assessed using the linear definition of BASMI (range 0–10, with higher scores reflecting worse mobility), and using the individual components of BASMI: tragus-to-wall distance (cm), cervical rotation (degrees), anterior lumbar flexion (modified Schöber; cm), lateral spinal flexion (cm) and maximal intermalleolar distance (cm). Disease activity was measured using the AS Disease Activity Score C reactive protein (ASDAS-CRP), a composite index that incorporates the assessment of four different domains (back pain, duration of morning stiffness, global assessment of disease activity, peripheral pain/swelling), scored on a 0–10 numeric rating scale by patients, plus an inflammatory marker (CRP). The concise Mander Enthesitis Score (cMES) with gradation was used to evaluate enthesitis involvement. This score considers 13 entheseal sites corresponding to mainly axial locations: left and right first costochondral joint, left and right seventh costochondral joint, left and right posterior superior iliac spine, left and right anterior superior iliac spine, left and right iliac crest, left and right proximal insertion of Achilles tendon and fifth lumbar spinous process. Each one of the sites is graded from 0 to 3 (0 = no pain; 1 = mild tenderness; 2 = moderate tenderness; 3 = wince or withdraw), the total range being from 0 to 39. The following entheseal sites (N = 7) were arbitrarily defined as 'pure axial sites' for the purpose of sensitivity analyses: left and right first costochondral joint, left and right seventh costochondral joint, left and right posterior superior iliac spine and fifth lumbar spinous process. Spinal MRI inflammation and sacroiliac joint (SIJ) MRI inflammation were assessed using the Berlin scoring system and the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) scoring system, respectively; spinal and hip radiographic structural damage were assessed using the modified Stoke AS Spinal Score (mSASSS)and the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Radiology Index for the hips (BASRI-hips; the mean score of both hips was used in the present study), respectively. Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARD) and anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs were assessed according to their intake in the 6 months before each visit (yes or no).

### De novo mutation in the dopamine transporter gene associates dopamine dysfunction with autism spectrum disorder [^113SvM91]. Molecular Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

De novo genetic variation is an important class of risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Recently, whole-exome sequencing of ASD families has identified a novel de novo missense mutation in the human dopamine (DA) transporter (hDAT) gene, which results in a Thr to Met substitution at site 356 (hDAT T356M). The dopamine transporter (DAT) is a presynaptic membrane protein that regulates dopaminergic tone in the central nervous system by mediating the high-affinity reuptake of synaptically released DA, making it a crucial regulator of DA homeostasis. Here, we report the first functional, structural and behavioral characterization of an ASD-associated de novo mutation in the hDAT. We demonstrate that the hDAT T356M displays anomalous function, characterized as a persistent reverse transport of DA (substrate efflux). Importantly, in the bacterial homolog leucine transporter, substitution of A289 (the homologous site to T356) with a Met promotes an outward-facing conformation upon substrate binding. In the substrate-bound state, an outward-facing transporter conformation is required for substrate efflux. In Drosophila melanogaster, the expression of hDAT T356M in DA neurons-lacking Drosophila DAT leads to hyperlocomotion, a trait associated with DA dysfunction and ASD. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that alterations in DA homeostasis, mediated by aberrant DAT function, may confer risk for ASD and related neuropsychiatric conditions.

### Formations of host fibers and bacteria in human temporal bones with otitis media [^116doAMC]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypothesis

In temporal bones with otitis media, fibrin and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) form a fibrous network with bacteria, which is involved in growth of bacterial clusters/biofilms and chronicity of disease.

Background

NETs and fibrin are important in host defense against pathogens; however, their role in otitis media is not well understood.

Methods

Eight human temporal bones with serous otitis media, 30 with serous-purulent otitis media, 7 with mucoid otitis media, 23 with mucoid-purulent otitis media (OM), 30 with purulent OM, and 30 with chronic otitis media were selected based on histopathologic findings. Fibrous material with bacteria was detected with hematoxylin-eosin, Gram-Weigert, and propidium iodide stains; and its composition was analyzed with immunohistochemistry.

Results

Extensive formations of fibrous material with bacteria were observed in 30% of temporal bones with serous-purulent otitis media, 29% with mucoid otitis media, 50% with mucoid-purulent OM, 57% with purulent OM, and 67% of temporal bones with histological evidence of chronic otitis media. Some of these formations showed large bacterial clusters or biofilms. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that fibrous structures were composed of fibrin or NETs.

Conclusions

Formations of fibrous material with bacteria were detected in human temporal bones with different types of otitis media. Inflammatory cells were observed mostly in areas with low presence of fibrous structures. The network of fibrous material seems to prevent clearance of bacteria by phagocytic cells and thus influences growth of bacterial clusters or biofilms. Fibrin and NETs may be important for the recurrences and chronicity of disease, and contribute to clogging of tympanostomy tubes in children.

### Ventricular-vascular coupling is predictive of adverse clinical outcome in paediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension [^1116VtRY]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study assessed the prognostic ability of pressure-derived ventricular–vascular coupling and demonstrated that both the original modified single beat method proposed by Takeuchi et al (Eₑₛ/Eₐ (Takeuchi)), and Eₑₛ/Eₐ developed by Kind et al (Eₑₛ/Eₐ (Kind)), is predictive of severe adverse outcomes in children with idiopathic or hereditary aetiology. The data presented show that Eₑₛ/Eₐ is a powerful tool that provides insight to both ventricular and vascular function that can be used in management and treatment of children with PAH.

### Ofloxaxin (ofloxacin) [^112cmQae]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Otitis Externa

The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of otitis externa is:

For pediatric patients (from 6 months to 13 years old): Five drops (0.25 mL, 0.75 mg ofloxacin) instilled into the affected ear once daily for seven days.
For patients 13 years and older: Ten drops (0.5 mL, 1.5 mg ofloxacin) instilled into the affected ear once daily for seven days.
The solution should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness which may result from the instillation of a cold solution. The patient should lie with the affected ear upward, and then the drops should be instilled. This position should be maintained for five minutes to facilitate penetration of the drops into the ear canal. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.

Acute Otitis Media in pediatric patients with tympanostomy tubes

The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients (from 1 to 12 years old) with tympanostomy tubes is:

Five drops (0.25 mL, 0.75 mg ofloxacin) instilled into the affected ear twice daily for ten days. The solution should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness which may result from the instillation of a cold solution. The patient should lie with the affected ear upward, and then the drops should be instilled. The tragus should then be pumped 4 times by pushing inward to facilitate penetration of the drops into the middle ear. This position should be maintained for five minutes. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.

Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media with perforated tympanic membranes

The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media with perforated tympanic membranes in patients 12 years and older is:

Ten drops (0.5 mL, 1.5 mg ofloxacin) instilled into the affected ear twice daily for fourteen days. The solution should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness which may result from the instillation of a cold solution. The patient should lie with the affected ear upward, before instilling the drops. The tragus should then be pumped 4 times by pushing inward to facilitate penetration into the middle ear. This position should be maintained for five minutes. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.

### Joint hypermobility syndrome [^112KJ5SC]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Although perceived as a rare condition, joint hypermobility syndrome is common. Its prevalence in rheumatology clinics is extremely high. Early estimates suggest that it may be the most common of all rheumatologic conditions. The problem lies in the general lack of awareness of the syndrome, its means of recognition, and the resultant failure to diagnose it correctly when present. It is a worldwide problem. This article provides an overview of hypermobility and hypermobility syndrome, stressing its multisystemic nature and the negative impact that it may have on quality of life, with particular reference to gastrointestinal involvement.

### Vascular endothelial adrenomedullin-RAMP2 system is essential for vascular integrity and organ homeostasis [^113qdFhV]. Circulation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Revealing the mechanisms underlying the functional integrity of the vascular system could make available novel therapeutic approaches. We previously showed that knocking out the widely expressed peptide adrenomedullin (AM) or receptor activity-modifying protein 2 (RAMP2), an AM-receptor accessory protein, causes vascular abnormalities and is embryonically lethal. Our aim was to investigate the function of the vascular AM-RAMP2 system directly.

Methods and Results

We generated endothelial cell-specific RAMP2 and AM knockout mice (E-RAMP2(-/-) and E-AM(-/-)). Most E-RAMP2(-/-) mice died perinatally. In surviving adults, vasculitis occurred spontaneously. With aging, E-RAMP2(-/-) mice showed severe organ fibrosis with marked oxidative stress and accelerated vascular senescence. Later, liver cirrhosis, cardiac fibrosis, and hydronephrosis developed. We next used a line of drug-inducible E-RAMP2(-/-) mice (DI-E-RAMP2(-/-)) to induce RAMP2 deletion in adults, which enabled us to analyze the initial causes of the aforementioned vascular and organ damage. Early after the induction, pronounced edema with enhanced vascular leakage occurred. In vitro analysis revealed the vascular leakage to be caused by actin disarrangement and detachment of endothelial cells. We found that the AM-RAMP2 system regulates the Rac1-GTP/RhoA-GTP ratio and cortical actin formation and that a defect in this system causes the disruption of actin formation, leading to vascular and organ damage at the chronic stage after the gene deletion.

Conclusions

Our findings show that the AM-RAMP2 system is a key determinant of vascular integrity and homeostasis from prenatal stages through adulthood. Furthermore, our models demonstrate how endothelial cells regulate vascular integrity and how their dysregulation leads to organ damage.

### Alterations in vascular function associated with the use of combustible and electronic cigarettes [^114brtXB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study provides new insights into the effects of tobacco product use on measures of vascular function in young, healthy adult individuals without CVD risk factors. The most recent nationally representative sample shows that the majority of adult e‐cigarette users are either former (36.5%) or current (22.1%) combustable cigarette smokers emphasizing the importance of understanding cardiovascular health measures in these groups. 32 Significantly, we found that e‐cigarette use either with or without combustible cigarette use was associated with a similar elevation of AIx, a measure of vascular stiffness, as compared with users of combustible cigarettes alone. Several measures of vascular function did not distinguish between tobacco product users and nonusers in young healthy adults. These data suggest that the abnormalities in vascular stiffness persist in e‐cigarette users and that, at least within the limitations of our cohort and measurement approaches, there was no evidence that the use of e‐cigarettes reduces cardiovascular injury, dysfunction, or harm associated with the use of combustible tobacco products. Further, ECs from combustible cigarette and e‐cigarette users had impaired A23187‐induced NO production, suggestive of EC dysfunction. With the diversity of tobacco products available and continuing to increase, methods to evaluate tobacco product–induced cardiovascular toxicity are needed. Our study suggests that measures of vascular stiffness, such as AIx, may be useful methods in evaluating novel tobacco product cardiovascular toxicity.

### Pre-hypertension: another' pseudodisease'? [^1117qk5L]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The data of Huang et al. clearly indicate that a blood pressure level currently defined as pre-hypertension is a significant marker of increased cardiovascular risk. However, we lack evidence that pre-hypertensive blood pressure itself is harmful and that an earlier intervention to reduce the blood pressure is beneficial in the absence of cardiovascular disease. Since pre-hypertensive individuals are at a high risk to progress to sustained hypertension, we advise periodic screening.

### Association between polymorphism in regulatory region of gene encoding tumour necrosis factor alpha and risk of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia: a case-control study [^114dzHPE]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Deposition of beta-amyloid in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease is thought to precede a chain of events that leads to an inflammatory response by the brain. We postulated that genetic variation in the regulatory region of the gene for the proinflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) leads to increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.

Methods

A polymorphism in the regulatory region of the TNF-alpha gene was analysed in a case-control study. The polymorphism (C-850T) was typed in 242 patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease, 81 patients with vascular dementia, 61 stroke patients without dementia, and 235 normal controls. These groups of individuals were also genotyped for the apolipoprotein E polymorphism, and the vascular dementia and stroke groups were typed at the HLA-DR locus.

Findings

The distribution of TNF-alpha genotypes in the vascular dementia group differed significantly from that in the stroke and normal control groups, giving an odds ratio of 2.51 (95% CI 1.49–4.21) for the development of vascular dementia for individuals with a CT or TT genotype. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the possession of the T allele significantly increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease associated with carriage of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele (odds ratio 2.73 [1.68–4.44] for those with apolipoprotein E epsilon4 but no TNF-alpha T, vs 4.62 [2.38–8.96] for those with apolipoprotein E epsilon4 and TNF-alpha T; p = 0.03).

Interpretation

Possession of the TNF-alpha T allele significantly increases the risk of vascular dementia, and increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease associated with apolipoprotein E. Although further research is needed, these findings suggest a potential role for anti-inflammatory therapy in vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and perhaps especially in patients who have had a stroke.

### Accurate quantitative measurements of brachial artery cross-sectional vascular area and vascular volume elastic modulus using automated oscillometric measurements: comparison with brachial artery ultrasound [^116RbE9r]. Hypertension Research (2015). Low credibility.

Automated measurements of Vₑ

The rest Vₑ showed good reproducibility. This reproducibility is similar to that for other vascular functional evaluations.

Arterial elastic mechanics including Vₑ are linked to arterial stiffness. Bank et al. reported that brachial artery elastic mechanics accurately evaluated vascular stiffness over a wide range of BP and vascular smooth muscle tone. Therefore, Vₑ should be examined in clinical practice. However, previous methods of doing so were either complex or invasive. The current oscillometric approach may build on these previous studies and may allow for practical measurements of vascular elasticity in clinical settings or epidemiological study settings.

Vₑ was also reduced under NTG stress. NTG dilates brachial arteries by causing smooth muscle relaxation. The oscillometric system automatically detected changing vascular tone with NTG, and these data agree with those from the previous study by Bank et al. The current data may imply that this approach could be used to detect anatomical and functional change during NTG stress.

### Alterations in vascular function associated with the use of combustible and electronic cigarettes [^1143JRMf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

E‐cigarettes have gained popularity among adult smokers seeking to reduce their consumption of or quit combustible cigarettes. 1, 2, 3 Many users and public health activists view e‐cigarettes as safer alternatives to combustible cigarettes because these products contain a limited number of ingredients (nicotine, propylene glycol/glycerin, and in many cases flavoring additives) compared with combustible tobacco products. The perception that e‐cigarettes are safer than combustible cigarettes is widespread, with the majority of adult e‐cigarette users reporting that the primary reason for use is the perception that e‐cigarettes pose less of a health risk than combustible cigarette smoking. 1 Consequently, e‐cigarettes have drawn significant attention as a potential way to reduce harm. However, it is unclear whether e‐cigarettes are a safer alternative to combustible cigarettes.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality among combustible cigarette smokers. 4, 5 Smoking combustible cigarettes exposes the cardiovascular system to inhaled toxins and leads to widespread changes in vascular function that are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. 6, 7, 8, 9 Vascular dysfunction, associated with smoking combustible cigarettes, is characterized by impaired endothelial function and increased vascular stiffness, both of which are predictive of adverse cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. 10, 11, 12 Although smoke generated from combustible cigarettes generates a wide range of harmful or potentially harmful substances, the increased cardiovascular risk associated with smoking has largely been attributed to reactive aldehydes such as acrolein, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde. 13 Importantly, such aldehydes have also been found in e‐cigarette–generated aerosol, 13, 14, 15, 16 although their contribution to the cardiovascular effects of e‐cigarette use remains unknown.

To gain early evidence of the cardiovascular effects of e‐cigarettes, we performed a cross‐sectional study (the CITU [Cardiovascular Injury due to Tobacco Use] study) of nonsmokers, combustible cigarette users, e‐cigarette users, and dual combustible and e‐cigarette users. The objective of this study was to compare vascular function between combustible cigarette users and users of e‐cigarettes, alone or with contemporaneous use of combustible cigarettes.

### Effects of low doses of esmolol on cardiac and vascular function in experimental septic shock [^1177e3cU]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Administration of a selective β1-blocker, such as esmolol, in human septic shock has demonstrated cardiovascular protective effects related to heart rate reduction. Certain experimental data also indicate that esmolol exerts systemic anti-inflammatory and beneficial effects on vascular tone. Thus, the present study aimed to determine whether a non-chronotropic dose of esmolol maintains its protective cardiovascular and anti-inflammatory effects in experimental septic shock.

Methods

Four hours after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), Wistar male rats were randomly allocated to the following groups (n = 8): CLP, CLP+E-1 (esmolol: 1 mg.kg -1 .h -1), CLP+E-5 (esmolol: 5 mg.kg -1 .h -1), CLP+E-18 (esmolol: 18 mg.kg -1 .h -1). An additional eight rats underwent sham operation. All rats received a continuous infusion of saline, analgesic and antibiotics 4 hours after the surgery. Assessment at 18 hours included in vivo cardiac function assessed by echocardiography and ex vivo vasoreactivity assessed by myography. Circulating cytokine levels (IL-6 and IL-10) were measured by ELISA. Cardiac and vascular protein expressions of p-NF-κB, IκBα, iNOS, p-AKT/AKT and p-eNOS/eNOS were assessed by western blotting.

Results

CLP induced tachycardia, hypotension, cardiac output reduction, hyperlactatemia and vascular hypo-responsiveness to vasopressors. Compared to CLP animals, heart rate was unchanged in CLP+E-1 and CLP+E-5 but was reduced in CLP+E-18. Stroke volume, cardiac output, mean arterial pressure and lactatemia were improved in CLP+E-1 and CLP+E-5, while vascular responsiveness to phenylephrine was only improved in CLP+E-5 and CLP+E-18. Plasma IL-6 levels were decreased in all esmolol groups. p-NF-κB was decreased in both cardiac and vascular tissues in CLP+E-5 and CLP+E-18.

Conclusion

In experimental septic shock, low doses of esmolol still improved cardiac function and vasoreactivity. These benefits appear to be associated with a modulation of inflammatory pathways.

### Cochlear changes in chronic otitis media [^113YtJyJ]. The Laryngoscope (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

The objective was to describe the morphological changes in the cochlea in chronic otitis media.

Study Design

Retrospective human temporal bone analysis.

Methods

Fifteen temporal bones with unilateral chronic otitis media were selected and compared with contralateral normal temporal bones. Standard cytocochleograms and spiral ganglion cell reconstructions were performed on all temporal bones. Spiral ligament was divided into four segments according to the locations of different types of fibrocytes. The average loss of fibrocytes in each segment was estimated. Morphometric measurements of areas of stria vascularis and spiral ligament were made in all turns of the cochlea on mid modiolar sections.

Results

Loss of outer and inner hair cells was common in the basal turn of the cochlea in temporal bones with chronic otitis media compared with control ears. There was no difference in the number of spiral ganglion cells in the chronic otitis media and contralateral ears. The areas of stria vascularis and spiral ligament in the basal turn decreased significantly in the ears with chronic otitis media compared with control ears. There were no significant differences between the ears with chronic otitis media and the contralateral ears for any of the regions characterized by the presence of types I-IV fibrocytes.

Conclusion

The results of the study are consistent with the hypothesis that chronic otitis media causes cochlear disease.

### Is the presence of neck pain associated with more severe clinical presentation in patients with migraine? A cross-sectional study [^112Vew4d]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the association between the presence of self-reported neck pain in patients with migraine and clinical features, upper cervical mobility, and neck muscle performance.

Methods

A total of 142 patients with migraine were recruited and stratified by the presence (n = 99) or absence of self-reported neck pain (n = 43). The clinical examination included the Migraine Disability Assessment, the 12-item Allodynia Symptom Checklist, a flexion rotation test, and the Craniocervical Flexion Test.

Results

Migraine-related disability was reported by more than 80% in both groups (p = 0.82). However, there was a greater prevalence and severity of cutaneous allodynia observed in the group with neck pain (p < 0.001). Reduced upper cervical mobility was verified in 67% of the patients with neck pain and in 41% of those without neck pain (p = 0.005). In addition, 67% of the patients with neck pain and 40% without neck pain were not able to maintain the third stage of the Craniocervical Flexion Test without compensation (p = 0.003).

Conclusions

The presence of self-reported neck pain in patients with migraine was associated with a poor clinical presentation regarding cutaneous allodynia, neck mobility, and muscle function. However, there were no differences in migraine-related disability.

### Cerebral perfusion pressure and risk of brain hypoxia in severe head injury: a prospective observational study [^1154RoYK]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Higher and lower cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) thresholds have been proposed to improve brain tissue oxygen pressure (PtiO2) and outcome. We study the distribution of hypoxic PtiO2 samples at different CPP thresholds, using prospective multimodality monitoring in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.

Methods

This is a prospective observational study of 22 severely head injured patients admitted to a neurosurgical critical care unit from whom multimodality data was collected during standard management directed at improving intracranial pressure, CPP and PtiO2. Local PtiO2 was continuously measured in uninjured areas and snapshot samples were collected hourly and analyzed in relation to simultaneous CPP. Other variables that influence tissue oxygen availability, mainly arterial oxygen saturation, end tidal carbon dioxide, body temperature and effective hemoglobin, were also monitored to keep them stable in order to avoid non-ischemic hypoxia.

Results

Our main results indicate that half of PtiO2 samples were at risk of hypoxia (defined by a PtiO2 equal to or less than 15 mmHg) when CPP was below 60 mmHg, and that this percentage decreased to 25% and 10% when CPP was between 60 and 70 mmHg and above 70 mmHg, respectively (p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Our study indicates that the risk of brain tissue hypoxia in severely head injured patients could be really high when CPP is below the normally recommended threshold of 60 mmHg, is still elevated when CPP is slightly over it, but decreases at CPP values above it.

### Predicting depression and anxiety of Chinese population during COVID-19 in psychological evaluation data by XGBoost [^115TW8ze]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Due to the onset of sudden stress, COVID-19 has greatly impacted the incidence of depression and anxiety. However, challenges still exist in identifying high-risk groups for depression and anxiety during COVID-19. Studies have identified how resilience and social support can be employed as effective predictors of depression and anxiety. This study aims to select the best combination of variables from measures of resilience, social support, and alexithymia for predicting depression and anxiety.

Methods

The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost 1) model was applied to a dataset including data on 29,841 participants that was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Discriminant analyses on groups of participants with depression (DE 2), anxiety (AN 3), comorbid depression and anxiety (DA 4), and healthy controls (HC 5), were performed. All variables were selected according to their importance for classification. Further, analyses were performed with selected features to determine the best variable combination.

Results

The mean accuracies achieved by three classification tasks, DE vs HC, AN vs HC, and DA vs HC, were 0.78, 0.77, and 0.89. Further, the combination of 19 selected features almost exhibited the same performance as all 56 variables (accuracies = 0.75, 0.75, and 0.86).

Conclusions

Resilience, social support, and some demographic data can accurately distinguish DE, AN, and DA from HC. The results can be used to inform screening practices for depression and anxiety. Additionally, the model performance of a limited scale including only 19 features indicates that using a simplified scale is feasible.

### The original pathologische anatomie Leiden-Endothelium monoclonal antibody recognizes a vascular endothelial growth factor binding site within neuropilin-1 [^1125fWBB]. Cancer Research (2007). Low credibility.

For two decades, the antigen recognized by the Pathologische Anatomie Leiden-Endothelium (PAL-E) monoclonal antibody, a standard vascular endothelial cell marker, has remained elusive. Here, we used a combinatorial phage display-based approach ("epitope mapping") to select peptides binding to the original PAL-E antibody. We found that a subset of the selected panel of peptides had motifs with strong homology to an exposed site within the b1 domain of human neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). We confirmed peptide binding by ELISA and by surface plasmon resonance. We also showed that the PAL-E antigen colocalizes with NRP-1 staining in endothelial cells. Crystal structure of the b1 domain in NRP-1 suggests that the PAL-E binding site overlaps with a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) binding site. Taken together, these results indicate that NRP-1 is an endothelial cell antigen recognized by the true PAL-E antibody. The consistent biochemical, morphologic, and functional features between the PAL-E antigen and NRP-1 support our interpretation. Given that NRP-1 is a VEGF receptor, these results explain the attributes of the PAL-E antibody as a marker of vascular permeability and angiogenesis.

### Increase in body temperature during migraine attacks [^111j1Py6]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Intermittent fever has been occasionally related to migraine, either as a migraine equivalent or as a migraine accompaniment. We present a case of recurrent increase in body temperature consistently associated with migraine headaches.

Methods

A 15-year-old girl reported a 3-year lasting history of migraine without aura, with a feeling of warmth occurring in each episode. Ancillary tests did not show any evidence of secondary headaches or any systemic disease. A 2-month headache diary was obtained, with daily records of headache intensity (0, no headache; 1, mild pain; 2, moderate pain; 3, severe pain) and simultaneous measurements of axillary temperature. Both parameters were registered in the evening, at 6:00 pm every day. The distribution of headache intensity and body temperature as well as the relationship between both variables over time were analyzed with nonparametric tests.

Results

The number of days without pain was 28 (45.2%); a mild headache was present on 13 days (21%), a moderate headache on 15 days (24.2%), and a severe headache on 6 days (9.7%). Headache days were associated with higher body temperature than headache-free days (median values: 37.3°C vs 36.6°C; Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.001). Moreover, a positive correlation was found between headache intensity and body temperature (Spearman's rho coefficient: 0.83, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Recurrent increase in body temperature may be another manifestation of the complex clinical spectrum of migraine. This symptom is probably related to hypothalamic involvement.

### Effects of aerobic exercise and obesity phenotype on abdominal fat reduction in response to weight loss [^113KZGm3]. International Journal of Obesity (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the effects on abdominal fat reduction of adding aerobic exercise training to a diet program and obesity phenotype in response to weight loss.

Design

A prospective clinical trial with a 14-week weight-loss intervention design.

Setting and Participants

In total, 209 overweight and obese women were assigned to four subgroups depending on type of treatment and the subject's obesity phenotype: diet alone (DA) with intra-abdominal fat (IF) obesity (≥ mean IF area), diet plus exercise (DE) with IF obesity, DA with abdominal subcutaneous fat (ASF) obesity (< mean IF area) and DE with ASF obesity. Abdominal fat areas were evaluated by CT scans, with values adjusted for selected variables.

Results

Values were adjusted for age, menopausal status and change in body weight and total fat mass. The IF reductions were significantly (P < 0.0001) greater in subjects with IF obesity phenotype (-45.1 cm2) compared to the ASF obesity phenotype (-22.2 cm2). The ASF reductions were significantly (P < 0.001) greater for subjects with ASF obesity (-74.5 cm2) compared to IF obesity (-55.5 cm2). For IF obesity, the IF reduction was significantly (P < 0.01) greater in the DE group (-49.3 cm2) than in the DA group (-37.8 cm2).

Conclusion

These results suggest that for individuals with IF obesity, the efficacy on reducing IF of adding aerobic exercise training to a diet-alone weight-reduction program is more prominent (-49.3 cm2/-37.8 cm2 = 1.3 times) compared with DA. Moreover, abdominal fat reduction was found to be modified by obesity phenotype in response to weight loss.

### Low-dose photodynamic therapy promotes vascular E-selectin expression in chest malignancies, improving immune infiltration and tumor control [^112K6j47]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Vascular E-selectin expression is associated with better survival in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma

In order to investigate the impact of vascular E-selectin on the survival of patients with PM, we analyzed a large number of tumor tissues from 82 patients with a total of 105 samples when including pre-treatment and post-treatment samples. Among these, 54 tumors presented an epithelioid, 21 a biphasic and 7 a sarcomatoid histology. In this cohort, 21 patients underwent surgical resection and similar chemotherapy regimens with matched pre-treatment (initial biopsy) and post-treatment (surgical specimen) samples. We first compared tumors with increased vascular E-selectin post-treatment (n = 13) compared with samples with decreased or stable E-selectin expression (n = 8) (figure 6A, online supplemental figure 10A). Patients with higher tumor-associated vascular E-selectin presented a better survival compared with patients with lower levels (median survival: 24 months vs 8 months, p = 0.0027, figure 6B). This change was significant in patients with epithelioid tumors (median survival: 24 months vs 9 months, p = 0.0007, figure 6C). In the biphasic and sarcomatoid subgroups, no survival analysis could be obtained because of sample under-representation in this surgical cohort. The median expression of vascular E-selectin across all subtypes was 2.18%. Patients with E-selectin expression higher than the median had significantly better survival compared with patients with lower than median expression. This observation was found when pooling all histologies and when considering epithelioid tumors (figure 6D, E). However, no difference was found in the biphasic or sarcomatoid tumor group (online supplemental figure 10B). Finally, VE-cadherin and non-vascular E-selectin expression had no impact on survival across different histologies (online supplemental figure 10C, D).

### Scanning electron microscopy in the evaluation of defects to the ossicular chain in the course of chronic otitis media [^115xgS39]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Chronic otitis media is a heterogeneous disorder. Chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma and, to a lesser extent, chronic otitis media with granulation lead to the destruction of bone structures within the middle ear. Bone loss may appear in the prominence of the horizontal semicircular canals and the bony canal of the facial nerve. The inflammatory process may spread to the bony labyrinth of the sigmoidal sinuses and the cranial cavities.

Materials and Methods

The analysis comprised the examination of fragments of auditory ossicles removed during surgery in 21 patients with various types of chronic inflammation of the middle ear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of scanning electron microscopy in evaluating the erosion of middle ear ossicles in different types of chronic otitis media. Images captured at various magnifications were used for the best possible illustration of the observed lesions in bone tissue.

Results

The observed lesions and the degree of bone surface damage were dependent on the type of chronic inflammation of the middle ear. The largest destructive changes in the ossicular chain were observed in chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma; smaller changes were observed in chronic otitis media with granulation.

Conclusion

In the case of damage to the ossicles inflicted by inflammation, the use of a modeled bone block made of a temporal bone taken from outside the tympanic cavity or a biomaterial prosthesis is a good choice in ossiculoplasty.

### 'Essential'arterial hypertension: time for a paradigm change [^111GtHhA]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

The exclusion of causes of hypertension is not systematically exploited in clinical practice. Therefore, essential hypertension is consistently presented as the most prevalent 'cause'. The paradox of a condition with unknown causes being described as a common cause of hypertension translates into a diagnosis of essential hypertension in most patients, which precludes the detection of a curable cause of hypertension. The aim of this review is to investigate how the notion of essential hypertension has developed and whether scientific evidence still support the notion of its high prevalence by examining the most recent studies. These studies provided solid scientific evidence that, when systematically sought for, secondary hypertension is quite common and that secondary hypertension is highly prevalent. The increased awareness should lead to a systematic search for, with the goal of curing or achieving a better control of high blood pressure, and ultimately improving patients' quality of life.
