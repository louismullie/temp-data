## Question

How does serum potassium level correlate with total body potassium, and what are the limitations of using serum potassium levels in diagnosing (intracellular) hypokalemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how serum potassium correlates with total body potassium and why serum potassium is an unreliable marker for diagnosing intracellular hypokalemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic physiology of potassium distribution and the concept of internal versus external balance. Then, I should quantify the extracellular-to-intracellular ratio and its clinical implications. Next, I will examine scenarios where serum potassium and total body potassium diverge, including transcellular shifts and chronic depletion states. After that, I should review special populations where this mismatch is common, such as CKD and DKA. Finally, I will synthesize the diagnostic limitations and propose a practical clinical approach, making sure I verify each claim against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental physiology. Potassium is predominantly intracellular, with roughly 98% of total body potassium residing inside cells and only about 2% in the extracellular fluid, which explains why serum potassium is a tiny, dynamic fraction of total stores and why small shifts in distribution can markedly change serum levels without changing total body potassium at all [^113WaB5S] [^notfound] [^115zcqHu].

> Wait, let me verify the quantitative relationship before drawing conclusions. Classic teaching notes that a mere 1% redistribution of potassium from intracellular to extracellular compartments can increase serum potassium by about 0.5–1.0 mmol/L, implying that a 1% total body potassium loss could produce profound serum hypokalemia even though 99% of body stores remain intact; I initially thought this meant a 1% loss equals a 50% change in plasma potassium, but hold on, I should correct that: the 50% change in plasma potassium comes from a 1% shift in distribution, not a 1% change in total body content, so I need to be precise here to avoid overstatement [^112zAvMR].

> I will now examine the internal balance mechanisms that uncouple serum from total body potassium. Insulin, catecholamines, and acid-base status rapidly modulate transcellular potassium flux; alkalosis drives potassium into cells and can lower serum potassium without any total body deficit, whereas acidosis shifts potassium out of cells and can mask a true total body potassium deficiency by keeping serum potassium normal or even high, so I should double-check that these are canonical examples of redistribution rather than true depletion or excess [^112zAvMR] [^114jUbxk] [^113x8xpj].

> Next, I should review the external balance side to ensure I'm not missing chronic depletion states. The kidneys ultimately determine long-term potassium balance, and sustained renal or gastrointestinal losses can produce large total body deficits that are only partially reflected by serum potassium; importantly, feedforward renal adaptations can begin conserving potassium even when serum potassium is still normal, meaning a normal serum potassium does not exclude early or moderate total body depletion, so I need to keep that in mind when interpreting "normal" results in high-risk patients [^112zAvMR] [^1162AKU9] [^113NFDQ5].

> Let me consider concrete clinical scenarios where serum and total body potassium diverge. In diabetic ketoacidosis, total body potassium is typically depleted, yet acidosis and insulin deficiency shift potassium extracellularly, so serum potassium may be normal or high on presentation; with insulin therapy, potassium shifts intracellularly and serum potassium can plummet, risking dangerous hypokalemia unless preemptively replaced, which is why guidelines advise checking potassium before insulin and being ready to replete aggressively [^1127ZiP1] [^111ppTRS] [^112CYaPu].

> Hold on, I should verify the chronic kidney disease paradox as well. Many patients with CKD or on hemodialysis exhibit total body potassium deficits despite frequent hyperkalemia, because uremic milieu, insulin resistance, and acidosis impair cellular potassium uptake; dialysis removes both extracellular and intracellular potassium, and low dialysate potassium or stringent dietary restriction can further deplete intracellular stores, so a high serum potassium in CKD may coexist with low total body potassium, which complicates interpretation and management [^113sjWHt] [^1131XGiV].

> I need to check other special contexts where redistribution dominates. During therapeutic hypothermia, potassium shifts intracellularly and serum potassium falls, sometimes to less than 3.0 mmol/L, even without true total body deficit; conversely, rewarming can provoke rebound hyperkalemia, so potassium targets and monitoring must be adjusted accordingly to avoid arrhythmias during temperature transitions [^1127bgax].

> Let me synthesize the diagnostic limitations now. Serum potassium is an inaccurate marker of total body potassium deficit because it reflects only the extracellular fraction and is highly sensitive to transcellular shifts; mild hypokalemia can accompany substantial total body deficits, and normal serum potassium can obscure clinically meaningful depletion, especially in the presence of acid-base disturbances or hormonal states that alter distribution, so I should confirm that relying on serum potassium alone risks both under- and overestimation of true deficits [^113NFDQ5] [^113WaB5S] [^114tYe6C].

> But wait, what if I try to use alternative markers to infer intracellular status. Red blood cell potassium has been proposed as a more representative index of cellular potassium, yet it remains a surrogate and is not routinely available or validated for broad clinical decision-making; similarly, whole-body potassium counting is feasible in research settings but impractical at the bedside, reinforcing that we must triangulate clinically rather than rely on a single test [^116fQXnY] [^1131XGiV].

> Next, I should review a practical clinical approach and make sure it aligns with guidelines. Diagnosis of potassium depletion should integrate the clinical history of intake and losses, medication review, acid-base assessment, and, when indicated, urinary potassium excretion to distinguish renal wasting from gastrointestinal or transcellular causes; in patients with persistent hypokalemia despite repletion, measuring 24-hour urinary potassium and assessing mineralocorticoid status can uncover ongoing renal losses that serum potassium alone will miss [^113NFDQ5] [^116uEiHT] [^112kmFAC].

> I should double-check treatment principles to avoid premature conclusions. Replacement should be titrated to severity and symptoms, with oral potassium preferred when feasible and intravenous therapy reserved for severe deficits, ECG changes, or inability to tolerate oral intake; importantly, correcting the underlying cause of renal or gastrointestinal losses and addressing acid-base disturbances are essential because otherwise potassium repletion may appear ineffective despite large doses, reflecting persistent redistribution or ongoing wasting rather than true refractoriness [^116c8DvS] [^113NFDQ5] [^112zAvMR].

> In summary, I need to ensure the core message is explicit: serum potassium correlates poorly with total body potassium because it represents only a small, dynamically shifting fraction of total stores; small redistribution can create large serum changes, and chronic depletion states may present with normal or even high serum potassium, so accurate assessment requires clinical context, acid-base evaluation, and, when appropriate, urinary potassium profiling rather than reliance on serum potassium alone [^113WaB5S] [^112zAvMR] [^113NFDQ5].

---

Serum potassium reflects only the extracellular fraction (~2% of total body potassium) and is an **unreliable surrogate** for intracellular stores [^113WaB5S]. Because most potassium is intracellular, serum levels can be normal despite significant total-body deficits, or low due to redistribution without true depletion [^114tYe6C]. Diagnosing intracellular hypokalemia from serum alone is limited by transcellular shifts, acid-base status, and medications; only direct intracellular measurement or clinical correlation can reliably detect it [^116fQXnY].

---

## Physiological distribution of potassium

- **Intracellular potassium**: ~98% of total body potassium is intracellular; ~2% is extracellular [^113WaB5S].
- **Extracellular potassium**: ~2% in plasma/ISF; serum potassium is tightly regulated at 3.5–5.0 mmol/L [^115zcqHu].
- **Transcellular shifts**: Insulin, catecholamines, and acid-base status rapidly move potassium in/out of cells, altering serum without changing total body potassium [^112zAvMR].

---

## Relationship between serum potassium and total body potassium

Serum potassium does not reliably reflect total body stores; a **1% shift** can change serum by ~0.5 mmol/L, and serum can be normal despite large deficits or high despite normal stores [^113NFDQ5] [^113x8xpj] [^114tYe6C]. Thus, serum potassium is an **unreliable surrogate** for total body potassium.

## Limitations of serum potassium in diagnosing intracellular hypokalemia

Serum potassium has several limitations for diagnosing intracellular hypokalemia:

| **Limitation** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Transcellular shifts | Insulin, catecholamines, and alkalosis shift K+ intracellularly, lowering serum without true depletion [^112zAvMR] |
| Acid-base status | Alkalosis lowers serum K+; acidosis raises it, masking deficits or excesses [^112RKM4X] |
| Medications | Diuretics, beta-agonists, and insulin can lower serum K+ without reflecting intracellular stores [^113NFDQ5] |
| Chronic adaptation | Chronic hypokalemia may normalize serum K+ via renal/adaptations, hiding intracellular deficits [^1162AKU9] |

---

## Clinical scenarios illustrating limitations

- **Diuretic therapy**: Serum K+ can be low despite modest total-body deficits due to renal losses and shifts [^114tYe6C].
- **Alkalosis**: Serum K+ can be low without true depletion from intracellular shifts [^113x8xpj].
- **Chronic hypokalemia**: Renal adaptations can normalize serum K+ despite persistent intracellular deficits [^1162AKU9].

---

## Alternative methods for assessing intracellular potassium

Given serum limitations, **alternative methods** include:

- **Muscle biopsy**: Direct intracellular K+ measurement, but invasive and impractical.
- **Red blood cell potassium**: Noninvasive surrogate; not widely available [^116fQXnY].
- **Clinical correlation**: Use history, exam, and labs (e.g. urinary K+, acid-base status) to infer intracellular deficits [^116uEiHT].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Clinical correlation**: Always interpret serum K+ with history, exam, and labs (e.g. urinary K+, acid-base status) [^116uEiHT].
- **Treat underlying causes**: Address causes and correct acid-base/metabolic disturbances [^112zAvMR].
- **Monitor response**: Track clinical and lab response to therapy, not just serum K+ [^113NFDQ5].

---

Serum potassium is an **unreliable marker** of intracellular potassium because it reflects only the extracellular fraction and is influenced by shifts, acid-base status, and medications. Accurate assessment requires clinical correlation and, when available, direct intracellular measures [^113WaB5S].

Hypokalemia is common and can be associated with serious adverse consequences, including paralysis, ileus, cardiac arrhythmias, and death. As a result, the body maintains serum potassium concentration within very narrow limits by tightly regulated feedback and feed-forward systems. Whereas the consequences of symptomatic hypokalemia and severe potassium depletion are well appreciated, chronic mild hypokalemia can accelerate the progression of chronic kidney disease, exacerbate systemic hypertension, and increase mortality. Persistent hypokalemia may reflect total-body potassium depletion or increased renal potassium clearance. In a patient with simple potassium depletion, potassium replacement therapy should correct serum potassium concentration, but may have little effect when renal potassium clearance is abnormally increased from potassium wasting. In such cases, the addition of potassium-sparing diuretics might be helpful. Serum potassium concentration is an inaccurate marker of total-body potassium deficit. Mild hypokalemia may be associated with significant total-body potassium deficits and conversely, total-body potassium stores can be normal in patients with hypokalemia due to redistribution. The speed and extent of potassium replacement should be dictated by the clinical picture and guided by frequent reassessment of serum potassium concentration(.) The goals of therapy should be to correct a potassium deficit, if present, without provoking hyperkalemia. Oral replacement is preferred except when there is no functioning bowel or in the setting of electrocardiogram changes, neurologic symptoms, cardiac ischemia, or digitalis therapy.

Electrolyte disorders are very common in the pediatric population. Derangements in serum sodium and potassium concentrations are among the most frequently seen given the risk factors and comorbidities unique to children. Pediatricians, in both outpatient and inpatient settings, should be comfortable with the evaluation and initial treatment of disturbances in these electrolyte concentrations. However, to evaluate and treat a child with abnormal serum concentrations of sodium or potassium, it is critical to understand the regulatory physiology that governs osmotic homeostasis and potassium regulation in the body. Comprehension of these basic physiologic processes will allow the provider to uncover the underlying pathology of these electrolyte disturbances and devise an appropriate and safe treatment plan.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^113hTA5U]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperkalemia:

- **Definition**: Hyperkalemia is defined as an increase in serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves disruptions in potassium balance due to excess potassium intake, impaired potassium excretion, or transcellular shifts. The etiology is often multifactorial, with impaired renal function, medication use, and hyperglycemia being the most common contributors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the US is estimated at 1,550 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Mild and moderate hyperkalemia are usually asymptomatic. Severe cases may manifest as muscle weakness, ascending paralysis, heart palpitations, and paresthesias. ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR-interval prolongation, widening of the QRS complex, and sine waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of hyperkalemia is dependent on the severity of the condition and the promptness of treatment. Severe untreated hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

### Potassium homeostasis [^112aMnj7]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Potassium homeostasis is essential for maintaining the normal resting membrane potential of excitable cells. Yet daily dietary potassium typically far exceeds total extracellular potassium, thus the body has elegant strategies to shift potassium into cells promptly after a meal and then the kidneys efficiently excrete potassium. Potassium excretion depends on adequate kidney perfusion and filtration, sodium delivery to the distal nephron and aldosterone action on the distal nephron. Both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia have been associated with an increase in mortality. In this piece, we share 5 challenging cases to explore normal potassium homeostasis and disorders that can lead to derangements in potassium balance or excretion.

### Hyperkalemia [^116MgUnZ]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening metabolic problem caused by inability of the kidneys to excrete potassium, impairment of the mechanisms that move potassium from the circulation into the cells, or a combination of these factors. Acute episodes of hyperkalemia commonly are triggered by the introduction of a medication affecting potassium homeostasis; illness or dehydration also can be triggers. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, hyperkalemia may be caused by the syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. The presence of typical electrocardiographic changes or a rapid rise in serum potassium indicates that hyperkalemia is potentially life threatening. Urine potassium, creatinine, and osmolarity should be obtained as a first step in determining the cause of hyperkalemia, which directs long-term treatment. Intravenous calcium is effective in reversing electrocardiographic changes and reducing the risk of arrhythmias but does not lower serum potassium. Serum potassium levels can be lowered acutely by using intravenous insulin and glucose, nebulized beta2 agonists, or both. Sodium polystyrene therapy, sometimes with intravenous furosemide and saline, is then initiated to lower total body potassium levels.

The following constitutes key background information on hypokalemia:

- **Definition**: Hypokalemia refers to the presence of serum potassium levels < 3.6 mmol/L.

- **Epidemiology**: Hypokalemia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice.
- **Disease course**: Manifestations of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, ileus, and cardiac arrhythmias. Typical electrocardiographic changes include flat or inverted T waves, ST-segment depression, and prominent U waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Severe untreated hypokalemia can lead to rhabdomyolysis and malignant cardiac arrhythmias, such as VT and VF.

### Hyponatremia and hypokalemia in patients on peritoneal dialysis [^112cbYAv]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia occurs in up to 60% of patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) for end-stage renal disease. It can be associated with poor clinical outcomes, including malnutrition and death. New evidence points to a link between hypokalemia and the risk of peritonitis. The serum Na(+) concentration is determined by the ratio of exchangeable Na(+) and K(+) to total body water. Hyponatremia may be caused by excessive thirst, a particular problem in patients on PD. Consistent with the relationship among the serum sodium concentration, total body cation content, and total body water, hyponatremia may also be caused by total body potassium depletion. Ultra-low sodium dialysis fluid may prove to have an important role in management of fluid overload and hypertension in patients on PD. Surprisingly, it is not associated with significant hyponatremia, for reasons that remain to be elucidated.

Potassium disorders are common in patients with kidney disease, particularly in patients with tubular disorders and low glomerular filtration rate. A multidisciplinary group of researchers and clinicians met in October 2018 to identify evidence and address controversies in potassium management. The issues discussed encompassed our latest understanding of the regulation of tubular potassium excretion in health and disease; the relationship of potassium intake to cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, with increasing evidence showing beneficial associations with plant-based diet and data to suggest a paradigm shift from the idea of dietary restriction toward fostering patterns of eating that are associated with better outcomes; the paucity of data on the effect of dietary modification in restoring abnormal serum potassium to the normal range; a novel diagnostic algorithm for hypokalemia that takes into account the ascendency of the clinical context in determining cause, aligning the educational strategy with a practical approach to diagnosis; and therapeutic approaches in managing hyperkalemia when chronic and in the emergency or hospital ward. In sum, we provide here our conference deliberations on potassium homeostasis in health and disease, guidance for evaluation and management of dyskalemias in the context of kidney diseases, and research priorities in each of the above areas.

PRECAUTIONS

General

The diagnosis of potassium depletion is ordinarily made by demonstrating hypokalemia in a patient with a clinical history suggesting some cause for potassium depletion. In interpreting the serum potassium level, the physician should bear in mind that acute alkalosis per se can produce hypokalemia in the absence of a deficit in total body potassium, while acute acidosis per se can increase the serum potassium concentration to within the normal range even in the presence of a reduced total body potassium. The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, requires careful attention to acid-base balance and appropriate monitoring of serum electrolytes, the electrocardiogram, and the clinical status of the patient.

Information for Patients

Physicians should consider reminding the patient of the following:

To take each dose with meals and with a full glass of water or other liquid.

To take this medicine following the frequency and amount prescribed by the physician. This is especially important if the patient is also taking diuretics and/or digitalis preparations.

To check with the physician if there is trouble swallowing tablets or if the tablets seem to stick in the throat.

To check with the physician at once if tarry stools or other evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding is noticed.

### Elevated serum potassium values: the role of preanalytic variables [^114s56JV]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Potassium is one of the most frequently tested analytes in the clinical laboratory. Because of its critical role in body homeostasis, laboratory errors that cause inaccurate potassium results can significantly affect patient safety. This review is limited to the spurious increase of serum potassium levels (pseudohyperkalemia), ie, instances of elevated potassium results that cannot be explained clinically and do not correspond to the status of the patient; when these specimens are recollected, potassium values usually drop substantially without clinical intervention. Because the workup of falsely elevated potassium levels consumes valuable health care resources and can result in patient care delays, it is essential to identify all variables that can cause pseudohyperkalemia, understand the mechanisms by which these variables affect serum potassium levels, and define corrective actions to ameliorate the problem. In most cases, increases in serum potassium are due to factors in the preanalytic phase of the testing cycle. The effect of patient-specific variables and variables related to specimen acquisition and processing, handling, and transport are discussed.

---

### The cardiovascular implications of hypokalemia [^116wBXWL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The role of potassium in the progression of cardiovascular disease is complex and controversial. Animal and human data suggest that increases in dietary potassium, decreases in urinary potassium loss, or increases in serum potassium levels through other mechanisms have benefits in several disease states. These include the treatment of hypertension, stroke prevention, arrhythmia prevention, and treatment of congestive heart failure. Recently, the discovery that aldosterone antagonists not only decrease sodium reabsorption and decrease potassium secretion in the nephron, but also decrease pathological injury of such nonepithelial tissues as the myocardium and endothelium, has generated great controversy regarding the actual mechanisms of benefit of these agents. We review the available data and draw conclusions about the relative benefits of modulating potassium balance versus nonrenal effects of aldosterone blockade in patients with cardiovascular disease.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115h7Ejq]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur when serum potassium levels are less than 3.5 mEq per L or greater than 5.0 mEq per L, respectively. The World Health Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day for optimal cardiovascular health. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased intake, renal losses, gastrointestinal losses, or transcellular shifts. Severe features of hypokalemia that require urgent treatment include a serum potassium level of 2.5 mEq per L or less, electrocardiography abnormalities, or neuromuscular symptoms. The underlying cause should be addressed, and potassium levels replenished. An oral route is preferred if the patient has a functioning gastrointestinal tract and a serum potassium level greater than 2.5 mEq per L. Hyperkalemia is caused by impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts, or increased potassium intake. Electrocardiography identifies cardiac conduction disturbances but may not correlate with serum potassium levels. Emergent treatment is recommended for patients with clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, paralysis) or if electrocardiography abnormalities are present. Acute treatment may include intravenous calcium, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, and beta agonists. Dialysis may be considered in the presence of end-stage renal disease, severe renal impairment, or ongoing potassium release. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer potassium binders and may be used in chronic or acute hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. Long-term management of potassium disturbances includes correcting underlying conditions, dietary counseling, and adjusting causative medications.

### The relationship between serum potassium, potassium variability and in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients and a before-after analysis on the impact of computer-assisted potassium control [^116LJxPz]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

In contrast to a large recent observational study on the relationship between potassium and outcome, we took into account both sides of potassium derangements, finding an increased mortality rate in both hypo- and hyperkalemia. Hypo- and hyperkalemia are associated with an increased risk of potentially fatal complications. Both either should be avoided in critically ill patients or should be rapidly corrected when severely deranged. The precise mechanisms that relate in-hospital mortality and potassium are not known. It has been proposed that mild abnormalities could be a marker of disease, whereas severe potassium derangements could be a cause of mortality. Mild hypo- and hyperkalemia are often asymptomatic. Cardiac dysfunction is frequently caused by worse abnormalities.

That the multivariate relationships of both mean potassium and potassium variability with mortality (Figure 2, Table 2) were as marked as those observed by others for glucose could be explained in at least two ways. One explanation could be that potassium variability has a direct causal relationship with outcome, such as through rapidly changing conditions in the cell membrane. A second explanation could be that a higher potassium variability, or, for that matter, variability of many other parameters, may be a marker of patient instability in general. Recently, it was reported that fluctuations in sodium were also associated with outcome. Until more mechanistic data are available, we believe the second, noncausal explanation is more appropriate. Regardless of whether it may be useful, the GRIP system was able to decrease potassium variability.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115KhjSU]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are common electrolyte disorders caused by changes in potassium intake, altered excretion, or transcellular shifts. Diuretic use and gastrointestinal losses are common causes of hypokalemia, whereas kidney disease, hyperglycemia, and medication use are common causes of hyperkalemia. When severe, potassium disorders can lead to life-threatening cardiac conduction disturbances and neuromuscular dysfunction. Therefore, a first priority is determining the need for urgent treatment through a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory, and electrocardiography findings. Indications for urgent treatment include severe or symptomatic hypokalemia or hyperkalemia; abrupt changes in potassium levels; electrocardiography changes; or the presence of certain comorbid conditions. Hypokalemia is treated with oral or intravenous potassium. To prevent cardiac conduction disturbances, intravenous calcium is administered to patients with hyperkalemic electrocardiography changes. Insulin, usually with concomitant glucose, and albuterol are preferred to lower serum potassium levels in the acute setting; sodium polystyrene sulfonate is reserved for subacute treatment. For both disorders, it is important to consider potential causes of transcellular shifts because patients are at increased risk of rebound potassium disturbances.

### Pathophysiology and management of hypokalemia: a clinical perspective [^112zAvMR]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Potassium (K(+)) ions are the predominant intracellular cations. K(+) homeostasis depends on external balance (dietary intake [typically 100 mmol per day] versus excretion [95% via the kidney; 5% via the colon]) and internal balance (the distribution of K(+) between intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments). The uneven distribution of K(+) across cell membranes means that a mere 1% shift in its distribution can cause a 50% change in plasma K(+) concentration. Hormonal mechanisms (involving insulin, β-adrenergic agonists and aldosterone) modulate K(+) distribution by promoting rapid transfer of K(+) across the plasma membrane. Extrarenal K(+) losses from the body are usually small, but can be marked in individuals with chronic diarrhea, severe burns or prolonged sweating. Under normal circumstances, the kidney's distal nephron secretes K(+) and determines final urinary excretion. In patients with hypokalemia (plasma K(+) concentration < 3.5 mmol/l), after the exclusion of extrarenal causes, alterations in sodium ion delivery to the distal nephron, mineralocorticoid status, or a specific inherited or acquired defect in distal nephron function (each of which affects distal nephron K(+) secretion), should be considered. Clinical management of hypokalemia should establish the underlying cause and alleviate the primary disorder. This Review aims to inform clinicians about the pathophysiology and appropriate treatment for hypokalemia.

To take each dose without crushing, chewing or sucking the tablets. If those patients are having difficulty swallowing whole tablets, they may try one of the following alternate methods of administration:

a. Break the tablet in half, and take each half separately with a glass of water.

b. Prepare an aqueous (water) suspension as follows:

1. Place the whole tablet(s) in approximately 1/2 glass of water (4 fluid ounces).

In interpreting the serum potassium level, the physician should bear in mind that acute alkalosis per se can produce hypokalemia in the absence of a deficit in total body potassium, while acute acidosis per se can increase the serum potassium concentration into the normal range even in the presence of a reduced total body potassium. The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, requires careful attention to acid-base balance and appropriate monitoring of serum electrolytes, the electrocardiogram, and the clinical status of the patient.

Information for patients

To minimize the possibility of gastrointestinal irritation associated with the oral ingestion of concentrated potassium salt preparations, patients should be directed to dissolve each dose completely in the stated amount of water.

Each dose should be taken immediately after a meal or with food. Patients should avoid low-salt foods and salt substitutes, unless approved by physician. The patient should be cautioned to comply strictly with the regimen, particularly when taking diuretics or digitalis, to visit the physician regularly and to report at once any unusual symptoms (e.g. blackish stools, a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding). As with any other medicine, the patient should be counseled on this background information and advised to report to the physician any changes in routine (e.g. starting a fitness program). Proper storage and handling of the product is important. Tablets should not be removed from foil pouch until shortly before use.

Laboratory tests

Frequent clinical evaluation of the patient should include an ECG and a serum potassium level; also, as appropriate, renal function, serum magnesium and serum pH.

Drug Interactions

The simultaneous administration of potassium supplements and a potassium-sparing diuretic can produce severe hyperkalemia (see Contraindications). Potassium supplements should be used cautiously in patients who are using salt substitutes, because most of the latter contain substantial amounts of potassium. Such concomitant use could result in hyperkalemia.

Moreover, the following drugs may produce unfavorable interactions when used concomitantly with potassium supplements: angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, heparin, low-salt foods, other potassium containing medications, digitalis glycosides and others.

### Narrative review: evolving concepts in potassium homeostasis and hypokalemia [^1162AKU9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Humans are intermittently exposed to large variations in potassium intake, which range from periods of fasting to ingestion of potassium-rich meals. These fluctuations would abruptly alter plasma potassium concentration if not for rapid mechanisms, primarily in skeletal muscle and the liver, that buffer the changes in plasma potassium concentration by means of transcellular potassium redistribution and feedback control of renal potassium excretion. However, buffers have capacity limits, and even robust feedback control mechanisms require that the perturbation occur before feedback can initiate corrective action. In contrast, feedforward control mechanisms sense the effect of disturbances on the system's homeostasis. This review highlights recent experimental insights into the participation of feedback and feedforward control mechanisms in potassium homeostasis. New data make clear that feedforward homeostatic responses activate when decreased potassium intake is sensed, even when plasma potassium concentration is still within the normal range and before frank hypokalemia ensues, in addition to the classic feedback activation of renal potassium conservation when plasma potassium concentration decreases. Given the clinical importance of dyskalemias in patients, these novel experimental paradigms invite renewed clinical inquiry into this important area.

### Serum potassium and adverse outcomes across the range of kidney function: a CKD prognosis consortium meta-analysis [^116ABgiW]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Both hypo- and hyperkalaemia can have immediate deleterious physiological effects, and less is known about long-term risks. The objective was to determine the risks of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and end-stage renal disease associated with potassium levels across the range of kidney function and evaluate for consistency across cohorts in a global consortium.

Methods and Results

We performed an individual-level data meta-analysis of 27 international cohorts [10 general population, 7 high cardiovascular risk, and 10 chronic kidney disease (CKD)] in the CKD Prognosis Consortium. We used Cox regression followed by random-effects meta-analysis to assess the relationship between baseline potassium and adverse outcomes, adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics, overall and across strata of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria. We included 1 217 986 participants followed up for a mean of 6.9years. The average age was 55 ± 16years, average eGFR was 83 ± 23mL/min/1.73 m², and 17% had moderate- to-severe increased albuminuria levels. The mean baseline potassium was 4.2 ± 0.4mmol/L. The risk of serum potassium of > 5.5mmol/L was related to lower eGFR and higher albuminuria. The risk relationship between potassium levels and adverse outcomes was U-shaped, with the lowest risk at serum potassium of 4–4.5mmol/L. Compared with a reference of 4.2mmol/L, the adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.22 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15–1.29] at 5.5mmol/L and 1.49 (95% CI 1.26–1.76) at 3.0mmol/L. Risks were similar by eGFR, albuminuria, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor use, and across cohorts.

Conclusions

Outpatient potassium levels both above and below the normal range are consistently associated with adverse outcomes, with similar risk relationships across eGFR and albuminuria.

### Prevalence of hypokalemia in ED patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^1127ZiP1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Although patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) are expected to have total body potassium depletion, measured levels may be normal or elevated due to extracellular shifts of potassium secondary to acidosis. Because insulin therapy decreases serum potassium levels, which creates potential to precipitate a fatal cardiac arrhythmia in a patient with hypokalemia, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends obtaining a serum potassium level before giving insulin. Although the ADA guidelines are clear, the evidence on which they are based is largely anecdotal. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of hypokalemia in patients with DKA before initiation of fluid resuscitation and insulin therapy.

Methods

This is a prospective cross-sectional descriptive study of patients with a capillary blood glucose level of 250 mg/dL or higher (at risk for DKA) seen in an urban county emergency department over a 1-year period. Those who consented provided basic demographic information and had a venous blood gas and chemistry panel drawn. Diabetic ketoacidosis and hypokalemia were defined using ADA recommendations.

Results

The mean age in our sample was 40.2 years, and 81% of patients were Hispanic. Of 503 analyzable patients with hyperglycemia, 54 (10.7%) met all criteria for DKA. Of patients with DKA, 3 (5.6%) of 54 (95% confidence interval, 1.2%-15.4%) had hypokalemia. Two of these patients had values of 3.0 mmol/L, and 1 had a value of 2.8 mmol/L.

Conclusion

Hypokalemia was observed in 5.6% of patients with DKA. These findings support the ADA recommendation to obtain a serum potassium before initiating intravenous insulin therapy in a patient with DKA.

### Novel bloodless potassium determination using a signal-processed single-lead ECG [^115QGZSX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Blood potassium levels are tightly regulated homeostatically and are critical for normal physiological cellular function. 1, 2 Fluctuations in potassium values are found in many disease states and can expose patients to life‐threatening arrhythmias. 3, 4, 5 Compelling evidence shows that in patients with renal or cardiac disease, even modest potassium changes may lead to morbidity, hospitalization, and death. 6 Moreover, evidence‐based therapies used to treat these conditions, including adrenergic blockade, potassium‐sparing diuretics, and renin–angiotensin antagonism, result in hyper‐ or hypokalemia. After the potassium‐sparing diuretic spironolactone was shown to lower heart failure mortality in a randomized prospective trial, hospitalization for hyperkalemia tripled and mortality doubled. 7 As the prevalence of these diseases and their risk factors (hypertension and diabetes) rise, and as the population continues to age, increasing numbers of patients will be at risk of hyper‐ and hypokalemia. 8, 9

### Severe hyperkalemia requiring hospitalization: predictors of mortality [^111cd3TY]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Potassium (K +) is a ubiquitous cation contained mostly within the intracellular fluid; only about 2% of total body K + is found in the extracellular fluid. In healthy humans, serum K + levels are tightly controlled within the narrow range of 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L, thus retaining a normal ratio between the intracellular and extracellular compartments. This homeostasis plays a critical role in maintaining cellular resting membrane potential and neuromuscular function and is essential for normal activity of muscles, nerves, and the heart. Hyperkalemia, resulting from an imbalance in K + homeostasis, is defined as a serum K + level of greater than 5.0 mEq/L and is further classified as mild, moderate, or severe. It has been reported that drug therapy and impaired renal function are the main factors predisposing to the development of hyperkalemia.

Severe hyperkalemia (K + of at least 6.5 mEq/L) is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder that has been reported to occur in 1% to 10% of all hospitalized patients, a higher percentage than that seen in outpatients. It is associated with electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, including peaked T waves, shortened QT intervals, prolonged PR intervals, reduction in the amplitude of P waves, and 'sine-wave' ventricular rhythms with wide QRS complexes. Severe hyperkalemia eventually causes fatal arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or asystole, leading to cardiac arrest. Severe hyperkalemia is a medical emergency and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality; it therefore requires hospitalization, ECG monitoring, and immediate treatment.

To promptly and effectively treat severe hyperkalemia, it is important to know the risk factors, the clinical manifestations, the therapeutic approaches, and the factors that predict both mortality and improvement in this disorder. Although most of these factors are well documented, reliable predictors of clinical outcomes such as in-hospital mortality have not been established. We therefore designed this study to identify common factors predisposing to severe hyperkalemia and to analyze the relationship between serum K + levels and clinical outcomes, including in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, we attempted to determine the association between in-hospital mortality and multiple clinical factors in patients with severe hyperkalemia.

### Personalizing potassium management in patients on haemodialysis [^113sjWHt]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

TOTAL BODY POTASSIUM

This editorial so far has focused on the effects of potassium interventions on the predialysis serum potassium concentration and the dialysate–serum potassium gradient. However, potassium is primarily an intracellular cation, where it plays a crucial role in cellular function. Therefore, it is also important to consider how interventions change intracellular potassium concentration and total body potassium, and how this relates to outcomes (Figure 1). Measurement of intracellular electrolyte concentrations and whole-body counting of naturally radioactive potassium can be used to provide insight into the 'black box' of the intracellular compartment. Unexpectedly, such measurements reveal that patients with CKD or patients on haemodialysis often have a total body potassium deficit, despite their tendency to develop hyperkalaemia (Figure 2). For example, the intracellular potassium concentration and the resting membrane potential were lower in muscle cells of patients with CKD compared with healthy subjects. The initiation of haemodialysis normalized intracellular potassium, but did not improve the resting membrane potential. Similarly, total body potassium is up to 10% lower in haemodialysis patients compared with control subjects (Figure 2). When patients transit from predialysis care to haemodialysis, total body potassium was restored in some patients, whereas in others it decreased. Preliminary data suggest that total body potassium depletion is also associated with increased mortality (Figure 1). Because more than 60% of potassium removal derives from the intracellular compartment, dialysis may contribute to reducing total body potassium. In this regard, the combination of a low potassium diet and a low dialysate potassium concentration may exhaust intracellular potassium stores. Of note, hyperkalaemia and total body potassium deficiency may co-exist if factors prevent the entry of potassium into cells. Such factors are not uncommon in haemodialysis patients and include metabolic acidosis, insulin resistance and the use of beta-blockers (Figure 1). Of interest, a high dialysate sodium also contributes to the interdialytic increase in serum potassium because hypertonicity causes a shift of potassium out of cells. Conversely, one could postulate that a higher dialysate potassium may improve sodium removal during haemodialysis and contributes to better blood pressure control. To this end, we are currently conducting a cross-over study to compare the effects of a dialysate potassium of 4.0 mmol/L with 2.0 mmol/L on blood pressure, volume and intracellular sodium and potassium.

### Hyperkalemia is associated with increased mortality among unselected cardiac intensive care unit patients [^111ANsXb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

As with all retrospective cohort studies, our study has several limitations, including the inability to establish a causal relationship between abnormal admission potassium and mortality and the potential for unmeasured residual confounding factors. This tertiary referral hospital CICU population may differ significantly from other populations, although the prevalence of ACS and HF diagnoses are similar to recent CICU studies. 25 To facilitate early risk stratification, we focused on admission potassium levels, which included laboratory values from either before or after CICU admission, potentially contributing to data variability. The potassium levels we analyzed included serum, plasma, and whole blood values, which have different reference ranges and analytic techniques, and we were unable to determine which patients had potassium levels measured by which assay or the reasons that a different assay may have been used in each patient. While it remains possible that these differences in analytical technique could have influenced the observed relationship between potassium levels and mortality, the differences between the different potassium levels are relatively modest and unlikely to impact the results meaningfully. Furthermore, the rate and magnitude of change in potassium levels over time could have influenced the effects on outcomes, but we did not have preadmission potassium levels for comparison, nor did we have the time of the peak and nadir potassium levels to determine the rate of increase in its level. The secondary analysis evaluating maximum and minimum potassium levels during the CICU stay could potentially be confounded by mixing patients with low admission potassium levels and a normal maximum potassium level with patients whose potassium levels were normal at all times or mixing patients with high admission potassium levels and normal minimum potassium levels with patients whose potassium levels were normal at all times. Based on available data, we cannot determine the ways in which admission potassium levels could have influenced patient care. We specifically were not able to obtain data on medications administered while in the hospital, including potassium supplementation, guideline‐directed medical therapy, or treatments administered for hypokalemia. We do not have specific data on adverse events directly related to high or low potassium levels, including treatment‐emergent arrhythmias. The ICD‐9 discharge diagnoses we obtained reflect all diagnoses from the hospitalization, including both acute and chronic conditions. Furthermore, despite careful multivariate adjustment, unmeasured confounding could remain to explain the observed associations between hyperkalemia and mortality.

2 SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND

2.1 Definition of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can be classified as acute (as occurring in an emergent setting), chronic, or recurrent, depending on the onset and number of hyperkalemia episodes that have occurred. The decision of whether emergency therapy is warranted is largely based on subjective clinical judgement. The lack of robust and evidence‐based treatment guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department poses a challenge for treatment.

Although the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and other organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Hearth Failure Society of America (HFSA)have issued guidelines, the concentration of potassium that is labelled as hyperkalemia varies. Serum potassium concentrations of 5.0,5.5, or 6.0 mmol/Lare commonly used cutoffs for the definition of hyperkalemia.

The KDIGO controversies' conference report defines the severity of hyperkalemia by both serum potassium concentration and ECG changes. The most common ECG change is peaked T waves, followed by QRS prolongation. Hyperkalemia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on potassium concentration and the presence or absence of ECG changes. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 5.0–5.9 mmol/L are typically defined as mild and ≥ 6.0–6.4 mmol/L as moderate. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 6.5 mmol/L are typically defined as severe.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the potassium chloride oral solution with at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia

Daily dose ranges from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses; limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24-hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hypokalemia [^116uEiHT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte disorder. Transient causes of hypokalemia are due to cell shift, whereas sustained hypokalemia is caused by either inadequate intake or excessive potassium loss. Evaluation of the intake, distribution, and excretion of potassium should include the following: (1) a careful history, including use of drugs, medications, and the presence of vomiting or diarrhea; (2) physical examination, including orthostatic changes in blood pressure and heart rate; and (3) measurement of urine and plasma electrolytes. Urinary potassium wasting is caused by pathophysiologic conditions that couple increased distal sodium delivery with increased plasma aldosterone levels or aldosterone-like effects. If urinary potassium loss is identified, the next step is to determine whether the loss is caused by a primary increase in distal delivery of sodium or a primary increase in mineralocorticoid level. A primary increase in distal delivery should be associated with volume depletion, whereas a primary increase in mineralocorticoid level generally is associated with volume expansion and hypertension. In patients with a primary increase in mineralocorticoid activity, it is useful to measure plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone levels. Complications of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmias, impaired urinary concentrating ability, and glucose intolerance.

### Where Do the salt and water Go? A case of profound hyponatremia [^112PdBSU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of profound hyponatremia is challenging. Severe symptoms mandate correction by 4 to 6 mEq/L within hours, but with risk factors for osmotic demyelination, daily correction should be < 8 mEq/L. With a therapeutic window this narrow, clinicians would like to know how serum sodium (SNa) concentration will respond to their therapy. Based on isotopic measurements, Edelman showed SNa level to be a function of exchangeable sodium and potassium divided by total-body water. Edelman defined this relationship with linear regression yielding an equation of the form y = mx + b, where y is SNa level, x is exchangeable sodium and potassium divided by total-body water, m is the slope, and b is the intercept. Edelman said that the intercept of his regression "probably is a measure of the quantity of osmotically inactive exchangeable sodium and potassium per unit of body water". Predictive formulas are derived from Edelman's original linear regression, some including and some omitting the regression's intercept. We illustrate the performance and limitations of these formulas using comprehensive data for electrolyte and fluid balance obtained during the treatment of a critically patient who presented with an SNa concentration of 101 mEq/L.

### Hyperkalemia treatment standard [^11415M5d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disturbance in both inpatient and outpatient clinical practice. The severity and associated risk depends on the underlying cause and rate of potassium (K+) increase. Acute hyperkalemia requires immediate attention due to potentially life-threatening manifestations resulting from the rapid increase in plasma K+ concentration. Treatment is initially focused on stabilizing the cardiac membrane, followed by maneuvers to shift K+ into the cells, and ultimately initiating strategies to decrease total body K+ content. Chronic hyperkalemia develops over a more extended period of time and manifestations tend to be less severe. Nevertheless, the disorder is not benign since chronic hyperkalemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The approach to patients with chronic hyperkalemia begins with a review of medications potentially responsible for the disorder, ensuring effective diuretic therapy and correcting metabolic acidosis if present. The practice of restricting foods high in K+ to manage hyperkalemia is being reassessed since the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this strategy is lacking. Rather, dietary restriction should be more nuanced, focusing on reducing the intake of nonplant sources of K+. Down-titration and/or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors should be discouraged since these drugs improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and proteinuric kidney disease. In addition to other conservative measures, K+ binding drugs and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors can assist in maintaining the use of these drugs.

2 REGULATION OF POTASSIUM HOMEOSTASIS

Potassium is a very important electrolyte for the maintenance of the physiologic cell function. Approximately 2% of total‐body K+ is in extracellular fluid, whereas 98% of K+ is in the intracellular compartment. Cellular Na + ‐K + ‐ATPase plays a key role in this homeostasis by pumping Na + out of the cell and K + into the cell and this process leads to a K + gradient across the cell membrane which is vitally important for normal cellular function. The body has developed numerous mechanisms for maintaining serum K + in a narrow range and kidney is the organ with the primary responsibility of this and adjustments in renal K + excretion occur over several hours. Serum potassium homeostasis is usually preserved until GFR is reduced substantially.

There are several mechanisms regulating potassium secretion and potassium reabsorption. K + is freely filtered across the glomerulus and then reabsorbed by the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb of the kidney. The shift in lumen potential from negative to positive in the proximal tubule provides a driving force for K + reabsorption. In the thick ascending limb, K + reabsorption is mediated mostly by the Na + ‐K + ‐2Cl − cotransporter located on the apical membrane while a small proportion is reabsorpted through the paracellular pathway. Important factors for this regulation include luminal sodium delivery and flow rate, plasma potassium concentration, circulating aldosterone and arginine vasopressin, and acid‐base status. Αldosterone, angiotensin II, distal delivery of Na + and water are key factors in the renal excretion of K +. Angiotensin II‐mediated stimulation of aldosterone secretion from the adrenal gland control renal blood flow and GFR and therefore potassium balance. Decreased renal excretion of K + can be due to a decreased distal delivery of Na +, mineralocorticoid deficiency, and/or abnormal cortical collecting tubule function. In addition, catecholamines through β 2 ‐stimulation regulate extracellular K + concentration. K + homeostasis mechanisms are also modulated in the gut and ranges according to potassium intake through diet.

### Association between serum potassium and 28-day mortality in elderly patients with sepsis: a multicenter cohort study [^112d5oBd]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In multivariable analyses, serum potassium demonstrated a significant association with 28-day ICU mortality (Table 3). When analyzed as a continuous variable, each 1 mmol/L increase in serum potassium was associated with higher odds of mortality in the unadjusted model (OR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.54–1.77]; P < 0.001). This association persisted after adjusting for age and sex (OR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.55–1.77]; P < 0.001) and further adjustment for serum creatinine (OR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.41–1.63]; P < 0.001). In the fully adjusted model, which accounted for demographics, comorbidities, disease severity, and clinical interventions, the association remained significant although attenuated (OR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.09–1.39]; P = 0.001). When categorizing serum potassium levels, patients with hyperkalemia (> 5.0 mmol/L) showed substantially higher mortality risk compared with those with normal potassium levels (3.5–5.0 mmol/L). This relationship was robust across all adjustment models, with OR of 2.72 (95% CI, 2.34–3.15) in the unadjusted model and 1.45 (95% CI, 1.11–1.88) in the fully adjusted model (P = 0.007). Notably, patients with hypokalemia (< 3.5 mmol/L) did not show significantly different mortality risk compared with the reference group across all models. The ordinal analysis of serum potassium categories demonstrated a significant trend, with each categorical increase in potassium level associated with higher mortality risk (fully adjusted OR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.04–1.50]; P = 0.020). In our sensitivity analysis with refined potassium categories(≤ 3.5, > 3.5 to ≤ 4.0, > 4.0 to ≤ 4.5, > 4.5 to ≤ 5.0, and > 5.0 mmol/L), multivariable analysis shows that when analyzing these five categorized serum potassium groups as an ordinal variable, each incremental category increase was associated with a 12% higher risk of death in the fully adjusted model (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04–1.21, P = 0.004)(Table S2). We conducted additional sensitivity analyses incorporating eGFR as an alternative measure of kidney function in Models 4 and 5 (Table S3). In Model 4, adjusted for age, sex, and eGFR, each 1 mmol/L increase in serum potassium was associated with a 39% increased risk of 28-day ICU mortality (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.29–1.50, P < 0.001). In the fully adjusted Model 5 (with eGFR replacing serum creatinine along with all other covariates), the association remained significant but attenuated, with each 1 mmol/L increase corresponding to a 21% increased mortality risk (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.07–1.37, P = 0.003).

Definitions of hyperkalemia

Definitions of hyperkalemia vary by geographic region. In Europe, mild hyperkalemia is defined as serum potassium 5.0–5.4 mEq/L, moderate as 5.5–5.9 mEq/L, and severe as ≥ 6.0 mEq/L. The American Heart Association uses cutoffs of 5–6 mEq/L (mild), 6–7 mEq/L (moderate), and > 7 mEq/L (severe). However, in this review, we refer to the standard potassium values specified in the guidelines published by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare entitled "Classification criteria for the seriousness of adverse drug reactions of medical agents", wherein serum potassium values of ≥ 5.5 mEq/L and < 6.0 mEq/L are classified as Grade 2 adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and values of ≥ 6.0 mEq/L are classified as Grade 3 ADRs. For patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), Japanese nephrology guidelines recommend maintaining serum potassium between 4.0 and 5.5 mEq/L to avoid hypo- or hyperkalemia. Of note, mild to moderate hyperkalemia generally cannot be diagnosed from electrocardiogram (ECG) changes; a study in hospitalized patients indicated that the first ECG changes occurred at serum potassium levels above 7.2 mEq/L, a level that already indicates severe hyperkalemia.

### Potassium chloride (potassium chloride for oral solution) [^112jCLAA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the contents of 1 pouch of potassium chloride for oral solution in at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Daily dose range from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses: limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24 hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

### Serum potassium and risk of death or kidney replacement therapy in older people with CKD stages 4–5: eight-year follow-up [^114CMrup]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Hypokalemia may accelerate kidney function decline. Both hypo- and hyperkalemia can cause sudden cardiac death. However, little is known about the relationship between serum potassium and death or the occurrence of kidney failure requiring replacement therapy (KRT). We investigated this relationship in older people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4–5.

Study Design

Prospective observational cohort study.

Setting & Participants

We followed 1,714 patients (≥ 65 years old) from the European Quality (EQUAL) study for 8 years from their first estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 20mL/min/1.73 m² measurement.

Exposure

Serum potassium was measured every 3 to 6 months and categorized as ≤ 3.5, > 3.5- ≤ 4.0, > 4.0- ≤ 4.5, > 4.5- ≤ 5.0 (reference), > 5.0- ≤ 5.5, > 5.5- ≤ 6.0, and > 6.0mmol/L.

Outcome

The combined outcome death before KRT or start of KRT.

Analytical Approach

The association between categorical and continuous time-varying potassium and death or KRT start was examined using Cox proportional hazards and restricted cubic spline analyses, adjusted for age, sex, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition, eGFR, and subjective global assessment (SGA).

Results

At baseline, 66% of participants were men, 42% had diabetes, 47% cardiovascular disease, and 54% used RAAS inhibitors. Their mean age was 76 ± 7 (SD) years, mean eGFR was 17 ± 5 (SD) mL/min/1.73 m², and mean SGA was 6.0 ± 1.0 (SD). Over 8 years, 414 (24%) died before starting KRT, and 595 (35%) started KRT. Adjusted hazard ratios for death or KRT according to the potassium categories were 1.6 (95% CI, 1.1–2.3), 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1–1.7), 1.1 (95% CI, 1.0–1.4), 1 (reference), 1.1 (95% CI, 0.9–1.4), 1.8 (95% CI, 1.4–2.3), and 2.2 (95% CI, 1.5–3.3). Hazard ratios were lowest at a potassium of about 4.9mmol/L.

Limitations

Shorter intervals between potassium measurements would have allowed for more precise estimations.

Conclusions

We observed a U-shaped relationship between serum potassium and death or KRT start among patients with incident CKD 4–5, with a nadir risk at a potassium level of 4.9mmol/L. These findings underscore the potential importance of preventing both high and low potassium in patients with CKD 4–5.

Plain-Language Summary

Abnormal potassium blood levels may increase the risk of death or kidney function decline, especially in older people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We studied 1,714 patients aged ≥ 65 years with advanced CKD from the European Quality (EQUAL) study and followed them for 8 years. We found that both low and high levels of potassium were associated with an increased risk of death or start of kidney replacement therapy, with the lowest risk observed at a potassium level of 4.9 mmol/L. In patients with CKD, the focus is often on preventing high blood potassium. However, this relatively high optimum potassium level stresses the potential importance of also preventing low potassium levels in older patients with advanced CKD.

### Hyperkalemia is associated with increased mortality among unselected cardiac intensive care unit patients [^1151uKiB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Prior studies have demonstrated a U‐shaped relationship between potassium level and mortality in a variety of patient populations. 1, 2, 3, 15, 16, 17, 18 Colombo et al 2 performed a meta‐analysis of 12 studies examining the relationship between serum potassium levels and mortality in 60 547 patients with acute myocardial infarction, demonstrating higher short‐ and long‐term mortality in patients with serum potassium < 3.5 or ≥ 4.5 mEq/L. Similarly, patients with hypokalemia in our study had higher unadjusted in‐hospital mortality, although we did not find an association between hypokalemia and adjusted in‐hospital mortality or postdischarge mortality. Younis et al 1 noted an independent association between admission potassium levels > 5.5 mEq/L and long‐term mortality in 4031 patients hospitalized with HF. These data support an association between hyperkalemia (admission serum potassium ≥ 5 mEq/L) with higher adjusted in‐hospital and postdischarge mortality in a broad spectrum of acutely ill cardiac patients. We also observed a positive association between potassium variability (based on the maximum and minimum potassium levels) and in‐hospital mortality.

Hypokalemia was associated with higher rates of ventricular arrhythmias in the meta‐analysis by Colombo et al. 2 In our study, patients with hypokalemia more frequently had discharge diagnoses of arrhythmias, including AF, VT, and VF. The Colombo et al 2 systematic review suggested an optimal serum potassium level of 3.5 to 4.4 mEq/L, reflecting disagreement amongst included studies. In our study, the lowest in‐hospital mortality was observed in patients with admission potassium 4 to 4.4 mEq/L, except in those with HF, in whom the lowest death rate was observed in patients with admission potassium levels between 3.5 and 3.9 mEq/L. While we found lower mortality in the majority of patients at an admission serum potassium level ≥ 4.0 mEq/L, these data do not allow specific recommendations to be made regarding target levels for potassium repletion.

Multivariate analysis for hospital mortality a

a CI, Confidence interval; OR, Odds ratio. Data are adjusted for sex, age, acute kidney injury (AKI), severity of illness (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score), mean potassium, mean potassium squared and potassium variability observed between 24 hours and 7 days after admission. For all variables except potassium variability (9,228 patients (88%)) and APACHE II score (4,883 patients (51%)), virtually complete data were available, therefore the multivariate analysis was performed with APACHE II score (lower panel) and without APACHE II score. In-hospital mortality was associated with all domains of potassium control. In order to test for a U-shaped relationship of mean potassium with hospital mortality, the mean potassium concentration was both included directly and squared.

Time in hypo- and hyperkalemia was higher for nonsurvivors for both the early and late phases (P < 0.001) (Table 1). Time in hypo- and hyperkalemia was noted as a mean percentage of the total ICU stay and not as a median percentage, because the medians were 0%. Both mild and severe hypokalemia occurred more often in nonsurvivors than in survivors, during both the early phase and the late phase. The incidence of mild and severe hyperkalemia was also higher in nonsurvivors.

### Comparative efficacy of magnesium and potassium towards cholesterol and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomised single-blinded controlled clinical trial [^114UwWLd]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Potassium is an essential mineral, which plays major roles for the resting membrane potential and intracellular osmolarity. According to research, hypokalaemia, or decreased serum potassium brought on by diuretics, is linked to impaired glucose tolerance and a higher risk of developing diabetes in hypertensive people. Significant decreases in serum potassium and total body potassium in a small group of healthy people experimentally fed a low‐potassium diet have been hypothesised to cause glucose intolerance and impair insulin secretion, both of which are regulated by ATP‐sensitive potassium channels. It was discovered that White Americans and African Americans have an inverse relationship between serum potassium levels and an increased risk of T2DM that is unrelated to the use of diuretics. Numerous epidemiological studies have found that potassium consumption and blood pressure are inversely associated, with blood pressure falling as potassium intake rises. A significant independent factor affecting the population's blood pressure was potassium consumption, as determined by 24‐h urinary potassium excretion, according to the big multinational study on electrolytes and blood pressure.

It is important to identify modifiable risk factors of T2DM to prevent this public health problem. Prospective observational studies have shown the importance of diet and dietary patterns in the prevention and management of T2DM. Micronutrients are usually being ignored in the diet due to inappropriate dietary patterns or lack of awareness. This study hypothesised that magnesium and potassium supplementation affect the cholesterol and quality of life (QoL) in patients with T2DM. This study will help determine the combined effect of magnesium and potassium towards cholesterol and QoL in T2DM.

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^116Vgddg]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

The majority of disorders that cause renal potassium wasting present with abnormalities in adrenal hormone secretion. While these findings frequently lead patients to seek endocrine evaluation, clinicians often struggle to accurately diagnose these conditions, delaying treatment and adversely impacting patient care. At the same time, growing insight into the genetic and molecular basis of these disorders continues to improve their diagnosis and management. In this review, we outline a practical integrated approach to the evaluation of renal hypokalemia syndromes that are seen in endocrine practice while highlighting recent advances in understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology behind them.

### Potassium chloride extended-release (Potassium chloride) [^116UhpET]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

General

The diagnosis of potassium depletion is ordinarily made by demonstrating hypokalemia in a patient with a clinical history suggesting some cause for potassium depletion. In interpreting the serum potassium level, the physician should bear in mind that acute alkalosis per se can produce hypokalemia in the absence of a deficit in total body potassium while acute acidosis per se can increase the serum potassium concentration into the normal range even in the presence of a reduced total body potassium. The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance and appropriate monitoring of serum electrolytes, the electrocardiogram, and the clinical status of the patient.

Information for Patients

Physicians should consider reminding the patient of the following:

To take each dose with meals and with a full glass of water or other liquid.

To take each dose without crushing, chewing, or sucking the tablets. If those patients are having difficulty swallowing whole tablets, they may try one of the following alternate methods of administration:

Break the tablet in half, and take each half separately with a glass of water.
Prepare an aqueous (water) suspension as follows:
Place the whole tablet(s) in approximately 1/2 glass of water (4 fluid ounces).
Allow approximately 2 minutes for the tablet(s) to disintegrate.
Stir for about half a minute after the tablet(s) has disintegrated.
Swirl the suspension and consume the entire contents of the glass immediately by drinking or by the use of a straw.
Add another 1 fluid ounce of water, swirl, and consume immediately.
Then, add an additional 1 fluid ounce of water, swirl, and consume immediately.

Aqueous suspension of potassium chloride that is not taken immediately should be discarded. The use of other liquids for suspending potassium chloride tablets is not recommended.

To take this medicine following the frequency and amount prescribed by the physician. This is especially important if the patient is also taking diuretics and/or digitalis preparations.

To check with the physician at once if tarry stools or other evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding is noticed.

Laboratory Tests

When blood is drawn for analysis of plasma potassium it is important to recognize that artifactual elevations can occur after improper venipuncture technique or as a result of in vitro hemolysis of the sample.

Drug Interactions

Potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (see WARNINGS).

### Assessment of hypokalemia and clinical characteristics in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in wenzhou, China [^117Anv4R]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Because hypokalemia can affect myocardial function, timely treatment is necessary to achieve good outcomes. However, the mechanism of hypokalemia in the present study suggested that it was challenging to achieve normokalemia in the presence of continuous renal loss of K +. The ongoing K + supplements often failed to correct hypokalemia when the urinary loss of K + persisted in the patients with severe disease. The steady normalization of serum potassium by use of potassium supplements at the later phase of hospitalization occurred at the same time as improvement of disease. We interpreted that this phenomenon might be associated with less renal loss of potassium, which suggested the patients had a more balanced RAS function, as the counter-function of ACE2 was recovered to some degree.

Although COVID-19 causes injury to lungs, heart, liver, and kidney, our study also found that the occurrence of abnormal indices of heart, liver, and kidney was low (Table 2). Several laboratory indices, such as elevated CK, CK–MB fraction, LDH, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase, usually came to normal levels or substantially improved after relevant treatment. The superficial mildness contradicted with the sudden progression of disease in some patients. This contradiction might result from the fact that the biomarkers were not sensitive enough to reflect the underlying progression of this disease. A more sensitive biomarker can facilitate monitoring of ongoing COVID-19. As discussed already, 85% of severely and critically ill patients had hypokalemia (Table 3), showing that depletion of K + was prevalent. On the basis of the analysis of the trend in plasma K + and urine output of K +, the end of the depletion often suggested a good prognosis (Figure 2). Hence, a comprehensive analysis of K + depletion can be achieved by monitoring urinary K + loss, plasma K +, and the response to K + supplement treatment. Importantly, the current knowledge about hypokalemia directly reflects the very basis of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and might be a reliable, timely, and sensitive biomarker to reflect the progression of COVID-19.

Limitations

This study has some limitations. There are several risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19. The confounding factors may affect the results. However, as the present findings reflect the fundamental pathophysiological mechanism of COVID-19 and the great proportion of patients with hypokalemia, we believe that our conclusion is valid.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Carcinogenicity, mutagenicity and fertility studies in animals have not been performed. Potassium is a normal dietary constituent.

Pregnancy Category C

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with K-TAB tablets. It is unlikely that potassium supplementation that does not lead to hyperkalemia would have an adverse effect on the fetus or would affect reproductive capacity.

Nursing Mothers

The normal potassium ion content of human milk is about 13 mEq per liter. Since oral potassium becomes part of the body potassium pool, as long as body potassium is not excessive, the contribution of potassium chloride supplementation should have little or no effect on the level in human milk.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.

### Regulation of potassium homeostasis [^116xnthA]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Potassium is the most abundant cation in the intracellular fluid, and maintaining the proper distribution of potassium across the cell membrane is critical for normal cell function. Long-term maintenance of potassium homeostasis is achieved by alterations in renal excretion of potassium in response to variations in intake. Understanding the mechanism and regulatory influences governing the internal distribution and renal clearance of potassium under normal circumstances can provide a framework for approaching disorders of potassium commonly encountered in clinical practice. This paper reviews key aspects of the normal regulation of potassium metabolism and is designed to serve as a readily accessible review for the well informed clinician as well as a resource for teaching trainees and medical students.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with end-stage renal disease hospitalized with diabetes ketoacidosis [^112CYaPu]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Potassium concentration is maintained in the body by balancing the intake with the excretion and the transcellular shifts of potassium. Approximately 75% of patients admitted with DKA present with elevated serum potassium levels on admission owing to the shift of intracellular potassium to the extracellular compartment in the setting of hypertonicity, insulin deficiency and acidosis. As expected, patients with ESRD in this study presented with higher potassium levels due to diminished potassium excretion by the kidneys. During insulin treatment, potassium concentration rapidly decreases due to intracellular shifting of potassium, mediated by insulin stimulation of Na + -H + transporter, promoting the entry of Na +, then activation of the Na + -K + ATPase, resulting in influx of potassium; as well as increased kaliuresis, thought to be mediated by an aldosterone-like effect of insulin. In recent studies in patients with ESRD, the prevalence of hyperkalemia ≥ 5 mmol/L was reported between 14% and 20%, and the prevalence of hypokalemia ≤ 4 mmol/L was between 12% and 18%, with both conditions associated with increased mortality. Patients with DKA and ESRD presented with higher potassium concentration compared with patients with preserved renal function. In agreement with previous reports, insulin administration was the only treatment required for correction of hyperkalemia. Of interest, we observed no differences in the rate of hypokalemia between groups. These results indicate the need for a modified potassium administration approach in the management of DKA in patients with ESRD, as well as close follow-up of potassium levels on admission and during insulin treatment.

We acknowledge several limitations in our analysis including a relatively small number of patients with ESRD presenting with DKA; however, this is the largest cohort study of patients with ESRD admitted with DKA — an uncommon scenario. The retrospective nature of the study and the use of ICD-9 codes may limit the ability to accurately differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, duration of diabetes and precipitant causes. Nonetheless, despite using ICD-9/10 codes, we were able to confirm all cases of DKA and ESRD based on biochemical data on admission, which have been a limitation of previous reports. In addition, although a DKA treatment protocol is available for use in the emergency department and in intensive care unit and step-down units, the current protocols are not designed to adjust for changes in insulin, fluid and electrolyte administration in patients with diabetes and ESRD on hemodialysis. We also recognized the limited value of HbA1c in the setting of ESRD.

The normal potassium ion content of human milk is about 13 mEq per liter. Since oral potassium becomes part of the body potassium pool, so long as body potassium is not excessive, the contribution of potassium chloride supplementation should have little or no effect on the level in human milk.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

### Hypokalaemia: improving the investigation, management and therapeutic monitoring of hypokalaemic medical inpatients at a district general hospital [^117WArCW]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

The normal range of plasma potassium is 3.5–5.1 mmol/l. Daily potassium requirements of a 70kg male are 70 mmol compared to a 40kg woman who will need 40 mmol. Hypokalaemia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised patients. When defined as a value of less than 3.5 mmol/L, hypokalaemia is found in 20% of hospital inpatients, but occurs in only 2% of otherwise healthy adults. Approximately 5% of hospitalised patients with confirmed hypokalaemia have serum potassium concentrations of < 3.0 mmol/l. Additionally, up to 50% of patients with normal potassium on admission may develop hypokalaemia during their inpatient stay.

Deviations to both extremes (hypo- and hyperkalaemia) are related to an increased risk of cardiac complications. Potassium levels below 3.0 mmol/l may cause significant Q-T interval prolongation with subsequent risk of torsade des pointes, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden cardiac death. Those at particular risk are patients with cardiac ischemia, heart failure, and left ventricular hypertrophy, in whom even mild-to-moderate hypokalaemia increases the likelihood of cardiac arrhythmias. For example, the mortality rate of hospitalised hypokalaemic patients with cardiovascular disease was 10-fold higher than the general hospitalised population.

Hypokalaemia can be life-threatening when severe (< 2.5 mmol/L) but is usually well tolerated in otherwise healthy people and patients are often asymptomatic. Consequently, the diagnosis is easily missed and recognition of high risk patients, frequent laboratory monitoring, and prompt treatment is essential to reduce the incidence of hypokalaemic complications. Risk of hypokalemia in patients taking diuretics is higher in the elderly and enhanced by concomitant illness, such as heart failure or nephrotic syndrome. Latrogenic causes are also important to consider. Of patients taking non–potassium-sparing diuretics, 10% to 40% develop hypokalemia. Other morbidities associated with a higher incidence of hypokalemia include; 21% of hospitalised patients with AIDS, 12.6% of hospitalised patients with alcoholism, and patients after bariatric surgery.

### Hypokalaemia: addressing human factors and improving education around prescription and administration of intravenous (IV) potassium infusion in trauma and orthopaedics [^1168uqhj]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

The normal range of plasma potassium is 3.5 −5.0 mmol/l. Hypokalaemia is defined as a serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/l. Severe hypokalaemia is defined as a K+ < 2.5 mmol/l.

Hypokalaemia is one of the most common electrolyte abnormalities and has an incidence of 17–20% in hospitalised patients. Hypokalaemia is most frequently asymptomatic and identified on routine screening. Mild to moderate hypokalaemia if ignored may progress to life threatening severe hypokalaemia. Literature shows severe hypokalaemia is associated with potential life threatening complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, paralysis, rhabdomyolysis, diaphragmatic weakness resulting in cardiac or respiratory arrests.

Causes of hypokalaemia include drugs such as diuretics, laxatives or steroids, gastrointestinal loss such as diarrhoea, renal loss such as renal tubular disorders or diabetes insipidus, endocrine disorders such as Cushing's syndrome, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesaemia, poor dietary intake and treatment strategies used for hyperkalaemia.

### Serum potassium levels and outcome in patients with chronic heart failure [^112D33Aa]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Potassium levels are often abnormal in patients with heart failure (HF) and have a detrimental effect on clinical outcome. We evaluated potassium levels in a real-world cohort of patients with HF and its effect on mortality. All patients with a diagnosis of HF at a health maintenance organization were evaluated and followed for cardiac-related hospitalizations and death. The cohort consisted of 6,073 patients with HF. Mean potassium levels were 4.57 ± 0.53 mmol/L. Most patients (68%) had potassium levels in the normal range (4.0 to 5.0 mmol/L). High-normal potassium levels (5.0 to 5.5) were present in 17% of the patients, low potassium levels (< 4.0) in 11%, and hyperkalemia (K ≥ 5.5) in 4%. Mean follow-up was 576 days. The overall mortality rate during this period was 14%. Survival rate by Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that hypokalemia (K ≤ 3.5) was associated with the lowest survival rate. Survival was highest in patients with high-normal potassium levels. Cox regression analysis after adjustment for significant predictors including co-morbidities and standard HF drug therapies demonstrated that high-normal potassium levels were independently associated with reduced mortality compared with normal reference levels (hazard ratio 0.78, 95 confidence interval [CI] 0.64 to 0.95, p = 0.01). Subgroup analysis showed improved outcome with high-normal potassium levels in patients with reduced renal function, spironolactone, and loop diuretic therapy. In conclusion, potassium levels in the high-normal range appear to be safe and are associated with an improved outcome in patients with HF.

### Association between serum potassium and outcomes in patients with reduced kidney function [^112aEVT4]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Patients with CKD are more likely than others to have abnormalities in serum potassium (K(+)). Aside from severe hyperkalemia, the clinical significance of K(+) abnormalities is not known. We sought to examine the association of serum K(+) with mortality and hospitalization rates within narrow eGFR strata to understand how the burden of hyperkalemia varies by CKD severity. Associations were examined between serum K(+) and discontinuation of medications that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which are known to increase serum K(+).

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

A cohort of patients with CKD (eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m²) with serum K(+) data were studied (n = 55,266) between January 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013 (study end). Serum K(+), eGFR, and covariates were considered on a time-updated basis. Mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), hospitalization, and discontinuation of RAAS blockers were considered per time at risk.

Results

During the study, serum K(+) levels of 5.5–5.9 and ≥ 6.0 mEq/L were most prevalent at lower eGFR: they were present, respectively, in 1.7% and 0.2% of patient-time for eGFR of 50–59 ml/min per 1.73 m² versus 7.6% and 1.8% of patient-time for eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m². Serum K(+) level < 3.5 mEq/L was present in 1.2%-1.4% of patient-time across eGFR strata. The median follow-up time was 2.76 years. There was a U-shaped association between serum K(+) and mortality; pooled adjusted incidence rate ratios were 3.05 (95% confidence interval, 2.53 to 3.68) and 3.31 (95% confidence interval, 2.52 to 4.34) for K(+) levels < 3.5 mEq/L and ≥ 6.0 mEq/L, respectively. Within eGFR strata, there were U-shaped associations of serum K(+) with rates of MACE, hospitalization, and discontinuation of RAAS blockers.

Conclusions

Both hyperkalemia and hypokalemia were independently associated with higher rates of death, MACE, hospitalization, and discontinuation of RAAS blockers in patients with CKD who were not undergoing dialysis. Future studies are needed to determine whether interventions targeted at maintaining normal serum K(+) improve outcomes in this population.

### Effects of pH on potassium: new explanations for old observations [^112RKM4X]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Maintenance of extracellular K(+) concentration within a narrow range is vital for numerous cell functions, particularly electrical excitability of heart and muscle. Potassium homeostasis during intermittent ingestion of K(+) involves rapid redistribution of K(+) into the intracellular space to minimize increases in extracellular K(+) concentration, and ultimate elimination of the K(+) load by renal excretion. Recent years have seen great progress in identifying the transporters and channels involved in renal and extrarenal K(+) homeostasis. Here we apply these advances in molecular physiology to understand how acid-base disturbances affect serum potassium.

### Plasma potassium ranges associated with mortality across stages of chronic kidney disease: the stockholm CREAtinine measurements (SCREAM) project [^117AGLJL]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hyperkalaemia, i.e. excess of circulating potassium (K +), is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder. Although it is agreed upon that there appears to be a U-shaped relationship between serum K + and death, there remains a controversy as to the exact level of K + at which the clinician should become concerned and consider altering therapy such as the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade. The optimal serum K + may depend on the underlying conditions. Maintenance of total body K + homoeostasis is a major function of a healthy kidney. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), with subsequent failure to augment distal tubular K + secretion, arises as one of the most important clinical predictors of hyperkalaemia occurrence. In addition to K + retention, accompanying comorbidities and medications make CKD patients particularly prone to a state of chronic hyperkalaemia.

Intriguingly, there is evidence suggesting that hyperkalaemia is a less threatening condition in CKD, arguing adaptive mechanisms that render better tolerance to elevated K + in circulation. Most of these studies are of small scale and they include high-risk patients. In clinical practice, chronic mild hyperkalaemia is often interpreted as the normal state in patients with advanced CKD. This study evaluates this hypothesis by formally estimating K + distribution in relation to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and by exploring K + ranges that predict mortality across worse CKD severity stages in a large healthcare system. As a secondary objective, and because plasma is the predominant source of K + assessment in Sweden, we explored whether the observed optimal ranges approximated to current clinical K + thresholds.

### Profound hypokalemia in diabetic ketoacidosis: a therapeutic challenge [^111ppTRS]. Endocrine Practice (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe profound hypokalemia in a comatose patient with diabetic ketoacidosis.

Methods

We present a case report, review the mechanisms for the occurrence of hypokalemia in diabetic ketoacidosis, and discuss its management in the setting of hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality.

Results

A 22-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus was admitted in a comatose state. Laboratory tests revealed a blood glucose level of 747 mg/dL, serum potassium of 1.9 mEq/L, pH of 6.8, and calculated effective serum osmolality of 320 mOsm/kg. She was intubated and resuscitated with intravenously administered fluids. Intravenous administration of vasopressors was necessary for stabilization of the blood pressure. Intravenous infusion of insulin was initiated to control the hyperglycemia, and repletion of total body potassium stores was undertaken. A total of 660 mEq of potassium was administered intravenously during the first 12.5 hours. Despite such aggressive initial repletion of potassium, the patient required 40 to 80 mEq of potassium daily for the next 8 days to increase the serum potassium concentration to normal.

Conclusion

Profound hypokalemia, an uncommon initial manifestation in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, is indicative of severe total body potassium deficiency. Under such circumstances, aggressive potassium repletion in a comatose patient must be undertaken during correction of other metabolic abnormalities, including hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality. Intravenously administered insulin should be withheld until the serum potassium concentration is (3)3.3 mEq/L.

### Serum sodium concentration and tonicity in hyperglycemic crises: major influences and treatment implications [^117MPgeG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Maintenance of the volume of all cells, particularly those of the central nervous system, is critical for their function and survival. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Tonicity (ie, effective osmolarity) of a solution refers to its property to cause osmotic fluid shifts into or out of cells suspended in it. Direct determination of serum tonicity is not readily available for clinical applications. 6 Serum sodium concentration ([Na] S) is the main parameter used as a surrogate value for serum tonicity. 5, 6, 7 The only direct information provided by [Na] S is whether serum tonicity is normal (the volume of cells exposed to a serum with normal [Na] S is not affected), low (the volume of cells exposed to a serum with low [Na] S increases by osmotic intracellular transfer of water), or high (the volume of cells exposed to a serum with high [Na] S decreases by osmotic transfer of water out of the cells). 6, 7

In a pivotal study, Edelman and coinvestigators identified total body sodium, total body potassium, and total body water as the universal determinants of [Na] S in patients with various states potentially associated with extracellular volume disturbances. 8 Abnormalities in [Na] S usually result from changes in the external balance of one of its 3 determinants or a combination thereof. The relations between [Na] S and total body sodium, total body potassium, and total body water have been expressed by various formulas. The original Edelman formula expresses sodium concentration in plasma water. 8 The Nguyen and Kurtz formula expresses sodium concentration in plasma, which is essentially equal to [Na] S. 9 Nguyen and Kurtz developed their formula by multiplying the components of the Edelman formula by a correction coefficient equal to 0.93, which represents the normal plasma water fraction. The Rose formula, which represents a simplified version of the Edelman formula, expresses [Na] S as the fraction (total body sodium plus total body potassium) over total body water. 10 Formulas calculating the tonicity of replacement solutions for correction of dysnatremias applied in clinical practice 11, 12, 13, 14 are based on the Rose formula, which will also be the basis of the calculations in this review.

### The implementation of targeted temperature management: an evidence-based guideline from the Neurocritical Care Society [^1127bgax]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Targeted temperature management (TTM) — potassium alterations during hypothermia and rewarming are characterized as follows: Hypothermia induces hypokalemia by shifting potassium from the extracellular to intracellular or extravascular spaces, and patients cooled to a goal temperature of 33 °C showed a potassium nadir of 3.2 ± 0.7 mmol/L at 10 h after cooling initiation; in another cohort, 13% and 18% of patients cooled to 36 and 33 °C, respectively, had hypokalemia. There appears to be a correlation between nadir potassium levels < 3.0 mmol/L and risk of premature ventricular contractions. Rebound hyperkalemia is of concern during rewarming, and hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias have been associated with maintaining potassium levels above 3.5 mmol/L during the cooling maintenance phase; therefore, maintaining serum potassium levels between 3.0 and 3.5 mmol/L during induction and maintenance phases may prevent arrhythmias and reduce the risk of rebound hyperkalemia during rewarming.

### Potassium chloride (Klor-con M) [^117Xfm8a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

The diagnosis of potassium depletion is ordinarily made by demonstrating hypokalemia in a patient with a clinical history suggesting some cause for potassium depletion. In interpreting the serum potassium level, the physician should bear in mind that acute alkalosis per se can produce hypokalemia in the absence of a deficit in total body potassium while acute acidosis per se can increase the serum potassium concentration into the normal range even in the presence of a reduced total body potassium. The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance and appropriate monitoring of serum electrolytes, the electrocardiogram, and the clinical status of the patient.

Information for Patients

Physicians should consider reminding the patient of the following:

To take each dose with meals and with a full glass of water or other liquid.

To take each dose without crushing, chewing or sucking the tablets. If those patients are having difficulty swallowing whole tablets, they may try one of the following alternate methods of administration:

Break the tablet in half and take each half separately with a glass of water.
Prepare an aqueous (water) suspension as follows:
Place the whole tablet(s) in approximately ½ glass of water (4 fluid ounces).
Allow approximately 2 minutes for the tablet(s) to disintegrate.
Stir for about half a minute after the tablet(s) has disintegrated.
Swirl the suspension and consume the entire contents of the glass immediately by drinking or by the use of a straw.
Add another 1 fluid ounce of water, swirl, and consume immediately.
Then, add an additional 1 fluid ounce of water, swirl, and consume immediately.

Aqueous suspension of potassium chloride that is not taken immediately should be discarded. The use of other liquids for suspending potassium chloride tablets is not recommended.

To take this medicine following the frequency and amount prescribed by the physician. This is especially important if the patient is also taking diuretics and/or digitalis preparations.

To check with the physician at once if tarry stools or other evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding is noticed.

Laboratory Tests

When blood is drawn for analysis of plasma potassium it is important to recognize that artifactual elevations can occur after improper venipuncture technique or as a result of in vitro hemolysis of the sample.

Drug Interactions

Potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [see WARNINGS].

### Changes in serum potassium levels during hospitalization in patients with worsening heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (from the EVEREST trial) [^115Xh4Zs]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Both hyperkalemia and hypokalemia may be related to heart failure (HF) therapy and are associated with adverse outcomes. Abnormalities in serum potassium levels in hospitalized patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (EF) have not been previously investigated. A post hoc analysis was performed in 1,907 hospitalized patients with worsening HF and reduced EF in the placebo arm of the Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in HF Outcome Study with Tolvaptan (EVEREST) trial. Serum potassium was measured at randomization and at discharge or day 7. The co-primary end points were all-cause mortality (ACM) and cardiovascular mortality or the first HF hospitalization (CVM + HFH). The association between inhospital change in potassium levels and time to outcomes was evaluated using multivariate Cox regression models. Study participants had a mean age of 65.6 ± 12.0 years and were on optimal guideline-directed medical therapies, including β blockers (77%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (85%), and aldosterone antagonists (55%). Baseline potassium concentration was 4.3 ± 0.6 mEq/l, and hyperkalemia or hypokalemia was seen in 6.5% of the participants. On average, serum potassium level increased by 0.21 ± 0.66 mEq/l, p < 0.0001, during hospitalization. Inhospital potassium change was not associated with either the primary or the secondary end point over a median follow-up of 9.9 months. In conclusion, in patients with reduced EF hospitalized for worsening HF, serum potassium abnormalities are common at baseline (within 48 hours of admission) and potassium levels increase during hospitalization, despite aggressive diuretic therapy. However, they are not associated with all-cause or CVM or HFH. Inhospital changes in potassium may limit the implementation of evidence-based therapies such as mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

### Personalizing potassium management in patients on haemodialysis [^1131XGiV]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 2
Comparison of total body potassium (TBK, ratio of measured versus expected normal) between haemodialysis patients and controls (patients with essential hypertension). Data are based on Williams et al. Measured TBK in controls and haemodialysis patients were 3390 and 2810 mmol, respectively. Time on dialysis varied from < 1 to > 5 years. TBK was measured before dialysis. Values are mean ± standard error.

In conclusion, to improve potassium management and potentially long-term outcomes in haemodialysis, we believe it is important to integrate all factors that determine potassium balance and apply a personalized approach that is dynamic and relies on more frequent serum potassium measurements and ideally also on total body potassium.

### The relationship between serum potassium, potassium variability and in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients and a before-after analysis on the impact of computer-assisted potassium control [^112vf1Ux]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Abnormal serum potassium levels and in-hospital mortality

The in-hospital mortality number was 2,276 (21.8%), and admission potassium levels were higher in patients who died during their hospital stay than among patients who survived. It should be stressed that all the incidences mentioned refer to the number of patients with potassium derangements, not to the number of deranged measurements. There was a U-shaped relationship between potassium levels and in-hospital mortality (P < 0.001) (Figure 1). Potassium variability was independently related to outcome. The independent impact of variability is given in Figure 2, which shows mean potassium in quintiles and potassium variability in quartiles within each quintile (Table 2). Figure 2 shows evidence of lower in-hospital mortality associated with the lower normal range for potassium, as well as lower mortality associated with lower variability across all quintiles. Overall, we saw a lower potassium variability in survivors in both the early and late phases (P < 0.001). The design of Figure 2 was copied as faithfully as possible from a figure reported by Krinsley that depicted a very similar phenomenon for mean glucose and glucose variability. Multivariate analysis showed an independent association with in-hospital mortality for the occurrence of both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia and potassium variability with and without inclusion of APACHE II and AKI data (Table 3).

Figure 1
Lowest and highest potassium levels and outcomes in the early and late phases of intensive care unit admission. Relationship between abnormal potassium levels and mortality during the first 24 hours of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (early phase; upper panel) and days 2 through 7 (late phase; lower panel) of ICU admission. This distinction was made because the initial derangements often cannot be influenced by ICU treatment. Both the lowest and the highest potassium levels measured during the relevant episode were used. Lower and higher potassium levels were both associated with a marked increase in mortality risk. The incidences are indicated above the x -axis. Thus, 59% and 60% of the patients had neither hypokalemia nor hyperkalemia in the early and late phases, respectively. Because some patients are represented in both a hypokalemic and a hyperkalemic category, the percentages add up to more than 100%.

8.7 Renal Impairment

Patients with renal impairment have reduced urinary excretion of potassium and are at substantially increased risk of hyperkalemia. Patients with impaired renal function, particularly if the patient is on ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should usually be started at the low end of the dosing range because of the potential for development of hyperkalemia. The serum potassium level should be monitored frequently. Renal function should be assessed periodically.

### Serum potassium determination… [^113WaB5S]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Flame measurement of the serum level of potassium one of the most accurate of laboratory tests. However accurately performed, the serum potassium determination has certain limitations. Thus, one must bear in mind that the serum potassium level measures the concentration of potassium in the extracellular fluid, not the total body potassium or the potassium of the cells. In an adult whose total body potassium is 3, 000 mEq, only 50 to 70 mEq normally is present in the extracellular fluid. This extracellular potassium slowly exchanges with the cellular potassium through the permeable cell membrane when stimulated by changes in the pH of the extracellular fluid. Potassium in Transit Of several factors that determine the extracellular level of potassium, only one is the cellular store. Since the cells gain or lose potassium via the extracellular fluid — a sort of middleman fluid — the serum potassium level really represents potassium in transit.

### New guidelines for potassium replacement in clinical practice… [^114tYe6C]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Of the total body potassium content, 90% is sequestered within cells. 1 This compartmentalization depends on active transport through the cell membrane by a sodium-potassium pump, which maintains an intracellular cation ratio of 1:

10. Normal serum potassium levels are considered to lie roughly between
3. 6 and 5. 0 mmol/L. The loss of just 1% of total body potassium content would seriously disturb the delicate balance between intracellular and extracellular potassium and would result in profound physiologic changes. On the other hand, the presence of hypokalemia is not necessarily synonymous with whole-body potassium deficiency, because such a small percentage of the total body stores is present in extracellular fluid. Whereas it is generally accepted that diuretic therapy can decrease serum potassium to hypokalemic levels, the subtler effects of inadequate dietary potassium are less well known.

Because the kidneys are the major regulators of external potassium homeostasis, accounting for approximately 80% of potassium transit from the body, renal dysfunction can result in gross abnormalities in serum potassium levels. 1 Transcellular potassium homeostasis depends to a large extent on acid-base balance. 1, 3 Acidosis stimulates cellular efflux of potassium from cells, resulting in hyperkalemia, whereas alkalosis stimulates influx of potassium, resulting in hypokalemia, without a simultaneous alteration in total body potassium. Overt hypokalemia may be diagnosed when the serum potassium level is less than 3. 6 mmol/L. Potential causes include diuretic therapy, inadequate dietary potassium intake, high dietary sodium intake, and hypomagnesemia. Because potassium is a major intracellular cation, the tissues most severely affected by potassium imbalance are muscle and renal tubular cells.

Manifestations of hypokalemia include generalized muscle weakness, paralytic ileus, and cardiac arrhythmias. The Nernst equation describes how the ratio of intracellular to extracellular potassium affects the RMP of myocardial cells: RMP = –61. 5 log. Changes in this ratio, such as those induced by diuretic therapy, affect cardiac conduction and automaticity. As a result, low intracellular potassium levels can increase spontaneous depolarization, automaticity, and the emergence of ectopic foci. 32.

### Red blood cell potassium… [^116fQXnY]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

THE INTRACELLULAR CONTENT OF POTASSIUM is one of the determinants of some of the physiologic actions of this important ion. In clinical practice the estimation of cellular potassium is not practical. It is well known that serum potassium, despite clinical usage, often does not reflect the intracellular or total body content of this cation. 1 It has been implied that red blood cell potassium concentration is superior to serum potassium as an indicator of changes in cellular potassium. 2, 3. Since the determination of KRBC is simple, it was deemed important to extend these studies in conditions expected to produce changes in potassium balance. Method KRBC and KS were measured simultaneously for the following subjects: 36 normal, including some on anticoagulant therapy; 29 chronically maintained on diuretics, including a cirrhotic patient with ascites; 18 who were in different stages of.
