## Question

Intrahepatic biliary dilation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate intrahepatic biliary dilation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true intrahepatic dilation and excluding mimics. Then, I should classify the pattern of dilation to localize the likely level of obstruction. Next, I will build a prioritized differential diagnosis and map it to the appropriate imaging sequence. After that, I need to outline when to escalate to invasive testing and tissue diagnosis. Finally, I will consider management pathways by etiology, special populations, and follow-up, while continuously verifying assumptions against guidelines and key studies throughout.

> Let me first confirm the finding and avoid premature conclusions. I need to verify that the ducts are truly dilated and not mimics such as peribiliary cysts, which cluster around the hilum and do not communicate with the biliary lumen, or portal biliopathy with extrinsic compression from portal cavernoma that can kink or scallop the ducts, and I should also remember that Caroli disease shows cystic intrahepatic ducts in continuity with the biliary tree and may exhibit the central dot sign, so I should double-check for these discriminators on MRCP or contrast-enhanced imaging before labeling this as intrahepatic biliary dilation [^115DJ3BB] [^112k3sNm] [^115gM32L].

> Wait, let me verify the pattern of dilation because that drives the differential. Diffuse intrahepatic dilation suggests a distal extrahepatic obstruction or papillary process, segmental or lobar dilation points to a stricture or mass at the confluence or hilum, and multifocal saccular dilations alternating with strictures make me think of PSC, whereas isolated cystic segmental dilations without upstream obstruction suggest Caroli disease or an IPMN-B, so I should map the distribution carefully before deciding on next steps [^114Fn5MN] [^112A284s] [^112prMcn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I should construct a prioritized differential that includes obstructive causes such as stones, malignant strictures including cholangiocarcinoma, benign inflammatory strictures from PSC or IgG4, post-surgical or iatrogenic strictures, congenital anomalies like Caroli disease or choledochal cysts, infectious cholangiopathies including HIV/AIDS cholangiopathy and clonorchiasis, vascular compressive etiologies like portal biliopathy, and finally systemic or infiltrative diseases such as sarcoidosis or LCH, and I need to ensure the order reflects both likelihood and urgency to exclude malignancy [^114dSmp8] [^112ynRn1] [^111BpPgE] [^116ZVWMq] [^1178MAUt] [^113kBqEP].

> I will now examine the initial noninvasive workup. I should confirm cholestatic liver tests and, if cholestasis is present, obtain a high-quality MRCP as first-line because it delineates strictures, stones, and masses without instrumentation, and I should also consider multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI or CT to characterize masses and vascular relationships, reserving PET/CT for suspected malignancy when conventional imaging is indeterminate, and I need to remember that imaging before biliary intervention preserves accurate tumor delineation for staging [^115xNaAK] [^114PABjP] [^114gnCZ8] [^114yFzvU].

> But wait, what if MRCP is non-diagnostic or malignancy remains a concern? I should double-check whether endoscopic ultrasound adds value, as EUS has high sensitivity for distal CBD and periampullary lesions and can detect stones or small masses missed by cross-sectional imaging, and although the yield is lower in asymptomatic patients, clinical features like jaundice, abnormal LFTs, or coexisting pancreatic duct dilation increase diagnostic yield, so I should tailor EUS to those with higher pretest probability [^117F6Hw5] [^116MT3EQ] [^117BJFho].

> Next, I should review when to proceed to ERCP. If there is a dominant stricture in PSC, progressive biliary dilation with concerning labs, or a need for tissue sampling and therapy, ERCP with brushings or biopsies is indicated, but I need to ensure antibiotic prophylaxis and acknowledge the non-trivial adverse event risk, and I should confirm that ERCP is reserved for cases where the benefit outweighs the risk and where MRCP/EUS are insufficient or intervention is planned [^115renue] [^113NGuJs].

> Let me consider management by etiology, starting with malignant obstruction. I should confirm staging with high-quality multiphasic CT or MRI and obtain tissue when feasible, coordinate drainage and oncologic planning in a multidisciplinary setting, and remember that for unresectable hilar disease, liver transplantation within strict protocols may be an option, so I must not delay appropriate staging and referral while securing biliary decompression when needed [^114gnCZ8] [^114yFzvU].

> For benign strictures, I need to check whether endoscopic balloon dilation alone suffices or whether short-term plastic stenting is warranted. In PSC, guidelines favor dilation over routine stenting due to higher complication rates with stents, and if a plastic stent is placed, I should confirm removal within about 4 weeks to minimize adverse events, while for refractory or complex strictures, multiple plastic stents or fully covered self-expandable metal stents may be considered in expert hands [^113NGuJs] [^115DuB3W] [^112PiYyH].

> For choledocholithiasis, I should verify the need for urgent biliary decompression if cholangitis is present and then proceed to ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction, and if ERCP fails or anatomy is altered, I should consider EUS-guided access or percutaneous transhepatic approaches, while remembering that recurrence risk rises with ductal dilation, multiple stones, or papillary dysfunction, prompting strategies such as extended sphincterotomy, large-balloon dilation, or even surgical biliary-enteric drainage in selected cases [^111Y2726] [^113eq8CE] [^117PLg2M].

> For Caroli disease, let me think about extent and complications. Unilobar disease may be cured with hepatic resection, whereas diffuse disease often requires transplant, and I should confirm long-term surveillance for cholangitis, stones, and cholangiocarcinoma given the elevated malignancy risk, integrating MRCP and clinical follow-up into a lifelong plan [^1162KdQ3] [^117D3QGC] [^115gM32L].

> For PSC, I should confirm that dominant strictures are addressed with endoscopic dilation and that patients are monitored for progression and CCA, and I need to ensure colonoscopy screening for IBD and consider CA 19–9 trends while recognizing their limited specificity, coordinating care in a transplant-capable center when disease advances [^112A284s] [^113NGuJs].

> For portal biliopathy, hold on, I should verify that asymptomatic patients are managed conservatively with treatment of portal hypertension, while symptomatic obstruction may require endoscopic or percutaneous drainage or, rarely, surgical bypass, and I should avoid mistaking vascular compressive changes for malignant strictures on imaging [^112k3sNm].

> I should double-check special populations. In pediatrics, congenital biliary dilatation and Caroli disease predominate, and age-adjusted criteria and MRCP are essential, whereas in post-liver transplant patients, ischemic non-anastomotic strictures require vascular assessment and endoscopic therapy is technically challenging, and in pregnancy, MRCP without gadolinium is preferred to avoid ionizing radiation while still characterizing biliary pathology [^116ZKjEo] [^112Ms3GZ].

> Next, I should review follow-up. After treating a stricture or stone, I need to ensure interval imaging with MRCP or ultrasound and periodic liver tests to detect recurrence, and in patients with cystic intrahepatic dilation or PSC, I should maintain a low threshold to reassess for new strictures, stones, or mass lesions given malignancy risk, adjusting surveillance frequency to the underlying disease and prior intervention history [^112A284s] [^114Fn5MN].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: confirm true dilation and classify the pattern, correlate with cholestatic labs, start with MRCP and targeted cross-sectional imaging, escalate to EUS or ERCP when indicated, secure tissue when malignancy is suspected, and tailor therapy to etiology while coordinating multidisciplinary care and longitudinal surveillance, and I should keep verifying each assumption at every step to avoid anchoring bias and missed malignancy [^11177mkT] [^114dSmp8] [^114gnCZ8].

Intrahepatic biliary dilation is a **radiologic sign** of enlarged intrahepatic bile ducts, most often due to obstruction from stones, strictures, or tumors, but also from congenital anomalies such as Caroli disease or choledochal cysts [^114Fn5MN] [^117LpH2S]. Evaluation should start with **ultrasound and MRCP** to confirm dilation, localize the level, and identify the cause; ERCP or EUS is used when intervention or tissue diagnosis is needed [^11177mkT] [^114dSmp8]. Management targets the underlying cause — stone extraction, stricture dilation, or tumor therapy — and surgery or transplant is considered for refractory cases or diffuse disease [^114gnCZ8] [^117D3QGC]. Prognosis depends on the etiology and timeliness of treatment, with higher risks of cholangitis, biliary cirrhosis, and cholangiocarcinoma in chronic or untreated cases [^112ynRn1] [^112A284s].

---

## Etiology

Intrahepatic biliary dilation has diverse causes; **obstructive causes** include intrahepatic stones, benign or malignant strictures (PSC, IgG4, cholangiocarcinoma), and extrinsic compression (portal biliopathy, lymphadenopathy) [^1178MAUt] [^112k3sNm]. Congenital anomalies include Caroli disease, choledochal cysts, and pancreaticobiliary maljunction [^117LpH2S] [^114snoNk]. Inflammatory or infectious causes include recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, HIV/AIDS cholangiopathy, and parasitic infections such as Clonorchis sinensis [^111BpPgE] [^116ZVWMq].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients may be asymptomatic or present with:

- **Jaundice**: Yellowing of the skin and eyes due to impaired bile flow [^116A2CKz].
- **Pruritus**: Itching from cholestasis [^111muxuq].
- **Right upper quadrant pain**: From biliary distension or cholangitis [^116A2CKz].
- **Fever and chills**: Suggesting cholangitis or infection [^116A2CKz].
- **Weight loss and anorexia**: Suggesting malignancy [^111bhgpa].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Imaging modalities

- **Ultrasound (US)**: First-line to detect dilation, stones, and liver parenchyma; noninvasive and widely available [^115xNaAK].
- **Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)**: Noninvasive gold standard for biliary anatomy, strictures, and congenital anomalies [^114PABjP].
- **Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)**: Diagnostic and therapeutic for stones, strictures, and tissue sampling [^114gnCZ8].
- **Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)**: High yield for small lesions, stones, and tissue acquisition [^117BJFho].

---

### Laboratory tests

Laboratory evaluation includes **liver function tests** (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, bilirubin) to assess cholestasis and hepatocellular injury [^115xNaAK]. Tumor markers such as CA 19–9 and CEA may be elevated in malignancy but are nonspecific [^notfound]. Serologies (ANA, ANCA, IgG4) help identify autoimmune cholangiopathies [^1168RP3N].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

| **Etiology** | **Management approach** |
|-|-|
| Choledocholithiasis | ERCP with stone extraction [^117PLg2M] |
| Benign strictures | Balloon dilation, stenting, or surgical reconstruction [^1174HFAs] |
| Malignant strictures | Surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiation, or palliative stenting [^111bhgpa] |
| Caroli disease | - Segmental resection for localized disease <br/> - Liver transplantation for diffuse disease [^117D3QGC] |
| PSC | - Balloon dilation of dominant strictures <br/> - UDCA <br/> - Liver transplantation for advanced disease [^111xtEUo] |

---

## Complications

Untreated intrahepatic biliary dilation can lead to:

- **Cholangitis**: Recurrent infections [^1162M8H4].
- **Biliary cirrhosis**: From chronic cholestasis [^112ynRn1].
- **Cholangiocarcinoma**: Especially in PSC and Caroli disease [^112A284s] [^115gM32L].
- **Hepatic abscesses**: From chronic infection and stasis [^1162M8H4].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by **cause and timeliness of intervention**. Benign strictures and stones have favorable outcomes with appropriate treatment, whereas malignant causes carry poorer prognoses, particularly cholangiocarcinoma [^111bhgpa]. Congenital diseases such as Caroli disease and PSC have high risks of complications and may require transplant [^117D3QGC] [^113NGuJs].

---

Intrahepatic biliary dilation reflects enlarged intrahepatic bile ducts from multiple causes; **accurate diagnosis and targeted therapy** are essential to prevent complications and improve outcomes [^114Fn5MN].

## References

### MR imaging and CT of the biliary tract [^116Hb8B5]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) can be useful in the diagnosis of biliary disease, with both modalities allowing detailed evaluation of the biliary tract. Careful interrogation of the images is critical, regardless of modality. The identification of dilated bile ducts necessitates evaluation for strictures or filling defects, which is best performed with thin-section imaging. Smooth, concentric short-segment strictures favor a benign cause, whereas abrupt, eccentric long-segment strictures favor a malignancy. At MR imaging, extrabiliary entities such as crossing vessels or metallic clip artifact may mimic strictures and should not be mistaken for disease. A stone is the most common biliary filling defect and may occur in the absence of dilated ducts. Stones commonly have a lamellated, geometric shape and are found in a dependent portion of the duct. Identification of bile duct wall thickening raises concern for cholangitis or malignancy. Improved diagnosis of biliary disease can be achieved with a knowledge of the benefits and limitations of modern MR and CT cholangiographic techniques, including the use of biliary-excreted contrast material and of various postprocessing techniques. Familiarity with the radiologic appearances of the duct lumen, wall, and surrounding structures is also important for accurate image interpretation. The rapidly evolving technology for both MR imaging and CT of the biliary tract will continue to present radiologists with opportunities as well as challenges.

### The role of ERCP in benign diseases of the biliary tract [^115renue]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) — diagnostic role of ERCP, precautions, and therapy: MRCP has essentially replaced ERCP for the diagnosis of PSC, and the routine use of ERCP for the diagnosis of PSC is discouraged because ERCP-associated adverse events have been reported in 7% to 20% with postprocedural hospitalization rates as high as 10%. For dominant strictures, patients with PSC should undergo endoscopic brushing and/or biopsy to assess for malignancy, and antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for all patients with PSC undergoing ERCP. Diagnostic ERCP in PSC may be useful when MRCP is indeterminate due to suboptimal visualization of the intrahepatic bile ducts; ERCP may be considered to exclude a anastomotic stricture in previously stable PSC with clinical deterioration; and ERCP is also indicated to evaluate for cholangiocarcinoma masquerading as a dominant stricture when progressive biliary dilatation, worsening liver tests, or constitutional symptoms are present. For therapy, benign strictures in PSC respond well to balloon dilation with or without stent placement, limited data suggest that balloon dilation is often sufficient and that stents may be associated with an increased risk of adverse events and cholangitis, therefore stenting is usually reserved for strictures that are refractory to dilation, and endoscopic therapy of dominant strictures in patients with PSC may improve survival.

Imaging findings

Typical imaging findings are diffuse dilatation of peripheral intrahepatic bile ducts where the flukes are lodged. Central intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts are often spared.

US is used as screening technique in endemic areas. It characteristically displays the dilated intrahepatic ducts with wall thickening and a surrounding hyperechoic halo thought to be caused by periductal fibrosis. The gallbladder and bile ducts can be filled with detritus and/or gallstones, and sometimes the flukes themselves can be seen as moving echoic foci (Fig. 10a).

Fig. 10
Clonorchiasis in a 50-year-old woman native to China. a. Axial US image shows mild choledocal dilatation with a non-obstructive bile stone. b. Contrast-enhanced CT image shows dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts in the right lobe, with periductal enhancement and intraluminal solid contents (debris, parasites), including bile stones and casts (arrows). Note the hyperaemia of the surrounding hepatic parenchyma (asterisk), secondary to acute inflammatory changes

CT and MR, especially cholangiographic sequences, also show the dilated bile ducts with thickened walls. Periductal enhancement after iv contrast injection indicates active inflammation (Fig. 10b). MR cholangiography can show the flukes as low-signal material within the dilated ducts. Cholangiogram has a high sensitivity in detecting the parasites, which appear as linear or ovoid filling defects up to 10 mm.

Clonorchiasis can mimic other chronic inflammatory biliary processes, namely recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, forcing the radiologist to be precise and correlate closely with the clinical picture and history of the patient.

Diagnosis and treatment

Diagnosis is made by demonstration of the eggs in the host's faeces, biliary, or duodenal aspirates. Also, DNA of the fluke can be detected in the faeces and serum antigens can be identified with ELISA tests. Praziquantel is the treatment of choice.

Diagnostic work up

All guidelines recommend MRI or CT-scan for the diagnosis of CCA. At imaging, upstream biliary tract dilation is detected, except in the case of peripheral intrahepatic CCAs, but the tumour itself may not be detected. MRI/MRCP is highly accurate (98%) for identifying biliary obstruction (Figure 12), but is less able to differentiate benign from malignant causes.CT-scan and MRI protocols continuously improve, with the latest techniques currently involving T1- and T2-weighted sequences as well as diffusion-weighted imaging and late-phase sequences with hepatocyte-specific contrast agents. This has allowed for marked improvements but some aspects still remain problematic with both MRI and CT-scans (e.g. evaluation of the longitudinal extent of the lesion). The performance characteristics of CT-scan and MRI for diagnosis and staging of CCA have recently been reviewed. Another technique, F-FDG PET/CT, has demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 82% and 75% respectively, for diagnosing CCA, with better performance for intra- than extra-hepatic CCA.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for primary sclerosing cholangitis, more specifically with respect to endoscopic biliary dilatation, ACG 2015 guidelines recommend to perform ERCP with balloon dilatation in patients with PSC with dominant stricture and pruritus, and/or cholangitis, to relieve symptoms.

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^113eq8CE]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Choledocholithiasis — non-endoscopic, non-surgical options for biliary decompression include percutaneous radiologic treatment, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and dissolution therapy when endoscopic measures are truly unsuccessful. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD), although mainly used in cases of malignancy, can be considered an accepted alternative method for biliary decompression if the intrahepatic bile ducts are dilated and if other methods of stone extraction have failed. PTBD can use a temporary external drain, an internal/external biliary drain or an internal stent to achieve drainage and is particularly attractive in sepsis secondary to acute cholangitis in a hemodynamically unstable patient unfit for endoscopic or surgical intervention. Following creation of a transhepatic fistula, adjuncts via the drain tract such as basket retrieval, electrohydraulic or laser lithotripsy and the "rendez-vous procedure" can be used after tract dilation. Despite high success rates, these techniques carry a significant risk of bleeding via the transhepatic tract and can cause patient discomfort and dehydration secondary to fluid losses. Interventional radiology can insert external biliary drains in the intrahepatic ducts, internal/external drains that traverse the ampulla into the duodenum, and internal biliary stents placed percutaneously under fluoroscopic guidance.

### CT and MR imaging of primary biliary cholangitis: a pictorial review [^1178MAUt]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

LCH is a rare group of idiopathic disorders caused by the neoplastic proliferation of myeloid cells that infiltrate various tissues and organs. Approximately 10 ~ 15% of cases of LCH involve the bile ducts, so sclerosing cholangitis (often presented as a confined intrahepatic mass, as well as dilated, partially mass-like dilatation of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts can be used to differentiate LCH from PBC.

Secondary biliary cirrhosis is a form of cirrhosis caused by prolonged obstruction of the large bile duct. Cholelithiasis (Fig. 11) is the most common cause of biliary obstruction and often coexists with cholangitis. Other conditions include carcinoma of the pancreatic head or biliary tree (Fig. 12), postsurgical duct stricture, compression of the bile ducts with enlarged lymph nodes, and biliary atresia (mostly in neonates). Imaging will help to diagnose the level, severity, and cause of biliary obstruction and detect signs of cirrhosis. Calculi can be hyperattenuating to hypoattenuating to bile on CT and manifest as signal voids on T2WI and MRCP. In other settings, stenosis of the lumen of the large bile duct, with or without proximal ductal dilatation, can be seen. Benign stenoses tend to present with smooth symmetrical luminal narrowing, while malignant stenoses often manifest as abrupt transitions without tapering.

### Imaging of biliary tree abnormalities [^114Fn5MN]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Pathologic conditions of the biliary system, although common, can be difficult to diagnose clinically. Challenges in biliary imaging include anatomic variants and the dynamic nature of the biliary tract, which can change with age and intervention, blurring the boundaries of normal and abnormal. Choledochal cysts can have numerous appearances and are important to diagnose given the risk of cholangiocarcinoma potentially requiring surgical resection. Choledocholithiasis, the most common cause of biliary dilatation, can be difficult to detect at US and CT, with MRI having the highest sensitivity. However, knowledge of the imaging pitfalls of MRI and MR cholangiopancreatography is crucial to avoid misinterpretation. Newer concepts in biliary tract malignancy include intraductal papillary biliary neoplasms that may develop into cholangiocarcinoma. New paradigms in the classification of cholangiocarcinoma correspond to the wide range of imaging appearances of the disease and have implications for prognosis. Accurately staging cholangiocarcinoma is imperative, given expanding curative options including transplant and more aggressive surgical options. Infections of the biliary tree include acute cholangitis or recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, characterized by obstruction, strictures, and central biliary dilatation. Inflammatory conditions include primary sclerosing cholangitis, which features strictures and fibrosis but can be difficult to differentiate from secondary causes of sclerosing cholangitis, including more recently described entities such as immunoglobulin G4-related sclerosing cholangitis and COVID-19 secondary sclerosing cholangitis. The authors describe a wide variety of benign and malignant biliary tract abnormalities, highlight differentiating features of the cholangitides, provide an approach to interpretation based on the pattern of imaging findings, and discuss pearls and pitfalls of imaging to facilitate accurate diagnosis. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for primary sclerosing cholangitis, more specifically with respect to endoscopic biliary dilatation, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to decide on the choice between biliary balloon dilation with or without stenting at the discretion of the endoscopist. Remove stent within 4 weeks following placement if a plastic biliary stent is placed.

Differentiation of PBC from similar diseases

PBC should be differentiated primarily from intrahepatic cholestasis of other causes (e.g. PSC, IgG4-related sclerosing cholangiopathy, sarcoidosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), and secondary biliary cirrhosis) Of these, the distinction between PBC, PSC, and IgG4-related sclerosing cholangiopathy is even more important (Table 3).

Table 3
Differential diagnosis between primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis

PBC primary biliary cholangitis, PSC primary sclerosing cholangitis, HLA human leukocyte antigen, AMA antimitochondrial antibody, MRCP magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography

PSC is also a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease involving the bile ducts. However, it differs from PBC in several ways. First, PSC classically occurs in young people aged 30–40 years and is predominantly in males (the ratio of males to females is approximately 2:1). In addition, there is a close relationship between the development of PSC and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigens. Furthermore, the intestinal microbiome plays a key role in the initiation of immune responses in the biliary tree. Therefore, there is usually a high probability of diagnosis of irritable bowel disease, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, in patients with PSC. On imaging, most PSC cases are observed to involve both the medium- to large-calibre intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary systems, usually presenting as a branching-tree appearance with saccular dilatations and segmental strictures of the extrahepatic biliary ducts. Moreover, PSC may also involve the cystic duct, gallbladder, and pancreatic duct, which is a point of differentiation from PBC (Fig. 9). Unlike PBC, patients with PSC have a higher risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma regardless of the degree of fibrosis. About one-thirds of CCAs are detected within 1 year of the diagnosis of PSC. Besides, since 80% of PSC patients may have a combined inflammatory bowel disease, it is advisable to recommend a fusion of CA-199 and colonoscopy, in addition to MRI/MRCP, for the follow-up of PSC patients.

### Diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasound in dilated common bile duct with non-diagnostic cross-sectional imaging [^117BJFho]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Biliary dilatation as detected by transabdominal ultrasound often requires further evaluation with cross sectional imaging such as CT scan or MRI or both. All the above three modalities have their limitations in detecting etiological diagnosis in the given setting. Endoscopic ultrasound, despite being invasive in nature, has the advantage of being in close proximity to distal bile duct and pancreas to detect lesions which might be missed by cross sectional imaging. Thereby, EUS have close to 100% specificity in detecting benign lesions and greater than 90% sensitivity and accuracy in detecting pancreatic neoplasms. Few studies have looked into role of EUS for evaluation of dilated bile duct as detected by transabdominal ultrasound without subjecting the patients to cross sectional imaging. However, in most of the institutions, as of today, patients undergo cross sectional imaging in attempt to detect etiology for biliary dilatation and EUS is usually employed after non-contributory cross-sectional imaging. Multiple studies have analysed role of EUS in detecting etiology of biliary dilatation after non-contributory CT or MRCP or both in retrospective and prospective fashion.

Current study attempted to find the diagnostic role of EUS in this real-world scenario in prospective fashion. In this cohort, most of the patients were symptomatic as was noted in another prospective study. In more than half of the cases (54%), EUS was able to detect lesion responsible for biliary dilatation in our cohort with ampullary neoplasm being the commonest detected pathology. Similarly, EUS was noted to establish a positive diagnosis in other studies with outcome in favour of either neoplastic or benign etiologies.

This study identified clinical jaundice at presentation as a predictor for a positive diagnosis on EUS as well as for finding ampullary mass or pancreatic mass on EUS. Male sex, altered LFT, elevated pancreatic enzymes and dilated MPD with CBD were noted to be predictors in the retrospective study by Carriere et al. However, the later study employed bivariate analysis for the same instead of multivariate analysis as was done in present study. Pausawasdi et al. noted that intrahepatic biliary dilatation, in addition to male sex and elevated aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase were predictive of pathological obstruction. However, in contrast to the present study, it was retrospective in nature.

### Biliary intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm manifesting only as dilatation of the hepatic lobar or segmental bile ducts: imaging features in six patients [^112prMcn]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the imaging features of intrahepatic biliary intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm manifesting only as dilatation of the lobar or segmental bile ducts without a visible mass to determine whether this type of cholangiocarcinoma can be recognized on the basis of distinct imaging features.

Conclusion

Intrahepatic biliary intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm can spread along the mucosa without forming a mass and can produce a large amount of mucin. Severe dilatation of the lobar or segmental intrahepatic bile ducts with crowding and severe atrophy of the hepatic parenchyma are helpful imaging findings.

### Endoscopic dilation of dominant stenoses in primary sclerosing cholangitis: outcome after long-term treatment [^114eCn86]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is characterized by progressive fibrotic inflammation and obliteration of intra- and/or extrahepatic bile ducts. Total or subtotal stenoses of major bile ducts are associated with reduced survival.

Objective

To evaluate the outcome after long-term endoscopic treatment.

Design

Prospective, single-center study.

Setting

Tertiary care academic medical center.

Patients

A total of 171 patients treated with ursodeoxycholic acid were followed for as long as 20 years. At entry, 20 patients had dominant stenoses, and during a median follow-up period of 7.1 years, dominant stenosis developed in another 77.

Interventions

Ninety-six patients with dominant stenoses were treated by repeated balloon dilation; 5 patients with complete obstruction with bacterial cholangitis were stented.

Main Outcome Measurements

Survival free of liver transplantation, number of procedures, complications.

Results

In total, 500 balloon dilations were performed and 5 stents were placed. Complications were pancreatitis (2.2%), bacterial cholangitis (1.4%), and bile duct perforation (0.2%); there were no deaths. Repeated endoscopic interventions allowed the preservation of a functioning common bile duct and of at least 1 hepatic duct up to 2 cm above the bifurcation in all patients. Progression of intrahepatic bile duct and liver disease led to the need for liver transplantation in 22 of 96 patients. Five years after the first dilation of a dominant stenosis, the survival free of liver transplantation rate was 81%, and after 10 years, it was 52%.

Limitations

Single-center study, no control group, primary end-stage liver disease excluded.

Conclusion

Repeated endoscopic balloon dilations of dominant stenoses allow the preservation of a functioning common bile duct for many years.

### CT imaging findings of abdominopelvic vascular compression syndromes: what the radiologist needs to know [^112k3sNm]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 18
Drawing illustrating the coronal view of portal biliopathy

About 70–100% of patients with radiological evidence of portal biliopathy are initially asymptomatic. Portal biliopathy becomes clinically manifest only in a minority of patients with chronic cholestasis and jaundice. Overall, 4–10% patients may develop complications like choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, and secondary biliary cirrhosis.

Ultrasound may demonstrate the intra- and extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation and the imaging findings of portal cavernous transformation, including multiple anechoic tubular structures with vascular flow at color Doppler, corresponding to paracholedochal collateral veins in hepatoduodenal ligament and porta hepatis, and increased flow in hepatic artery as a compensatory mechanism. Contrast-enhanced CT (Fig. 19) is mainly performed to exclude other causes of biliary dilatation since it can mimic malignant strictures of the distal bile duct from pancreatic adenocarcinoma or biliary neoplasms. The most common imaging finding of portal biliopathy, besides the portal cavernoma, is the acute angulation of the common bile duct forming a "kinking", which can be considered the consequence of the extrinsic compression by the dilated paracholedochal veins. When MRI with cholangiography is performed, it may demonstrate a "scalloping" or "wavy" delineation of the extrahepatic biliary ducts secondary to indentations by the dilated peribiliary veins.

Portal biliopathy does not require specific treatment in asymptomatic patients. Symptomatic subjects may be approached with interventional radiology or surgical management. Interventional radiology plays a role in biliary drainage, through the placement of nasobiliary or biliary stent, or in portal vein recanalization and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement in selected patients with chronic portal vein thrombosis. In the case of persistent biliary obstruction, a surgical decompression may be performed with hepaticojejunostomy or choledochoduodenostomy.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of biliary strictures [^111Ah67u]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

A biliary stricture is an abnormal narrowing in the ductal drainage system of the liver that can result in clinically and physiologically relevant obstruction to the flow of bile. The most common and ominous etiology is malignancy, underscoring the importance of a high index of suspicion in the evaluation of this condition. The goals of care in patients with a biliary stricture are confirming or excluding malignancy (diagnosis) and reestablishing flow of bile to the duodenum (drainage); the approach to diagnosis and drainage varies according to anatomic location (extrahepatic vs perihilar). For extrahepatic strictures, endoscopic ultrasound-guided tissue acquisition is highly accurate and has become the diagnostic mainstay. In contrast, the diagnosis of perihilar strictures remains a challenge. Similarly, the drainage of extrahepatic strictures tends to be more straightforward and safer and less controversial than that of perihilar strictures. Recent evidence has provided some clarity in multiple important areas pertaining to biliary strictures, whereas several remaining controversies require additional research. The goal of this guideline is to provide practicing clinicians with the most evidence-based guidance on the approach to patients with extrahepatic and perihilar strictures, focusing on diagnosis and drainage.

There is subtle associated fat stranding. Findings are consistent with a gallbladder mucocoele. The gallbladder wall thickening and fat stranding are suggestive of possible empyema

Mirizzi syndrome refers to a gallstone that is impacted in the cystic duct or neck of gallbladder which causes extrinsic compression on the common bile duct resulting in obstructive jaundice (Fig. 18).

The common bile duct is normal in calibre. Appearances are consistent with Mirizzi syndrome, with a stone in Hartmann's pouch of the gallbladder causing extrinsic compression of the common hepatic duct

Both biliary dilatation and the offending gallstone can be seen on ultrasound; however, cross-sectional imaging with MRI or CT, or ERCP, may be needed to confirm that biliary dilatation is secondary to compression from a gallbladder/cystic duct stone rather than secondary to a CBD calculus.

Pancreaticobiliary system

The next anatomical location where gallstones can be found is outside the gallbladder but within the pancreaticobiliary system. When gallstones exit the gallbladder into the common bile duct (choledocholithiasis), they can often obstruct the normal drainage of bile which can lead to jaundice. This is typically associated with pain, unlike malignant biliary obstruction which is characteristically painless (Fig. 19).

Fig. 19

These images demonstrate multiple filling defects (arrows) within the common bile duct with associated biliary duct dilatation consistent with obstructing choledocholithiasis

The obstruction of biliary drainage and stasis of bile may result in infection in the form of ascending cholangitis and associated sepsis. The clinical picture associated with this is described in Reynolds' pentad consisting of fever, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, hypotension and altered mental status. These patients may require urgent decompression of the biliary system.

### Congenital dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary ducts… [^112UXEmk]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Congenital cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary ducts, until recently, has been infrequently recognized. Three patients with this anomaly have been treated at Northwestern University Medical Center during the past five years. Review of the world literature has yielded an additional 81 cases. Operative cholangiogram has become the most valuable test for the diagnosis, location, and extent of the disease process. Hepatic lobectomy or segmental resection yields the best results. Internal drainage has been the most frequent surgical treatment performed. Because of recurrent episodes of cholangitis, prolonged postoperative therapy with antibiotics and careful follow-up study are required. Watts DR, Lorenzo GA, Beal JM.

### Management of extrahepatic bile duct cysts [^116jzQYf]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bile duct cysts are rare anomalies that to this day are poorly understood. They are more common in the Asian population, and often found and treated in childhood. In Western countries, bile duct cysts are more commonly discovered incidentally in adults or as part of work-up for jaundice or non-specific upper abdominal symptoms. Often referred to as 'choledochal cysts', even in contemporary literature, the biliary dilatation can occur throughout the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. Thus, the term 'bile duct cyst' or 'biliary tract cyst' is preferred.

This paper describes a case of Caroli's disease in a female patient aged 32, who complained of nonspecific abdominal pain without cholesthasis or cholangitis. Liver resonance shows segment saccular dilations closely connected to intrahepatic biliary ducts, that differ from the Caroli's syndrome, which is more common and consists of multiple intrahepatic cystic dilatations, associated to congenital hepatic fibrosis. This patient has a congenital anomaly with an uncommon oligosymptomatic form of Caroli's disease that should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with recurrent abdominal pain.

### Biliary tract cancers, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114gnCZ8]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN biliary tract cancers — intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) imaging: Preoperative imaging for accurate staging of resectable CCA should be done with multidetector multiphasic abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI; contrast-enhanced MRI with MRCP is preferred for evaluating the extent of biliary tract involvement, and imaging with multiphasic CT or MRI with thin cuts, or multiphase CT or MRI of the liver and biliary tree should specifically address the anatomy of the biliary tree, hepatic arteries, and portal veins and their relationship to the tumor. Chest CT with or without contrast is recommended for staging. When biliary duct involvement is suspected, it is very important to obtain high-quality biliary protocol imaging (preferably CT) to evaluate the extent of tumor prior to stenting because reactive changes from stenting could potentially compromise the ability to delineate the complete extent of biliary tract involvement. EUS (endoscopic ultrasound) or ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) may be helpful in the setting of bile duct dilation if no mass is seen on CT or MRI and can also be used to establish tissue diagnosis and provide access to relieve biliary obstruction. CT of the chest with or without contrast and CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast may be used for follow-up, and delayed phase imaging is preferred when the diagnosis of intrahepatic CCA is suspected or confirmed. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Imaging

Recommendation 7: Contrast enhanced multiphasic CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis to stage the primary tumour, including assessment of local vascular relationships, should be undertaken for all types of CCA.

Strength of recommendation: STRONG

Quality of evidence: MODERATE

Recommendation 8: Contrast enhanced MRI and MRCP should be undertaken for perihilar and intrahepatic tumours to better delineate the extent of biliary involvement and identify any satellites/intrahepatic metastases.

Strength of recommendation: STRONG

Quality of evidence: MODERATE

Recommendation 9: For tumours involving the more distal extrahepatic duct, MRI is unlikely to add any further information over and above CT.

Strength of recommendation: MODERATE

Quality of evidence: LOW

Recommendation 10: 18 FDG-PET CT for detection of nodal and distant metastatic disease is recommended as part of staging investigations.

Strength of recommendation: STRONG

Quality of evidence: MODERATE

Recommendation 11: US or CT-guided biopsy of the primary intrahepatic tumour or metastatic lesions should be undertaken to acquire a pathological diagnosis following MDT discussion and consensus.

Strength of recommendation: STRONG

Quality of evidence: HIGH

In the diagnosis and staging of suspected CCA, the local tumour extent, vascular/biliary involvement, anatomic variations of the vessels/biliary tree and presence or absence of extrahepatic disease should be assessed. A multimodality approach is often required to combine the advantages of the various imaging techniques, which provide additive information.

Imaging studies should be performed before any biliary intervention to avoid secondary inflammatory change that can mask the tumour and lead to overestimation or underestimation of its true extent. All imaging modalities can underestimate the longitudinal tumour extent owing to microscopic spread along the mucosal/submucosal layer of the bile duct.

Transabdominal ultrasound (TUS)

Cholangiocarcinoma should be suspected when there is biliary ductal dilatation, particularly with a related mass and consistent clinical history. In suspected biliary obstruction, TUS is reliable for excluding gallstones but is operator-dependent and is insufficient alone for investigating suspected CCA. For detecting advanced CCA in patients with PSC, TUS offers specificity and negative predictive value of 90%, but sensitivity and positive predictive value are only 50%.TUS may miss small tumours and cannot accurately define tumour extent. The role of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in CCA is also limited but might be helpful as an additional modality when assessing indeterminate focal liver lesions.

Results

Postoperative IHBD stones were identified in 12 of 117 patients with CBD (10.2%). The median age at the diagnosis of IHBD stones was 11.5 (6–28) years, and the median duration from hepaticojejunostomy to the first diagnosis of hepatolithiasis was 10 (3–28) years. The comparison of background factors between patients with and without IHBD stones was shown in Table 1. The median age at primary surgery for CBD was significantly younger in the patients with IHBD stones (1 year [1 month to 4 years] vs. 3 years [14 days to 17 years]; p = 0.02). The Todani classification was type Ia in four patients and IVa in seven patients; the remaining patient had non-dilatation type. Type IVa was significantly more common in patients with IHBD stones. Patients with type Ic showed no postoperative IHBD stones; the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.03).

Small stones (< 7 mm) were successfully resolved on abdominal ultrasonography at one year after the administration of UDCA in 2 cases (Fig. 2). Three of the five remained unchanged and asymptomatic, and continued taking UDCA and attending follow-up visits.

### The use of endoscopic ultrasound in the evaluation of unexplained biliary dilation [^117F6Hw5]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Isolated biliary dilation, as an incidental diagnosis, is increasing owing to an increase in the use of noninvasive abdominal imaging and poses a diagnostic challenge to physicians especially when further noninvasive diagnostic testing fails to reveal an etiology. This article reviews available data describing the natural history of this clinical scenario and the impact of endoscopic ultrasound examination in the evaluation of unexplained dilation of the common bile duct.

### Incidentally identified common bile duct dilatation: a systematic review of evaluation, causes, and outcome [^116ACd9J]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

With the widespread use of abdominal imaging, an incidentally found dilated common bile duct (CBD) is a common radiographic finding. The significance of a dilated CBD as a predictor of underlying disease and long-term outcome have not been well elucidated.

Goals

A systematic review of studies on patients with dilated CBD was performed to identify etiologies and clinical factors that may predict which patients require further diagnostic testing and long-term outcomes. A PubMed search for relevant articles published between 2001 and 2014 was performed.

Results

The search yielded a total of 882 articles, and after careful individual review for eligibility and relevancy, 9 peer-reviewed studies were included. A cause of the CBD dilation was found on average in 33% of cases and the most common causes were: CBD stone, chronic pancreatitis, and periampullary diverticulum. The overall CBD diameter was not associated with finding a causative lesion. Coexisting CBD and intrahepatic bile duct dilation, age, and jaundice were found to be indicators of pathologic lesions. Dilation of both the CBD and pancreatic duct was suggestive of pancreatic disease, especially pancreatic malignancy in the setting of obstructive jaundice. Follow-up was reported in 6 studies ranging from 6 to 85 months, and generally there was no change in the diagnosis.

Conclusions

Incidentally found biliary tract dilatation can be a manifestation of significant biliary tract disease including malignancy. Long-term outcome is not well defined and further prospective studies examining the most cost-effective approach to evaluation are needed.

Conclusions

Oral UDCA may be effective for small stones. Although DB-ERC should be considered as a first-line interventional therapy for lithotomy, it may be infeasible due to a long jejunal loop, and pancreatitis may occur. Long-term follow-up and early detection and treatment of IHBD stones may provide a good prognosis.

### Medical treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis [^111xtEUo]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic cholestasis is the main feature of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), the most common chronic cholestatic liver diseases in adults. Although the etiology of both diseases remains poorly understood, auto-immune processes appear to be important, particularly in PBC. PBC and PSC usually slowly progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, and death, unless liver transplantation is performed. Ursodeoxycholic acid(UDCA), a hydrophilic dihydroxy bile acid, is the only drug currently approved for the treatment of patients with PBC and is also used in patients with PSC. In addition to UDCA, patients with PSC should be referred to endoscopic dilatation of major bile duct stenoses. Several potential mechanisms of action of UDCA have been proposed, including intracellular modulation of signaling events and secretion. Various immunosuppressive drugs have been evaluated alone or in combination with UDCA-especially for the treatment of PBC. Of these drugs, the topical corticosteroid budesonide, together with UDCA, appears promising in the treatment of early stage PBC, but data remain insufficient to warrant use of budesonide outside of controlled studies.

We describe a case of possible monolobar Caroli's disease in a patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) who presented with features of cholangitis. Diagnostic workup, which included endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, revealed focal intrahepatic biliary dilatation confined to the right lobe. The patient subsequently underwent right hepatic lobectomy. Pathology revealed multiple cysts filled with calculi and inflammation in the cyst walls. Special stain results for fungi and acid-fast organisms were negative. The presence of advanced AIDS in this patient raised the possibility of this being a possible manifestation of AIDS cholangiopathy.

Choledochal cysts

Choledochal cysts are congenital saccular or fusiform dilatations of the biliary tree and are approximately three times more prevalent in females. The overall incidence is approximately 1–2:100,000–150,000 live births, but again they are far more common in the Asian population with a reported prevalence of up to 1:1,000 in Japan. Choledochal cysts are usually classified according to Todani into five types (Fig. 6): type I, fusiform dilatation of the common bile duct below the cystic bile duct (Ia), or of the common bile duct and hepatic ducts (Ib); type II, one or more cystic diverticula of the common bile ducts; type III, focal dilatation of the distal common bile duct in the papil region into which the pancreatic ducts drain (also called choledochoceles); type IV, multiple dilatations of the intra- and extrahepatic (IVa) or only the extrahepatic (IVb) bile ducts; and type V, Caroli disease (segmental ectasia of the large intrahepatic ducts throughout the liver). The type I choledochal cysts are the most common, occurring in up to 80–90% of cases. An abnormal junction of the common bile duct with the pancreatic duct is associated with choledochal cysts, and found in up to 90% of cases in the Asian population.

### Intrahepatic cystic biliary dilatation constitutes a significant prognostic factor in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis [^11728Cxh]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the prognostic value of cystic dilatation (CD) of the intrahepatic biliary ducts in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).

Methods

A single-center cohort of 205 patients with PSC from 2003 to 2016 was analysed. CD was defined by quantitative and qualitative criteria. Radiological and clinical courses were assessed. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate cumulative survival without liver transplantation (LT) from the date of PSC diagnosis. A log-rank test was performed to compare survival time of PSC patients with and without CD.

Results

A total of 15 (7.3%) PSC patients (12 males) with a median age of 23 years at diagnosis had CD. Five patients had one CD; seven patients had two or three CDs; and three patients had diffuse CD. CDs ranged in small diameter size from 12 to 32 mm. Radiological evolution of CD was markedly variable. However, a radiological worsening of PSC over time was observed in all patients. The clinical course was characterized by the occurrence of complications in most patients. Half of the patients with CD underwent LT at a median time of 40 months from diagnosis of CD and the median survival time from PSC diagnosis was significantly lower than in PSC without CD (10.7 vs. 23.4 years; HR 3.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.7–8.3, p = 0.001).

Conclusions

CD in PSC is an unusual condition that mostly affects young patients. It is characterized by a rapid, unfavorable course and constitutes a significant prognostic factor.

Key Points

- Cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary ducts affects young patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and is characterized by a markedly variable radiological evolution.
- Biliary wall inflammation, found in explanted livers, could be a key feature in the pathogenesis of cystic dilatation.
- Cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary ducts is characterized by an unfavorable course and constitutes a significant prognostic factor of primary sclerosing cholangitis.

### Sclerosing cholangitis [^113M431S]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disorder characterized by strictures and dilatations of the biliary tree. The median survival has been reported to be 12 years from diagnosis but patients diagnosed during the last decade have been shown to have longer survival of a median of 18 years. Small duct PSC seems to be an entity of its own and rarely progresses to large duct PSC and the prognosis of small duct PSC is much better than in large duct disease. Cholangiocarcinoma does not develop in patients with small duct PSC according to recently published studies. Autoantibodies binding to biliary epithelial cells have been demonstrated in sera from patients with PSC but the pathogenic role of these remains to be determined. It is suggested that inflammatory bowel disease is accelerated after orthotopic liver transplantation. MR cholangiopancreatography is increasingly used in clinical practice and has been reported to have similar diagnostic accuracy as ERCP. However, lack of standardization of this novel technology makes it unclear if it can supersede ERCP as a diagnostic tool in PSC at the present time. Better diagnostic tests to detect cholangiocarcinoma in patients with PSC are urgently needed.

### Radiological biliary intervention for stone disease [^1174HFAs]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Balloon dilation

Balloon angioplasty has emerged as a pivotal radiological intervention tailored for the management of biliary strictures. It involves the catheter-guided introduction and inflation of a balloon within the narrowed segment of the biliary system, aiming to dilate the stricture and restore patency.

The procedure commences with precise catheter positioning, typically under fluoroscopic guidance, ensuring that the balloon spans the entirety of the stricture. Once suitably positioned, the balloon is progressively inflated, exerting radial force on the stricture. This dilation facilitates the improvement of bile flow, alleviates symptoms and, importantly, paves the way for further interventions, such as stone removal or stent placement, if deemed necessary. Initially, it is advisable to use a balloon size that is either slightly smaller or equal to the diameter of the bile duct near the stricture. This approach helps reduce the chances of causing a bile leak. If needed, balloons of a larger diameter can be used in later dilations, with sizes potentially 25% to 30% bigger than the estimated diameter of the duct being expanded. Generally, the diameters of balloons used vary between 4 and 12 mm. Strictures in the CBD in adults can typically be safely expanded to a size of 10–12 mm. For particularly resistant stenoses, high pressure balloons or cutting balloons may also be used.

### Congenital biliary dilatation may consist of 2 disease entities [^114Teqtr]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

This study aims to establish the possible mechanisms of pathogenesis of congenital biliary dilatation and to classify the disease accordingly.

Methods

Radiologic features of congenital biliary dilatation and pancreaticobiliary malunion in 107 affected children were examined and correlated with laboratory results. Relative lengths/diameters were calculated to provide comparison between children of different ages. Intraluminal pressures of common bile duct (CBD) were measured intraoperatively.

Results

The minimal relative diameters of distal CBD negatively correlated with the maximal relative diameters/lengths of dilated CBD, the maximal relative diameters of common hepatic duct, and left/right hepatic ducts. The intraluminal pressure in patients with a stenotic distal CBD (stenotic group) was significantly higher than that in patients with a nonstenotic distal CBD (nonstenotic group). The narrower the distal CBD, the more deranged the liver function. Conversely, serum/bile amylase levels were more elevated in the nonstenotic group. Common channel protein plugs were only found in the nonstenotic group, whereas common hepatic duct strictures, intrahepatic duct dilatations, and calculi were detected more frequently in the stenotic group.

Conclusion

We propose to categorize congenital biliary dilatation into 2 subgroups: (1) cystic type with stenotic distal CBD associated with deranged liver function and common hepatic duct stricture and (2) fusiform type with nonstenotic distal CBD associated with pancreatitis and common channel protein plugs. Different underlying pathologies of each group require different operative strategies.

### Prognosis… [^111bhgpa]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately 50% of cholangiocarcinomas arise in the bile ducts of the perihilar region, 40% in the distal region, and 10% in the intrahepatic region. Many bile duct cancers are multifocal. In most patients, the tumor cannot be completely removed by surgery and is incurable. Palliative measures such as resection, radiation therapy, or stenting procedures may maintain adequate biliary drainage and allow for improved quality of life. Anatomy The biliary system consists of a network of ducts that carry bile from the liver to the small bowel and is classified by its anatomical location. Bile is produced by the liver and is important for fat digestion. Intrahepatic bile duct The bile ducts located within the liver are called intrahepatic bile ducts.

Tumors of the intrahepatic bile ducts originate in small intrahepatic ductules or large intrahepatic ducts that are proximal to the bifurcation of the right and left hepatic ducts. These tumors are also known as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. Extrahepatic bile duct The bile ducts located outside of the liver are called extrahepatic bile ducts. They include part of the right and left hepatic ducts that are outside of the liver, the common hepatic duct, and the common bile duct. The extrahepatic bile ducts can be further divided into the perihilar region and distal region. Perihilar region. The hilum is the region where the right and left hepatic ducts exit the liver and join to form the common hepatic duct that is proximal to the origin of the cystic duct. Tumors of this region are also known as perihilar cholangiocarcinomas or Klatskin tumors. Distal region. This region includes the common bile duct and inserts into the small intestine.

Tumors of this region are also known as extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. Clinical Features Distal and perihilar bile duct cancers frequently cause biliary tract obstruction, leading to the following symptoms:

- Jaundice.
- Weight loss.
- Abdominal pain.
- Fever.
- Pruritus. Intrahepatic bile duct cancer may be relatively indolent and difficult to differentiate clinically from metastatic adenocarcinoma deposits in the liver.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of biliary strictures [^114dSmp8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — biliary strictures: A biliary stricture is defined as an abnormal narrowing in the ductal drainage system of the liver that can cause clinically and physiologically relevant obstruction to bile flow, with the most common and ominous etiology being malignancy; the goals of care are confirming or excluding malignancy (diagnosis) and reestablishing bile flow to the duodenum (drainage), and the approach varies by anatomic location. For extrahepatic strictures, endoscopic ultrasound-guided tissue acquisition is highly accurate and has become the diagnostic mainstay, whereas the diagnosis of perihilar strictures remains a challenge; drainage of extrahepatic strictures tends to be more straightforward and safer and less controversial than that of perihilar strictures. Biliary strictures are generally divided according to anatomic location (extrahepatic, perihilar, or intrahepatic), but intrahepatic strictures are not specifically addressed in this document; strictures related to primary sclerosing cholangitis are covered in a separate American College of Gastroenterology guideline, and the document does not address surgical or oncological management of malignant strictures except where there are endoscopic implications.

### A new clinical classification of congenital biliary dilatation-HUAXI CBD classification [^1136U2dH]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Lenriot et al. argued that the Todani classification emphasizes the association of extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile duct dilatation without considering their distinct nature, especially regarding the treatment and long-term prognosis of intrahepatic bile duct dilatation. Therefore, in 1998, they suggested combining Todani type IVb with multiple extrahepatic dilatations into type Id, and regrouping Todani type IVa with multiple extrahepatic and intrahepatic dilatations into a type IV based on the morphology of intrahepatic bile duct dilatation (cystic, segmental, or fusiform dilatations). This modification differentiates extrahepatic bile duct dilatation in cases associated with intrahepatic duct dilatation and improves their classification.

Visser et al. have suggested that the Todani classification system actually encompasses four different diseases in terms of their pathogenesis, risk of malignancy, natural history, and treatment, and thus proposed describing these entities as congenital choledochal cyst, choledochocele, choledochal diverticulum, and Caroli's disease. Many researchers have subsequently supported this approach. However, these four diseases have similar clinical features and generally similar treatments (with the exception of Caroli's disease), so they can be differentiated but not necessarily be completely independent, which seems to over-exaggerate the differences of each type.

Dong et al. also concluded that the Todani classification was cumbersome, did not consider pathological results, and was confusing regarding the classification of extrahepatic bile duct dilatation, which led them to propose a new system based on anatomical and clinicopathological features from analysis of plenty of data and clinical practices. Their system combines cases that only involve the extrahepatic bile ducts, subdivides Todani type IVa, and classifies intrahepatic dilatation as involving the peripheral or central hepatic ducts, with further classification according to the extent of liver involvement. Thus, the Biliary Surgery Group of the Chinese Society of Medical Surgery acknowledged in 2017 that this classification system was useful for guiding the surgical strategy. However, Dong's exhaustive classification system is complicated to remember and apply, which is a challenge in primary hospitals, and this system includes some overlap in terms of treatment strategy, with unclear boundaries. Moreover, Dong's classification system does not cover cases with extrahepatic dilatation plus intrahepatic distal dilatation.

### Diffuse caroli's disease with atypical presentation: a case report [^112Keo5B]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Caroli's disease (CD) is an uncommon congenital malformation, first described by Jacques Caroli in 1958. Its incidence is extremely low (1 in 1,000,000 population), and comprises two entities, namely CD and Caroli's syndrome.

Caroli's syndrome is more common than CD and consists of multiple cystic or saccular dilatation of intrahepatic biliary ducts (IHBD) associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis. Caroli's syndrome is a genetic disorder with a probable autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Many authors believe that the two conditions are different stages of the same disease characterized by ductal dilatation and periportal fibrosis.

Patients with Caroli's syndrome have signs and symptoms of portal hypertension and hepatocellular insufficiency, recurrent attacks of cholelithiasis and cholangitis, and occasionally biliary abscess. Patients with CD present recurrent attacks of cholangitis (right upper quadrant pain, fever and jaundice rarely).

This paper describes a case of a woman with CD with cystic formations randomly distributed by the hepatic parenchyma, diagnosed at adulthood, during the investigation of nonspecific abdominal pain framework.

### A new clinical classification of congenital biliary dilatation-HUAXI CBD classification [^114EBzGD]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Current CBD classification

Vater et al. first described BD in 1723, which was divided into 3 types by Alonso-Lej et al. in 1959, and Todani et al. added types IV and V to their classification system in 1976, which is still widely used in clinical practice. The Todani classification system was based on the anatomical knowledge and surgical procedures of that time, as well as the concept that biliary cystic dilatation could occur in the common bile ducts as well as any part of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. The Todani system was effective for guiding the surgical treatment strategies of that time, however, the small sample size and relatively early examinations and surgical techniques led to a system that is now considered confusing and misleading. First, dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct is often secondary to dilatation of the extrahepatic duct, which can obscure the distinction between types I and IV. Second, types I and IVa account for > 95% of cases, and the relative rarity of the other types makes the Todani classification impractical. Third, each type can have different etiologies, postoperative complications, risks of malignancy, and long-term outcomes. For example, Caroli disease has a clear genetic background and is usually combined with liver fibrosis and extrahepatobiliary lesions. Therefore, several individuals and institutions have questioned the continued clinical use of the Todani classification system and have proposed new ways of classifying the disease. Subsequently, Todani provided an update that included the concept of pancreaticobiliary maljunction and indicated that types Ia, Ic, and IVa are usually associated with pancreaticobiliary maljunction, however, this update is no practical guide to the operation.

### Fibropolycystic liver disease: CT and MR imaging findings [^11328aPD]. Radiographics (2005). Low credibility.

Fibropolycystic liver disease encompasses a spectrum of related lesions of the liver and biliary tract that are caused by abnormal embryologic development of the ductal plates. These lesions (congenital hepatic fibrosis, biliary hamartomas, autosomal dominant polycystic disease, Caroli disease, choledochal cysts) can be clinically silent or can cause signs and symptoms such as cholangitis, portal hypertension, gastrointestinal bleeding, infections, and space-occupying masses. The different types of fibropolycystic liver disease demonstrate characteristic findings at computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Patients with congenital hepatic fibrosis typically have imaging evidence of liver morphologic abnormalities, varices, splenomegaly, renal lesions, and other associated ductal plate abnormalities. Biliary hamartomas usually manifest as multiple cysts that are nearly uniform in size and measure up to 15 mm in diameter. Autosomal dominant polycystic disease typically manifests as an enlarged and diffusely cystic liver. In Caroli disease, cystic or fusiform dilatation of the intrahepatic ducts is seen, as well as the "central dot sign", which corresponds to a portal vein branch protruding into the lumen of a dilated bile duct. Choledochal cyst manifests as a fusiform or cystic dilatation of the extrahepatic bile duct. Awareness of these CT and MR imaging features is essential in detecting and differentiating between various fibropolycystic liver diseases and can assist in proper management.

### Peribiliary cysts: a systematic review and proposal of a classification framework [^115DJ3BB]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Peribiliary cysts are one of the most recent discoveries in the domain of liver cystic abnormalities. These lesions are usually found up the liver hilum, tracking the fourth-order biliary duct branches. Although they are usually diminutive, measuring < 20 mm in diameter and lacking communication with the adjoining large bile ducts, they can at times cluster together resembling a multilocular malignancy, mimic biliary dilation (taking the appearance of periportal fluid-filled cylinders), or grow to compress the neighbouring structures, resulting in obstruction and cholestasis. These structures do not communicate with the biliary lumen, and are external to the duct walls. Although these cysts are usually benign, and typically found in patients with liver cirrhosis, they can occasionally cause biliary obstruction or cholangitis. The clinical importance of these structures arises from the fact that they may mimic other diseases (eg, cholangiocarcinoma, choledochal cyst), or may represent a harbinger of an important underlying illness (eg, portal hypertension), which may lead the clinician to unneeded investigations. Our aim was to systematically review the characteristics of these anatomical variants, and propose a clinical classification based on their location.

Peribiliary cyst

Aetiopathogenesis

Peribiliary cysts, which are small serous cysts caused by obstructed extramural hilum peribiliary glands, must not be confused with biliary dilatations. The aetiopathogenesis of these cysts and their exact prevalence are unknown. They are mostly found in cirrhotic liver (50% in autopsy studies), in ADPKD or ADPLD and can be solitary (10%). They can sometimes cause compression and cholangitis. A classification of the cysts has been proposed according to their location: type I including intrahepatic biliary tract, type II extrahepatic biliary tract and type III intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tract (25).

Imaging

Peribiliary cysts are characterised by multiple, usually small (from 1 to 55 mm), simple cystic lesions, appearing as a "string of pearls" around the hilar portal veins (Fig. 16). They are predominantly located in the left lobe due to the preponderance of the peribiliary gland. While they do not communicate with the biliary tract, they can communicate with one another, thereby mimicking biliary dilatations. MRCP is helpful to differentiate them from biliary dilatations (Fig. 16) and hepatobiliary MRI contrast agent can be used to prove the absence of biliary communication. On rare occasions, peribiliary cysts can be confused with dilated lymphatic vessels.

### Dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct associated with congenital anomalous junction of the cystic duct – a new disease entity [^115rfEmE]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

We describe 3 children with dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct, who had anomalous junctions of the cystic duct, 2 high and 1 low, without pancreaticobiliary maljunction. They were all male, and underwent excision of the gallbladder and the extrahepatic bile duct followed by a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy as a definitive surgery. Postoperatively, the dilated intrahepatic bile duct became normal in size. From these 3 cases, we propose a new disease entity-dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct because of congenital anomalous junction of the cystic duct.

### Complications of percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage in patients with dilated and nondilated intrahepatic bile ducts [^117EZBxd]. European Journal of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) have been described as an effective technique to obtain biliary access. Between January 1996 and December 2006, a total of 419 consecutive patients with endoscopically inaccessible bile ducts underwent PTBD. The current retrospective study evaluated success and complication rates of this invasive technique. PTBD was successful in 410/419 patients (97%). The success rate was equal in patients with dilated and nondilated bile ducts (p = 0.820). In 39/419 patients (9%) procedure related complications could be observed. Major complications occurred in 17/419 patients (4%). Patients with nondilated intrahepatic bile ducts had significantly higher complication rates compared to patients with dilated intrahepatic bile ducts (14.5% vs. 6.9%, respectively [p = 0.022]). Procedure related deaths were observed in 3 patients (0.7%). In conclusion, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage is an effective procedure in patients with dilated and nondilated intrahepatic bile ducts. However, patients with nondilated intrahepatic bile ducts showed a higher risk for procedure related complications.

### Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage and gastrointestinal anastomoses: the journey from promising innovations to standard of care [^111Y2726]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Intrahepatic access

EUS-guided intrahepatic access may be considered in cases of biliary obstruction where: 1) the left hepatic ducts are dilated and retrograde drainage has failed; or 2) the extrahepatic biliary tree is not accessible (e.g. surgically altered anatomy or limited bile duct dilation preventing LAMS placement), as an alternative to PTBD. Dilation of the intrahepatic ducts is a prerequisite to performing these procedures, whereas refractory ascites and cancer infiltration of the gastric wall are contraindications for this approach.

Under EUS guidance, from the stomach, a dilated intrahepatic left biliary duct (segment II or III) is selected. The target duct should be better dilated ≥ 5 mm and ideally accessed through a hepatic parenchyma cushion of around 1.5–3 cm to reduce the risk of bile leak during the procedure — of course, without compromising vascular integrity.

### Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for the treatment of common bile duct dilatation with choledocholithiasis in children: a single-center retrospective cohort study of 58 cases [^116ZKjEo]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

CBD is a common biliary system disorder in pediatric surgery, with definitive diagnosis requiring imaging studies or direct anatomical (surgical) examination. Bile duct diameter measurement in imaging should be obtained using non-pressure imaging techniques, such as ultrasound, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or CT. In 2016, the Japanese Association of Pancreaticobiliary Maljunction introduced the first age-adjusted ultrasonographic criteria for bile duct diameter in pediatric patients. This emphasizes that the diagnosis of common bile duct dilatation should be based on the upper limit of bile duct diameter relative to the patient's age (in months), while strictly excluding secondary common bile duct dilatation. In pediatric patients, distinguishing congenital common bile duct dilatation from secondary causes, such as biliary atresia, infectious hepatitis, choledocholithiasis, and pancreatitis, is essential. Patients presenting with FFCC exhibit a clinical syndrome — including abdominal pain, recurrent pyrexia, pancreatitis, and cholestatic jaundice — that mirrors the manifestations of a classical biliary cyst. However, FFCC is distinguished by the absence of the characteristic cystic dilation within the biliary tree. Instead, the common bile duct demonstrates only minimal segmental dilation, described as spindle-like or fusiform in configuration.

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^117PLg2M]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Recurrent CBD stones — risk factors for recurrent stones include multiple common bile duct stones, biliary dilatation > 13 mm, prior open cholecystectomy, prior gallstone lithotripsy, hepatolithiasis or factors leading to biliary stasis such as periampullary diverticula, papillary stenosis, biliary stricture or tumor and angulation of the common bile duct; treatment typically includes repeat endoscopic intervention (i.e. ERCP) but may also be treated surgically in patients who are at high risk of recurrence, with the three main surgical options for re-establishing biliary drainage including choledochoduodenostomy, hepaticojejunostomy or transduodenal sphincteroplasty, which should be further pursued with involvement of a hepatopancreatobiliary surgeon.

### Current treatment strategies for postoperative intrahepatic bile duct stones in congenital biliary dilatation: a single center retrospective study [^117QidJE]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

UDCA is currently employed for oral litholysis of small cholesterol gallstones. The proportion of this bile acid is increased in the bile acid pool, inducing decreased hepatic secretion of biliary cholesterol and the formation of unsaturated bile, the key factor that promotes the dissolution of cholesterol crystals. UDCA is reported to have a role in reducing the size of gallstones in pediatric patients. In this study, small stones disappeared in 2 patients with hepatolithiasis who received oral UDCA. As long as the patients are asymptomatic, it is important to prescribe UDCA and do active surveillance using ultrasonography or MRCP. If IHBD stones become symptomatic or cause biliary obstruction, the intervention including DB-ERC, PTCD would be considered.

### British society of gastroenterology and UK-PSC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^113NGuJs]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Balloon dilatation in preference to stenting has been advised in European and American guidelines on the management of patients with PSC. Some strictures do not open satisfactorily with balloon dilatation alone and stent insertion is usually recommended in these cases. A meta-analysis in other benign causes of biliary stricture and/or obstruction, shows that insertion of multiple plastic stents offers higher rates of relief of cholestasis (94% vs 60%) and lower complication (mostly cholangitis) rates (20% vs 36%) than single stent insertion. In a multicentre randomised trial of patients with PSC and a dominant stricture (n = 65), short-term stents were not superior to balloon dilatation and were associated with significantly higher complications of pancreatitis and cholangitis in the stent group (45%) than in the balloon dilatation group (7%)

Fully covered self-expandable metal stents are now well established in the management of benign biliary strictures of different aetiologies. Case series including small numbers of patients with PSC also suggest a role for these stents in dominant strictures below the liver hilum due to PSC.

Some strictures are not amenable to, or do not require, endoscopic intervention. In these patients, careful consideration should be made about a conservative, radiological or surgical (including liver transplantation) approach to treatment before ERCP is performed. If ERCP is performed in the presence of dominant stricture, it is important that consideration is made of possible CCA and that appropriate sampling is undertaken if there is any clinical suspicion of malignancy.

Recommendation 11: We recommend that non-invasive investigations such as MRCP, dynamic liver MRI and/or contrast CT should be performed in patients who have new or changing symptoms or evolving abnormalities in laboratory investigations (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: MODERATE).

Recommendation 12: We recommend that patients with PSC should ordinarily not undergo ERCP until there has been expert multidisciplinary assessment to justify endoscopic intervention (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: MODERATE).

Recommendation 13: We recommend that in patients undergoing ERCP for dominant strictures, pathological sampling of suspicious strictures is mandatory (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: STRONG).

Recommendation 14: We recommend that in patients undergoing ERCP for dominant strictures, biliary dilatation is preferred to the insertion of biliary stents (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: MODERATE).

### Dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts associated with benign liver lesions: an unusual finding [^113Sz6hY]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

In three patients presenting different types of liver lesions, including isolated cyst, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), and hemangioma, intrahepatic bile duct dilatation was observed on US and CT. Final diagnosis was obtained by surgery in two cases (cyst and FNH) and by 1-year follow-up in one patient presenting an isolated hemangioma. The only common characteristic in our three cases was that lesions were present in segment four according to Couinaud's classification, at the level of the transverse fissure, suggesting that a space-occupying lesion at this site may cause compression of the common hepatic duct and right or left intrahepatic bile ducts. Our report indicates that compression may occur even with lesion of moderate size (35–40 mm in diameter). A benign liver lesion may cause a bile duct dilatation, particularly if located in segment 4, close to the hilum. Awareness of this possibility is important to avoid unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures, particularly when all imaging criteria are consistent with a benign lesion.

### Large-duct cholangiopathies: aetiology, diagnosis and treatment [^112ynRn1]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cholangiopathies describe a group of conditions affecting the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. Impairment to bile flow and chronic cholestasis cause biliary inflammation, which leads to more permanent damage such as destruction of the small bile ducts (ductopaenia) and biliary cirrhosis. Most cholangiopathies are progressive and cause end-stage liver disease unless the physical obstruction to biliary flow can be reversed. This review considers large-duct cholangiopathies, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, ischaemic cholangiopathy, portal biliopathy, recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and Caroli disease.

### Effect of scheduled endoscopic dilatation of dominant strictures on outcome in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis [^115PfGma]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver and biliary tract disease with a variable natural history. Clinical symptoms and complications of the disease result from fibrosis and strictures involving extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts.PSC may have a progressive course, leading to recurrent biliary tract obstruction, recurrent episodes of cholangitis and, ultimately, end-stage liver disease. Biliary obstruction may develop at all levels of the biliary tree, but endoscopic therapy is possible only for large bile ducts and is recommended for strictures described as dominant strictures (DS). At cholangiography, DS are defined as stenoses measuring < 1.5 mm in the common bile duct or < 1.0 mm in the hepatic ducts.DS are detected at the initial clinical presentation of PSC in up to one-half of patients and frequently will develop over the course of the disease. Reported benefits following endoscopic treatment of DS include short-term improvement of symptoms and liver biochemical test results, as well as a longer transplantation-free survival than that predicted using the Mayo clinical risk model. Thus, in different guidelines, endoscopic treatment is recommended for suspected DS in patients with PSC who present with symptoms likely to improve following endoscopic treatment.

The impact on actual long-term survival, rather than predicted survival, of scheduled endoscopic treatment independent of symptoms, up to resolution of DS at cholangiography, has not been evaluated thus far. In the present trial, we compared clinical outcome and long-term survival of patients with PSC adhering to a scheduled endoscopic surveillance and treatment programme versus patients with PSC receiving endoscopic diagnosis and therapy on clinical demand only.

### A novel approach to the management of late-onset liver failure in biliary atresia [^1111wEPN]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Late-onset hyperbilirubinemia in patients who have undergone a successful portoenterostomy (PE) for biliary atresia (BA) is usually considered evidence of ongoing severe liver failure. The authors recently have treated 2 patients who had acute hyperbilirubinemia years and months after a successful PE and had dilated intrahepatic cysts. A combined operative and percutaneous approach reestablished drainage and a reduction in their bilirubin levels.

Methods

Data from 2 cases of BA and late-onset hyperbilirubinemia from obstruction were reviewed and analyzed.

Results

Two patients (15-year-old boy and a 2.5-year-old girl) presented with increasing serum bilirubin after a PE for BA in infancy. Both had extensive preoperative workup, which showed intrahepatic biliary dilatation in one and a large bile lake in the other. They underwent attempted percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and stenting, followed by an intraoperative transhepatic approach in which the dilated ducts were connected to the PE. A rapid and sustained reduction in the serum bilirubin level was noted in these patients.

Conclusions

When patients with BA after a successful PE present with sudden onset of hyperbilirubinemia, imaging for biliary obstruction should be carried out. If biliary dilatation is found, then a combined radiologic and operative approach may help improve the bile flow and delay the need for liver transplant.

Obstructive jaundice

Biliary rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a rare primary malignancy, but the most likely primary tumour to cause biliary tract obstruction, and can be accompanied by abdominal distension and hepatomegaly. Occasionally, it may be misinterpreted as a hepatic mass such as a hepatoblastoma, which can also present with jaundice or as an undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma due to the shared histopathological similarities (although embryonal sarcomas rarely cause biliary obstruction). Lymphadenopathy at the porta hepatis or a pancreatic head mass due to pancreatoblastoma may be large but, again, seldom cause biliary dilatation (Figs. 15 and 16).

Fig. 15
A 5-year-old boy presenting with jaundice from biliary rhabdomyosarcoma. a Longitudinal and (b, c) transverse ultrasound images of the liver at diagnosis, demonstrates a heterogenous mass (white arrows) occupying and distending the common bile duct with downstream intrahepatic biliary dilatation (red arrow). d, e Axial T2-weighted MRI images through the liver confirm the intra-biliary mass (white arrows), with dilatation of right-sided intrahepatic bile ducts (red arrow). f The intrahepatic biliary dilatation is best demonstrated on the 3D-maximum intensity projection (MIP) image of the MRCP (MR cholangiopancreatography)

Fig. 16

In this clinical scenario, compared to the images of Fig. 15, the intra-ductal mass is harder to visualise on ultrasound without careful assessment of the common bile duct to its origin, highlighting the importance of careful assessment and patience to ensure all pertinent findings are identified

Periportal edema

Periportal edema is not unique to PBC and can be seen in all processes involving ductal hyperplasia, lymphatic dilatation, and inflammatory cell infiltration. This sign has been depicted on MRI in previous studies, mainly presenting as periportal hyperintensity on T2WI (Fig. 3 a), but in fact, it can also be seen on CT, where it presents as periportal low density (Fig. 3 b). A previous study reported that periportal hyperintensity on T2WI was most common in the early stages of PBC, with a prevalence of 80–100%. As the disease progresses, this sign is less likely to be seen, which is probably because the inflammatory process is gradually replaced by the accumulation of fibrous tissue. However, a recent study demonstrated no significant correlation between periportal hyperintensity on T2WI and fibrosis stage. In addition, Kovač et al. found that approximately 66.7% of patients with PBC with stage IV fibrosis still presented periportal hyperintensity on T2WI, which may indicate that periportal inflammation persists throughout the disease.

Fig. 3
Periportal edema of PBC. a T2WI image of a 54-year-old female with PBC shows periportal hyperintensity (arrows). b Contrast-enhanced CT of a 53-year-old female with PBC shows periportal low density (arrows)

Irregular configuration of the biliary ducts

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) may be normal in most patients with PBC, especially in the early stages of the disease when fibrosis in the portal triads has not developed. As the disease progresses to cirrhosis, irregularity and pruning will occur in the intrahepatic bile ducts. Typical bile duct manifestations of PSC, such as beaded dilatation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree, are not seen in PBC. Instead, PBC often presents with segmental small bile duct dilatation, stenosis or poor visualization, mostly with involvement of the intrahepatic secondary bile ducts (Fig. 4).

### Current treatment strategies for postoperative intrahepatic bile duct stones in congenital biliary dilatation: a single center retrospective study [^1142yHhg]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

IHBD stones are the most common late complications after radical surgery for CBD, with an incidence rate of 2.7–11%. It is hypothesized that postoperative bile stasis and infection of the biliary tract cause the formation of IHBD stones. The main causes of these conditions are anastomotic stricture, intrahepatic bile duct stricture, and residual intrahepatic ductal dilatation. Therefore, the formation of hepatic stones after definitive surgery is more common in type IVa, as this study presented. Primary stricture of the hepatic ducts near hilum and intrahepatic ducts is occasionally seen in patients with CBD, and whenever possible these ducts should be widened by duct plasty at the time of the primary surgery. In this study, 3 type Ia cases without apparent stenosis showed postoperative IHBD stones, and we speculated that the suture remnant might become the core of such stones. Postoperative stenosis and repeated cholangitis of the intrahepatic bile duct lead to bile stasis and IHBD stones, and may be associated with a high risk of carcinogenesis. The incidence of biliary carcinoma among patients who undergo radical surgery is reported to be approximately 0.7–5.4%, which is higher than that in the general population. Therefore, symptomatic IHBD stones, which may promote these conditions should be considered for treatment.

### Primary sclerosing cholangitis: summary of a workshop [^1141XEvn]. Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare but important liver disease that leads to cirrhosis and need for liver transplantation in a high proportion of cases. The disease occurs in approximately 1 per 100,000 population per year, usually presents in adulthood, and affects men more often than women. Typical serum biochemical results, autoantibodies and liver biopsy are suggestive but not diagnostic of PSC, the diagnosis requiring cholangiographic demonstration of stricturing and dilatation of the intra- and/or extra-hepatic bile ducts. The natural history of PSC is variable, the average survival being 12 to 17 years. The cause of PSC is still unknown. Although considered an autoimmune disease, PSC has several atypical features and a strong genetic component. The therapy of PSC is unsatisfactory. Standard doses of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) lead to improvements in biochemical abnormalities but not in histology, cholangiographic appearance or survival. Several innovative therapies have been tried in PSC, but with scant evidence of benefit. For patients with high grade strictures, endoscopic dilatation is beneficial. Liver transplantation is successful for end-stage liver disease due to PSC and improves survival. PSC may recur after transplantation but is rarely progressive. The most dreaded complication of PSC is cholangiocarcinoma. Diagnosis of this highly malignant tumor is difficult, and there are no biomarkers for its early detection. Liver transplantation for cholangiocarcinoma has an exceedingly poor outcome, although transplantation with neoadjuvant chemoirradiation holds promise in selected patients. Thus, significant opportunities remain for basic and clinical research into the cause, natural history, and therapy of PSC.

Caroli syndrome and disease

These are both extremely rare congenital ductal plate development abnormalities (prevalence of less than one in 1,000,000 inhabitants). Caroli disease (CD) occurs less frequently than Caroli syndrome (CS). CS must be differentiated from CD. Their pathophysiology is different. CD results from the abnormal development of large bile ducts, whereas CS affects both the central and smaller peripheral bile ducts. CS combines cystic biliary dilatation (congenital intrahepatic ductal dilatation) and the features of congenital hepatic fibrosis, whereas CD is characterised solely by biliary dilatation. The origin of CD is unclear: it is thought to be usually nonhereditary, and it is rarely transmitted in an autosomal dominant mode. CS is transmitted in an autosomal recessive mode. While CD is assumed to result from a partial or complete interruption at an early phase of ductal plate remodelling, in CS, the abnormalities occur both at an early and at a late phase and involve peripheral bile ducts. Follow-up is mandatory for CS and CD due to the increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. In addition, the cysts and biliary tract can contain stones, resulting from the stagnation of bile.

Caroli disease

Aetiopathogenis

The lack of periportal biliary epithelium regression during embryogenesis creates the aneurysmal dilatation of the large intra-hepatic bile ducts. The liver parenchyma is normal. Frequent symptoms include abdominal pain, jaundice, and/or cholangitis.

Imaging

The biliary tract is abnormal and there are focal dilated bile ducts, without stenosis (Fig. 10). The cystic dilatations are connected to the biliary tract and have thin walls with a "central dot sign", corresponding to a residual portal vein and arterial branch. The Doppler or contrast-enhanced CT/MRI images confirm its vascular origin.

Fig. 10
Caroli disease in a 24-year-old male. a Axial magnetic resonance imaging in T2 and (b) in T1 on portal venous phase show both fusiform (arrows) and connected round (arrowheads) dilatations, better depicted on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography images (c). There is no associated sign of fibrosis

MRCP is the modality of choice for assessing these lesions. Cystic hepatic lesions communicate with the biliary tract (Fig. 10). The use of hepatobiliary MRI contrast agents can be useful to confirm the communication between the biliary tracts and cysts. There is no liver atrophy (Fig. 10).

intrahepatic bile ductListen to pronunciationA bile duct that passes through and drains bile from the liver. Enlarge this image in new windowAnatomy of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Intrahepatic bile ducts are a network of small tubes that carry bile inside the liver. The smallest ducts, called ductules, come together to form the right and left hepatic ducts, which lead out of the liver. The two ducts join outside the liver and form the common hepatic duct. The cystic duct from the gallbladder joins the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct. The common bile duct passes through the pancreas and ends in the small intestine. Bile is made by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. When food is being digested, bile is released from the gallbladder and passes through the common bile duct, pancreas, and ampulla of Vater into the small intestine.

### Hepatobiliary anomalies associated with ABCB4 / MDR3 deficiency in adults: a pictorial essay [^113WxKJ8]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Bile duct dilatations

When bile duct dilatations are present, they appear as mild to moderate. Rarely, patients may present with more severe dilatations (< 10%). Such severe bile duct dilatation may only involve one or two liver segments or may be diffuse (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7). In such cases, and as opposed to ductal plate malformations (Caroli disease, congenital hepatic fibrosis, congenital cystic anomalies of the common bile duct, etc.), which are directly related to abnormal embryological development of the bile ducts, abnormalities are related to a biliogenesis disorder developed on initially normal ducts. Anomalies are a consequence of the chronic alteration of the bile composition, which results in damage to the biliary epithelium. Bile duct abnormalities are demonstrated as unifocal or multifocal non-cystic large spindle-shaped bile duct dilatations (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7). However, ductal plate malformations, particularly the Caroli disease, have to be ruled out by the absence of specific features, such as the "central dot sign", dilated bile ducts associated with focal area of cystic ectasia, or the fact that no biliary dilatation can be found in LPAC syndrome without underlying biliary stones. Other possible differential diagnosis is bile duct dilatations related to focal obstacle on the biliary ducts. Traditionally, downstream-acquired stenosis (iatrogenic, biliodigestive anastomosis, sclerosing cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma) may lead to obstructive dilatations that appear more central without intrahepatic lithiasis.

Fig. 7
Left: a stone is seen after the choledochoscope passed through the stenotic segment. Right: intracholedochal stricture was seen with the choledochoscope (the white arrow points to the stone and the red arrow points to the biliary stricture)

The basic principles for treating BD involve resection of the dilated bile duct(s), relief of secondary symptoms, and restoration of bile flow. Thus, in this research, patients with HUAXI type I, II and III CBD underwent complete resection of the dilated extrahepatic bile duct and a high Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with the anastomosis made as large as possible to reduce the incidence of postoperative stenosis. Types II, III, and IV, because they involve hilar or intrahepatic bile duct dilatation, should be resected or shaped for stenoses that can be explored in the portal region, while for intrahepatic intrahepatic stenosis, close long-term postoperative follow-up is needed to pay attention to cholelithiasis and possible development of cholangiocarcinoma. Type III and IV intrahepatic dilatation may be confined to a single LL, but more often the dilatations are widely distributed throughout the liver. For children with lesions mainly confined to a single lobe, complicated by recurrent intrahepatic stones and cholangitis, hemihepatectomy can be considered. In cases where the lesion involves the whole liver, especially in Caroli's disease, which is often associated with genetic abnormalities and rapid progression of liver fibrosis, there is no curative surgical option and liver transplantation is usually considered.

### The role of endoscopy in the evaluation and treatment of patients with biliary neoplasia [^112eF9ng]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2013). Medium credibility.

Cholangiocarcinoma — Radiologic imaging: "TUS, CT, or MRC may demonstrate biliary dilation with or without a stricture or mass". MRC technique is described as "heavily T2-weighted image sequences that display fluid as high signal intensity to define the level of a biliary stricture and identify features suggestive of malignancy, such as a stricture length of more than 10 mm, irregular margins, and shouldering". Reported performance is "a sensitivity of 77% to 86% and a specificity of 63% to 98% for the diagnosis of malignant biliary obstruction caused by cholangiocarcinoma". The text also states, "The differentiation of hilar versus nonhilar tumors is important… " and "The Bismuth classification of cholangiocarcinoma is useful for determining surgical resectability and type of surgery".

### The role of surgery in caroli's disease [^1162KdQ3]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Caroli's disease is a rare congenital disorder characterized by multifocal segmental dilation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Whether conservative or surgical strategies should be preferred is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of surgery in the management of Caroli's disease.

Study Design

From April 1998 until August 2005, 12 consecutive patients with Caroli's disease were treated in the Department of General, Visceral, and Transplantation Surgery, University Hospital Essen, Germany. All patients were intended to receive liver resections or liver transplantations.

Results

There were seven men and five women, with a median age of 39 years (range 7 months to 70 years). Eight patients had monolobar and four patients had bilobar liver involvement. All patients had a history of recurrent cholangitis, with up to 16 unsuccessful conservative treatment attempts. Nine patients (75%) underwent liver resection and two (17%) had liver transplantation. Intraoperatively, three patients (25%) were found to have cholangiocarcinoma, of which one was unresectable. There was no mortality and only low morbidity (16%) postoperatively. After a median followup of 31 months, 11 patients are well with no recurrent symptoms.

Conclusions

Surgery can offer a definite therapy, with an acceptable morbidity and virtually no mortality in localized Caroli's disease. In diffuse disease, the use of extended resections or liver transplantation can provide good longterm results.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^1166Em8T]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Choledochal cysts — imaging evaluation is best performed with MRI with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography; MRCP may offer the advantage of detecting an APBJ and does not contaminate the biliary tree with instrumentation, and Type V cysts (Caroli disease) involve only the intrahepatic bile ducts and are the least common type. One key feature distinguishing biliary ductal dilatation as a choledochal cyst from malignancy causing obstruction is that malignancy usually results in diffuse intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation as opposed to more focal areas of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.

### A new clinical classification of congenital biliary dilatation-HUAXI CBD classification [^116CZnog]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

Patients

This retrospective study evaluated patients with CBD admitted to the Department of Pediatric Surgery (West China Hospital of Sichuan University) between January 2015 and December 2018. The inclusion criteria were age of 0–18 years, a definite diagnosis of CBD, and complete imaging data available. The exclusion criteria were communication disorders, and loss to follow-up. The study's retrospective protocol was approved by the ethics committees of West China Hospital of Sichuan University, which waived the requirement for informed consent.

CBD HUAXI classification

Patients' imaging data, perioperative information, and long-term outcomes were collected retrospectively. Preoperative preliminary classification had been performed using findings from abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and MRCP, while the final type had been determined using findings from intraoperative cholangiography. CBD was classified into 4 types based on the location of lesions in the biliary tree as revealed by the imaging data (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
HUAXI CBD classification system: Type I dilatation involved only extrahepatic bile duct dilatation; type II dilatation involved extrahepatic and the right or left primary hepatic bile dilatation; type III dilatation involved extrahepatic combined with secondary and higher hepatic ducts dilatation; type IV dilatation involved only intrahepatic bile duct dilatation

Type I (Fig. 2), only the extrahepatic bile duct dilatation, which included the common bile and common hepatic ducts, with normal or secondary intrahepatic dilatation (marked reduction or disappearance of the intrahepatic dilatation after extrahepatic choledochotomy). These lesions could be localized or diffuse, solitary or multiple, and cystic dilatation or diverticula, which correspond to Todani types I, II, III, and IVb.

### Type IV choledochal cyst with polycystic kidney disease: a case report [^114snoNk]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Choledochal cysts are cystic dilations that may occur in any part of the bile duct between the liver and the duodenum. Alonso-lej first classified choledochal cysts in 1959, and Todani expanded the classification system in 1977 by dividing choledochal cysts into 5 types. Type I cysts are subclassified into 3 types. Type IA cysts are marked cystic dilations of the entire extrahepatic biliary tree that do not involve the intrahepatic ducts. Type IB cysts are focal, segmental dilations of the extrahepatic bile duct. Type IC cysts are smooth fusiform dilations of the entire extrahepatic bile duct. Type II cysts are discrete diverticula of the extrahepatic duct with narrow stalk connections to the common bile duct. Type III cysts are choledochoceles that are located in the duodenal wall. Type IVA cysts are multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic dilations. Intrahepatic duct dilation can be cystic, fusiform, or irregular. Type IVB cysts are multiple dilatations that are confined only to the extrahepatic bile duct. Type V cysts, which are also called Caroli disease, show single or multiple dilatations of the intrahepatic bile duct.

The aetiology of choledochal cysts is complex. At present, there are several assumed causes, including genetic factors, abnormal pancreaticobiliary confluence (pancreaticobiliary maljunction, PBM), gastrointestinal neuroendocrine factors, and abnormal proliferation of the bile duct epithelium. Caroli disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disease that is caused by a mutation in the PKHD1 gene located on chromosome 6p12; usually, it is considered to be associated with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). The role of congenital factors in the pathogenesis of choledochal cysts aside from those associated with Caroli disease is not yet clear.

### Surgical management of congenital intrahepatic bile duct dilatation, caroli's disease and syndrome: long-term results of the French association of surgery multicenter study [^117D3QGC]. Annals of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess clinical presentation and long-term results of surgical management of congenital intrahepatic bile duct dilatation (IHBDD) (Caroli disease and syndrome) in a multicenter setting.

Background

Congenital IHBDD predisposes to biliary stasis, resulting in intrahepatic lithiasis, septic complications, and cholangiocarcinoma. Although liver resection (LR) is considered to be the treatment of choice for unilobar disease extent into the liver, the management of bilobar disease and/or associated congenital hepatic fibrosis remains challenging.

Methods

From 1978 to 2011, a total of 155 patients (median age: 55.7 years) were enrolled from 26 centers. Bilobar disease, Caroli syndrome, liver atrophy, and intrahepatic stones were encountered in 31.0%, 19.4%, 27.7%, and 48.4% of patients, respectively. A complete resection of congenital intrahepatic bile ducts was achieved in 90.5% of the 148 patients who underwent surgery.

Results

Postoperative mortality was nil after anatomical LR (n = 111) and 10.7% after liver transplantation (LT) (n = 28). Grade 3 or higher postoperative morbidity occurred in 15.3% of patients after LR and 39.3% after LT. After a median follow-up of 35 months, the 5-year overall survival rate was 88.5% (88.7% after LT), and the Mayo Clinic score was considered as excellent or good in 86.0% of patients. The 1-year survival rate was 33.3% for the 8 patients (5.2%) who presented with coexistent cholangiocarcinoma.

Conclusions

LR for unilobar and LT for diffuse bilobar congenital IHBDD complicated with cholangitis and/or portal hypertension achieved excellent long-term patient outcomes and survival. Because of the bad prognosis of cholangiocarcinoma and the sizeable morbidity-mortality after LT, timely indication for surgical treatment is of major importance.

### Effectiveness, safety, and factors associated with the clinical success of endoscopic biliary drainage for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: a retrospective multicenter study [^115DZaQ7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

This retrospective study was based on the clinical databases of the Okayama University Hospital and 10 affiliated hospitals. Data were extracted from the patients who underwent endoscopic stent placement for obstructive jaundice caused by HCC from April 2013 to October 2018. Biliary strictures considered to be associated with therapy for HCC, such as PTA, trans-arterial embolization, and radiation therapy, were omitted. Informed consent was obtained via an opt-out option on the website. The Institutional Review Board of Okayama University approved this study.

Reference for endoscopic treatment

The indication for endoscopic stent placement was aggravation of jaundice or liver dysfunction with intrahepatic bile duct (IHBD) dilation. Some patients had cholangitis in addition to jaundice or liver dysfunction. Jaundice was defined as a serum total bilirubin concentration over 3 mg/dl, and liver dysfunction was defined as hepatobiliary enzyme elevation compared to the baseline of each patient. IHBD dilatation was defined when an axial scan by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound sonography showed the lumen of the intrahepatic bile duct to be more than 2 mm in diameter.

In accordance with Tokyo Guidelines 2018, cholangitis was defined as the presence of leukocytosis, elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP), or a fever (temperature ≥ 38 °C), in addition to the findings indicating cholestasis and/or the IHBD dilatation previously mentioned.

### Diffuse caroli's disease with atypical presentation: a case report [^113mRRdE]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

This paper describes a case of Caroli's disease in a female patient aged 32, who complained of nonspecific abdominal pain without cholesthasis or cholangitis. Liver resonance shows segment saccular dilations closely connected to intrahepatic biliary ducts, that differ from the Caroli's syndrome, which is more common and consists of multiple intrahepatic cystic dilatations, associated to congenital hepatic fibrosis. This patient has a congenital anomaly with an uncommon oligosymptomatic form of Caroli's disease that should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with recurrent abdominal pain.

### Caroli's disease: description of a case with a benign clinical course [^113Nq3Fh]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

The characteristic findings of the disease are the dilated sacculi or cystic spaces, visible by U/S or CT of the abdomen, only in some patients, particularly in the early stages. The findings include saccular or tubular dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts, intraluminal bulbar protrusions, bridge formation across dilated bile ducts resembling internal septa, within the dilated bile ducts and portal radicles partially or completely surrounded by dilated bile ducts. These portal radicles - if seen in axial projection - appear as tiny, hyperechogenic structures centrally in the dilated bile duct and have been named; the "central dot" signs. Higher density small structures within the dilated ducts represent non-calcified or calcified stones.

In the boy described above, U/S depicted two small cystic formations in the liver, initially thought to represent simple liver cysts. Simple liver cysts commonly seen on U/S seldom cause symptoms, but, occasionally, if they are large may cause pain and some require surgical drainage.

Polycystic liver disease could be a possible diagnosis, but in this condition although large cysts developed from the biliary tree, they did not obstruct the ducts. The clinical picture is also different as cysts may cause pain, but do not affect liver function and in most patients, the kidneys are similarly affected with cysts, which may cause high blood pressure and kidney failure. The tendency to form cysts is probably present at birth, but usually they do not enlarge and cause problems until adulthood. Our patient had normal blood pressure and his kidneys were normal in shape and size, with normal function.

Von Meyenburg complex could be another possible diagnosis, which is a rare condition characterized by multiple small hepatic cysts within the parenchyma at a distance from the peribiliary portal regions and with no communication with the bile ducts. In our patient the cystic formations were in communication with the biliary tree.

### Benign biliary strictures: a current comprehensive clinical and imaging review [^112aGGw1]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

There is a wide spectrum of nonneoplastic causes of biliary stricture that can pose a significant challenge to clinicians and radiologists. Imaging plays a key role in differentiating benign from malignant strictures, defining the extent, and directing the biopsy. We describe the salient clinical and imaging manifestations of benign biliary strictures that will help radiologists to accurately diagnose these entities.

Conclusion

Accurate diagnosis and management are based on correlating imaging findings with epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data. Cross-sectional imaging modalities permit precise localization of the site and length of the segment involved, thereby serving as a road map to surgery, and permit exclusion of underlying malignancy.

### Role of endoscopic ultrasound in evaluation of unexplained common bile duct dilatation on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography [^116w7xoN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Dilatation of CBD can result from diverse causes: choledochocholithiasis, CBD stricture, cholangiocarcinoma, periampullary diverticulum, pancreatic head mass, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and papillary stenosis, etc. A dilated CBD can indicate underlying biliary pathology; it may however also occur in patients with advanced age or post-cholecystectomy status in the absence of any pathology. Therefore it is important to evaluate further the patients with CBD dilatation to rule out any sinister underlying etiology. MRCP is an excellent non-invasive modality for diagnosis of various pathologies causing CBD dilatation with its diagnostic results being comparable to ERCP. Therefore, once MRCP demonstrates only a mildly dilated CBD, the treating physician is faced with a dilemma of investigating further with an ERCP or stopping all investigations presuming the dilatation to be normal variant. EUS is an excellent modality to image the CBD because of close proximity of the transducer placed in the duodenum to the CBD. The sensitivity of EUS for detection of CBD stones has been demonstrated to be equivalent to ERCP and has also been shown to be an excellent modality for evaluation of pancreaticobiliary disorders.

### HIV-related / AIDS cholangiopathy: pictorial review with emphasis on MRCP findings and differential diagnosis [^111BpPgE]. Clinical Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography provides accurate, noninvasive diagnosis of HIV/AIDS cholangiopathy through the identification of characteristic ductal abnormalities including multiple intrahepatic strictures, papillary stenosis, and long segmental extrahepatic strictures. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should be reserved for cytological or bioptic investigation in doubtful cases and for operative treatment when appropriate. Furthermore, cross-sectional imaging allows differentiation from other causes of biliary dilatation in HIV-positive patients, including infectious (bacterial) cholangitis, portal biliopathy, pancreatic or duodenal lymphoma, and mycobacterial lymphadenopathies.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115xNaAK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic liver diseases — evaluation of elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the role of gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT) is outlined as follows: cholestatic liver diseases are associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase, with or without elevated bilirubin, and once alkaline phosphatase has been confirmed to be of hepatic origin, an ultrasound of the liver should be performed to assess the hepatic parenchyma and bile ducts. Biliary dilatation suggests an extrahepatic cause, whereas a non-dilated biliary system suggests that the cause of elevated alkaline phosphatase is intrahepatic; some disease of extrahepatic cholestasis may not be apparent by ultrasound and cholangiography by MR/MRCP or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography should be undertaken when these disorders are suspected. With isolated alkaline phosphatase elevation, confirmation with GGT, or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes can be used to help differentiate alkaline phosphatase from non-liver sources; however, GGT elevation is not specific for cholestatic liver disease and can be elevated in > 50% of alcoholic patients without obvious evidence of liver disease, so GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease in the absence of abnormal liver chemistries. In hospitalized patients with isolated alkaline phosphatase elevations, one study reported that ~80% could be given a clinical diagnosis solely based on history and physical examination, routine labs, and chest X-ray.

### A case of pregnancy complicated by caroli disease [^115ftaFM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Caroli disease (CD), an autosomal recessive disorder, is also known as congenital cystic dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts and refers to the rare congenital developmental abnormality of the biliary tract. CD can present sporadically or as Caroli syndrome caused by the mutation of polycysti kidney and hepatic disease 1 (PKHD1) gene encoding fibrocystic protein on chromosome 6p12. It may be associated clinically by congenital hepatic fibrosis and or polycystic kidney disease. The main feature of the disease is congenital cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, and clinically there are mostly no symptoms, when the congenital bile ducts structural abnormalities lead to cholestasis and recurrent cholangitis may appear fever, abdominal pain and jaundice and other symptoms. Early diagnosis and intervention of CD can increase patient survival and improve neonatal prognosis to some extent. CD is exceptionally rare, with an incidence rate of only 1/1,000,000, and has been exceedingly rarely reported in pregnant women. This article reports a case of pregnancy complicated by CD, with the aim of elevating the level of diagnosis and treatment of this disease by clinicians and providing early interventions, thus improving maternal and infant outcomes.

- Fifty-five cases of intrahepatic dilation of the bile ducts associated with choledochal cyst have been found in the literature, mostly reported over the past five years. Obstructive jaundice is often not present at an early stage in this group of patients, but dissociation of the serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels could be an early manifestation of this condition. Recent advances in diagnosis and new concepts of the cause and surgical management are reviewed.

### Factors contributing to diagnostic delay of caroli syndrome: a single-center, retrospective study [^117EtKiG]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Imaging studies remain the primary diagnostic modality in patients with CS due to their non-invasiveness compared to liver biopsy, which when performed is usually to establish the degree of fibrosis. Although a range of PKHD1 mutations are associated with CS, the diagnosis is usually made through the characteristic clinical picture, typical imaging features with or without histological confirmation, and exclusion of other hepatic diseases leading to hepatic fibrosis and bile duct dilatation. Most (87.5%) of our patients were diagnosed according to typical imaging features by US, CT, and MRI. The diagnosis of CS relies on demonstrating cystic dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts in continuity with the biliary tree as well as signs of hepatic fibrosis. US features of the liver in CS include intrahepatic cystic anechoic areas in which fibrovascular bundles, stones, and linear bridging or septa may be present. Nevertheless, it is often difficult for radiologists to differentiate by US intrahepatic cysts caused by CS from cysts arising through other causes such as polycystic liver disease, and interobserver variability according to radiologist experience in making the diagnosis of CS has been reported. In our study, the accuracy of diagnosing CS by US was only 25%, and some patients were not successfully diagnosed by US at first but were later diagnosed by another US performed in another hospital. Taking this interobserver variance into account, the actual accuracy of US for CS might be even lower.

Biliary strictures and prognostic implications in PSC — Dominant strictures are present in up to half of patients at the time of diagnosis and up to 45% of patients with PSC will develop dominant strictures; patients with the disease limited to intrahepatic ducts seem to have a better outcome, whereas high-grade strictures with prestenotic dilatation at magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRI/MRCP) are associated with poorer outcomes, a dominant stricture on ERCP or rapid progression of a stricture at MRI/MRCP increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), and even without bile duct malignancy the presence of a dominant stricture significantly reduces survival.

### A rare cause of dilated bile duct incidentally detected on imaging [^1149dojK]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Adenomas involving the extrahepatic bile ducts are rare benign tumours of the biliary tract. Given the asymptomatic nature of these tumours and the natural progression of biliary adenoma to carcinoma including cholangiocarcinoma, early detection is challenging. We present a case of an octogenarian woman with a remote history of gallstones who initially presented to the gastroenterology office for an incidental finding of biliary dilation, and whose subsequent imagings and biopsy suggested common bile adenoma. However, the patient was deemed a poor surgical candidate for pancreaticoduodenectomy, and unfortunately represented 5months later with findings suggesting cholangiocarcinoma. This case provides a unique opportunity to study the natural progression of biliary adenoma to cholangiocarcinoma.

Intrahepatic and extrahepatic choledochal cysts — epidemiology and classification — Choledochal cysts are rare cystic dilatations of the bile ducts, more frequently seen in women (1:4 male-to-female ratio) and more common in Asian populations; they present predominantly in the first decade of life (80%), although incidence seems to be rising in adults. They are classified by the Todani system based on anatomic findings and extent of biliary involvement: Type I cysts are cystic or fusiform dilatations of the extrahepatic bile duct and are the most commonly seen; Type II are extrahepatic (supraduodenal) diverticula; and Type III are intraduodenal diverticula (choledochocele) which, unlike others, lack female predominance and rarely have risk of malignant transformation. Type IV cysts have both extrahepatic and intrahepatic cystic dilations (type IVA) or multiple extrahepatic dilations (IVB).

Confirmed alkaline phosphatase elevations — primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) features chronic biliary inflammation and stricturing with malignancy risk: "Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) also represents a rare chronic liver disease which is characterized by chronic immune-mediated inflammation and fibrosis of both intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, fixed multifocal bile duct strictures, progressive liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, and an increased risk for both hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma (65)". Serologies lack a diagnostic hallmark: "Although no serologic hallmarks have been identified for PSC, IgG and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody are frequently elevated, and IgG4 may signal a specific IgG4-associated form of PSC". Imaging establishes diagnosis: "Diagnosis of PSC is established by characteristic imaging findings of thickened, inflamed bile ducts, dilatation of intrahepatic ducts, and focal strictures on MRI cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography", and tissue sampling is seldom necessary because "liver biopsy is rarely required to establish a diagnosis or to significantly alter medical management". PSC commonly coexists with colonic disease: "There is a common association with inflammatory bowel disease of the colon". When PBC and PSC are excluded, alternative causes should be sought: "Chronic cholestatic liver injury in the absence of PBC or PSC should prompt further investigation for less common etiologies such as bile duct obstructions, medications, sepsis, total parenteral nutrition, vanishing bile duct syndrome, and sarcoidosis (66)".

### Current treatment strategies for postoperative intrahepatic bile duct stones in congenital biliary dilatation: a single center retrospective study [^112Z4pgP]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Intrahepatic bile duct (IHBD) stones are one of the most common late complications of Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy for congenital biliary dilatation (CBD). We report the current treatment strategies for IHBD stones and their outcomes in our institute.

Methods

Between 1983 and 2021, 117 patients with CBD were surgically treated in our institute. Our treatment strategies included oral ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), double-balloon endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (DB-ERC), percutaneous cholangio-drainage (PTCD), and open surgery. A retrospective study was conducted using medical charts.

Results

Postoperative IHBD stones were identified in 12 of 117 patients with CBD (10.2%). Five patients received UDCA, and small stones were successfully resolved in two cases. DB-ERC was performed eight times in five patients, but the endoscope could not reach the porta hepatis due to a long jejunal loop in two of five patients. One patient presented with severe acute pancreatitis induced by prolonged DB-ERC. PTCD was performed in three patients, two of whom finally underwent open surgery due to unsuccessful lithotomy. Open surgery was eventually performed in three patients. Lithotomy was performed in one patient; lithotomy with strictureplasty was performed in another patient. The other patient was diagnosed with intrahepatic cholelithiasis with adenocarcinoma. He underwent left lobectomy and died of carcinomatous peritonitis.

Conclusions

Oral UDCA may be effective for small stones. Although DB-ERC should be considered as a first-line interventional therapy for lithotomy, it may not be feasible due to a long jejunal loop, and pancreatitis may occur. Long-term follow-up and early detection and treatment for IHBD stones may yield a good prognosis.

### Congenital intrahepatic bile duct dilatation is a potentially curable disease: long-term results of a multi-institutional study [^1114vUKB]. Annals of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To report clinical presentation, perioperative outcome, and long-term results of surgical management of congenital intrahepatic bile duct (IHBD) dilatations (including Caroli disease) in a multi-institutional setting.

Summary Background Data

Congenital IHBD dilatations are a rare congenital disorder predisposing to intrahepatic stones, cholangitis, and cholangiocarcinoma. The management remains difficult and controversial for bilobar forms of the disease or when concurrent congenital hepatic fibrosis is associated.

Methods

From 1976 to 2004, 33 patients (range 11 to 79 years) were retrospectively enrolled. Disease extent into the liver was unilobar in 26 patients and bilobar in 7 patients (21%). Cholangiocarcinoma, congenital hepatic fibrosis, and intrahepatic stones were present in 2, 10, and 20 patients, respectively. Transplantations or liver resections were performed in 5 and 27 patients, respectively, whereas 1 asymptomatic patient was managed conservatively.

Results

Postoperative mortality was nil. Postoperative complications occurred in 16 of 32 operated patients (50%) and additional procedures for residual stones were required in 5 patients. During a median follow-up of 80 months (1 patient being lost for follow-up) no patient developed metachronous carcinoma. Six patients (30%) developed recurrent intrahepatic stones but satisfactory late outcome was achieved in 27 patients (87%).

Conclusions

Partial or total liver resection achieves satisfactory late outcome in congenital IHBD dilatations, when the affection is treated at an early stage and when the extent of liver resection is tailored to intrahepatic disease extent and takes into consideration the presence and severity of underlying chronic liver and renal diseases.

### A comparison of balloon-versus stent-based approach for dominant strictures in primary sclerosing cholangitis: a meta-analysis [^111muxuq]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic, cholestatic liver disease that leads to biliary cirrhosis and portal hypertension by causing obstruction of intra- and/or extrahepatic bile ducts by inflammation and fibrosis. From 5–15% of patients with PSC have a lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), with the annual incidence being 0.6–1.5%. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is currently the modality of choice, given the invasive nature and increased risk of adverse events (AE) with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

The most common reason for endoscopic intervention in patients with PSC is dominant strictures, found in 15–20% of patients. Anatomically, dominant strictures are defined as: 1) strictures of the common bile duct measuring < 1.5 mm in diameter; or 2) strictures of the hepatic ducts with a diameter < 1.0 mm within 2 cm of the bifurcation. As the disease progresses, patients can have evidence of mechanical biliary obstruction, manifested by jaundice, pruritus, ascending cholangitis and malabsorption, but biliary strictures are asymptomatic in most cases. Approximately 25% of intrahepatic or extrahepatic duct strictures are malignant at the time of presentation. The presence of a dominant stricture has been associated with a worse long-term prognosis and an increased risk of CCA.

ERCP is the endoscopic therapeutic modality of choice for the endoscopic management of dominant strictures. The goal is to relieve the biliary obstruction and rule out malignancy, specifically CCA. This has been associated with improved transplant-free survival and a reduced risk of CCA in patients with PSC. A percutaneous approach is associated with high morbidity and mortality and is reserved for symptomatic patients who have failed an endoscopic approach. Multiple interventions can be performed for these strictures, such as balloon dilation, balloon dilatation with stent placement, nasobiliary catheter perfusion, or injection of mitomycin C. According to the recent guidelines of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, endoscopic biliary stricture dilation is the initial procedure of choice for the management of dominant strictures. Bile duct stenting is often reserved for cases where balloon dilation alone appears to be inadequate.

Endoscopic and percutaneous therapy — balloon dilation and stenting parameters in PSC strictures: The decision to (1) perform balloon dilation and (2) stenting of a stricture should be made by a multidisciplinary care team; when performed, balloon dilation of a biliary stricture should not exceed the diameter of the bile ducts immediately delimiting the stricture, and if a plastic biliary stent is placed, it should generally be removed within 4 weeks; the role of self-expanding metallic stents in PSC remains unclear, but their use may be considered in select cases.

### Caroli's disease: description of a case with a benign clinical course [^1162M8H4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Caroli's disease and Caroli's syndrome are rare congenital disorders characterized by cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary tree. Caroli's disease is sporadic, its prevalence is one case per 1,000,000 of the population and is less common than Caroli's syndrome, mainly inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, although other modes of inheritance (autosomal dominant) were also described. Loss of the distal 3p chromosome and gain of the 8q chromosome is of pathogenic importance. As with congenital hepatic fibrosis Caroli's syndrome is often associated with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) (8, 9) and less frequently with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).

The illness has usually a long-lasting course, with recurrent episodes of cholangitis, which may be complicated by intrahepatic calculi and hepatic abscess formation. There is also good evidence that Caroli's disease confers an approximately 7% risk of malignancy.

The diagnosis rests on demonstrating that the cystic liver lesions are in continuity with the biliary tree. Modern imaging techniques (initially abdominal ultrasound and then with magnetic cholangio-pancreatographic study: MRCP), facilitate diagnosis without the need of invasive imaging of the biliary tree (such as endoscopic cholangio-pancreatographic study: ERCP).

We describe this case report of a 12-year-old boy with Caroli's disease, an extremely rare condition in childhood, because of its atypical presentation and its unexpected benign course, before and after the diagnosis was made.

### Evaluation of diagnostic yield of EUS among patients with asymptomatic common bile duct dilation: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116MT3EQ]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Common bile duct (CBD) dilation is a frequent indication for EUS. Among asymptomatic individuals, biliary dilation may not be clinically significant; however, EUS is often relied on for the exclusion of benign and malignant pathology that might require further intervention. The yield of EUS evaluation for this indication is not well characterized and has significant implications for health resource utilization because asymptomatic biliary dilation is prevalent. Through this systematic review, we sought to appraise the yield of EUS evaluation of asymptomatic patients with radiologic evidence of isolated CBD dilation.

Methods

A protocolled search (PROSPERO: CRD42020193428) extracted original studies from the Cochrane Library, Ovid Embase, Google Scholar, Ovid Medline, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection that described diagnostic yield of EUS among asymptomatic patients with biliary dilation. Cumulative EUS diagnostic yield was calculated through meta-analysis of proportions using inverse variance methods and a random-effects model.

Results

Of 2616 studies, 8 delineated the EUS yield among 224 asymptomatic patients. The cumulative yield of EUS for any pathology was 11.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.6%- 21.6%). The EUS yield for benign etiologies was 9.2% (95% CI, 1.1%-21.9%), of which choledocholithiasis comprised 3.4% (95% CI, 0%-11.2%) and malignant etiologies .5% (95% CI, 0%-3.4%) of cases.

Conclusions

EUS in patients with asymptomatic CBD dilation does yield findings of choledocholithiasis and malignancy, albeit at low rates. A cost-effectiveness analysis is warranted to further guide clinical decision-making in this area.

### Current treatment strategies for postoperative intrahepatic bile duct stones in congenital biliary dilatation: a single center retrospective study [^11189p9m]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital biliary dilatation (CBD) usually has an excellent short-term prognosis after prompt surgical treatment, which typically consists of total resection of the extrahepatic bile duct and reconstruction using Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (RYH). Recently, some studies concerning long-term follow-up have been reported, and the long-term results have gradually become clearer. Intrahepatic bile duct (IHBD) stones are one of the most common late complications, especially at > 10 years after surgery for CBD. As reported in 2009, postoperative IHBD stones were identified in only 1 of 56 patients (1.7%) over 10 years of postoperative follow-up in our institute. However, the number of patients with IHBD stones has recently increased, and severe sequelae due to IHBD stones (e.g. abdominal colic, cholangitis, and cholangiocarcinoma) become a major problem during follow-up.

In this study, we reviewed the current treatment strategies for IHBD stones and the outcomes of patients with IHBD stones in our institute.

### Cutting edge issues in juvenile sclerosing cholangitis [^117CcPbV]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Sclerosing cholangitis (SC) is a rare chronic disorder characterised by inflammation and progressive obliterative fibrosis of the intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic bile ducts. Diagnosis is based on cholangiogram showing bile duct dilatation, narrowing and obliteration of the biliary tree, and histologically, on the presence of inflammatory bile duct damage leading to periductal fibrosis. In children the most common SC is associated with strong autoimmune features, overlapping with those of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH); this form is known as autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis, ASC. Conversely, primary SC (PSC), a condition in which the term "primary" indicates that aetiology and pathogenesis are unknown, is rare in paediatrics. Secondary SC (SSC) defines a cholangiopathy associated with an identifiable aetiology such as immunodeficiencies, infections or haematological disorders. ASC and PSC are strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). ASC responds biochemically well to immunosuppressive drugs and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Primary forms are exclusively managed with oral UDCA, while in the secondary forms the medical treatment depends on the underlying aetiology. Despite treatment, SC often progresses to biliary cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation. The disease can recur after transplant. Better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and better treatment modalities are needed to improve the prognosis of this invalidating hepatic disorder.

### Percutaneous transhepatic cholangioplasty to treat multiple intrahepatic biliary strictures after hepatoportoenterostomy [^111Xyt38]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

In children with biliary atresia, hepatoportoenterostomy (HP) is recommended to improve bile flow. Biliary strictures are known potential complications after HP, which can again impair bile flow often leading to biliary cirrhosis and liver transplantation. In patients who are status post HP and have biliary strictures, nonsurgical therapeutic options such as endoscopic dilation can pose technical difficulties due to altered anatomy. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography with cholangioplasty is a valuable tool for obstructive cholangiopathies, but to our knowledge this has not been previously demonstrated to be successful in patients with multiple intrahepatic biliary strictures status post HP. Herein, we present 3 patients status post HP who presented with multiple intrahepatic biliary strictures and underwent successful percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography with cholangioplasty.

Figure 2
(A) This is a representative picture of the liver biopsy, demonstrating a granulomatous nodule forming in a background of otherwise unremarkable hepatic parenchyma. The granuloma consists of an aggregate of histiocytes (cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and elongated nuclei) and giant cells (large eosinophilic cells with numerous nuclei arranged in crescent shape). This finding is characteristic, while not specific, for sarcoidosis. (H&E stain, 100× magnification). (B) The representative picture of the portal tract of the liver biopsy shows a mild ductular reaction (bile duct proliferation) and mild lymphocytic infiltration of the portal tract. There is a lack of inflammation of the bile duct, however, as the lymphocytes are not infiltrating the ductal epithelium. Moreover, the characteristic periductal fibrosis (onion-skinning) typically seen in primary sclerosing cholangitis is not observed in the entire biopsy. (H&E stain, 100× magnification).

### Percutaneous biliary stent removal for benign biliary stricture post hepaticojejunostomy [^11543Lrm]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Investigations

The follow-up MRCP 7 months later demonstrated interval worsening of intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary dilation with an abrupt transition in the calibre of the common bile duct near the hepaticojejunostomy, confirming a stricture at the hepaticojejunostomy site (figure 1). Subsequently, a right-sided percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) was performed. The cholangiogram confirmed severe stenosis of the hepaticojejunostomy (figure 2).

### Congenital and hereditary cystic diseases of the abdomen [^1175fjbV]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Type IV: This group has been subclassified into two subgroups. Type IVA is characterized by combined saccular-shaped dilations in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. Type IVB refers to saccular dilations restricted to extrahepatic bile ducts (Fig. 10).

Fig. 10

Type V: This group is also known as Caroli disease.

Choledochal cysts typically manifest before the age of 10 years. The diagnosis is typically made after the clinical emergence of complications. Among these potential complications, cholangitis and pancreatitis are the most common. Malignancy may also be seen in the course of the disease. The risk of malignancy development is not rare (around 10–15% of the cases) with the extrahepatic biliary system and gallbladder being the most common.

Post-surgical biliary strictures

In Western countries, iatrogenic strictures account for up to 80% of all benign strictures.

Post-cholecystectomy. Although the incidence of biliary injuries at laparoscopy recently decreased to figures similar to those reported with open cholecystectomy (0.08–0.3%), cholecystectomy remains a frequent cause of biliary stricture. These most often involve the CBD, the hilum, or the right hepatic duct (Figure 9). Patients typically present with jaundice or pain, sometimes associated with cholangitis. Various classifications of post-surgical biliary strictures have been proposed.MRCP can be used to identify not only the level of the stricture but may also reveal a bile leak, an obstructed segment lacking continuity with the biliary tree, or a focal liver atrophy.
Post-liver transplantation. Biliary strictures may be anastomotic or non-anastomotic. Anastomotic strictures complicate approximately 6–12% and 34% of deceased and living donor LT procedures, respectively. Non-anastomotic strictures are located > 5 mm proximal to the anastomosis and account for 10–25% of all strictures complicating LT; they may result from ischaemia (e.g. hepatic artery thrombosis or stenosis, prolonged cold or warm ischaemia) or from receiver disease (e.g. PSC). They are usually multiple and longer than anastomotic strictures (Figure 10), and may progress to the intrahepatic ducts. Endoscopy has become the first-line treatment; it is technically more difficult for non-anastomotic strictures than for anastomotic strictures, and, in the case of hepatic artery thrombosis, it is mostly ineffective if the arterial blood flow cannot be restored.

Guideline for the Use of Laparoscopic Ultrasound in Biliary Disease — The primary use of LUS in biliary disease has been as an alternative to intraoperative cholangiography to identify choledocholithiasis during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and LUS can be used routinely to identify the common bile duct, common hepatic duct, and intrahepatic bile ducts to determine dilation or bile duct stones, with cystic duct anatomy sometimes discernible.

### Biliary duct dilatation: expert panel narrative review [^11177mkT]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2024). Medium credibility.

Biliary duct dilatation is a common incidental finding in practice, but it is unlikely to indicate biliary obstruction in the absence of clinical symptoms or elevated levels on liver function tests (LFTs). However, the clinical presentation may be nonspecific, and LFTs may either be unavailable or difficult to interpret. The goal of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to highlight a series of topics fundamental to the management of biliary duct dilatation, providing consensus recommendations in a question-and-answer format. We start by covering a basic approach to interpreting LFT results, the strengths and weaknesses of the biliary imaging modalities, and how and where to measure the extrahepatic bile duct. Next, we define the criteria for biliary duct dilatation, including patients with prior cholecystectomy and advanced age, and discuss when and whether biliary duct dilatation can be attributed to papillary stenosis or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Subsequently, we discuss two conditions in which the duct is pathologically dilated but not obstructed: congenital cystic dilatation (i.e., choledochal cyst) and intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct. Finally, we provide guidance regarding when to recommend obtaining additional imaging or testing, such as endoscopic ultrasound or ERCP, and include a discussion of future directions in biliary imaging.
