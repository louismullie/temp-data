## Question

Treatment for simple jaw fracture

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step management plan for a simple, non-condylar mandibular fracture. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definition and diagnostic confirmation. Then, I should verify fracture characteristics and risk factors. Next, I will determine candidacy for closed versus open treatment. After that, I need to outline operative technique if indicated and conservative management if chosen. Finally, I should specify post-treatment care, special scenarios like pediatrics or high-energy injuries, and evidence gaps to communicate uncertainty clearly.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and definition. A simple, non-condylar mandibular fracture is a non-comminuted, non-displaced or minimally displaced fracture of the body, angle, or symphysis without involvement of the condylar process, typically presenting with malocclusion and localized pain or mobility, so I need to check occlusion and pain on palpation carefully. I should confirm with imaging; panoramic radiography can suffice for isolated, low-energy injuries, but computed tomography is the gold standard for most trauma and provides definitive delineation of fracture lines and displacement, so I will prefer CT when feasible [^113u91fw] [^111ZW2Gu].

> Next, I should review fracture characteristics that drive treatment. Location matters because angle fractures are notorious for higher complication rates and may favor load-sharing fixation strategies, whereas symphyseal or body fractures can often be managed with simpler techniques. Displacement and angulation influence the decision toward open reduction if malocclusion is present or nonunion risk is high. I need to check patient-specific risks such as smoking, diabetes, and especially antiresorptive therapy because long-term bisphosphonate or denosumab use elevates osteonecrosis of the jaw risk, which alters surgical planning and timing, and denosumab discontinuation carries a rebound fracture risk that complicates management. For children, I should verify the stage of dental development and growth potential before choosing rigid fixation [^1155pmFr] [^113NrPCw] [^113hCrR4] [^115kJss3] [^111V5vKw].

> Now, I will decide on closed versus open management. Wait, let me verify the criteria favoring closed reduction: non-displaced or easily reducible fractures with intact occlusion, low-energy mechanism, and good patient compliance are suitable for closed reduction with intermaxillary fixation using arch bars, bone screws, or even silk sutures in select pediatric cases, typically for 2 to 3 weeks. I should double-check occlusion after reduction and plan staged IMF removal with close follow-up for relapse or nonunion [^115dXLBy] [^115JrqHQ].

> For open reduction, I need to ensure clear indications: displaced fractures causing malocclusion, angle fractures, atrophic edentulous segments, failure of closed reduction, or nonunion risk factors. The objective is anatomic reduction with stable internal fixation that restores occlusion and allows early function. Let me consider fixation philosophy: functionally stable fixation with a load-sharing miniplate system is standard, with Champy-style superior border plating for angle fractures and a single miniplate for symphyseal or body fractures in most cases. I should confirm screw lengths to avoid tooth roots and inferior alveolar nerve injury, and use transbuccal or right-angle drills to facilitate ergonomics and avoid extraoral incisions when possible [^111dkx6c] [^116qbu1T] [^115BFE1F] [^112tbppG].

> If I proceed operatively, I will now examine technique details. I should make an intraoral vestibular incision, expose the fracture ends, perform anatomic reduction, and apply a titanium miniplate with bicortical screws sized to the local anatomy, using a Champy plate on the superior border for angle fractures and a single plate for symphyseal or body fractures. Hold on, I should verify that plate contouring matches the mandibular curvature to avoid secondary displacement and ensure passive fit. After fixation, I will check occlusion and may place short-course IMF if stability is questionable, then release to begin guided function within days to prevent ankylosis and muscle atrophy [^116qbu1T] [^115gC8Pd].

> If I choose conservative management, I need to ensure meticulous IMF application and close monitoring. Arch bars or bone screws with elastics or wire provide secure fixation, but I should verify occlusion at baseline and again after reduction, and counsel on strict dietary adherence to a soft or liquid diet. Duration is typically 2 to 3 weeks, followed by a gradual return to function with radiographic confirmation of healing. But wait, what if occlusion drifts or pain increases? I should have a low threshold to convert to open reduction if malunion develops [^115dXLBy].

> Post-treatment care applies regardless of modality. I should confirm that the patient receives clear oral hygiene instructions and consider prophylactic antibiotics perioperatively, acknowledging that high-quality evidence is limited and heterogeneous, so I will individualize based on contamination, delay to treatment, and comorbidities. Pain control should follow multimodal strategies, and I will schedule follow-up at 1 week, 2 to 3 weeks, and 3 months with clinical and radiographic assessment for union and occlusion. I need to check for complications such as infection, hardware failure, malocclusion, nonunion, and neurosensory changes, and manage promptly if they occur [^116FP3WJ] [^113gCjL8] [^1154M5Yz].

> Special scenarios require tailored decisions. In children, I should avoid rigid fixation across developing tooth roots when possible and favor conservative IMF or resorbable systems, balancing the risk of growth disturbance against the need for stability. For high-energy injuries such as gunshot wounds, open reduction with rigid internal fixation is generally preferred to restore alignment and shorten treatment time, though I should verify that the soft tissue envelope is optimized before fixation. In patients on antiresorptives, I need to coordinate with prescribing clinicians, consider a drug holiday only if benefits outweigh risks, and use atraumatic technique with primary closure to mitigate MRONJ risk [^111V5vKw] [^112vcytf] [^115eqefp] [^114BMUYY] [^113vBVUU].

> I should acknowledge evidence gaps explicitly. The Cochrane review concludes that high-quality comparative evidence is sparse, with no single approach proven superior across settings, so treatment decisions remain individualized and experience-dependent. For condylar fractures, controversy persists and closed management is often favored for minimally displaced cases, reinforcing that my current plan pertains to non-condylar simple fractures only. I need to communicate this uncertainty to the patient during shared decision-making [^114z1p1n] [^115tDDBJ] [^112c1hA8].

> Putting this together, my final algorithm is as follows: confirm a simple, non-condylar mandibular fracture with clinical exam and CT; assess displacement, occlusion, and risk factors; select closed reduction with IMF for non-displaced fractures with intact occlusion and reliable follow-up; choose open reduction with miniplate fixation for displaced fractures, angle fractures, or failure of closed methods; execute meticulous reduction and stable fixation with attention to tooth roots and nerve anatomy; provide structured postoperative care with hygiene, analgesia, and staged follow-up; and adapt for pediatrics, high-energy mechanisms, and antiresorptive therapy as indicated, while counseling on evidence limitations and expected outcomes [^113u91fw] [^115dXLBy] [^111dkx6c] [^114z1p1n].

For a simple jaw fracture, **closed reduction with intermaxillary fixation (IMF)** is the preferred initial treatment [^115dXLBy], typically for 2–3 weeks [^115dXLBy], followed by a soft diet and close follow-up. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is reserved for **displaced, unstable, or non-healing fractures** [^112c1hA8], or when IMF is not feasible. Pain is managed with NSAIDs [^notfound], and antibiotics are given if there is contamination or infection risk. Early mobilization and physiotherapy help restore function, and patients are monitored for malocclusion, nonunion, or infection.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis and fracture characterization are essential for treatment planning. The diagnostic evaluation includes:

- **Clinical examination**: Assess occlusion, mobility, crepitus, pain, and neurosensory deficits [^notfound].

- **Imaging**: Panoramic radiography is useful for initial assessment [^113u91fw], but computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard for detailed fracture delineation, especially in complex cases [^113u91fw].

- **Classification**: Fractures are classified by location (symphysis, body, angle, condyle), pattern (simple, comminuted, compound), and displacement [^notfound].

---

## Indications for conservative management

Conservative management with closed reduction and IMF is appropriate for:

- **Non-displaced or minimally displaced fractures**: Stable fractures with intact occlusion [^notfound].

- **Simple fracture patterns**: Single, non-comminuted fractures without significant angulation or displacement [^notfound].

- **Patient factors**: Good compliance, absence of significant comorbidities, and ability to tolerate IMF [^notfound].

---

## Conservative management protocol

### Closed reduction and intermaxillary fixation (IMF)

- **Technique**: Arch bars, IMF screws, or Ivy loops are used to immobilize the jaws, maintaining occlusion and allowing fracture healing [^114z1p1n].

- **Duration**: Typically 2–3 weeks, followed by gradual mobilization and a soft diet [^112c1hA8].

- **Follow-up**: Regular clinical and radiographic assessments to ensure proper healing and occlusion [^111b4s9p].

---

## Indications for surgical management

Surgical intervention with ORIF is indicated for:

- **Displaced or unstable fractures**: Significant displacement, angulation, or mobility [^112c1hA8].

- **Complex fracture patterns**: Comminuted, compound, or multiple fractures [^1165Jwx7].

- **Failure of conservative management**: Persistent malocclusion or nonunion after IMF [^notfound].

- **Patient factors**: Poor compliance, inability to tolerate IMF, or significant comorbidities [^115dXLBy].

---

## Surgical management protocol

### Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF)

- **Technique**: Intraoral or extraoral approaches are used to expose and reduce the fracture, followed by fixation with miniplates and screws [^114z1p1n].

- **Advantages**: Early mobilization, stable fixation, and reduced risk of malocclusion [^notfound].

- **Complications**: Infection, nerve injury, hardware failure, and scarring [^notfound].

---

## Pain management

Pain control is essential for patient comfort and cooperation. NSAIDs are **first-line agents** for mild to moderate pain [^notfound]; opioids are reserved for severe pain unresponsive to NSAIDs.

---

## Antibiotic prophylaxis

Antibiotics are indicated when contamination is present — such as with compound fractures, intraoral communication, or infected wounds — or when the patient is immunocompromised or has significant comorbidities. First-line agents include **penicillin or amoxicillin**; clindamycin is used for penicillin-allergic patients.

---

## Rehabilitation and follow-up

Rehabilitation focuses on restoring jaw function and preventing complications. Early mobilization and physiotherapy help prevent **trismus** and restore **mandibular function**. Follow-up includes regular clinical and radiographic assessments to monitor healing, occlusion, and complications [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications

Complications of untreated or improperly managed simple jaw fractures include:

- **Malocclusion**: Improper bite alignment, leading to functional impairment [^111ZW2Gu].

- **Nonunion or delayed union**: Persistent fracture gap or delayed healing [^112vcytf].

- **Infection**: Osteomyelitis or abscess formation [^116FP3WJ].

- **Nerve injury**: Inferior alveolar nerve injury causing sensory deficits [^notfound].

- **Temporomandibular joint dysfunction**: Chronic pain, limited mouth opening, and joint dysfunction [^115tDDBJ].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis for simple jaw fractures is **generally excellent** with appropriate treatment. Conservative management achieves high success rates with minimal complications, whereas surgical management offers stable fixation and early mobilization, further improving outcomes [^116qbu1T].

---

Simple jaw fractures are managed with **conservative treatment** (closed reduction and IMF) for stable, non-displaced fractures, while surgical intervention (ORIF) is reserved for displaced, unstable, or complex fractures. Pain control, antibiotic prophylaxis, and rehabilitation are essential components of care, with a generally excellent prognosis when properly managed.

### Optimizing miniplate fixation for simple mandibular fractures [^111cA22A]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Summary

Optimal management of the mandible fracture is directly dependent on thorough evaluation, correct injury assessment, and timely initiation of appropriate therapy. As the mandible is a complex three-dimensional bone, significant structural differences in mandibular regions must be appreciated. While the small cross-section of the mandibular condyle imparts a particular vulnerability to injury, fractures of the angle, body, or symphyseal regions are associated with greater force and the potential for more complex injury. In conjunction with their video presentation, the authors discuss their approach to miniplate fixation of a symphyseal fracture.

Pathological fracture is one of the most serious complications in medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). This case is a report of an 87-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with pathological fracture due to MRONJ. The authors performed minimally invasive and conservative treatment, such as intraoral dressing, antibiotic therapy, and simple debridement, for patients with pathologic fractures due to MRONJ. After 1 year, the inflammatory symptoms disappeared and pathological fractures spontaneously recovered.

### Approach to the patient with bone fracture: making the first fracture the last [^115kJss3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Atypical femur fractures (AFFs) are atraumatic fractures of the subtrochanteric femoral shaft, believed to result from accumulation of microdamage caused by the inhibition of bone remodeling during prolonged antiresorptive therapy. While the incidence of AFFs rises with increasing duration of treatment, with an absolute risk of around 11 fractures per 10 000 person-years of bisphosphonate treatment and similar risk in denosumab users, the absolute risk remains very low and the benefit of treatment usually outweighs the risk of AFF by a large margin. As the risk of AFF declines rapidly following cessation of antiresorptive therapy, a "drug holiday" may be considered in appropriate patients, that is, in those without major risk factors such as prevalent or new fragility fractures or very low BMD. In stark contrast, denosumab discontinuation is not recommended at any point as this leads to a complete and rapid reversal of its effects on bone turnover and BMD, with an increased risk of multiple vertebral fractures. Risk factors for multiple vertebral fractures post denosumab cessation include longer duration of treatment and cessation, prevalent vertebral fractures, greater hip BMD gain on treatment, and greater hip BMD loss off treatment. Thus, while adherence to all forms of osteoprotective pharmacotherapy is important, particular attention should be paid to 1) communicate clearly to patients and their GPs that once denosumab is commenced the drug cannot be ceased without subsequent antiresorptive therapy to prevent bone loss, and 2) carefully consider the appropriateness of using denosumab in a younger patient in whom lifelong antiresorptive treatment is neither desirable nor indicated.

Osteonecrosis of the jaw, another extremely rare adverse event associated with antiresorptive therapy, typically occurs in the setting of invasive dental procedures and higher-dose regimens in oncology patients. Patients should be aware that the incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw in the setting of osteoporosis treatment is only around 1 in 10 000 to 100 000 patient-years. They should be counseled on the importance of informing their dentist of antiresorptive treatment, with antiresorptive therapy recommended 4 to 6 weeks after invasive procedures to promote wound healing.

### Intraoral epimucosal fixation for reducible maxillary fractures of the jaws; surgical considerations in comparison to current techniques [^115ZSoi1]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Fractures of the jaw are often treated with rigid and stable internal fixation using plates or miniplates. Early surgery for jaw fractures is the optimal treatment; however, if a late treatment is begun, often the adoption of other protocols is needed. When the jaw fracture has one free bone fragment with 2 full-thickness lesions of mucoperiosteal soft tissues both on the buccal and palatal sides, the risk of resorption or necrosis is very high after elevating a mucoperiosteal flap for rigid fixation. For this reason, we developed an intraoral epimucosal fixation technique using self-locking screws and plates. Substantial advantages of this new technique, in comparison with other commonly used fixation techniques, consisted in the prevention of bone resorption or necrosis by safe and simple screw insertion procedure after manipulation of the fracture for reduction in closed surgery. Major indications for epimucosal fixation in closed surgery are the presence of jaw fractures without dislocation or reducible jaw fractures by manipulation particularly in edentulous patients.

### Pharmacologic treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass to prevent fractures in adults: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^113QxChE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Primary osteoporosis — treatment in males includes the following: there was no evidence suggesting differences in treatment benefits and harms by sex, evidence was limited in males, and the authors complemented low-certainty conclusions for males by extrapolating from trials that included females to recommend the same first- and second-line treatments for males and females; they downgraded the overall certainty to low due to indirectness and downgraded the strength of the recommendation to conditional; the systematic review identified 10 studies (6 RCTs and 4 observational studies) in males; low‑certainty evidence showed that bisphosphonates may have reduced radiographic vertebral fractures (ARD, 140 fewer events per 1000 patients; moderate certainty) in RCTs at least 36 months from treatment initiation, and no RCTs evaluated hip fractures; at 12 to less than 36 months, bisphosphonates probably reduced radiographic vertebral fractures but not any clinical fractures (moderate certainty); in harms at 12 to less than 36 months, RCTs showed no differences in serious adverse events and probably no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events and atrial fibrillation in males; longer treatment with bisphosphonates was associated with higher risk for atypical femoral fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw, and other harms included higher incidence of pyrexia, myalgia, and arthralgia.

### Interventions for the management of mandibular fractures [^114z1p1n]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Fractures of the mandible (lower jaw) are a common occurrence and usually related to interpersonal violence or road traffic accidents. Mandibular fractures may be treated using open (surgical) and closed (non-surgical) techniques. Fracture sites are immobilized with intermaxillary fixation (IMF) or other external or internal devices (i.e. plates and screws) to allow bone healing. Various techniques have been used, however uncertainty exists with respect to the specific indications for each approach.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to provide reliable evidence of the effects of any interventions either open (surgical) or closed (non-surgical) that can be used in the management of mandibular fractures, excluding the condyles, in adult patients.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 28 February 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 28 February 2013), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 28 February 2013), metaRegister of Controlled Trials (to 7 April 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (to 7 April 2013) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 7 April 2013). The reference lists of all trials identified were checked for further studies. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. Any studies that compared different treatment approaches were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Results were to be expressed as random-effects models using mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was to be investigated to include both clinical and methodological factors.

Main Results

Twelve studies, assessed as high (six) and unclear (six) risk of bias, comprising 689 participants (830 fractures), were included. Interventions examined different plate materials and morphology; use of one or two lag screws; microplate versus miniplate; early and delayed mobilization; eyelet wires versus Rapid IMF™ and the management of angle fractures with intraoral access alone or combined with a transbuccal approach. Patient-oriented outcomes were largely ignored and post-operative pain scores were inadequately reported. Unfortunately, only one or two trials with small sample sizes were conducted for each comparison and outcome. Our results and conclusions should therefore be interpreted with caution. We were able to pool the results for two comparisons assessing one outcome. Pooled data from two studies comparing two miniplates versus one miniplate revealed no significant difference in the risk of post-operative infection of surgical site (risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95% CI 0.41 to 4.22, P = 0.64, I² = 0%). Similarly, no difference in post-operative infection between the use of two 3-dimensional (3D) and standard (2D) miniplates was determined (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.19 to 8.13, P = 0.81, I² = 27%). The included studies involved a small number of participants with a low number of events.

Authors' Conclusions

This review illustrates that there is currently inadequate evidence to support the effectiveness of a single approach in the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. The lack of high quality evidence may be explained by clinical diversity, variability in assessment tools used and difficulty in grading outcomes with existing measurement tools. Until high level evidence is available, treatment decisions should continue to be based on the clinician's prior experience and the individual circumstances.

### Open versus closed management for gunshot wounds of the mandible-which more frequently achieves satisfactory bony union? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112vcytf]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Closed management of high-energy mandibular injuries has been considered the gold standard for many years, but open management is preferable for its shorter overall treatment time. At present, there is a paucity of evidence on which to base management decisions, and as such there is a priority to review the literature to define the optimal treatment for mandibular gunshot wounds (GSWs).

Method

The study design was a systematic review with meta-analyses and the protocol was designed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement. Electronic searches of published literature in the MEDLINE and Embase databases (1980-present) were conducted. Search terms included "gunshot", "firearm", "mandible", and "jaw". Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, case-control studies, and case series written in English describing studies involving patients with mandibular fractures caused by GSWs [population] containing information on treatment by either open reduction and (nonwire) internal fixation [intervention] or by closed reduction ± external fixation [comparator], and the frequency of bony union and complications [outcomes]. Meta-analysis was conducted using the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) as the measure of effect. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies.

Results

159 studies were identified overall of which 6 studies (3.7%; 3 observational studies and 3 RCTs) met the eligibility criteria. Due to high heterogeneity the study subtypes were analyzed separately. In the observational studies (n = 137), open management resulted in bony union 43/52 (82.7%) times, whereas closed management resulted in bony union 78/85 (91.8%) times (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.15, P = 0.09). In the RCTs (n = 190), open management resulted in bony union 89/95 (93.7%) times, whereas closed management resulted in bony union 70/95 (73.7%) times (OR 6.86, 95% CI 2.42 to 19.46, P = 0.0003).

Conclusion

The practicalities of treating mandibular GSWs are nuanced, and the recommendation of a one-size-fits-all management approach would be inappropriate. However, there is sufficient evidence in the findings of this systematic review to support open management as first-line treatment, with closed management considered if the former is clinically or logistically unfeasible.

### Management of mandible fractures [^115dXLBy]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Review the incidence and etiology of mandible fractures. 2. Discuss indications and techniques for closed and open treatment of mandible fractures. 3. Review complications of mandible fractures.

Background

Mandible fractures are among the most common types of facial fractures treated by plastic surgeons. They must be managed carefully to maintain the function of the mandible, reestablish proper occlusion, and minimize secondary complications.

Methods

Current methods of management include combinations of soft diet, intermaxillary fixation, open reduction with plate fixation, and, rarely, external fixation.

Results

Decision-making depends on the age of the patient, type of fracture identified, and concomitant medical conditions or injuries.

Conclusion

The authors review the diagnosis and current trends in management of mandible fractures.

### Treatment modalities for mandibular angle fractures [^115BFE1F]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Management of mandibular angle fractures is often challenging and results in the highest complication rate among fractures of the mandible. Optimal treatment for angle fractures remains controversial. Historically, treatment of mandible fractures included intraoperative maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) along with rigid internal fixation. More recently, noncompression plates miniplates, which produce only relative stability, have gained popularity. The absolute necessity of intraoperative MMF as an adjunct to internal fixation has also become controversial. The current trends in the management of simple, noncomminuted mandibular angle fractures are examined.

Materials and Methods

A survey was submitted to North American and European AO ASIF (Arbeits-gemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen Association for the Study of Internal Fixation) faculty in July 2001. Statistical analysis of results included both Fisher's exact and chi-square tests. Results were considered significant if P < .05.

Results

One hundred ten of 127 potential responses were received (87%). Among 104 surgeons who treat mandible fractures, 86 (83%) treat more than 10 mandibular fractures per year. Preferred techniques for simple, noncomminuted mandibular angle fractures in this group were: single miniplate on the superior border (Champy technique) with or without arch bars (44 surgeons, 51%); tension band plate on the superior border and nonlocking, bicortical screw plate on the inferior border (11 surgeons, 13%); dual miniplates (9 surgeons, 10%); a locking screw plate on the inferior border only (6 surgeons, 7%), and 3-dimensional plates (5 surgeons, 6%). Eleven surgeons (13%) gave multiple answers. Although only 13% of surgeons surveyed primarily use the combination of tension band and nonlocking, bicortical screw plates, many surgeons (73%) continue to use this technique in certain circumstances. Within this group, 32 (51%) place screws in a neutral position, while 31 (49%) place screws in an eccentric position, resulting in compression. For simple noncomminuted angle fractures, the number of surgeons performing internal fixation without MMF were: 14 often (16%); 20 occasionally (23%); 17 seldom (20%); and 35 never (41%). Surgeons treating more than 10 versus those who treat less than 10 fractures per year, International versus North American faculty, and Oral and Maxillofacial surgeons (OMS) versus non-OMS surgeons were compared. Surgeons who treat more than 10 fractures per year favor the Champy technique over the tension band and bicortical plate combination (44 [51%] vs 11 [13%]), while those surgeons who treat less than 10 per year favor the tension band and bicortical plate combination over the Champy technique (9 [50%] vs 3 [17%]; P < .01, Fisher exact test). International faculty are less likely to use intraoperative MMF than North American faculty (29 [81%] vs 31 [43%]; P < .01, Fisher exact test). OMS surgeons are less likely to use the tension band and bicortical plate combination than non-OMS surgeons (22 [56%] vs 42 [90%]; P < .017, Fisher exact test).

Conclusion

This survey suggests an evolution in the management of mandibular angle fractures. A single miniplate plate on the superior border of the mandible has become the preferred method of treatment among AO faculty. When using large, inferiorly based plates more surgeons are now favoring neutral rather than eccentric screw placement. Intraoperative MMF is not considered mandatory by some surgeons in certain circumstances.

### Evidence-based medicine: evaluation and treatment of zygoma fractures [^1169ox4Q]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Diagnose zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures from physical examination and radiographic findings. 2. Plan the necessary surgical approaches for operative treatment of zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures depending on severity. 3. Understand the three-dimensional anatomy of the orbit and zygomaticomaxillary complex and the importance of the zygomaticosphenoid suture along the lateral orbital sidewall. 4. Be aware of pitfalls and associated fractures that can complicate anatomical reduction of zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures.

Summary

Fractures of the zygoma are some of the most commonly treated facial fractures, yet reconstruction of the three-dimensional structure of the zygomaticomaxillary complex can be challenging, and malunions are common. This article presents an evidence-based, systemic approach to the assessment and treatment of zygoma fractures from the simple to the complex. Anatomy, approaches, techniques, and pitfalls are described in an effort to improve the treatment of these common facial fractures.

### Prevention and management of osteoradionecrosis in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiation therapy: ISOO-MASCC-ASCO guideline [^112Ub9gR]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for osteoradionecrosis of the jaw, more specifically with respect to indications for surgery (full-thickness osteoradionecrosis), ASCO/ISOO/MASCC 2024 guidelines recommend to remove superficial bony sequestra deemed low risk by the clinician. Recognize that reduction of the disease burden and the biofilm environment can be synergistic with the ongoing systemic therapy.

### Analysis of fractured mandible over two decades [^113NzPKG]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Maxillofacial fractures are one of the most frequent and complicated problems of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Within these fractures, mandibula is one of the most affected bones. When all of the facial bone fractures are evaluated, incidence of the mandible fractures can be detected as ∼38%. If mandible fractures are not treated appropriately, they can cause morbidities at a high level. The most important aim of the treatment is to provide healing on both functional and cosmetic aspects. During the determination of treatment strategy, age of the patient, presence of additional injuries, comorbid diseases of the patient, trauma type, and localization of the fracture must be kept in mind. Although there are many developing techniques for the fixation of the fractures, still there is no consensus on the ideal treatment. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the patients treated for mandible fractures retrospectively from different aspects such as epidemiology, way of treatment, and possible complications.

### Screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^11795CXv]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Harms of screening and treatment — rare events with bisphosphonates and denosumab: Osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures are potential rare harms of bisphosphonates; five trials reported no cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw and no trials reported on atypical femur fractures. Observational data show increased atypical femur fracture risk with zoledronic acid (aHR, 2.46 [95% CI, 1.17–5.15]) and with bisphosphonate use overall (aHR, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.36–1.73]) over a mean follow-up of 1 year, and a systematic review reported osteonecrosis of the jaw incidence ranging from 0.001% to 0.006% in individuals using bisphosphonates. For denosumab, pooled analyses found no significant increase in serious adverse events (5 RCTs) or upper gastrointestinal tract adverse events (4 trials), two trials reported no significant increase in cardiovascular events, and three trials reported no cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw with two trials reporting no cases of atypical femur fracture.

### Interventions for the treatment of fractures of the mandibular condyle [^115tDDBJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Fractures of the condylar process account for between 25% and 35% of all mandibular fractures. Treatment options for fractures of the condyles consist of either the closed method or by open reduction with fixation. Complications may be associated with either treatment option; for the closed approach these can include malocclusion, particularly open bites, reduced posterior facial height and facial asymmetry in addition to chronic pain and reduced mobility. A cutaneous scar and temporary paralysis of the facial nerve are not infrequent complications associated with the open approach. There is a lack of consensus currently surrounding the indications for either surgical or non-surgical treatment of fractures of the mandibular condyle.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions that can be used in the treatment of fractures of the mandibular condyle.

Search Strategy

The databases searched were: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 12th March 2010), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1950 to 12th March 2010), and EMBASE (from 1980 to 12th March 2010). The reference lists of all trials identified were cross checked for additional trials. Authors were contacted by electronic mail to ask for details of additional published and unpublished trials. There were no language restrictions and several articles were translated.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which included adults, over 18 years of age, with unilateral or bilateral fractures of the mandibular condyles. Any form of open or closed method of reduction and fixation was considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors screened trials for inclusion. Extracted data were to be synthesised using the fixed-effect model but if substantial clinical diversity was identified between the studies we planned to use the random-effects model with studies grouped by action and we would explore the heterogeneity between the included studies. Mean differences were to be calculated for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes together with their 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

No high quality evidence matching the inclusion criteria was identified.

Authors' Conclusions

No high quality evidence is available in relation to this review question and no conclusions could be reached about the effectiveness or otherwise of the two interventions considered in this review. A need for further well designed randomised controlled trials exists. The trialists should account for all losses to follow-up and assess patient related outcomes. They should also report the direct and indirect costs associated with the interventions.

### Imaging of mandibular fractures: a pictorial review [^111ZW2Gu]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Mandibular fractures are among the most common maxillofacial fractures observed in emergency rooms and are mainly caused by road accidents. The clinical features of mandibular fractures include malocclusion and loss of mandibular function. Panoramic radiography is usually limited to isolated lesions, whereas computed tomography is the tool of choice for all other facial traumatic events. No reference standard classification system for the different types of mandibular fractures is defined. Therapeutic options include a conservative approach or surgical treatment based on the anatomic area and the severity of fracture. The main purpose of this pictorial review is to illustrate a practical description of the pathophysiology of mandibular fractures and describe both the imaging techniques to recognise them and the therapeutic indications.

### An alternative method of intermaxillary fixation for simple pediatric mandible fractures [^115JrqHQ]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Mandibular fractures represent a substantial portion of facial fractures in the pediatric population. Pediatric mandibles differ from their adult counterparts in the presence of mixed dentition. Avoidance of injury to developing tooth follicles is critical. Simple mandibular fractures can be treated with intermaxillary fixation (IMF) using arch bars or bone screws. This report describes an alternative to these methods using silk sutures and an algorithm to assist in treating simple mandibular fractures in the pediatric population.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed and the records of 1 surgeon were examined. Pediatric patients who underwent treatment for a mandibular fracture in the operating room from 2011 to 2015 were identified using Common Procedural Terminology codes. Data collected included age, gender, type of fracture, type of treatment used, duration of fixation, and presence of complications.

Results

Five patients with a mean age of 6.8 years at presentation were identified. Fracture types were unilateral fractures of the condylar neck (n = 3), bilateral fractures of the condylar head (n = 1), and a unilateral fracture of the condylar head with an associated parasymphyseal fracture (n = 1). IMF was performed in 4 patients using silk sutures, and bone screw fixation was performed in the other patient. No post-treatment complications or malocclusion were reported. Average duration of IMF was 18.5 days.

Conclusions

An algorithm is presented to assist in the treatment of pediatric mandibular fractures. Silk suture fixation is a viable and safe alternative to arch bars or bone screws for routine mandibular fractures.

### Medical management of patients after atypical femur fractures: a systematic review and recommendations from the European calcified tissue society [^112ammze]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Antiresorptive drugs such as bisphosphonates are widely used for the treatment of osteoporosis. Although effective for prevention of osteoporotic fractures, use of bisphosphonates is associated with rare but serious adverse events such as osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures (AFFs). An AFF is a spontaneous or low-trauma, subtrochanteric or femur shaft fracture often complicated by delayed or nonunion (26%–39%) and bilateral occurrence.

The age-adjusted incidence rate of AFF has been estimated to be 1.8 per 100 0000 person-years in patients on bisphosphonate use under 2 years, increasing to 113 per 100 000 person-years with more than 8 years' duration. It is thought that decreased bone resorption in bisphosphonate users results in suppressed bone turnover with accumulation of microcracks and homogeneously mineralized bone, making the bone more brittle and allowing the development of a spontaneous femur fracture. However, it is uncertain if bisphosphonates are causally related to AFF, and, incidentally, AFFs do occur in bisphosphonate-naïve individuals. Usually, bisphosphonates are discontinued after AFF is diagnosed. It has been shown that the risk of AFF decreases 70% per year from the last use of antiresorptive drugs, although it is not certain that this risk reduction is also seen in patients who have already sustained an AFF.

### Mandibular condylar fractures [^112DrCew]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Mandibular condyle fractures can result in short-term and long-term morbidity. As a weak area of the mandible, the condyle is vulnerable to injury by a direct impact or an indirect force. Current treatment recommendations aim to better match the severity of the fracture with the choice of closed or open approach. Long-term follow-up of patients provides the best opportunity to monitor the degree of functional restoration after treatment. There is a growing consensus regarding the use of standardized fracture classification methods and outcomes measures that will allow better assessment of treatment results and strengthen the quality of outcomes research.

Fracture through the angle of the mandible is one of the most common maxillofacial injuries sustained in modern societies. Among issues related to the treatment of maxillofacial injuries, those concerning angle fractures are the most hotly debated, with the exception perhaps of those concerning the condylar process of the mandible. There are several reasons for this controversy about treatment of angle fractures, a controversy too often made up of arguments founded on emotion rather than on scientific information. This article discusses some of the controversies in the management of such fractures.

### Cost-effectiveness of secondary fracture prevention intervention for Medicare beneficiaries [^1153uGrH]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

We assumed that individuals who initiated osteoporosis treatment would receive a medication with a fracture risk reduction efficacy for all types of fracture of 35% (relative risk of fracture on treatment 0.65), as reported in a recent large cohort study of the real‐world effectiveness of osteoporosis treatment. We assumed individuals would be treated for 5 years, and that adherence for the entire treatment period would be 50% in usual care group and approximately 15% higher (65%) in the intervention group, with the remainder of patients fully nonadherent. We assumed that residual fracture risk reduction efficacy after discontinuing treatment declined linearly over the course of 5 years after discontinuation to no remaining benefit. We included risk of possible rare serious adverse events of osteoporosis treatment of atypical subtrochanteric femoral fractures or osteonecrosis of the jaw for patients on treatment, with rates obtained from a published review paper. We assumed that if an individual sustained either of these adverse events they would discontinue treatment.

Fracture rates

Age‐stratified rates of new osteoporotic fracture (combined rates for hip, nonvertebral, and clinical vertebral fractures) for Medicare beneficiaries reported in the Milliman report were used for baseline fracture incidence rates for patients of different ages; overall rates for each age group (65–74, 75–84, and 85+) were further adjusted up or down for females or males, respectively, to account for women having approximately 79% greater fracture rates than men after adjusting for age. After a new osteoporotic fracture, we assumed that the short‐term risk of a subsequent fracture was 3.1 times higher than baseline, and that this elevated short‐term fracture risk persisted for 5 years after the fracture.

Bone health in prostate cancer — osteonecrosis of the jaw prevention and dental management emphasizes pre-treatment dental evaluation and timing of dental procedures: The risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw is increased in patients who have tooth extractions, poor dental hygiene, or a dental appliance, and to prevent osteonecrosis of the jaw, it is recommended that all patients have a comprehensive dental evaluation prior to initiating an osteoclast inhibitor. If invasive dental procedures are required, bone-targeted therapy should be withheld until the dentist indicates that the patient has healed completely from all dental procedure(s), and stopping denosumab represents a dilemma such that the clinician must carefully weigh the risk of rebound spine fractures versus the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.

### Comparative study of the prognosis of an extracorporeal reduction and a closed treatment in mandibular condyle head and / or neck fractures [^116v6RE8]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this study was a comparison of the prognosis between an extracorporeal reduction technique and closed treatment of a mandibular condyle fracture. The relationship between condylar resorption and several clinical variables was also studied.

Patients and Methods

Seventy-one patients who had a mandibular condyle fracture took part in this study. Thirty-five patients (female: 7, male: 28, age: 30.46 ± 14.27 years) were treated by extracorporeal reduction, and 36 patients (male: 24, female: 12, age: 24.28 ± 9.99 years) were treated using a closed treatment. The presence of complications such as condylar resorption, malocclusion, nerve disorder, and disc displacement was evaluated with panoramic radiographs and clinical examinations 12 months after treatment. The relationships between the complications and other clinical variables were evaluated statistically.

Results

The anatomic site and fracture type were closely related to condyle resorption in the bivariate analysis. Condylar head fractures showed significantly higher condyle resorption than condylar neck fractures (P = 0.023). A complex or compound fracture showed significantly higher condyle resorption compared with a simple fracture (P = 0.006). Patients who had a complex/compound fracture were 34.366 times more likely to have condyle resorption compared with those who had a simple fracture (P = 0.002). The patient's age and treatment method were also significant predictors for condyle resorption.

Conclusion

Fracture type was the strongest predictor of condylar resorption. Because treatment method and patient age were also related to the prognosis, the optimal treatment for mandibular condylar head and/or neck fractures should be individualized according to the patient's condition.

### Conservative management of severe medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw with pathological fracture [^114YLWqY]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a well-known risk following dental extraction in patients taking certain medications. Pathological fracture secondary to MRONJ often requires complex operative intervention. This case demonstrates the conservative management of pathological fracture secondary to MRONJ in a patient with multiple comorbidities. The patient developed MRONJ with pathological fracture following extraction of the mandibular second molar. The patient presented with significant surgical risk factors, having hypertension and a recent stroke, causing dense left hemiparesis, subsequently resulting in transition to high-level nursing care. Given the high risk of reconstructive surgery, nonoperative management was undertaken. Following a course of long-term antibiotics with resolution of signs of infection, the case was managed conservatively with chlorhexidine-based mouthwash and soft diet. With routine clinico-radiographic assessment and optimal oral health care, the pathological fracture did not require operative intervention. Healing progressed well with no clinical complications and radiographic evidence of good healing at 6- and 12-month follow-up on orthopantomogram. A role for conservative management of pathological fractures secondary to MRONJ yet exists, especially in the elderly population. This case highlights the importance of developing treatment plans based on individual patient context and clinical assessment.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — antiresorptive therapy safety (osteonecrosis of the jaw [ONJ] and atypical femoral fractures [AFF]) shows that in advanced cancer dosing the incidence of ONJ is higher, with an incidence of 1 to 2% per year at annual doses 10 and 12 times higher than osteoporosis regimens, whereas for osteoporosis the incidence is on the order of 1/10,000 to 1/100,000 patients per year and denosumab reports 5.2 cases per 10,000 patient-years. Risk mitigation includes dental assessment and timing of therapy: risk factors include dental pathologic conditions, invasive dental procedures, and poor dental hygiene; an oral examination should be done in patients being considered for treatment, and if significant dental issues are present, delaying the initiation of bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy until the dental issues have been corrected is recommended; for patients already receiving therapy who require invasive dental procedures, there is no evidence that discontinuing or interrupting treatment will change the outcome or reduce the risk of ONJ, but stopping should at least be considered for patients undergoing extensive invasive dental procedures such as extraction of several teeth. AFF risk seems increased with long-term bisphosphonate therapy (> 5 years duration), yet modeling suggests that treatment of 1,000 women with osteoporosis for up to 3 years would be associated with fewer than 1 AFF per 100 osteoporotic fractures prevented; a review reported prodromal groin or thigh pain in approximately 70% of AFF patients, bilateral radiographic abnormalities in 28%, and delayed healing in 26%, and any patient with persistent thigh or groin pain should interrupt bisphosphonate treatment while appropriate imaging studies are obtained; a causal relationship has not been established, and there is evidence that using anabolic therapy when AFF is diagnosed accelerates fracture healing.

Results — characteristics of studies and evidence-based recommendations report that a total of 132 papers met the eligibility criteria — 10 randomized controlled trials, 75 retrospective studies, and 47 prospective studies. Due to the limitations of the available evidence, the guideline relied on formal consensus for most recommendations, and the only two recommendations that were deemed evidence based by the Expert Panel were those for coordination of care to reduce the risk of MRONJ (Recommendation 2.1) and avoidance of elective dentoalveolar surgery during BMA therapy (Recommendation 2.3).

### Atypical fractures at non-classical sites associated with anti-resorptive therapy: a systematic review [^111s2J7F]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Osteoporosis is common, affecting more than 20% of women and 6% of men globally over the age of 50. Anti-resorptive drugs, bisphosphonates and denosumab, have been effective treatments for osteoporosis for more than 30 years. Rare complications of anti-resorptive therapy include medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures (AFF). The American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) proposed a case definition for these atypical femoral fractures in 2010, which was updated in 2013. However, atypical fractures at non-classical sites have been increasingly described. We aimed to systematically identify atypical fracture cases excluded from the ASBMR AFF case definition in patients receiving anti-resorptive medication for longer than 3 yr. A structured search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Cochrane, and Web of Sciences, and hand-searching of conference abstracts were undertaken. All full-text articles written in English describing an atypical fracture in patients (aged > 18 yr) and receiving anti-resorptive medication for > 3 yr were included, with data extracted and analyzed by two independent reviewers. Sixty-six articles were identified, describing 151 cases of atypical fractures in 114 individuals. The most frequent fracture site was the ulna, followed by the tibia. All patients were taking anti-resorptive treatment prior to or at the time of fracture, most frequently alendronate monotherapy (44%). Most commonly, fractures were transverse in nature (95%), following minimal or no trauma (96%), and non-comminuted (98%) with cortical thickening of the surrounding bone (69%). Anti-resorptive treatment was ceased following an atypical fracture in the majority (89%). Atypical fractures are rare and should not deter physicians from appropriate anti-resorptive therapy for osteoporosis. However, clinicians should be alert to their presence at additional sites to the femur. An update of the current ASBMR AFF case definition to include other skeletal sites could be timely.

### Pharmacologic treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass to prevent fractures in adults: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^115hsKH3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Serious adverse events (≥ 36 Months) — Bisphosphonates and denosumab resulted in no differences in serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events in RCTs. Bisphosphonates were associated with higher risk for osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral or subtrochanteric fractures in observational studies, with higher risk after longer treatment duration. Romosozumab followed by alendronate probably did not increase risk for serious harms or withdrawal due to adverse effects compared with bisphosphonate alone at 12- to 36-month outcome assessment in an RCT. Teriparatide may have resulted in no difference in risk for serious adverse events but probably increased the risk for withdrawal due to adverse events in RCTs.

Comminuted fractures of the mandible are unusual but not rare. They are complex injuries with a high complication rate. Gunshot wounds are a frequent cause. Traditional management with closed techniques is noted for good long-term results, but may involve an extended period of treatment. Treatment with open reduction and rigid internal fixation significantly shortens the course of treatment and simplifies the convalescence.

### Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: MASCC / ISOO / ASCO clinical practice guideline [^113R5igW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) — general objectives and procedural considerations specify that treatment objectives for patients with an established diagnosis of MRONJ are to eliminate pain, control infection of the soft and hard tissues, and minimize the progression or occurrence of bone necrosis, and patients with established MRONJ should avoid elective dentoalveolar surgical procedures; there have been several reports of successful treatment outcomes for all stages after operative therapy and nonoperative therapy, and, with the exception of the more advanced cases of stage 3 disease or cases with a well-defined sequestrum, a more prudent approach is to consider operative therapies when nonoperative strategies have failed. Regardless of stage, areas of superficial necrotic bone that are an ongoing source of soft tissue irritation and loose bony sequestra should be removed or recontoured to optimize soft tissue healing, extraction of symptomatic teeth within exposed, necrotic bone should be considered, and most affected patients experience osteonecrosis of the jaw after dentoalveolar surgery.

### Acute pain management [^113gCjL8]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Control of acute pain in oral and maxillofacial surgery is important for patient care and comfort. Oral surgical procedures are associated with tissue injury and inflammation. Acute pain can arise directly from a surgical procedure or from problems such as dental caries, infection, perforation of maxillary sinus, pericoronitis, and jaw fractures. The major factor in acute pain management is deciding on an appropriate intervention and/or analgesics that will provide the best pain relief. Multimodal pain control has taken a leading role in effectively managing acute pain. This article covers the different options available to dental clinicians.

Rarely, patients have reported severe bone, joint, and/or muscle pain
starting within one day to several months after beginning to take, by mouth,
bisphosphonate drugs to treat osteoporosis (thin bones). This group of drugs
includes BONIVA. Most patients experienced relief after stopping the drug.
Contact your health care provider if you develop these symptoms after starting
BONIVA.

Rarely, patients taking bisphosphonates have reported serious jaw problems
associated with delayed healing and infection, often following dental procedures
such as tooth extraction. If you experience jaw problems, contact your health
care provider and dentist.

What is osteoporosis?

Osteoporosis is a disease that causes bones to become thinner. Thin bones can
break easily. Most people think of their bones as being solid like a rock.
Actually, bone is living tissue, just like other parts of the body, such as your
heart, brain, or skin. Bone just happens to be a harder type of tissue. Bone is
always changing. Your body keeps your bones strong and healthy by replacing old
bone with new bone.

Osteoporosis causes the body to remove more bone than it replaces. This means
that bones get weaker. Weak bones are more likely to break. Osteoporosis is a
bone disease that is quite common in women after menopause. At first,
osteoporosis has no symptoms, but people with osteoporosis may develop loss of
height and are more likely to break (fracture) their bones, especially the back
(spine), wrist, and hip bones.

### Facial fractures: classification and highlights for a useful report [^113t8ruZ]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

The first and most important goal in treating zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures is to reduce the fracture. The zygomatic bone plays an important role in defining the height and width of the midface, so failure to recognize and treat this fracture can lead to cosmetic deformity. The complexity of the surgical repair will depend on the degree of fracture displacement and comminution, so the radiologist's report should include these points (Fig. 11 c–e).

The extent of orbital involvement will also determine surgical treatment because increased orbital volume is the most common cause of posttraumatic enophthalmos. When more than 50% of the orbital floor is affected, open reconstruction will probably be necessary.

Anyway, these fractures are different than simple orbital blow-out fractures, when considering the size of the floor fragment on pre-surgical CT: when ZMC fractures displaced with internal rotation/malar retrusion are reduced, the defect size must be taken together with the possibility that the defect will further expand with eventually a worsening of the future enophthalmos.

Finally, it is also important to take the status of the orbital apex into account. When the lateral orbital wall is displaced medially, apex involvement is more likely and consequently damage to carotid arteries and cranial nerves (CN) II–VI in the superior orbital fissure is more likely.

Zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures can be displaced due to rotational forces on the zygomatic bone from the masseter muscle; in these cases, if the infratemporal fossa is occupied, patients may have difficulties chewing.

### Call to action: a five nations consensus on the use of intravenous zoledronate after hip fracture [^111e35BE]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Dental issues and extremely low risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw

Individuals who take anti-resorptive therapies such as IV Zol are at very low risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). ONJ is defined as exposed bone, or bone that can be probed through a fistula in the maxillofacial region, that has persisted for more than 8 weeks and without a history of radiation therapy or metastatic disease to the jaw. The pathophysiology is not fully understood and is probably multifactorial. ONJ is more prevalent in patients who have procedures that have impact on bone, such as tooth extractions and possibly dental implants, but ONJ can be spontaneous. Risk factors include cumulative bisphosphonate dosage and duration of treatment, concurrent periodontal disease, treatment with systemic steroids and people of Asian ethnicity. ONJ is also seen in people who have never used anti-resorptive therapies. The risk of ONJ is 0–2.3% with bisphosphonates for a cancer diagnosis. With oral bisphosphonates for osteoporosis, the risk is 0–0.1%, but probably increases with longer therapy duration. The risk with annual IV Zol is similar: one study identifying a single case in around 6,000 patients (0.017%).

In patients commencing IV Zol therapy, some consideration of dental health should be made. Patients should be encouraged to seek routine dental care where possible, with the reasoning for good dental hygiene explained. However, the very low absolute risk of ONJ, particularly for those who are treatment naïve, needs to be balanced against the high absolute risk of further imminent fragility fractures. It is important not to delay treatment on dental grounds when the benefits of IV Zol outweigh the risks. Further, patients should not be declined dental treatment if need arises following IV Zol administration.

Expert group consensus

For patients with hip fracture, the absolute risk of imminent fragility fractures and the clear benefits of IV Zol usually far outweigh any potential risk of ONJ. Dental considerations should not limit the use of IV Zol; patients should be informed of the very rare risk of ONJ and be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene.

### Call to action: a five nations consensus on the use of intravenous zoledronate after hip fracture [^113wjVFg]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

The speciality of orthogeriatrics is less well developed in many countries, but the writing group included members of the Hip Fracture Audit and the Secondary Prevention advisory groups of the Global Fragility Fracture Network (FFN), and this work will encourage other countries to consider how they implement effective secondary fracture prevention appropriate to their own populations and health economies.

This consensus paper was entirely unfunded; the authors did this work on a voluntary basis. The decision to write a consensus statement rather than a guideline reflected the fact that formal guidance already exists, but a series of concerns and uncertainties currently limit guideline implementation in many hospitals. As such, we would not anticipate a need to update this statement, unless new drug developments or future revisions of national guidance were to pose additional challenges to clinical teams. Notably, this statement forms the basis for planned work within the Global FFN, which may lead to a revision that takes other factors into account (including the absence of geriatricians and financial constraints) in extending this call to action to those working in other countries.

An initial scoping meeting of the writing group identified key areas of concern, drawing on prior clinical experience, expressed uncertainties received from colleagues and participants in the national audits that the writing group members were each leading. These were then drawn together into six themes. Individual members with particular clinical and/or research experience in each area then reviewed the relevant literature and drafted the introduction and each of the six sections. These sections were then reviewed by the writing group and discussed in a series of five fortnightly virtual meetings, where they were iteratively expanded, reworded and refined in content until consensus was agreed. For each section, a summary consensus statement that captured the implications of each section was agreed during these meetings, and these statements were then combined into the management flowchart (Figure 2).

### Interventions for managing medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw [^113vBVUU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a severe adverse reaction experienced by some individuals to certain medicines commonly used in the treatment of cancer and osteoporosis (e.g. bisphosphonates, denosumab, and antiangiogenic agents), and involves the progressive destruction of bone in the mandible or maxilla. Depending on the drug, its dosage, and the duration of exposure, this adverse drug reaction may occur rarely (e.g. following the oral administration of bisphosphonate or denosumab treatments for osteoporosis, or antiangiogenic agent-targeted cancer treatment), or commonly (e.g. following intravenous bisphosphonate for cancer treatment). MRONJ is associated with significant morbidity, adversely affects quality of life (QoL), and is challenging to treat. This is an update of our review first published in 2017.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions versus no treatment, placebo, or an active control for the prophylaxis of MRONJ in people exposed to antiresorptive or antiangiogenic drugs. To assess the effects of non-surgical or surgical interventions (either singly or in combination) versus no treatment, placebo, or an active control for the treatment of people with manifest MRONJ.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 16 June 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one modality of intervention with another for the prevention or treatment of MRONJ. For 'prophylaxis of MRONJ', the primary outcome of interest was the incidence of MRONJ; secondary outcomes were QoL, time-to-event, and rate of complications and side effects of the intervention. For 'treatment of established MRONJ', the primary outcome of interest was healing of MRONJ; secondary outcomes were QoL, recurrence, and rate of complications and side effects of the intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported the risk ratio (RR) (or rate ratio) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

We included 13 RCTs (1668 participants) in this updated review, of which eight were new additions. The studies were clinically diverse and examined very different interventions, so meta-analyses could not be performed. We have low or very low certainty about available evidence on interventions for the prophylaxis or treatment of MRONJ.

Prophylaxis of MRONJ
Five RCTs examined different interventions to prevent the occurrence of MRONJ. One RCT compared standard care with regular dental examinations at three-month intervals and preventive treatments (including antibiotics before dental extractions and the use of techniques for wound closure that avoid exposure and contamination of bone) in men with metastatic prostate cancer treated with zoledronic acid. The intervention seemed to lower the risk of MRONJ (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.39, 253 participants). Secondary outcomes were not evaluated. Dentoalveolar surgery is considered a common predisposing event for developing MRONJ and five RCTs tested various preventive measures to reduce the risk of postoperative MRONJ. The studies evaluated plasma rich in growth factors inserted into the postextraction alveolus in addition to standardised medical and surgical care versus standardised medical and surgical care alone (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.51, 176 participants); delicate surgery and closure by primary intention versus non-traumatic tooth avulsion and closure by secondary intention (no case of postoperative MRONJ in either group); primary closure of the extraction socket with a mucoperiosteal flap versus application of platelet-rich fibrin without primary wound closure (no case of postoperative MRONJ in either group); and subperiosteal wound closure versus epiperiosteal wound closure (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.56, 132 participants).

Treatment of MRONJ
Eight RCTs examined different interventions for the treatment of established MRONJ; that is, the effect on MRONJ cure rates. One RCT analysed hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment used in addition to standard care (antiseptic rinses, antibiotics, and surgery) compared with standard care alone (at last follow-up: RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.18, 46 participants). Healing rates from MRONJ were not significantly different between autofluorescence-guided bone surgery and conventional bone surgery (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37, 30 participants). Another RCT that compared autofluorescence- with tetracycline fluorescence-guided sequestrectomy for the surgical treatment of MRONJ found no significant difference (at one-year follow-up: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.30, 34 participants). Three RCTs investigated the effect of growth factors and autologous platelet concentrates on healing rates of MRONJ: platelet-rich fibrin after bone surgery versus surgery alone (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22, 47 participants), bone morphogenetic protein-2 together with platelet-rich fibrin versus platelet-rich fibrin alone (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.29, 55 participants), and concentrated growth factor and primary wound closure versus primary wound closure only (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.34, 28 participants). Two RCTs focused on pharmacological treatment with teriparatide: teriparatide 20 μg daily versus placebo in addition to standard care (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.95, 33 participants) and teriparatide 56.5 μg weekly versus teriparatide 20 μg daily in addition to standard care (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.44, 12 participants).

Authors Conclusions

Prophylaxis of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw
One open-label RCT provided some evidence that dental examinations at three-month intervals and preventive treatments may be more effective than standard care for reducing the incidence of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) in individuals taking intravenous bisphosphonates for advanced cancer. We assessed the certainty of the evidence to be very low.
There is insufficient evidence to either claim or refute a benefit of the interventions tested for prophylaxis of MRONJ in patients with antiresorptive therapy undergoing dentoalveolar surgery. Although some interventions suggested a potential large effect, the studies were underpowered to show statistical significance, and replication of the results in larger studies is pending.

Treatment of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw
The available evidence is insufficient to either claim or refute a benefit, in addition to standard care, of any of the interventions studied for the treatment of MRONJ.

Regarding surgical interventions for osteoradionecrosis of the jaw, more specifically with respect to indications for surgery (full-thickness osteoradionecrosis), ASCO/ISOO/MASCC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider reconstructing maxillectomy defects extending into the sinus (ClinRad stage III) with myocutaneous flaps or osteomyocutaneous flaps, recognizing that the latter allows for dental implantation if desired. Consider obturating the defect with a prosthetic appliance in patients who are poor candidates for microvascular surgery.

### Use of antibiotics in the treatment of mandible fractures: a systematic review [^116FP3WJ]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The use of prophylactic antibiotics in the treatment of mandible fractures is common practice. The evidence supporting this practice has not been formally assessed for quality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate this empirically.

Materials and Methods

Randomized and nonrandomized trials evaluating the possible impact of the prophylactic use of antibiotics in patients with mandible fractures were identified. Data were extracted on characteristics of studies and patients, including treatment, fracture location, time from injury to treatment, antibiotics used (type, route, dosage, duration), and complications (infection, malunion, reoperation). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were further evaluated for issues of reported methodological quality.

Results

There were 31 eligible studies (5,437 patients). Of these, 9 were prospective RCTs; the remaining 22 were retrospective case series. Information about the time between injury and definite treatment was provided by 10 studies (31%). The type of antibiotic used was not defined in 13 of 31 studies (42%). Half of the studies (15 of 31 [48%]) did not describe the route of administration and did not comment on the duration of the antibiotic course. The vast majority (23 of 31 [74%]) did not describe the dosage of the antibiotics used. Most of the RCTs were small, had not adequately described the mode of randomization, and did not present intention-to-treat analyses. None of them presented power calculations or ensured allocation concealment. There was not a single mention about number needed to treat. The amount and quality of the available data precluded formal quantitative synthesis, despite scattered signals that prophylactic antibiotics may be better than nothing in preventing infection.

Conclusion

The overall evidence to support the use of prophylactic antibiotics in mandible fractures is of poor quality. Large RCTs are needed to guide clinical practice.

To assess the effects of interventions versus no treatment, placebo, or an active control for the prophylaxis of MRONJ in people exposed to antiresorptive or antiangiogenic drugs. To assess the effects of non-surgical or surgical interventions (either singly or in combination) versus no treatment, placebo, or an active control for the treatment of people with manifest MRONJ.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 23 November 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2016, Issue 10), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 23 November 2016), and Embase Ovid (23 May 2016 to 23 November 2016). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on language or publication status when searching the electronic databases; however, the search of Embase was restricted to the last six months due to the Cochrane Embase Project to identify all clinical trials and add them to CENTRAL.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one modality of intervention with another for the prevention or treatment of MRONJ. For 'prophylaxis of MRONJ', the primary outcome of interest was the incidence of MRONJ; secondary outcomes were QoL, time-to-event, and rate of complications and side effects of the intervention. For 'treatment of established MRONJ', the primary outcome of interest was healing of MRONJ; secondary outcomes were QoL, recurrence, and rate of complications and side effects of the intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported the risk ratio (RR) (or rate ratio) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included five RCTs (1218 participants) in the review. Three trials focused on the prophylaxis of MRONJ. Two trials investigated options for the treatment of established MRONJ. The RCTs included only participants treated with bisphosphonates and, thus, did not cover the entire spectrum of medications associated with MRONJ. Prophylaxis of MRONJOne trial compared standard care with regular dental examinations in three-month intervals and preventive treatments (including antibiotics before dental extractions and the use of techniques for wound closure that avoid exposure and contamination of bone) in men with metastatic prostate cancer treated with zoledronic acid. The intervention seemed to lower the risk of MRONJ: RR 0.10; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.39 (253 participants; low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes were not evaluated. As dentoalveolar surgery is considered a common predisposing event for developing MRONJ, one trial investigated the effect of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) for preventing MRONJ in people with cancer undergoing dental extractions. There was insufficient evidence to support or refute a benefit of PRGF on MRONJ incidence when compared with standard treatment (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.51; 176 participants; very low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes were not reported. In another trial comparing wound closure by primary intention with wound closure by secondary intention after dental extractions in people treated with oral bisphosphonates (700 participants), no cases of intraoperative complications or postoperative MRONJ were observed. QoL was not investigated. Treatment of MRONJOne trial analysed hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment used in addition to standard care (antiseptic rinses, antibiotics, and surgery) compared with standard care alone. HBO in addition to standard care did not significantly improve healing from MRONJ compared with standard care alone (at last follow-up: RR 1.56; 95% CI 0.77 to 3.18; 46 participants included in the analysis; very low-quality evidence). QoL data were presented qualitatively as intragroup comparisons; hence, an effect estimate of treatment on QoL was not possible. Other secondary outcomes were not reported. The other RCT found no significant difference between autofluorescence- and tetracycline fluorescence-guided sequestrectomy for the surgical treatment of MRONJ at any timepoint (at one-year follow-up: RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.30; 34 participants included in the analysis; very low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylaxis of MRONJOne open-label RCT provided some evidence that dental examinations in three-month intervals and preventive treatments may be more effective than standard care for reducing the incidence of MRONJ in individuals taking intravenous bisphosphonates for advanced cancer. We assessed the certainty of the evidence to be low. There is insufficient evidence to either claim or refute a benefit of either of the interventions tested for prophylaxis of MRONJ (i.e. PRGF inserted into the postextraction alveolus during dental extractions, and wound closure by primary or secondary intention after dental extractions). Treatment of MRONJAvailable evidence is insufficient to either claim or refute a benefit for hyperbaric oxygen therapy as an adjunct to conventional therapy. There is also insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about autofluorescence-guided versus tetracycline fluorescence-guided bone surgery.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: imaging and clinical laboratory tests in the diagnosis and management of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw [^113rnPii]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). High credibility.

Imaging — treatment decisions in medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) emphasize that imaging is a critical tool for maxillofacial surgery planning, with computed tomography (CT) and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) used routinely to plan resection and reconstruction; imaging may show proximity to high-risk anatomical structures and, in such cases, the radiogram may guide a conservative treatment approach; 3D imaging may confirm a detached sequestrum and assist in estimating post-surgery fracture risk; and CT signs of periosteal reaction were correlated with lower rates of MRONJ healing and may assist with treatment decisions.

### Principles of pediatric mandibular fracture management [^111xHWPV]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Mandible fractures are commonplace in today's craniofacial practice; however, managing the infrequent, operative pediatric mandible injury requires a thorough knowledge base and thoughtful approach. Not only do these patients demonstrate variable anatomy due to differing stages of dental eruption, but condylar disruption may translate into long-term growth disturbance. In addition, patient immaturity often complicates cooperation, and both fixation strategies and postoperative planning must take this into account. As a supplement to the authors' video presentation, the present article focuses on repair of the symphyseal fracture and bilateral condylar injuries in the pediatric patient.

### Zygomatic arch fracture: a new classification and treatment algorithm with epidemiologic analysis [^114B4PCS]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Determining the optimal method for zygoma fracture reduction is a common challenge. Numerous methods for treating zygomatic arch fractures have been suggested. However, a substantial gap exists between suggested treatment strategies and real-world practice. A general consensus of classification and treatment guidelines for zygomatic arch reduction has not yet been established. We reviewed our cases and propose a new classification of zygomatic arch fracture and a treatment algorithm for successful reduction based on the injury vectors.

### Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: MASCC / ISOO / ASCO clinical practice guideline [^115e38jZ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) staging — A well-established staging system should be used to quantify disease and guide management, with options including the 2014 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons staging system, the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0, and the 2017 International Task Force on Osteonecrosis of the Jaw staging system for MRONJ; the same system should be used throughout the patient's MRONJ course of care, diagnostic imaging may be used as an adjunct, and optimally staging should be performed by a clinician experienced with MRONJ (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: weak).

### Prevention and management of osteoradionecrosis in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiation therapy: ISOO-MASCC-ASCO guideline [^115jco6Z]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for osteoradionecrosis of the jaw, more specifically with respect to dental care (invasive dental procedures), ASCO/ISOO/MASCC 2024 guidelines recommend to ensure a 2-week healing period between dental extraction and the initiation of radiotherapy, provided it does not compromise oncologic control by delaying the start of radiotherapy. Perform planned extractions before the fabrication of the immobilization mask to be worn during radiotherapy if they are likely to alter the vertical dimension of occlusion.

### Maxillofacial fractures resulting from falls [^114RWhvR]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to analyze maxillofacial fractures resulting from falls in terms of the demographics, the circumstance of injury, the site and severity of fracture, and the treatment.

Patients and Methods

Data of 457 patients treated for fall-related maxillofacial fractures at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Nara Medical University, Nara, Japan, from 1981 to 2007 were retrospectively analyzed.

Results

Patients were 163 males and 116 females with an average age of 51.3 years who had fallen on a level surface (simple fall), and 110 males and 68 females with an average age of 31.9 years in falls from a greater height (fall from height), respectively. Fractures of the mandible were more frequently observed than those of the midface. In the mandible, fracture lines were exclusively observed at the condyle, especially in simple falls. In the midface, the zygoma was most frequently involved. Facial Injury Severity Scale ranged from 1 to 6, with an average of 1.78 in simple falls, and from 1 to 9, with an average of 2.04 in falls from height, respectively. These were dependent on the causes and height of the fall. Fractures at the other sites of the body were found in 14 patients (5.0%) with simple falls and 38 (21.3%) with falls from height. Maxillomandibular fixation was most frequently chosen for mandibular fractures and observation for midface fractures. Open reduction and fixation was more frequently chosen in patients with falls from height than those with simple falls and in patients with a higher Facial Injury Severity Scale score.

Conclusions

Maxillofacial fractures resulting from falls showed characteristic features in the demographics, the circumstance of injury, and the site and severity of fracture. Treatment was chosen according to these features.

### Imaging of mandibular fractures: a pictorial review [^112c1hA8]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

If a fracture of the mandibular condyle does not meet the criteria above, patients can be treated with "closed reduction" for 2–3 weeks.

The mandibular fractures that usually require an "open" reduction are as follows:
Mandibular angle fractures, especially if bone fragments are misaligned (Fig. 22)
Atrophic toothless mandible, poor osteogenesis, or reduced healing potential
Complex maxillofacial fractures

Fig. 22
Bilateral angle fracture. a Panoramic radiograph shows fractures of both mandibular angles (arrows) involving the lower third molars. b After removing the lower left third molar, rigid internal fixations with osteosynthesis plates merge the bone segments

Assessment of mandibular fractures by imaging techniques is crucial for directing the patient towards surgical or conservative treatments.

### Management of mandible angle fractures with a right angle drill: description of technique [^112tbppG]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Management of mandible angle fractures can be challenging within the confines of the oral cavity where the use of linear instruments may result in structural weakness or malalignment secondary to improper placement. A right angle drill can facilitate a more ergonomic approach, with direct perpendicular placement of the instrument over the angle fracture. In addition, local soft tissue strain is minimized, and the need for a transcutaneous exposure can be avoided for additional plate placement. The right angle drill technique is simple, reproducible, and can be easily incorporated into routine mandible angle fracture management.

### Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: MASCC / ISOO / ASCO clinical practice guideline [^1113Xkjb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Clinical question 1 — diagnostic criteria — Clinicians should confirm the presence of all three of the following criteria to establish a diagnosis of MRONJ: (1) current or previous treatment with a BMA or antiangiogenic inhibitor, (2) exposed bone or bone that can be probed through an intraoral or extraoral fistula in the maxillofacial region and that has persisted for longer than 8 weeks, and (3) no history of radiation therapy to the jaws or metastatic disease to the jaws (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: weak).

### Variables related to surgical and nonsurgical treatment of zygomatic complex fracture [^112nqjN4]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this retrospective research was to establish the association between variables for the surgical treatment of zygomatic complex (ZC) fractures. In a 10-year period, 532 patients were examined for ZC fractures. The medical records of patients were analyzed to obtain information related to sociodemographic characteristics, trauma etiology, sign and symptoms of patients, and surgical or nonsurgical treatment. Statistical analysis was performed using χ test with statistical significance of P < 0.05. Most fractures were sustained by subjects between 21 and 40 years of age (55.8%), being principally men (80.1%), and 153 patients underwent surgery (28.8%). Surgical treatment of ZC fractures was statistically associated to the presence of other facial fractures (P = 0.004), alteration of occlusion (P = 0.0001; probably due to jaw fractures), presence of the comminuted fractures (P = 0.0002), and infraorbital nerve sensory disturbances (P = 0.003). A mixture of complex variables can be associated to surgical treatment; however, variables as comminuted fracture and alteration of occlusion were associated to surgical treatment indications.
