## Question

What is the role of TNF-alpha in the pathogenesis of Crohns disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of TNF-alpha in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental biology of TNF-alpha and its receptors. Then, I should verify the evidence that TNF-alpha is elevated in Crohn's disease and where it is produced. Next, I will examine the downstream pathogenic mechanisms, including epithelial barrier effects, immune cell activation, and granuloma formation. After that, I need to consider the paradoxical innate immune defects in TNF release and how they fit with adaptive overactivity. Finally, I will integrate therapeutic validation and synthesize a coherent model of TNF-alpha's role in Crohn's disease pathogenesis.

> Let me first confirm the basic biology so I don't jump to conclusions: TNF-alpha exists in soluble and transmembrane forms, signals through TNFR1 and TNFR2, and is produced by monocytes, macrophages, T cells, and stromal cells, with pleiotropic effects that include apoptosis, proliferation, and cytokine induction, which sets the stage for both homeostatic and pathogenic roles in the gut [^6589a47f] [^684c791a].

> Wait, let me verify the disease-specific evidence that TNF-alpha is actually elevated in Crohn's disease. Multiple sources show increased TNF-alpha in serum, stool, and especially the inflamed mucosa, and importantly, TNF-alpha mRNA and protein can remain elevated even in endoscopically normal-appearing tissue, suggesting a persistent pathogenic signal beyond visibly active disease, which aligns with the transmural and relapsing nature of Crohn's disease [^52cff35a] [^2a759fc7] [^6589a47f].

> I will now examine epithelial barrier effects, because I need to ensure I'm not overlooking structural damage. TNF-alpha drives increased intestinal permeability, induces enterocyte apoptosis, and impairs tight junctions, facilitating luminal antigen translocation and perpetuating inflammation; it also upregulates adhesion molecules and matrix metalloproteinases, promoting leukocyte trafficking and tissue remodeling that contribute to transmural injury and fibrosis [^6589a47f] [^f51b0a63].

> Next, I should review immune cell activation. TNF-alpha amplifies innate and adaptive responses by activating macrophages, promoting Th1 and Th17 differentiation, and sustaining effector T-cell survival, while also inducing other proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ, thereby creating a self-perpetuating inflammatory cascade in the mucosa [^6589a47f] [^70ae8469].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about granulomas without checking the mechanistic link. TNF-alpha is a key driver of granulomatous inflammation, and clinically effective anti-TNF agents that neutralize both soluble and membrane-bound TNF reduce granulomatous pathology, supporting a causal role for TNF in granuloma formation and maintenance in Crohn's disease [^6589a47f] [^c7e69f8d].

> But wait, what if there is a paradox here? I should double-check the innate immune defect data. Several studies show that Crohn's macrophages exhibit impaired TNF release in response to TLR stimulation, a defect not explained by common GWAS risk loci, suggesting a two-hit model wherein an initial innate immune defect permits bacterial persistence, followed by a compensatory adaptive immune response with excessive TNF production that drives chronic, granulomatous inflammation; this reconciles the apparent contradiction between defective TNF release and elevated TNF in tissue [^814c4644] [^f2a896bf].

> Let me consider genetic regulation to ensure I'm not missing upstream control. Transcriptional regulators such as LITAF are upregulated in Crohn's mucosa and correlate with TNF expression, and polymorphisms in TNF and TNF receptors have been associated with disease susceptibility and phenotype, indicating that genetic variation can modulate TNF pathway activity and contribute to heterogeneity in disease expression and treatment response [^7d60dd98] [^40f58838] [^5b0f6de2].

> I should confirm therapeutic validation because mechanism plus clinical effect strengthens causality. Anti-TNF agents consistently induce clinical remission, promote mucosal healing, reduce hospitalizations and surgeries, and are particularly effective for fistulizing disease, while combination with thiopurines improves pharmacokinetics and outcomes; importantly, agents that predominantly block soluble TNF, like etanercept, are ineffective in Crohn's disease, underscoring the pathogenic significance of membrane-bound TNF and transmembrane signaling in this disease [^52cff35a] [^7f6d1049] [^27aad41e] [^6589a47f].

> Let me synthesize a coherent model, but I need to ensure it integrates the paradox. In Crohn's disease, an innate immune defect in macrophage TNF release impairs bacterial clearance, allowing persistent antigen exposure that triggers a compensatory adaptive immune response with excessive TNF production; TNF then damages the epithelial barrier, amplifies proinflammatory cytokine networks, promotes granuloma formation, and sustains transmural inflammation, explaining the disease's chronicity, relapses, and response to TNF blockade [^6589a47f] [^814c4644] [^70ae8469].

> Finally, I should acknowledge nuances and exceptions so I don't overstate universality. TNF-alpha also has homeostatic roles in the gut, and resistance to anti-TNF therapy can emerge via alternative pathways such as IL-23–driven expansion of apoptosis-resistant T cells, which helps explain why not all patients respond and why mechanism-targeted alternatives like IL-12/23 blockade are effective in refractory cases [^f51b0a63] [^ad251fde].

TNF-α is a **key pro-inflammatory cytokine** in Crohn's disease, driving transmural inflammation, epithelial barrier dysfunction, and granuloma formation [^6589a47f] [^f51b0a63]. It is produced by macrophages, T cells, and stromal cells, and acts via TNFR1/2 to activate NF-κB and MAPK pathways, amplifying cytokine cascades and tissue damage [^6589a47f] [^3bf626a4]. TNF-α levels are elevated in serum, mucosa, and stool of patients with Crohn's disease and correlate with disease activity [^52cff35a] [^4b6ba805]. Anti-TNF therapy achieves clinical remission, mucosal healing, and reduced surgery, confirming its central pathogenic role [^52cff35a] [^7f6d1049] [^cc7c8c2e].

---

## Sources and regulation of TNF-α in Crohn's disease

- **Cellular sources**: Macrophages, T cells, and stromal cells are primary producers of TNF-α in the inflamed gut [^6589a47f].
- **Regulation**: TNF-α expression is controlled by transcription factors (e.g. NF-κB, LITAF) and is upregulated in inflamed mucosa [^7d60dd98] [^3bf626a4].
- **Forms**: Both soluble and membrane-bound TNF-α contribute to pathogenesis, with membrane-bound TNF-α implicated in granulomatous inflammation [^684c791a] [^6589a47f].

---

## Mechanisms of TNF-α-mediated inflammation

TNF-α exerts its effects through **multiple mechanisms**:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Epithelial barrier dysfunction | Induces apoptosis and increases permeability, promoting bacterial translocation [^6589a47f] [^f51b0a63] |
| Immune cell activation | Activates macrophages, T cells, and neutrophils, amplifying cytokine cascades (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8) [^6589a47f] [^70ae8469] |
| Granuloma formation | Promotes macrophage aggregation and granuloma development, a hallmark of Crohn's disease [^c7e69f8d] |
| Angiogenesis | Stimulates new vessel formation, supporting chronic inflammation [^6589a47f] |

---

## Evidence supporting TNF-α's role in Crohn's disease

- **Elevated levels**: TNF-α is increased in serum, mucosa, and stool of Crohn's patients and correlates with disease activity [^52cff35a] [^4b6ba805].
- **Clinical response**: Anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab) induce remission, promote mucosal healing, and reduce hospitalization and surgery [^52cff35a] [^7f6d1049] [^cc7c8c2e].
- **Resistance**: Alternative pathways (e.g. IL-23) can mediate anti-TNF resistance, underscoring TNF-α's centrality in many patients [^ad251fde].

---

## Clinical implications of TNF-α targeting

- **Therapeutic efficacy**: Anti-TNF therapy is a cornerstone for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, including fistulizing disease [^c85de9ea] [^5d81a9d0].
- **Limitations**: Primary nonresponse and loss of response occur in ~30–40%, often due to immunogenicity or alternative inflammatory pathways [^cca98437] [^ad251fde].
- **Personalized medicine**: Therapeutic drug monitoring and biomarker-guided strategies optimize outcomes [^03078d0b] [^3c004991].

---

TNF-α is a **central mediator** of inflammation in Crohn's disease, driving barrier breakdown, immune activation, and granuloma formation; its clinical importance is validated by the efficacy of anti-TNF therapy, though heterogeneity in response necessitates individualized management [^6589a47f] [^c85de9ea].

### Mechanisms of action of anti-tumor necrosis factor α agents in Crohn's disease [^27b1ed9e]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by inflammation that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. It is a chronic destructive condition that follows a relapsing-remitting course and can lead to disability and a poor quality of life. Lifelong pharmacotherapy with systemic immunomodulator therapies remains the cornerstone of CD management. Advances in understanding of the immunopathogenic mechanisms underlying chronic gut inflammation in CD have led to the development of effective biological therapies for patients with CD. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) is a potent proinflammatory cytokine that plays a pivotal role in the development of Crohn's inflammation. Therapies designed to target this cytokine have revolutionized treatment of CD since their introduction in the late 1990s, thanks to their ability to induce and maintain remission, heal mucosa, reduce hospital admissions and surgical procedures, and restore quality of life. Despite widespread use of these therapies in CD, their precise mechanism of action remains unclear, although several different mechanisms have been proposed. This review summarizes the biology of the TNF-α cytokine and the development of biological therapies targeting TNF-α, and updates our current understanding of mechanisms of action of the commercially available anti-TNF-α therapies used in the treatment of CD.

### Antitumour necrosis factor therapy in Crohn's disease [^03b1f244]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2002). Low credibility.

The key role and contribution of various pro-inflammatory cytokines in common chronic inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been thoroughly investigated in recent years. Besides IL-1, TNF-alpha has been identified as one of the central immune mediators controlling inflammatory processes. Not surprisingly, neutralisation of these cytokines has been introduced into clinical research. Crohn's disease (CD) is one of the chronic inflammatory disorders where TNF-alpha seems to have a particularly important role. Neutralisation of this cytokine by specific antibodies, for example infliximab, has been shown recently to affect the clinical phenotype of this disorder. Other TNF-neutralising approaches such as etanercept have also been studied in patients with CD but with less successful outcomes. These new cytokine-targeting approaches have changed clinical medicine in the field of inflammatory disorders.

### Biological response modifiers for the treatment of Crohn's disease [^f31c529a]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Although standard medical therapy in Crohn's disease is efficient in most patients, a substantial proportion of patients suffering from chronic active disease do not adequately respond to standard therapy. In these patients, alternative regimens have to be considered. Due to the major advances in understanding the pathogenesis of this complex disease involving genetic, environmental, microbial and immunological factors, various new biological therapies targeting key mechanisms have emerged. In this review, a critical appraisal of modern therapeutical concepts will be presented, focusing on antibody and small inhibitory molecule therapies, including inhibition of TNF-alpha and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules and T cell activation, as well as hormonal therapies.

### Crohn's disease: future anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies beyond infliximab [^d592014c]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The dramatic benefit experienced by many Crohn's disease patients treated with the anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antibody infliximab underscores the centrality of this cytokine in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and the potential use of the therapeutic strategy of blocking TNF-alpha in this disease. In the hopes of emulating and improving on the success of infliximab, numerous strategies are being devised and studied to inhibit the actions of TNF-alpha. This article focuses on those agents, other than infliximab, which target TNF-alpha to treat inflammatory bowel disease as their central mechanism of action.

### Early or late guided missile in the treatment of Crohn's disease? [^8150ffbd]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Over the last few years, much light has been shed on the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Further knowledge in this field has provided a firm basis not only in the understanding of current treatment but also for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Aim of these new agents is primarily to selectively interact with the key processes of intestinal inflammation. At present, only anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha antibodies namely infliximab, is licensed for clinical practice but it is feasible to foresee that, in the near future, a larger range of these agents will become available. Herein, the most promising biological agents in the treatment of Crohn's disease are outlined, which patients would benefit from these agents and when they should be administered. Attention is focused on the early (top-down) or late (step-up) use of biological agents, which for their very targeted mechanism of action may be compared to guided missiles. As yet, early use of biological agents remains to be supported by convincing evidence, nevertheless it may be advocated as first-line therapy for newly diagnosed severe Crohn's disease patients, both adults and children.

### Crohn's disease: beyond antagonists of tumour necrosis factor [^62479559]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

In the past few years, antagonists of tumour necrosis factor have resulted in unforetold therapeutic benefits in Crohn's disease, but the magnitude and duration of responses are variable. New agents are therefore needed. Their development has benefited from advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. Uncontrolled activation of the acquired immune system has an important role, and lymphocytes, cytokines, and adhesion molecules are broadly targeted for therapeutic intervention. With increasing evidence of an implication of the innate immune system and the intestinal epithelium, the therapeutic paradigm is also shifting from mere immunosuppression to the reinforcement of the intestinal barrier. We review mechanisms of actions of new drugs and the efficacy and adverse events from data from clinical trials. We discuss future directions, including new strategies with optimum endpoints.

### Overview of biologic therapy for Crohn's disease [^2ff9a528]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Therapy for Crohn's disease (CD) is evolving at breakneck speed. Biologic therapies are assuming ever more important roles in treating this unrelenting, life-long disorder. New evidence suggests that earlier, more aggressive use of biological therapies for CD may improve overall efficacy rates, as well as reduce long-term complications. In addition to optimizing the use of older biologic therapies (antibodies against TNF-alpha), recent and ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the clinical efficacy of a large number of other biologic therapies, honing in on a wide array of immunological targets. The promise of biologic therapies stems from their ability to induce complete and long-lasting remission of symptoms in a way that 'standard' therapies have not been able to accomplish. In this review of biologic therapies for CD, we examine the latest clinical trial data and evidence for mechanism of action of a variety of current and future therapies.

### Abstract… [^3d0b0d64]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Unlike ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease can involve the entire intestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus, with discontinuous focal ulceration, fistula formation and perianal involvement. The terminal ileum is most commonly affected, usually with variable degrees of colonic involvement. Subsets of patients have perianal disease with fissures and fistula formation. Only 2 to 3 percent of patients with Crohn's disease have clinically significant involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract. 4 The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is not known. A genetic predisposition has been suggested, and a host of environmental factors, including bacterial, viral and, perhaps, dietary antigens, can trigger an ongoing enteric inflammatory cascade. Although ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have multiple subtle immunologic differences, no test can yet reliably distinguish between them.

2 Approximately 5 to 15 percent of patients have "indeterminate" colitis, a diagnosis that is given when neither Crohn's disease nor ulcerative colitis can be reliably diagnosed based on clinical and pathologic features.
5. Antibiotics Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that bacterial flora play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Virtually all studies showing a benefit for antibiotic therapy have been performed in patients with Crohn's disease.
24. 39 infusion of the antitumor necrosis factor chimeric monoclonal antibody every four to six weeks resulted in a dramatic resolution of Crohn's disease. This treatment approach is currently being studied in the United States. The drug carries a risk of acute, potentially severe allergic reactions during the infusion. In addition, its long-term effects on the immune system are unknown.

Interleukin 10 and interleukin 11 are cytokines with immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory activities that, in preliminary studies, have been found to be of benefit in Crohn's disease. 40, 41 In one recent preliminary study, 42 tacrolimus, an immunosuppressant similar to cyclosporine but with better oral absorption, was shown to be beneficial in patients with complex proximal small-bowel Crohn's disease. Small-bowel cancer is rare in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. However, patients with Crohn's disease are at increased risk for this type of cancer. Screening for small-bowel cancer is neither feasible nor practical.

### Infliximab as disease-modifying therapy [^ca13d4f5]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Recent insights in the pathophysiology of Crohn's disease have revealed that tumour necrosis factor (TNF) plays a pivotal role in mucosal inflammation. Infliximab is a chimeric anti-TNF monoclonal antibody with potent anti-inflammatory effects, probably based on apoptosis of inflammatory cells. Numerous controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy in both active and fistulating Crohn's disease. Appropriate indications for using infliximab and growing experience with safety aspects have made this treatment a highly valuable tool in the management of Crohn's disease.

### Association between TNF inhibitor exposure and inflammatory CNS events… [^4b78d726]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

A, A patient with Crohn disease for 3 years who was treated with adalimumab for 10 years presented with a thoracic sensory band and lower-limb paresthesia. The patient had a cervical spine MRI that revealed multiple short-segment T2 hyperintense lesions with contrast enhancement. The diagnosis was central nervous system demyelination. In addition to a brain MRI scan showing leptomeningeal enhancement of the brainstem, an MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine also revealed patchy leptomeningeal enhancement of the spinal cord. Results of an infectious and neoplastic evaluation of the CSF were negative. A PET scan identified increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the mediastinum, and a biopsy of subcarinal lymph node confirmed granulomatous disease. A right frontal biopsy specimen demonstrated necrotizing granulomatous inflammation that extensively involved the leptomeninges. Special stains for microorganisms, including mycobacteria and fungi, had a negative result.

The diagnosis was neurosarcoidosis. F, A patient with a history of Crohn disease who was treated with infliximab for 3 years presented with myelopathic symptoms. A PET scan showed moderately intense FDG activity in the thoracic spinal cord. A thoracic cord biopsy demonstrated necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Special stains for microorganisms, including mycobacteria and fungi, had a negative result. The diagnosis was neurosarcoidosis. FLAIR indicates fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence. of demyelination with TNF inhibitors are clusters of inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune rheumatic disease in families with MS and case-control studies of inflammatory bowel disease that identified a higher frequency of MS among patients compared with control participants, which suggest a predisposition for developing inflammatory CNS events. 17–19 A study of data from.

Tumor necrosis factor is a cytokine with a range of functions, including induction of fever, defense against pathogens, inflammation, immune regulation, inhibition of tumor growth, stimulation of vascular endothelium, and proliferation of immune cells. 42 Proposed mechanisms for the paradoxical development of inflammatory CNS events in association with TNF inhibitor exposure include immune dysregulation from the inhibition of apoptosis of autoreactive T cells, which may then enter the CNS and cause demyelination. 43 TNF inhibition may result in upregulation of TNF expression.

### Targeting tumor necrosis factor-alpha in inflammatory bowel disease: why, how, and when? [^e7ecab84]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

A large proportion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease require more effective therapy, especially for the prevention of disease relapse. Recent therapeutic advances have focused on biologicals (monoclonal antibodies, therapeutic peptides, antisense oligonucleotides) that aim to neutralize specific proinflammatory proteins. This has proved successful for the anti-TNF-alpha antibody infliximab in patients with Crohn disease, but recent studies failed to demonstrate the efficacy of different anti-TNF-alpha strategies. Therefore, it seems essential to fully comprehend the molecular mechanisms of such compounds. An exciting development has been the association between drug efficacy and the induction of apoptosis in apoptosis-resistant lamina propria T cells in Crohn disease. Furthermore, TNF-alpha can also be targeted by "small molecules" to circumvent certain disadvantages of biologicals such as the nonoral route of administration, the potential immunogenicity, and the high costs of treatment. Several of these developments will certainly be relevant for designing future anti-TNF-alpha based strategies.

### Exploring the role of monitoring anti-TNF α drug and antibody levels in the management of inflammatory bowel disease [^bff27fb4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders which often result in significant morbidity or surgery. Current treatment options are not curative and may cause significant adverse effects. The introduction of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) therapy over a decade ago was a welcome addition to the therapeutic armamentarium and revolutionized the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite their relative success, a significant proportion of patients with IBD fail to respond or subsequently lose response anti-TNFα therapy. This review identifies and explores the role of drug levels and immunogenicity (antibody formation) on the efficacy of anti-TNFα therapy and details how monitoring these parameters may help to optimize the management of patients with IBD.

### Integrating anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: current and future perspectives [^76ea9592]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two idiopathic inflammatory disorders of the GI tract. Manifestations of disease can be severe and lead to long term therapy with a variety of medications and/or surgery. Standard medical therapy consists of agents that either treat suppurative complications or modulate the inflammatory cascade in a nonspecific manner. Many specific chemokine and cytokine effectors that promote intestinal inflammation have been identified. Such work has led to experimental clinical trials with a variety of cytokine antagonists. Compounds directed against one such cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), have demonstrated the greatest clinical efficacy to date. This is consistent with scientific observations that suggest a central role for TNF in the inflammatory cascade. Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF that has been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of Crohn's disease. Infliximab is Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of Crohn's disease. There exist several other TNF antagonists in various phases of investigation, including the monoclonal antibody CDP 571, the fusion peptide etanercept, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor oxpentifylline, and thalidomide. The clinical efficacy of these agents and the role of TNF in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is reviewed.

### Mode of function of biological anti-TNF agents in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases [^0555ce84]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

TNF-alpha has been identified as a major mediator in the pathophysiology of inflammation. Anti-TNF agents, either as a neutralising antibody or a soluble TNF receptor, have markedly influenced the clinical management of several chronic inflammatory disorders. Whereas it seems likely that neutralisation of soluble and membrane-bound TNF might be a key mechanism of any anti-TNF agent, the potential of the anti-TNF antibody infliximab to induce lymphocyte/monocyte apoptosis in Crohn's disease has been considered an additional important mechanism. Other potential mode of actions include induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 or TGF-beta via retrograde signalling or induction of a certain subset of regulatory T cells. Certolizumab, a pegylated fully human anti-TNF monoclonal antibody also effective in Crohn's disease, lacks the capacity to induce apoptosis. Therefore, the capacity to induce apoptosis and neutralisation of TNF alone are insufficient to explain clinical efficacy of anti-TNF agents in human inflammatory bowel diseases.

### Role of the tumor necrosis factor antagonists in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: an update [^f81a579a]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis represent the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent research points out the role of uncontrolled intestinal inflammation in the pathogenesis of IBD. Therefore, there is a growing interest in developing novel biologic therapies targeting specific molecules of the inflammatory cascade. Among them, anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents (i.e. infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol) have proved to be effective, particularly for patients with refractory IBD. These biological therapies have changed, at least partially, the clinical course and medical management of IBD. However, the administration of anti-TNF drugs has also been associated with serious side-effects, which have raised concerns on the application of these drugs in clinical practice. The goal of this review is to provide an update and analyze the pros and cons of using anti-TNF therapies in the treatment of IBD.

### Transcending conventional therapies: the role of biologic and other novel therapies [^7767e8de]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Biologic and other novel therapies targeted to specific pathogenic processes offer the potential for improved treatment outcomes in patients with Crohn's disease and alteration of the course of the disease. Therapies targeted to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) include anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibodies (infliximab and CDP-571), TNF-binding neutralizing fusion proteins (etanercept), and TNF-alpha production inhibitors (thalidomide). In placebo-controlled trials, infliximab has rapidly induced clinical response and remission in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease refractory to conventional therapy and patients with fistulizing Crohn's disease, with minimal toxicity; retreatment with infliximab in patients who experienced an initial response maintained their clinical improvement. Clinical experience suggests that infliximab may also be effective when administered as corticosteroid-sparing therapy. Infliximab is the only anti-TNF-alpha therapy currently available in clinical practice for the treatment of active Crohn's disease. Controlled trials of the investigational anti-TNF-alpha agent CDP-571 show benefit for induction of clinical improvement and steroid-sparing, but further investigation is needed. A pilot study of etanercept suggested a beneficial effect, but its efficacy was not confirmed in a controlled trial. In open-label trials, thalidomide has demonstrated efficacy in patients with refractory Crohn's disease; however, the therapeutic potential of thalidomide may be severely limited by the high incidence of drug-induced side effects. Other novel agents, including anti-alpha4 integrin antibodies, interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-11, and the immunomodulators tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil have been evaluated as treatment in patients with severely active or fistulizing Crohn's disease in open-label and controlled trials, with varied results reported to date. The development of these new therapies is an exciting advance that promises to improve the management of Crohn's disease and expand current knowledge of underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.

### Anti-TNF treatment in Crohn's disease: toward tailored therapy? [^4d455cfe]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Infliximab is a potent therapy for induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Unfortunately, many patients lose response and/or develop allergic reactions caused by the chimeric antibody. By means of measuring the presence of antibodies against infliximab and the trough levels of the drug, it seems easier to predict whether patients will respond to intensified dose regimens or will rather benefit from a switch to alternative agents.

### Tumor necrosis factor-α monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: clinical practice pharmacology [^f8df9be5]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

In the last 10 years, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α therapy has become a cornerstone in the management of autoimmune diseases. Clinical trial data have consistently found that infliximab, adalimumab, and recently certolizumab pegol offer therapeutic benefits to patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). Recent understanding on how these monoclonal antibodies evoke changes at the physiological and molecular levels have provided insights into disease pathogenesis and helped to identify new targets for future drug therapy. With increased experience in the use of these anti-TNF-α antibodies the long-term safety data, use in pregnancy have become available. This article provides an overview of the current knowledge regarding anti-TNF-α therapies for clinicians caring for patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

### A review of the therapeutic management of Crohn's disease [^896d8586]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The millenium and the dawn of a new (biological) era in IBD therapeutics

In 1985, Beutler et al. showed that the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), played a significant role in endotoxin-mediated shock. Keffer et al. subsequently demonstrated the role of TNF in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis in mice; but it was not until 1990 when MacDonald et al. found an increase in TNF concentration in tissue inflammation in rheumatoid synovial membranes and interestingly, in the mucosa and lamina propria of patients with CD that the prospect of anti-TNF therapy received attention. Elliot et al. conducted the first human trial for rheumatoid arthritis using a TNF-alpha-directed chimeric mouse/human monoclonal antibody, which was followed shortly after by the first human trial successfully using this drug in a small sample size of 10 CD patients. The advent of anti-TNF therapy and its ability to effectively induce and maintain remission while boasting of its corticosteroid-sparing effects, mucosal healing and reduced hospitalisation and surgery rates represent a defining moment in IBD therapeutics.

### Mechanisms of action of infliximab in inflammatory bowel disease: an anti-inflammatory multitasker [^34bf1e7a]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2008). Low credibility.

The pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a central role in mucosal inflammation and is a key mediator in the inflammatory cascade in both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha has been proved highly effective in the clinical management of both forms of IBD. Aim of this paper is to review the mechanisms of action of infliximab in IBD.

### The TNF ∆ ARE model of Crohn's disease-like ileitis [^41b25449]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) is one of the 2 main phenotypes of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs); CD ischaracterized by a discontinuous, spontaneously recurring, transmural immunopathology that largely affects the terminal ileum. Crohn's disease exhibits both a relapsing and progressive course, and its prevalence is on the rise globally, mirroring the trends of industrialization. While the precise pathogenesis of CD remains unknown, various factors including immune cell dysregulation, microbial dysbiosis, genetic susceptibility, and environmental factors have been implicated in disease etiology. Animal models, particularly ileitis mouse models, have provided valuable tools for studying the specific mechanisms underlying CD, allowing longitudinal assessment and sampling in interventional preclinical studies. Furthermore, animal models assess to evaluate the distinct role that bacterial and dietary antigens play in causing inflammation, using germ-free animals, involving the introduction of individual bacteria (monoassociation studies), and experimenting with well-defined dietary components. An ideal animal model for studying IBD, specifically CD, should exhibit an inherent intestinal condition that arises spontaneously and closely mimics the distinct transmural inflammation observed in the human disease, particularly in the terminal ileum. We have recently characterized the impact of disease-relevant, noninfectious microbiota and specific bacteria in a mouse model that replicates CD-like ileitis, capturing the intricate nature of human CD, namely the TNF∆ARE mouse model. Using germ-free mice, we studied the impact of different diets on the expansion of disease-relevant pathobionts and on the severity of inflammation. In this review article, we review some of the currently available ileitis mouse models and discuss in detail the TNF∆ARE model of CD-like Ileitis.

Introduction

TNF-α is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine exerting pleiotropic effects on various cell types and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as RA. Accumulating evidence suggests that not only soluble TNF-α, but also its precursor form, transmembrane TNF-α, is involved in the inflammatory response. Transmembrane TNF-α exerts its biological function in a cell-to-cell contact fashion, which is distinct from the feature of soluble TNF-α, which acts at sites remote from the TNF-α-producing cells. In transgenic mice, transmembrane TNF-α was shown to be sufficient to induce arthritis with synovial hyperplasia and inflammation.

Transmembrane TNF-α acts as a ligand by binding to TNF-α receptors as well as functioning as a receptor that transmits outside-to-inside (reverse) signals back into the transmembrane TNF-α-bearing cells (TNF-α-producing cells). It is therefore considered that transmembrane TNF-α plays a critical role in local inflammation. Anti-TNF agents have been successfully introduced for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. However, clinical features against granulomatous inflammation are not similar among these agents. For example, all the anti-TNF agents are effective against RA, but not all of them against Crohn's disease. The binding and neutralizing activities against soluble TNF-α are the critical and common mechanisms of action of these anti-TNF-agents. On the other hand, recent studies have shown that these agents have differential effects against transmembrane TNF-α and TNF-α-producing cells. In the light of a growing body of evidence for the involvement of transmembrane TNF-α in inflammation, such as granulomatous inflammation, it would be important to summarize the biology of transmembrane TNF-α in health and disease as well as its interaction with anti-TNF agents. We would like to review the following issues: (i) biological function of transmembrane TNF-α as a ligand, (ii) biological function of transmembrane TNF-α as a receptor and (iii) different effects of anti-TNF agents on transmembrane TNF-α-bearing cells (TNF-α-producing cells) that would help to understand the different clinical effects of the anti-TNF agents.

### Tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists for treatment of pediatric Crohn's disease [^f735fbfe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The incidence of pediatric Crohn's disease has been steadily increasing. In this population, the disease often presents with more extensive inflammation, a tendency toward a more aggressive course, and frequently requires early immunomodulation. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies work by neutralizing pro-inflammatory effectors, thus interrupting the inflammatory cascade. There is broad consensus that biologics are effective in achieving mucosal healing in Crohn's disease. Despite this, several important questions about anti-TNF therapy in children and adolescents remain unanswered. These include determining the optimal dosing regimen for both safety and durability, identifying the ideal timing for initiating anti-TNF treatment before irreversible bowel damage occurs, and deciding whether to use a top-down or step-up approach tailored to the individual patient's disease location, behavior, and other predictors of complicated outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of TNF-alpha antagonists for induction of remission in children and adolescents with active Crohn's disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database) (BIREME), and Science Citation Index Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (Web of Science). We applied no language or document type restrictions. The last update of evidence was on 1 June 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of publication type, publication status, and language, assessing the benefits and harms of TNF-alpha antagonist for induction of remission treatment for pediatric Crohn's disease.

Outcomes

Our critical outcomes were induction of clinical remission and incidence of serious adverse effects. Important outcomes were all-cause mortality and morbidity related to Crohn's disease, endoscopic remission, incidence of steroid withdrawal, proportion of participants in need of surgical intervention, loss of response to anti-TNF, and incidence of mild adverse events.

Risk Of Bias

We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's RoB 1 tool. The only included trial was at overall high risk of bias.

Synthesis Methods

We used standard Cochrane methodology to perform this systematic review. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence per outcome.

Included Studies

Only one study fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The study was an open-label, multicenter RCT conducted in 12 hospitals in three European countries, and included 100 children (51 boys and 49 girls) newly diagnosed with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease with a 52-week follow-up. Children were randomly assigned to first-line infiximab (FL-IFX) (n = 50) or conventional treatment (n = 50). The trial was at overall high risk of bias.

Synthesis Of Results

Clinical remission was achieved by 59% (24/41) in the FL-IFX group versus 34% (15/44) in the conventional-treatment group, therefore favoring FL-IFX (risk ratio [RR] 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06 to 2.79; low certainty evidence). Endoscopic remission was achieved by 59% (16/27) in the FL-IFX group versus 17% (5/30) in the conventional-treatment group, therefore favoring FL-IFX (RR 3.56, 95% CI 1.51 to 8.39; low certainty evidence). The included study did not assess all-cause morbidity or mortality related to Crohn's disease or incidence of serious or mild adverse events. No funding information was provided. This study is part of the TISKid study, which is in development and includes the same population with a planned follow-up of five years.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence to support the use of anti-TNF therapy for induction of remission in pediatric Crohn's disease. Only one randomized clinical trial at high risk of bias suggests that FL-IFX may result in a slight increase in induction of clinical remission and endoscopic remission when compared to conventional treatment. The results of this trial need to be interpreted with caution. Several important questions remain regarding the optimal timing of anti-TNF therapy, the preference between step-up versus top-down strategies, and other related issues. Further RCTs are needed to achieve stronger evidence, address these questions, and provide clearer guidance. There is a need for larger randomized clinical trials following the SPIRIT and CONSORT statements, assessing the benefits and harms of using anti-TNF versus conventional therapy for pediatric Crohn's disease induction treatment.

Funding

This Cochrane review had no dedicated funding.

### The many faces of tumor necrosis factor signaling in the intestinal epithelium [^f51b0a63]. Genes and Immunity (2019). Medium credibility.

The intestinal epithelium represents an exquisite complex combination of specialized cellular components, structural organization, as well as fine-tuned maintenance and renewal mechanisms that ensure its barrier and absorptive function. Defects in one or more of these components can lead to devastating consequences for the organisms, and when chronic, even develop into inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. In these scenarios, the cytokine TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor α) appears to be a major inflammation-promoting and tissue damage-promoting effector molecule. Besides its role in inflammation and cell death, TNF presents a wide range of pleiotropic activities with implications in various cellular processes, including proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, more recent evidences suggest an anti-inflammatory role of TNF, mostly via the induction of local glucocorticoids synthesis in the intestinal epithelium. Thus, the outcome of TNF receptor signaling largely depends on various factors, like the TNFR composition and the precise cellular context or tissue type, which will determine the cellular fate. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms and their potential crosstalk that regulate the different TNF-initiated cellular outcomes in the intestine, as well as possible applications for pharmacological interventions in the treatment of inflammatory disorders of the intestinal mucosa.

### Cytokines in inflammatory bowel disease [^70ae8469]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Cytokines have a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, where they control multiple aspects of the inflammatory response. In particular, the imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines that occurs in IBD impedes the resolution of inflammation and instead leads to disease perpetuation and tissue destruction. Recent studies suggest the existence of a network of regulatory cytokines that has important implications for disease progression. In this Review, we discuss the role of cytokines produced by innate and adaptive immune cells, as well as their relevance to the future therapy of IBD.

### Tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease [^7f6d1049]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease may be refractory to conventional treatments including corticosteroids and immunosuppressives. Recent studies suggest TNF-alpha blocking agents may be effective in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review of the evidence for the effectiveness of TNF-alpha blocking agents in the maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register were searched for relevant studies published between 1966–2007. Manual searches of references from potentially relevant papers were performed to identify additional studies. Experts in the field and study authors were contacted to identify unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials involving patients > 18 years with Crohn's disease who had a clinical response or clinical remission with a TNF-alpha blocking agent, or patients with Crohn's disease in remission but unable to wean corticosteroids, who were then randomized to maintenance of remission with a TNF-alpha blocking agent or placebo

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent authors performed data extraction and assessment of the methodological quality of each trial. Outcome measures reported in the primary studies included clinical remission, clinical response, and steroid-sparing effects.

Main Results

Nine studies met all inclusion criteria. Four different anti-TNF-alpha agents were evaluated (infliximab in 3 studies, CDP571 in 3 studies, adalimumab in 2 studies, and certolizumab in 1 study). There is evidence from three randomized controlled trials that infliximab maintains clinical remission (RR 2.50; 95% CI 1.64 to 3.80), maintains clinical response (RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.00 to 2.76), has corticosteroid-sparing effects (RR 3.13; 95% CI 1.25 to 7.81), and maintains fistula healing (RR 1.87; 95% CI 1.15 to 3.04) in patients with Crohn's disease with a response to infliximab induction therapy. There were no significant differences in remission rates between infliximab doses of 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg. There is evidence from two randomized controlled trials that adalimumab maintains clinical remission (RR 2.86; 95% CI 2.01 to 4.02), maintains clinical response (RR 2.69; 95% CI 1.88 to 3.86), and has corticosteroid-sparing effects (RR 2.81, 95% CI 1.46 to 5.43) in patients with Crohn's disease who have responded or entered remission with adalimumab induction therapy. There were no significant differences in remission rates between adalimumab 40 mg weekly or every other week. There is evidence from one randomized controlled trial that certolizumab pegol maintains clinical remission (RR 1.68; 95% CI 1.30 to 2.16) and maintains clinical response (RR 1.74; 95% CI 1.41 to 2.13) in patients who have responded to certolizumab induction therapy. There is no evidence to support the use of CDP571 for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.

Authors' Conclusions

Infliximab 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg, given every 8 weeks, is effective for the maintenance of remission and maintenance of fistula healing in patients who have responded to infliximab induction therapy. Adalimumab 40 mg weekly or every other week is effective for the maintenance of remission in patients who have responded to adalimumab induction therapy. Certolizumab pegol 400 mg every 4 weeks is effective for the maintenance of remission in patients who have responded to certolizumab induction therapy. No comparative trials have evaluated the relative efficacy of these agents. Adverse events are similar in the infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab groups compared with placebo, but study size and duration generally are insufficient to allow an adequate assessment of serious adverse events associated with long-term use.

### Adalimumab for induction of remission in Crohn's disease [^ff516c53]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Adalimumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets and blocks tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). A significant proportion of people with CD fail conventional therapy or therapy with biologics or develop significant adverse events. Adalimumab may be an effective alternative for these individuals.

Objectives

The objectives of this review were to assess the efficacy and safety of adalimumab for the induction of remission in CD.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, ClinicalTrials. Gov and the World Health Organization trial registry (ICTRP) from inception to 16 April 2019. References and conference abstracts were searched to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any dose of adalimumab to placebo or an active comparator in participants with active CD were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. The primary outcome was the failure to achieve clinical remission, as defined by the original studies. Clinical remission was defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of less than 150 points. Secondary outcomes included failure to achieve clinical response (defined as a decrease in CDAI of > 100 points or > 70 points from baseline), failure to achieve endoscopic remission and response, failure to achieve histological remission and response, failure to achieve steroid withdrawal, adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), withdrawal from study due to AEs and quality of life measured by a validated instrument. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes. Data were pooled for analysis if the participants, interventions, outcomes and time frame were similar. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

Three placebo-controlled RCTs (714 adult participants) were included. The participants had moderate to severely active CD (CDAI 220 to 450). Two studies were rated as at low risk of bias and one study was rated as at unclear risk of bias. Seventy-six per cent (342/451) of adalimumab participants failed to achieve clinical remission at four weeks compared to 91% (240/263) of placebo participants (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.90; high-certainty evidence). Forty-four per cent (197/451) of adalimumab participants compared to 66% (173/263) of placebo participants failed to achieve a 70-point clinical response at four weeks (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.79; high-certainty evidence). At four weeks, 57% (257/451) of adalimumab participants failed to achieve a 100-point clinical response compared to 76% (199/263) of placebo participants (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.86; high-certainty evidence). Sixty-two per cent (165/268) of adalimumab participants experienced an AE compared to 72% (188/263) of participants in the placebo group (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.09; moderate-certainty evidence). Two percent (6/268) of adalimumab participants experienced a SAE compared to 5% (13/263) of participants in the placebo group (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.15; low-certainty evidence). Lastly, 1% (3/268) of adalimumab participants withdrew due to AEs compared to 3% (8/268) of participants in the placebo group (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.30; low-certainty evidence). Commonly reported adverse events included injection site reactions, abdominal pain, fatigue, worsening CD and nausea. Quality of life data did not allow for meta-analysis. Three studies reported better quality of life at four weeks with adalimumab (measured with either Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire or Short-Form 36; moderate-certainty evidence). Endoscopic remission and response, histologic remission and response, and steroid withdrawal were not reported in the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

High-certainty evidence suggests that adalimumab is superior to placebo for induction of clinical remission and clinical response in people with moderate to severely active CD. Although the rates of AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to AEs were lower in adalimumab participants compared to placebo, we are uncertain about the effect of adalimumab on AEs due to the low number of events. Therefore, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the safety of adalimumab in CD. Futher studies are required to look at the long-term effectiveness and safety of using adalimumab in participants with CD.

### Proinflammatory cytokines underlying the inflammation of Crohn's disease [^0f4d2e12]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To encapsulate our current understanding of the proinflammatory cytokines responsible for the inflammation underlying Crohn's disease and the prospect of using this information to devise therapy for this condition based on inhibition of these cytokines.

Recent Findings

Current research is shedding new light on the role of both T helper cell (Th)1 and Th17 responses in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Initial studies conducted a decade ago highlighted the view that Crohn's disease inflammation is caused by an interleukin-12-driven Th1 response, which resulted in the generation of interferon-gamma, which then served as the main inflammatory mediator. In recent years, however, this view has been largely eclipsed by studies, conducted mainly in murine models, showing that a Th17 response is the main cause of Crohn's disease inflammation through the production of interleukin-17. Now, a somewhat more balanced view is emerging, which holds that interferon-gamma is still a major proinflammatory cytokine in Crohn's disease, although it may arise from both the Th1 and Th17-mediated responses at different phases of the inflammatory process.

Summary

The new findings continue to support the idea that anti-interleukin-12p40, an antibody that inhibits both the Th1 and Th17 response, is logically the most potent anticytokine for the treatment of Crohn's disease.

### Management of Crohn's disease [^59b7e144]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The management of paediatric CD has evolved significantly over recent years with evidence-based guidelines now in place to assist day-to-day practice. Novel tools for personalised IBD management (drug metabolites, anti-TNF antibodies, stool inflammatory markers) provide a better understanding of the patients' disease status. The pathophysiology of CD remains relatively poorly understood, but advances in molecular technologies are likely to facilitate a deeper understanding of pathways involved in IBD pathogenesis, and will hopefully reveal novel disease biomarkers and treatment strategies.

### Inflammatory molecules: a target for treatment of systemic autoimmune diseases [^023446b7]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Inflammation is a process to protect the host against infection and danger signals. However, many pathologic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, are sustained by perpetual activation of the inflammatory process. In the past few years our knowledge about the molecular basis of inflammation have been uncovered and now much is known about the primary role of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF. In the early '90s, anti-cytokine therapies started and confirmed the primary role of TNF in autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's Disease and psoriasis. Increasing understanding of the role of inflammatory mediators in inflammation and diseases is opening new avenues for the treatment of inflammatory-based diseases through selective targeting of cytokines and lipid mediators.

### Functional rare variants influence the clinical response to anti-TNF therapy in Crohn's disease [^5ddde787]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we report evidence that functional low-frequency variation is associated with the response to anti-TNF therapy in CD. These findings also provide new insights into the underlying heterogeneity of CD, revealing the basis of TNF-dependent biological mechanisms. The identification of this diversity at the molecular level will be essential to allow the stratification of patients, and, ultimately, help clinicians choose the most appropriate drug.

### Update on anti-tumor necrosis factor agents in Crohn disease [^93b5eec2]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) agents, including infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol, are effective medications for the management of moderate to severe Crohn disease (CD). They are effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission, inducing mucosal healing, improving quality of life, and reducing the risk of hospitalization and surgery in adult and pediatric patients with CD. Future research into comparative effectiveness of different agents, as well as better understanding of predictors of response, is warranted to allow optimization of therapeutic response.

### Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in inflammatory bowel disease: the story continues [^6589a47f]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Role of TNF in IBD

TNF is a 17 kDa soluble cytokine that is secreted predominantly by monocytes and can exert potent proinflammatory effects on a number of different cell types. It plays an important role in intestinal homeostasis (reviewed in detailand references therein) and is involved in multiple physiological processes, including regulation of epithelial cell shedding during renewal of the intestinal epithelium, maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity, wound healing and mucosal repair. Conversely to its function in gut health, TNF also plays a pivotal role in the development and perpetuation of IBD, as illustrated by the clinical benefits associated with TNF inhibition.

The role of TNF in the pathogenesis of IBD has been reviewed previously in detail. In brief, both soluble and membrane-bound TNF, along with other proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-18, are produced by a variety of stromal and immune cells within the inflamed mucosa. Non-immune cells also produce proinflammatory cytokines; for example, members of the IL-1 cytokine family, including IL-18, are produced by intestinal epithelial cells, while TNF and IL-6 are produced by stromal fibroblasts. Through its receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, TNF exerts pleiotropic proinflammatory effects, including angiogenesis, induction of Paneth cell death, production of matrix metalloproteases, and activation of macrophages and effector T cells. Experiments in mice have demonstrated that membrane-bound, rather than soluble, TNF may play a significant role in intestinal inflammation. Consistent with this, clinically effective antibodies such as infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab pegol that neutralize both soluble and membrane-bound forms of TNF - have been shown to induce mainly CD4+ T-cell apoptosis in vivo. These inhibitors have also been shown to specifically affect CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, by promoting and maintaining an anti-inflammatory IL-10+ phenotype and delaying CD4+ T-cell activation, maturation and proliferation. - In addition, infliximab and adalimumab, but not certolizumab, have been shown to induce wound-healing macrophages in vitro and in vivo via an Fc-receptor-mediated mechanism. In contrast, etanercept, which predominantly blocks soluble TNF, has been shown to have no therapeutic effect in IBD when used at doses that have been approved for the treatment of other autoimmune diseases.

### Tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonism improves endothelial dysfunction in patients with Crohn's disease [^809114e2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

This study assessed the presence of endothelial dysfunction in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and evaluated the possible role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in the pathophysiology of this abnormality. Similar elevations in circulating markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein and interleukin-6) were observed in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis compared to controls. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine was impaired in Crohn's disease, but not in ulcerative colitis. Endothelium-independent vasodilation to sodium nitroprusside, by contrast, was not different among the three groups. The TNF-alpha neutralizing antibody, infliximab, enhanced the responsiveness to acetylcholine, but not to nitroprusside, in Crohn's disease, without modifying vascular responses to both drugs in ulcerative colitis. In conclusion, despite comparable degrees of systemic inflammation in the two IBDs, endothelial dysfunction is a selective feature of Crohn's disease and is beneficially affected by intravascular TNF-alpha neutralization. These findings underscore the role of selective cytokine targeting in improving endothelial function in patients with Crohn's disease.

### Adalimumab for the treatment of Crohn's disease [^0706d8c4]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

The advent of biologic therapy for Crohn's disease has revolutionized our approach to disease management and redefined our goals. Infliximab (Remicade), an intravenously delivered murine-chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha was released in 1998 and shown to have significant benefits in patients with refractory luminal and fistulizing Crohn's disease. Since then other anti-TNF strategies have undergone investigation with variable results. Adalimumab (Humira), a self administered, subcutaneous, fully human monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha represents the next generation of therapy. It has demonstrated efficacy for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's in three large double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials. In addition it has demonstrated steroid-sparing properties and the ability to reduce hospitalizations and improve quality of life. It is anticipated, given its clinical efficacy, its fully human nature, and the convenience of self administration that it will have a significant effect on the management of Crohn's disease.

### Defective tumor necrosis factor release from Crohn's disease macrophages in response to toll-like receptor activation: relationship to phenotype and genome-wide association susceptibility loci [^814c4644]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

We present evidence demonstrating that macrophages from CD patients have attenuated TNF release downstream of multiple TLRs. This defect was evident in all three major CD phenotypes, and was not related to use of 5-ASA medication or previous bowel inflammation. The age and gender of the patient also had no effect on the levels of TNF released. The majority of susceptibility loci that have been identified by large-scale GWAS failed to demonstrate an influence on TNF release from macrophages after TLR activation. These results build on the growing body of work supporting a defective innate immune response in CD, but highlight our lack of mechanistic insight into the cause of this abnormality. The lack of association between impaired TNF release and GWAS risk alleles also reveals that while both coexist in CD, they are likely independent. Individuals who are more likely to develop CD may have inherent susceptibility plus a weak innate immune response.

CD is a complex disease comprising multiple stages and phenotypes. We recently demonstrated that CD patients clear bacteria less rapidly than control individuals, which was associated with delayed recruitment of neutrophils and defective macrophage function. This led us to propose a "three-stage" model for CD pathogenesis — where mucosal damage and penetration of bacteria and other particulate matter from the bowel wall is followed by an impaired macrophage response and incomplete bacterial clearance. Subsequently, a compensatory adaptive immunological response develops, associated with chronic, granulomatous inflammation and an elevation in proinflammatory cytokines that is characteristic of the "active" phase of CD. Our findings here of defective TNF release by CD macrophages in response to TLR agonists is consistent with this model, given the prominent role of TNF in the acute inflammatory response, upregulation of vascular cellular adhesion molecules, and resultant recruitment of neutrophils.

### 25 years of anti-TNF treatment for inflammatory bowel disease: lessons from the past and a look to the future [^817c4b2f]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies have been widely used for approximately 25 years now. The first clinical observations in patients with refractory Crohn's disease rapidly responding to infliximab prompted accelerated clinical development and approval for this indication. However, many questions remained unanswered when this treatment came to market related to maintenance schedules, pharmacokinetics, toxicity and positioning. Many of these open questions were addressed by investigators and sponsors during more than two decades of clinical use. The authors were among the first to use infliximab in Crohn's disease and felt that now is a good time to look back and draw lessons from the remarkable anti-TNF story. Even today, new insights continue to appear. But more importantly, what was learnt in the past 25 years has created a platform for future development of even stronger and safer therapies. We should not forget to learn from the past.

### New cytokine therapeutics for inflammatory bowel disease [^d6670898]. Cytokine (2004). Low credibility.

Conventional therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases rely on corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylates combined with immunosuppressive agents for maintenance. These drugs are not always effective and may inflict serious side effects. Other therapies are therefore awaited. Infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha has been successfully applied as a treatment for Crohn's disease. The mechanism of action of this drug extends beyond the level of TNF-alpha scavenging and includes induction of apoptosis of effector cells. Numerous anti-TNF antibodies have been developed and are currently evaluated in clinical trials. Other targets for monoclonal antibodies include integrins and cytokines involved in T-cell differentiation and activation. Likewise recombinant proteins that moderate TNF bioactivity and lymphocyte function have been developed. The therapeutic effect of recombinant interleukin-10 seems to be dependent on local delivery of the protein. Antisense therapy targeting lymphocyte migration has also been tested in IBD. Finally, the conventional drug thalidomide and possibly MAP-kinase inhibitors may become novel treatment entities for IBD.

### Tumor necrosis factor receptor gene polymorphisms in Crohn's disease: association with clinical phenotypes [^40f58838]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic multifactorial disorder with diverse clinical features that are influenced by a heterogeneous set of genetic factors. TNF-alpha/TNF receptor interactions play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory response. Our purpose was to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TNF receptors confer susceptibility to Crohn's disease and whether they are associated with clinical phenotype.

Methods

A cohort of 205 consecutively identified and unrelated patients with CD and 106 controls were recruited. Subjects were genotyped for polymorphisms in TNFRSF1A (position +36, -609), TNFRSF1B (+196, +1466), along with the three common CARD15 variants and phenotyped for disease behavior. Genotypic and allelic frequencies were compared between CD and controls and a logistic regression model was constructed to determine independent associations with specific clinical phenotypes.

Results

Only the TNFRSF1A +36 and TNFRSF1B +196 SNPs were associated with CD (p = 0.0019 and 0.034, respectively). The TNFRSF1A +36 mutation was negatively associated with stricturing disease phenotype (OR = 0.384; CI = 0.166–0.887). In contrast, the TNFRSF1B +196 was negatively associated with colitis (OR = 0.410; CI = 0.191–0.880). These associations were independent of CARD15 mutation status. Finally, TNFRSF1B +196 was negatively associated with surgery in CARD15 negative patients.

Conclusions

These data constitute the first report of an association of TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B polymorphisms with CD in a Caucasian population and address the role of TNFR mutations in determining clinical heterogeneity in CD.

### Infliximab for medical induction of remission in Crohn's disease [^52cff35a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralises tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which is present in high levels in the blood serum, mucosa and stool of people with Crohn's disease.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of infliximab alone or in combination with another agent for induction of remission in Crohn's disease compared to placebo or active medical therapies.

Search Methods

On 31 August 2021 and 4 March 2023, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization ICTRP.

Selection Criteria

Randomised control trials (RCTs) comparing infliximab alone or in combination with another agent to placebo or another active comparator in adults with active Crohn's disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently selected studies and conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We expressed outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Our primary outcomes were clinical remission, clinical response and withdrawals due to adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were endoscopic remission, histological remission, endoscopic response, and serious and total adverse events.

Main Results

The search identified 10 RCTs with 1101 participants. They were conducted between 1999 and 2019, and 7/10 RCTs included biologically naive participants. All but one RCT, which did not provide information, were multicentre and funded by pharmaceutical companies, and their authors declared conflicts. The age of the participants ranged from 26 to 65 years. Results were based on one study unless otherwise stated. Infliximab 5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg may be more effective than placebo at week four for clinical remission (30/55 versus 3/25; RR 4.55, 95% CI 1.53 to 13.50; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3) and response (36/55 versus 4/25; RR 4.09, 95% CI 1.63 to 10.25, NNTB 3). The evidence was low certainty. The study did not report withdrawals due to adverse events. We could not draw conclusions on the effects of infliximab 5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg compared to placebo for fistulating participants for clinical remission (29/63 versus 4/31; RR 3.57, 95% CI 1.38 to 9.25; NNTB 4), response (48/106 versus 15/75; RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.41; NNTB 6; 2 studies) or withdrawals due to adverse events (2/63 versus 0/31; RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.12 to 50.54). The evidence was very low certainty. Infliximab used in combination with purine analogues is probably more effective than purine analogues alone for clinical remission at weeks 24 to 26 (182/301 versus 95/302; RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.59 to 2.32, NNTB 4; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and clinical response at week 26 (107/177 versus 66/178; RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.05; NNTB 5; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events at week 26 (62/302 versus 53/301; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.21; 4 studies; low-certainty evidence). Infliximab alone may be more effective than purine analogues alone at week 26 for clinical remission (85/177 versus 57/178; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.95; NNTB 7; 2 studies) and response (94/177 versus 66/178; RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.82; NNTB 7; 2 studies). There may be little or no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (30/177 versus 43/178; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.06; 4 studies). The evidence was low certainty. We could not draw any conclusions on the effects of infliximab 5 mg/kg compared to 10 mg/kg for clinical remission (19/27 versus 11/28; RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.02) and response (22/27 versus 24/28; RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.46). The evidence was very low certainty. Withdrawals due to adverse events were not reported. We could not draw any conclusions on the effects of infliximab 5 mg/kg compared to 10 mg/kg in an exclusively fistulating population for clinical remission (17/31 versus 12/32; RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.53), response (21/31 versus 18/32; RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.78), or withdrawals due to adverse events (1/31 versus 1/32; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.79). The evidence was very low certainty. We could not draw any conclusions on the effects of infliximab 5 mg/kg compared to 20 mg/kg for clinical remission (19/27 versus 11/28; RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.02) or response (22/27 versus 18/28; RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.76). The evidence was very low certainty. Withdrawals due to adverse events were not reported. We could not draw any conclusions on the effects of infliximab 10 mg/kg compared to 20 mg/kg for clinical remission (11/28 versus 11/28; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.92) or response (14/28 versus 18/28; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.23). The evidence was very low certainty. Withdrawals due to adverse events were not reported. There may be little or no difference between infliximab and a CT-P13 biosimilar at week six for clinical remission (47/109 versus 49/111; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.32), response (67/109 versus 70/111; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.20) and withdrawals due to adverse events (21/109 versus 17/111; RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.25). The evidence was low certainty.

Authors' Conclusions

Infliximab in combination with purine analogues is probably more effective than purine analogues alone in inducing clinical remission and clinical response. Infliximab alone may be more effective in inducing clinical remission and response than purine analogues alone or placebo. Infliximab may be similar in efficacy to a CT-P13 biosimilar and there may be little or no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions as to whether infliximab alone is effective when used for exclusively fistulating populations. There was evidence that there may be little or no difference in withdrawal due to adverse events between infliximab plus purines compared with purines alone, as well as infliximab alone compared with purines alone. Meaningful conclusions cannot be drawn on all other outcomes related to adverse events due to very low certainty evidence.

### Current therapeutic recommendations: infliximab for ulcerative colitis [^a1286536]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Randomized, controlled studies have shown that infliximab, the chimeric anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) antibody, is effective for the treatment of active and fistulizing Crohn's disease. Because infliximab is beneficial in patients with Crohn's disease, in whom other therapies have failed, it has been postulated that infliximab may also be helpful in patients with ulcerative colitis. Many investigators have studied the effectiveness of infliximab in ulcerative colitis, mainly in patients who are refractory to corticosteroids. Unfortunately, these studies have not yielded a conclusive answer to the efficacy of infliximab in inducing remission in patients with severe ulcerative colitis. However, some have reported excellent results and others less effective, with the overall data being inconclusive. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature on the use of infliximab in ulcerative colitis, as well as to provide insight into the possible mechanisms of why it may or may not work in these difficult-to-treat patients.

### Association of TNF-alpha / LTA polymorphisms with Crohn's disease in Koreans [^5b0f6de2]. Cytokine (2006). Low credibility.

Polymorphisms of the proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and lymphotoxin-alpha (LTA), have been shown to affect their production and be associated with Crohn's disease. However, the actual alleles associated with the disease are variable among populations. The aim of this study was to test whether TNF-alpha and LTA polymorphisms were associated with Crohn's disease risk in Korean samples. Genotyping for five TNF-alpha promoter polymorphisms (-1031, -863, -857, -308, and -238) and two LTA polymorphisms (intron 1 and Thr60Asn) were performed on 289 Korean patients with Crohn's disease and 399 unrelated healthy controls. Carriers of an individual polymorphism of TNF-alpha at -857T, showed statistically significant association with Crohn's disease (adjusted OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.11–2.41, P = 0.013). Following haplotype analysis, carriers of the haplotype consisted of the -1031C, -863A, and -857C alleles showed statistically significant association with Crohn's disease (adjusted OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.02–2.32, P = 0.040). Significantly reduced frequencies were seen for the carriers of the LTA Thr60Asn polymorphism in patients (OR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.42–0.93, P = 0.019), suggesting a protective effect on Crohn's disease. Our data support the hypothesis that the TNF-alpha/LTA genotypes play an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease in Koreans.

### Therapeutic potential of TNF-α inhibition for Alzheimer's disease prevention [^776dd811]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

1.1 TNF- α: Master regulator of inflammation

TNF- α is a 25 kDa transmembrane protein produced by a wide variety of cells; however, the primary synthesizers are cells of the monocytic lineage, including microglia — macrophages that reside in the brain. Macrophages are a key driver of systemic inflammation via production of TNF and other proinflammatory cytokines. TNF- α binds to tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)1 and TNFR2 to exert a multitude of downstream effects including: 1) immune-stimulation, 2) resistance to infectious agents, 3) malignant cell cytotoxicity, 4) sleep regulation, and 5) embryonic development. In acute settings such as physical trauma or infection, TNF- α orchestrates the pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade. Principally, this results in activation of lipid signaling transduction mediators, including prostaglandins and platelet activating factor, as well as the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF- κ B), potentiating the inflammatory state through both cytokine and interleukin signaling pathways.

The chronic production of TNF- α by microglia elicits a neuro-inflammatory response associated with AD, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This TNF- α mediated inflammation may also contribute to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau protein hyperphosphorylation (tau) known to accumulate in the brains of AD patients.

1.2 Systemic inflammation increases risk of Alzheimer's disease

Systemic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis, which in part are mediated by TNF (Fig. 1), heighten risk for AD, and these diseases are also approved indications for TNF blocking agents. If the increased risk of AD is in part due to TNF, then TNF blocking agents could be expected possibly decrease risk of AD.

### Controversies in the management of anti-TNF therapy in patients with Crohn's disease: a Delphi consensus [^3c004991]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Crohn's disease (CD) has become a global medical condition with accelerating incidence in newly industrialised countries, but with stabilisation in western countries in which due to incidence exceeding mortality, disease prevalence is increasing.CD is associated with substantial morbidity, impaired quality of life, work disability, and high burden of hospitalisation and surgical interventions.

Over the last years, significant advances have been made in CD. New therapies with different action mechanisms have been approved for managing patients with moderate-to-severe CD. Different classes of biological therapies are currently available, including the anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs, adhesion molecule inhibitor vedolizumab (VDL), and anti-interleukin 12/23 agent ustekinumab (UST). More recently, upadacitinib, an oral selective Janus kinase inhibitor, has been approved. However, there is limited evidence regarding the optimal positioning of these agents as first-line or second-line therapies. Head-to-head robust comparative data are still scarce. Besides, the introduction of anti-TNF biosimilars has generated substantial cost-savings for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), limiting the use of other agents as first-line therapies in many centres. Therefore, anti-TNF drugs remain an essential component of CD treatment.

Current treatment paradigms include a 'treat-to-target' approach, a modality that is focused on objective therapeutic goals, mainly mucosal healing rather than mere absence of symptoms. This treatment strategy of tight disease monitoring, which is at least as crucial as the medical therapy choice, has recently been associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with CD undergoing anti-TNF treatment.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has emerged as a key element to optimise the use of biological therapies in managing patients with CD (dose escalation, dose interval shortening, and adding an immunomodulator (IMM)). However, the role of proactive TDM remains controversial. Low drug levels and the subsequent loss of response are usually related to immunogenicity, which has been linked, among others, to HLA-DQA1*05; nevertheless, the impact of HLA determination in clinical practice is still debatable.

### A new transcription factor that regulates TNF-alpha gene expression, LITAF, is increased in intestinal tissues from patients with CD and UC [^7d60dd98]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Recently, a new transcription factor termed LITAF (lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-alpha factor) was shown to mediate TNF-alpha expression in human macrophages by direct binding to specific sequences in the promoter region of the TNF-alpha gene.

Methods

In this report, we identified LITAF in resected ileal and colonic tissues from patients with CD and UC by immunohistochemistry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot analysis. LITAF expression in inflamed and noninflamed areas of the tissues was compared.

Results

This is the first demonstration of LITAF, a newly discovered transcription factor that regulates TNF-alpha gene transcription in ileal and colonic tissues from patients with either CD or UC. LITAF immunostaining was localized to lamina propria macrophages and was markedly increased relative to tissues from controls without inflammatory bowel disease. In patients with CD, a 5-fold increase in LITAF mRNA was measurable in noninflamed colonic tissues compared with controls without inflammatory bowel disease. LITAF mRNA in tissues from inflamed areas of the colon was increased by an additional 60% compared with noninflamed tissues. In patients with UC, LITAF mRNA levels in colonic tissues resected from noninflamed areas were elevated 15-fold above nondisease controls, but they were not different in tissues resected from inflamed areas. Western blot analysis showed that in patients with CD, there was a marked increase in LITAF protein in inflamed areas compared with noninflamed areas. LITAF protein levels were not different between noninflamed and inflamed tissues obtained from patients with UC. TNF-alpha mRNA and protein levels paralleled LITAF. Similarly, in inflamed ileal tissues from patients with CD, LITAF is also localized to lamina propria macrophages. LITAF mRNA and LITAF protein were significantly increased in inflamed ileal tissues compared with noninflamed areas.

Conclusions

LITAF is readily detectable in ileal and colonic tissues from patients with either CD or UC, is significantly elevated above controls, and is localized to macrophages, a major source of TNF-alpha. These data provide strong evidence of a role for LITAF in the pathophysiological regulation of the TNF-alpha gene and underscore the potential value of anti-LITAF strategies in the clinical management of these diseases.

### The medical management of paediatric Crohn's disease: an ECCO-ESPGHAN guideline update [^03078d0b]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for Crohn's disease, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (induction of remission, TNF inhibitors), ECCO/ESPGHAN 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain therapeutic drug monitoring to guide treatment changes, rather than empirically escalating the dose or switching therapies, in patients with active CD on anti-TNF agents.

### Functional rare variants influence the clinical response to anti-TNF therapy in Crohn's disease [^0740fab8]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Epigenetic mark enrichment analysis of the LoF variants indicates that the gut mucosa is an important mediator of anti-TNF response in CD. Previous genetic studies have shown the importance of the colonic mucosa in the regulation of the inflammatory processes that characterize the pathogenesis of CD. The gastrointestinal mucosa of CD patients is highly enriched in activated TNF-secreting macrophages. – From a pharmacological perspective, the anti-TNF therapy has been shown to inhibit not only the gut inflammation but also the inflammation-induced angiogenesis in the intestinal mucosa. Therefore, our findings are consistent with the critical role of the intestinal mucosa as the location where the immune response is initiated in CD, and, therefore, as the key organ determining the clinical response to anti-TNF therapy.

In this study, we provide the first evidence of association between rare damaging variation in the TNF signaling pathway and anti-TNF response. A recent sequencing study in rheumatoid arthritis found that rare variants in this pathway do not contribute to treatment response. However, in this latter study, only exomes were sequenced, and, thereby, important functional variation from other genomic regions was missed. Additionally, there is clear evidence that rheumatoid arthritis and CD have very little genetic risk overlap. This also suggests that different biological mechanisms operate through TNF signaling, and, consequently, drug efficacy is mediated by different groups of genes and associated regulatory variants.

### Infliximab: mechanism of action beyond TNF-alpha neutralization in inflammatory bowel disease [^2bcabb3d]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Infliximab, a chimeric antibody to tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), holds much promise for the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease. On the cellular level, infliximab affects survival and, as presented by Agnholt et al. in this issue of the journal, inhibits GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) production by intestinal T lymphocytes. Future studies will reveal whether the pro-apoptotic effect of infliximab is linked to its inhibition of endogenous GM-CSF expression in T cells. Treatment of Crohn's disease, a severe chronic intestinal disorder, may at times be challenging as it can be refractory to routine therapy. Among novel therapeutic strategies, agents that neutralize tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are of particular interest because of the crucial role of TNF-alpha in sustaining chronic mucosal inflammation. The exact mechanism of the anti-TNF action, apart from direct activity that neutralizes cytokines, is not fully understood. Cellular effects of TNF-alpha neutralizing treatment include an increased susceptibility to apoptosis of intestinal mucosal T cells. A novel pathway of anti-TNF-alpha interaction with T cells has been presented in the current issue of this journal. Agnholt et al. have found that in-vivo or in-vitro administration of infliximab, a chimeric antibody to TNF-alpha, resulted in a decreased production of GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) by T cells. Infliximab related down-regulation of TNF-alpha induced GM-CSF expression may be one of the mechanisms by which this drug increases the rate of apoptosis in T cells.

### Drug labels for the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF α) blockers… [^157fdb2c]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Facts about TNFα blockers
- The class of TNFα blockers are biologic products that include Remicade, Enbrel, Humira, Cimzia, and Simponi.
- TNFα blockers are used to treat Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, and/or juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Serious, including fatal, infections are a known risk of TNFα blockers. These infections can involve various organ systems and sites due to bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, viral, and other opportunistic pathogens has weakened).

FDA has identified cases of Legionella pneumonia in patients treated with TNFα blockers. A search of the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System database between years 1999 and 2010 identified reports of 80 patients who developed Legionella pneumonia after having received infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, and golimumab. The median age of the patients was 56 years. The most frequent indication for TNFα blocker administration in the case series was rheumatoid arthritis. The median duration of TNFα blocker administration prior to onset of Legionella pneumonia was 10. 4 months. of the 80 cases, reports for 30 patients provided information regarding laboratory confirmation of > Legionella infection.

The pathogens Legionella and Listeria have been added to the Boxed Warning for the entire class of TNFα blockers, so that healthcare professionals are aware that these pathogens can cause serious and potentially fatal outcomes in patients treated with TNFα blockers.

### NF-kappaB in inflammatory bowel disease [^3bf626a4]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Apart from genetic and environmental factors, the mucosal immune system of the gut plays a central role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In the healthy gut, the mucosal immune system ensures the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators and thereby allows an effective defence against luminal pathogens but at the same time prevents an overwhelming immune reaction directed against the huge amount of harmless luminal antigens (for example, components of food or nonpathological bacteria). In both entities of IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) this immunological balance is severely impaired and shifted towards the pro-inflammatory side. The chronic mucosal inflammation in IBD is caused by hyperactivation of effector immune cells, which produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 and interferon-gamma, resulting in colonic tissue damage. The nuclear transcription factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) was identified as one of the key regulators in this immunological setting. Its activation is markedly induced in IBD patients and through its ability to promote the expression of various pro-inflammatory genes, NF-kappaB strongly influences the course of mucosal inflammation. Considering the different cell-type specific effects which are mediated by NF-kappaB, this review aims at describing the complex role of NF-kappaB in IBD and discusses existing pharmacological attempts to block the activation of NF-kappaB to develop new therapeutic strategies in IBD.

### Infliximab for maintenance of medically-induced remission in Crohn's disease [^02f6e13a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralises tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) which is present in high levels in the blood serum, mucosa and stool of patients with Crohn's disease.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of infliximab for maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease.

Search Methods

On 31 August, 2021 and 23 June, 2023, we searched CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which infliximab was compared to placebo or another active comparator for maintenance, remission, or response in patients with Crohn's disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently selected studies and conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We expressed outcomes as risk ratios and mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Our primary outcome was clinical relapse. Secondary outcomes were loss of clinical response, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawal due to serious and adverse events.

Main Results

Nine RCTs with 1257 participants were included. They were conducted between 1999 and 2022; seven RCTs included biologically-naive patients, and the remaining two included a mix of naive/not naive patients. Three studies included patients in clinical remission, five included patients with a mix of activity scores, and one study included biologic responders with active disease at baseline. All studies allowed some form of concomitant medication during their duration. One study exclusively included patients with fistulating disease. The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 69 years old. All but one single-centre RCT were multicentre RCTs. Four studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, two had a mix of commercial and public funding, and two had public funding. Infliximab is probably superior to placebo in preventing clinical relapse in patients who have mixed levels of clinical disease activity at baseline, and are not naive to biologics (56% vs 75%, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.84, NNTB = 5, moderate-certainty evidence). We cannot draw any conclusions on loss of clinical response (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.96), withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.19), or serious adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.00) because the evidence is very low certainty. Infliximab combined with purine analogues is probably superior to purine analogues for clinical relapse (12% vs 59%, RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.42, NNTB = 2, moderate-certainty evidence), for patients in remission, and who are not naive to biologics. We cannot draw any conclusions on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.49), and serious adverse events (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.64) because the evidence is very low certainty. We cannot draw any conclusions about the effects of infliximab on serious adverse events compared to purine analogues (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.68) for a population in remission at baseline because the evidence is very low certainty. There was no evidence available for the outcomes of clinical relapse, loss of clinical response, and withdrawal due to adverse events. Infliximab may be equivalent to biosimilar for clinical relapse (47% vs 40% RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.69), and it may be slightly less effective in averting loss of clinical response (49% vs 32%, RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.23, low-certainty evidence), for a population with mixed/low disease activity at baseline. Infliximab may be less effective than biosimilar in averting withdrawals due to adverse events (27% vs 0%, RR 20.73, 95% CI 2.86 to 150.33, low-certainty evidence). Infliximab may be equivalent to biosimilar for serious adverse events (10% vs 10%, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.50, low-certainty evidence). We cannot draw any conclusions on the effects of subcutaneous biosimilar compared with intravenous biosimilar on clinical relapse (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.57), loss of clinical response (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.25), and withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.97) for an active disease population with clinical response at baseline because the evidence is of very low certainty. We cannot draw any conclusions on the effects of infliximab compared to adalimumab on loss of clinical response (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.59), withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.72), serious adverse events (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.54) for an active disease population with clinical response at baseline because the evidence is of very low certainty. There was no evidence available for the outcome of clinical relapse.

Authors' Conclusions

Infliximab is probably more effective in preventing clinical relapse than placebo (moderate-certainty evidence). Infliximab in combination with purine analogues is probably more effective in preventing clinical and endoscopic relapse than purine analogues alone (moderate-certainty evidence). No conclusions can be drawn regarding prevention of loss of clinical response, occurrence of withdrawals due to adverse events, or total adverse events due to very low-certainty evidence for both of these comparisons. There may be little or no difference in prevention of clinical relapse, withdrawal due to adverse events or total adverse events between infliximab and a biosimilar (low-certainty evidence). Infliximab may lead to more loss of clinical response than a biosimilar (low-certainty evidence). We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions about other comparisons and outcomes related to missing data or very low-certainty evidence due to serious concerns about imprecision and risk of bias. Further research should focus on comparisons with other active therapies for maintaining remission, as well as ensuring adequate power calculations and reporting of methods.

### TNF-alpha-308A promoter polymorphism is associated with enhanced TNF-alpha production and inflammatory activity in Crohn's patients with fistulizing disease [^5c8a3554]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a key role in the inflammatory response and pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). TNF-alpha -308A polymorphism within the TNF-alpha gene promoter has been associated with enhanced TNF-alpha production in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of TNF-alpha promoter polymorphism at -308 on the susceptibility and phenotypic expression of fistulizing CD.

Methods

The distribution of -308 TNF-alpha genotypes was analyzed in 50 patients with fistulizing CD and 100 healthy matched controls. TNF-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-6 serum levels were measured by ELISA. Serum amyloid-A, C-reactive protein, alpha1-antitrypsin, alpha1-acid glycoprotein, and haptoglobin were measured by nephelometry.

Results

No significant differences were found in the allele frequencies of the polymorphism between patients and controls. However, compared with -308GG patients, those carrying -308AG had a significant increase of serum levels of TNF-alpha (58 ± 79 vs 8 ± 19 pg/ml, p < 0.001), interleukin-1beta (36 ± 45 vs 16 ± 20 pg/ml, p = 0.048), and acute phase proteins (APPs). -308A carriers had also a higher frequency of arthritis (66% vs 26%, p = 0.039). The logistic regression model showed that the patients carrying -308A polymorphism had a relative risk for developing arthritis of 5.45 (95% CI = 1.1–25.6). No other clinical or analytical findings were predictive for the risk of development of arthritis.

Conclusions

TNF-alpha -308A polymorphism is associated with enhanced TNF-alpha production, more intense inflammatory activity, and an increased risk for arthritis susceptibility in CD patients with fistulizing disease.

AGA Crohn's disease guideline — TNF-antagonist withdrawal indicates that although SAE rates were similar across studies, there was a significant association between TNF-antagonist withdrawal and subsequent > 2-fold increased risk of relapse of disease; data also suggest that resumption of TNF antagonist at time of flare frequently recaptures clinical remission, and continued biochemical and/or structural assessment in the post-withdrawal period is appropriate to monitor for evidence of disease as well.

### Genetic polymorphisms in tumour necrosis factor receptors () illustrate differential treatment response to TNF α inhibitors in patients with Crohn's disease [^c7e69f8d]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Increased level of TNFα has been found in the inflamed intestinal mucosa of patients with CD, which is considered an essential mediator of immunologic response for this inflammatory disease. Consequently, TNFα plays a role in increasing intestinal permeability, granuloma formation and coagulation pathways. Most recently, we elucidated the relationship between MAP infection and the upregulation of TNFα expression in vitro, which has shown that both MAP and M. tuberculosis induce gene expression significantly in comparison to other mycobacteria and non-mycobacteria strains. Although inhibition of TNFα has shown a positive clinical outcome in some patients with CD, poor response was also found in others, which leaves those patients with severe side effects and higher susceptibility to infections. Therefore, several pharmacogenetic studies have evaluated the variation of anti-TNFα treatment response among patients with CD in order to predict treatment response ultimately.

### Expansion of IL-23 receptor bearing TNFR2 + T cells is associated with molecular resistance to anti-TNF therapy in Crohn's disease [^ad251fde]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

The exact mechanism of action of anti-TNF antibodies in CD is still a matter of uncertainty, but it is general consensus that one of their main therapeutic properties is mediated by binding to membrane-bound TNF (mTNF) bearing immune cells. Specifically, anti-TNF agents may bind to mTNF-expressing macrophages, thereby inducing apoptosis in TNFR2-expressing mucosal T cells lacking mTNF-dependent costimulation. The mTNF/TNFR2 signalling pathway is thus a crucial regulator in mediating resistance to intestinal T-cell apoptosis and may contribute to the perpetuation of mucosal inflammation.

How the mucosal immune system may escape the immunosuppressive and apoptosis-inducing effects of anti-TNF agents is poorly understood. However, it is known that cytokine networks in the inflamed mucosa of patients with CD are subject to change, influenced by varying cytokine production patterns that occur in the course of disease. For example, a transition from a Th1 to a mixed Th1/Th17 response has been described in CD. Additionally, the heterogeneity in disease pathobiology, independent of the TNF signalling pathway, and the existence of alternative TNF-independent cytokine signalling pathways might also contribute to the development of resistance to anti-TNF treatment. Indeed, apart from TNF, various studies have implicated the proinflammatory cytokine IL-23 in the pathogenesis of IBD. Polymorphisms in genes encoding the IL23R have been identified in genome-wide association studies and were linked to IBD pathogenesis. Functional studies in preclinical models of IBD underlined a regulatory role of IL-23 in gut inflammation. It was identified as the essential factor for development and perpetuation of chronic intestinal inflammation. Heightened mucosal expression of IL-23 was also demonstrated in patients with IBD, suggesting an important TNF-independent role in disease pathogenesis.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^8ea98627]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Anti-TNF agents — efficacy and dosing data indicate that the anti-TNF-α therapies approved for moderate to severe CD include infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol; these biologic agents are effective for treating patients with CD with objective evidence of active disease and inadequate response to corticosteroids and/or immunomodulator therapies, and they have a potential rapid onset of action occurring as early as within the first 2 weeks of treatment initiation. Treatment with anti-TNF agents does seem to be more effective when given earlier in the course of disease because rates of response and remission are higher if given within 2 years of disease. Maintenance evidence includes a meta-analysis including 14 clinical trials (total of 3,995 patients) showing effectiveness at weeks 20–30, another meta-analysis of 5 trials (total of 1,390 patients) reporting RR of relapse 0.71 (95% CI 0.65–0.76) at weeks 26–56 and a number needed to treat of 4 (95% CI 3–5), and a Cochrane review finding 5 or 10 mg/kg infliximab every 8 weeks superior to placebo at week 54 with 400 mg certolizumab pegol every 4 weeks also superior.

### Effectiveness of ustekinumab in patients with refractory Crohn's disease: a multicentre real-life study in Italy [^ba6ad627]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing disease resulting from uncontrolled inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Although several genetic, environmental, gut bacterial, and immune factors are thought to have a role in the development of CD, the aetiology and pathogenesis of this disease remain unknown.

The introduction of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-targeting biological agents, such as infliximab and adalimumab, has transformed the management of patients with moderately to severely active CD. – Patients refractory to conventional treatments have been shown to achieve clinical remission with anti-TNF-α agents; however, a proportion of patients are either primary nonresponders, lose their response over time, or are intolerant to these agents, and are thus a challenging group to treat.

Ustekinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the p40 subunit of interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, inhibiting their receptor binding on CD4 + T lymphocytes, antigen-presenting cells, and natural killer cells. The efficacy of ustekinumab in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with CD was demonstrated in the randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II CERTIFI clinical study and in the Phase III UNITI-1, UNITI-2, and IM-UNITI clinical trials. Based on the results of these trials, ustekinumab has been approved by the European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration since 2016 for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe CD who have had an inadequate response, lost their response, or been found to be intolerant to conventional therapy or TNF-α inhibitors. The drug was approved by the Italian Medicines Agency in September 2018.

What does this paper add to the literature?

Previous studies have not unambiguously been able to show reduction of surgery after therapy with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi. To our knowledge this is the largest study on real‐life use of TNFi and surgery in Crohn's disease. A majority of patients (62%) continued on TNFi for 12 months or more, and this was associated with a reduced rate of surgery compared to drug survival of TNFi less than 12 months.

### Genetic polymorphisms in tumour necrosis factor receptors () illustrate differential treatment response to TNF α inhibitors in patients with Crohn's disease [^3561f7a2]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Genetic polymorphisms are associated with the overall risk of developing an inflammatory disorder, and they play a role in the treatment outcome. For instance, polymorphisms in TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B have been shown to affect anti-TNFα treatment response significantly among patients with CD. However, the mechanism of those effects remains unknown. Predicting the efficacy of anti-TNFα treatment based on patient's genetics and MAP infection status would be more effective and beneficial to patients by reducing the risk for adverse effects and treatment cost.

In this study, we investigated the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in TNFα, TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B among patients with CD in comparison to healthy controls, in addition to their effect on gene expression and susceptibility to MAP intracellular infection. Finally, we further linked the effect of SNPs in these genes and presence of MAP to anti-TNFα treatment response in patients with CD.

### Focus on mechanisms of inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease sites of inhibition: current and future therapies [^f2b73c22]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Anti-TNF antibodies were the first biologic agents registered to treat patients who have CD and, more recently, patients who have UC. The sequence of events underlying the inflammatory reaction in IBD is extremely complex, however, and involves both the innate and antigen-driven adaptive immune system. Novel therapies are directed at several key players of this cascade. Blockade of T-cell proliferation and activation and inhibition of T-cell cytokines has been most extensively targeted by clinical trials in humans. Inhibition of adhesion molecules and the use of selected growth factors seem to have therapeutic potential. Restoration of regulatory T-cell and dendritic-cell function is still waiting to be explored in clinical trials. Although an increasing number of biologic therapies for IBD are being developed, the discovery of the full spectrum of treatment modalities is only beginning. Often, however, the clinical efficacy of biologic agents is investigated, and for some molecules is established, before mechanisms of action are specifically explored. Eight years after the Food and Drug Administration approved infliximab for the treatment of luminal CD, it is not known how this anti-TNF antibody actually dampens inflammation in IBD. The advent of newer anti-TNF agents is only postponing the answer.

### Targeting cytokines in autoimmunity: new approaches, new promise [^24985ccd]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2003). Low credibility.

The increasing understanding of the pathophysiology of a number of human autoimmune diseases, and the realisation that cytokines play a major role, has provided the pharmaceutical industry with a wide array of new targets for therapeutic intervention. This has also resulted in a surge of interest for the development of ways of blocking cytokines and their actions in a specific and safe manner. This article reviews the current status of anticytokine therapy and the major efficacy that anti-TNF-a monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and soluble TNF receptors have demonstrated in the clinic, which has led to their approval for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease (CD), juvenile arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. In addition, the development of novel approaches of cytokine blockade that are based on the characterisation of intracellular signalling pathways regulating cytokine expression (e.g., nuclear factor kappa B [NF-kB] and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase [MAPK]) and the use of small molecule inhibitors are discussed. Whether these approaches will keep up with their early promise and become a major and widespread treatment for several devastating autoimmune diseases will depend on specificity, safety, durability of the benefit, and pharmacoeconomic issues.

### Defective tumor necrosis factor release from Crohn's disease macrophages in response to toll-like receptor activation: relationship to phenotype and genome-wide association susceptibility loci [^f2a896bf]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background:

Recent work provides evidence of a failure of acute inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD), and suggests that the primary defect operates at the level of the macrophage and cytokine release. Here we extend the characterization of the innate immune defect in CD by investigating the macrophage response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists and assess potential links between genome-wide association study (GWAS) susceptibility loci, disease phenotype, and therapeutic regimens on tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) release.

Methods:

Peripheral blood-derived macrophages were cultured from control subjects and patients with CD, stimulated with TLR ligands, and the release of TNF measured. Genomic DNA was purified from blood and genotyped for 34 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified as being associated with CD by GWAS.

Results:

All stimuli resulted in a reduction (32%–48%) in TNF release from macrophages derived from CD patients (n = 28–101) compared to those from healthy control (HC) subjects. All phenotypes demonstrated impaired TNF release, with the greatest defect in patients with colonic disease. There was no detectable relationship between the level of TNF released and the presence of GWAS susceptibility loci in CD patients. Reduced TNF levels were not influenced by age, gender, or use of aminosalicylate (5-ASA) medication.

Conclusions:

This study supports the hypothesis of defective proinflammatory cytokine secretion and an innate immunodeficiency in CD. Abnormal TNF secretion is evident downstream of multiple TLRs, affects all disease phenotypes, and is unrelated to 34 polymorphisms associated with CD by GWAS. (Inflamm Bowel Dis 2012;)

### Potential off-label use of infliximab in autoimmune and non-autoimmune diseases: a review [^116c34c9]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

TNF-alpha is a crucial cytokine in the establishment and maintenance of inflammation in multiple autoimmune and non-autoimmune disorders. A number of large placebo-controlled trials have shown that infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha, is effective and well-tolerated in patients with Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and has become a widely used treatment for these diseases. More recent controlled trials have also shown the effectiveness of TNF-alpha blockers in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The results of clinical trials, open-label studies, and case studies indicate that TNF inhibitors (alone or in combination with other protocols) look very promising for the treatment of a variety of other conditions, including uveitis, sarcoidosis, Sjögren's syndrome (SS), Behcet's syndrome, vasculitis, and graft versus host disease. There is a rationale for using TNF blockade even in systemic lupus erythematosus, a prototype of autoantibody-mediated disease, and a pilot study seems to confirm this potential effective approach. The neutralisation of TNF might therefore play a role in the treatment of many autoimmune and non-autoimmune disorders other than Crohn's disease or RA. We here review the current and prospective roles of infliximab in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and other conditions that do not currently have FDA or EMEA approval.

### Anti-inflammatory role of interleukin-15 in Crohn's disease [^f900430c]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Interleukin (IL)-15 is overexpressed in intestinal tissue with active Crohn's disease (CD). However, its role in the pathogenesis of the disease remains uncertain. We studied the effects of IL-15 on colonic mucosal proinflammatory cytokine response in vitro using organ culture of human colonic explants.

Methods

Colonic tissue was obtained from (1) resections in pediatric CD patients (inflamed and noninflamed) and (2) rectal biopsies in patients with CD undergoing colonoscopy (n = 31) and controls (n = 9). In preliminary experiments, explants from the resections were cultured in the presence or absence of a simulated T(H)1 stimulation using ionomycin (Io) and phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA), with or without IL-15, or in medium alone. Rectal biopsies were cultured in the same conditions as above, with or without adding a monoclonal anti-IL-15 neutralizing antibody (mAb). Levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-2R alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Results

IL-15, in the absence of Io + PMA, did not induce the expression of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, or IL-2R alpha. Only inflamed explants from resections stimulated with Io + PMA expressed IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2R alpha. This T(H)1 stimulatory effect was inhibited by IL-15 in a dose-dependent fashion. In rectal biopsy explants, inflamed, noninflamed CD, and control tissue responded to stimulation with Io + PMA (P < 0.05) with increased IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha (P < 0.05). This response was again inhibited by IL-15. The inhibitory effect of IL-15 was specifically reversed by anti-IL-15 mAb (P < 0.05). The data for the CD group were also analyzed according to the severity of colonic inflammation and medication use.

Conclusions

Our results suggest a possible anti-inflammatory role for IL-15 in CD. We postulate that its overexpression in CD potentially represents a protective mechanism against the exaggerated T(H)1 immune response.

### Immunologic and molecular mechanisms in inflammatory bowel disease [^45d1c506]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Molecular and immunologic mechanisms underlying inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are largely unknown. Recent studies have helped better characterize genetic and environmental factors associated with colitis. Discoveries of genetic variants have confirmed that IBD is a bacteria and cytokine-driven pathologic immune response. Data have demonstrated that certain T cell subsets are important in executing the inflammatory cascade. Insufficient regulatory cell activity or modulatory cytokine production results in unrestrained inflammation. Biologic agents that block inflammatory cytokines (anti-TNFalpha antibodies) have been used successfully to treat IBD. Recent advances have also identified mucosal regulatory pathways.

### Tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors decrease mortality in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d651af11]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite widespread efforts to control the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), managing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases which require hospital admission remains an ongoing challenge. Although existing therapeutic guidelines have undoubtedly contributed to mitigating the impact of the disease, their efficacy in addressing severe manifestations is limited. Therefore, there is a critical need to explore alternative treatment options to manage severe and critical cases of COVID-19 more efficiently. One promising area of investigation focuses on the exaggerated inflammatory response seen in severe cases of COVID-19, often described as a "cytokine storm". This dysregulated immune reaction — marked by the excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines — has been closely linked to disease progression and poor clinical outcomes. Given the central role of the inflammatory cascade in COVID-19 pathogenesis, there is growing interest in the potential use of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy to mitigate this response and improve patient outcomes.

TNF-α inhibitors are well-established treatments for a range of severe immunoinflammatory diseases and have demonstrated substantial clinical benefit in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These agents — including infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab — have significantly advanced the management of chronic inflammatory conditions, supported by robust evidence of their safety and efficacy. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the urgent need to control inflammatory damage has led to early studies exploring the potential of TNF-α inhibitors to reduce disease severity in COVID-19.

In the pathophysiology of COVID-19, the initial viral replication phase is typically followed by a robust inflammatory cascade, in which tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) plays a central role. Elevated TNF-α levels have been associated with adverse outcomes, including disease progression to the severe or critical stages. Consequently, TNF-α inhibitors hold promise as a therapeutic strategy to modulate the inflammatory response and potentially improve clinical outcomes in severe COVID-19 cases. However, current evidence on the use of TNF-α inhibitors in COVID-19 remains limited and inconclusive, with studies reporting conflicting results.

Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to comprehensively summarise the available evidence on the potential effectiveness and safety of TNF-α inhibitors in the treatment of moderate-to-critical COVID-19 in inhibitor-naïve patients.

### Focus on: biologics that affect therapeutic agents in dermatology [^30fb53d1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is one of the oldest known cytokines in human physiology. It is involved in both normal and pathologic states. Virtually every cell and organ in the body are affected by TNF-alpha. Though TNF-alpha is usually involved in inflammation as a normal host defense response, when overproduced, it can become pathologic and affect almost every organ system. In this article, we address the role of TNF-alpha in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis as well as the drugs used to modulate TNF-alpha. Specifically, we look at the structure, mechanism of action, and clinical use for etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab. Historically, we also review the drug lenercept, another TNF-alpha modulator. These drugs offer alternative effective treatments to rheumatologic and dermatologic diseases without as many of the toxic side effects of some of the traditional therapies. The traditional agents target TNF-alpha in addition to several other modes of action (disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs [DMARDS] such as cyclosporine and methotrexate) (Table 1). Though TNF-alpha immunomodulation seems to be a very effective, promising treatment in several TNF-alpha mediated disease processes, long-term studies need to be performed to assess the risk-benefit ratio of using these drugs over an extended period of time.

### Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in inflammatory bowel disease: the story continues [^1e7c671a]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the 1990s, tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitor therapy ushered in the biologic therapy era for inflammatory bowel disease, leading to marked improvements in treatment options and patient outcomes. There are currently four tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitors approved as treatments for ulcerative colitis and/or Crohn's disease: infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab and certolizumab pegol. Despite the clear benefits of tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitors, a subset of patients with inflammatory bowel disease either do not respond, experience a loss of response after initial clinical improvement or report intolerance to anti-tumour necrosis factor-α therapy. Optimizing outcomes of these agents may be achieved through earlier intervention, the use of therapeutic drug monitoring and thoughtful switching within class. To complement these approaches, evolving predictive biomarkers may help inform and optimize clinical decision making by identifying patients who might potentially benefit from an alternative treatment strategy. This review will focus on the current use of tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitors in inflammatory bowel disease and the application of personalized medicine to improve future outcomes for all patients.

### Maintenance infliximab treatment is associated with improved bone mineral density in Crohn's disease [^95e65d3e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Diminished bone mineral density (BMD) is a recognized complication of Crohn's disease (CD). The mechanisms underlying bone loss are unclear but may include a direct effect of inflammatory cytokines related to disease activity. Because tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of CD inflammation, we evaluated the effect on BMD of maintenance treatment with infliximab in patients with CD.

Methods

BMD of the lumbar spine (L2-L4) and proximal left femur (neck and trochanter) were measured at baseline and 1 yr in 46 CD patients treated with infliximab (5 mg/kg) at 6–8 wk intervals for 1 yr. Thirteen patients received concurrent prednisone at a mean dose of 10 mg/day (range: 5–15).

Results

At baseline, reduced BMD (T-score ≤ 1) occurred in 43% of patients at the lumbar spine and 46% at the left femur. Between baseline and 1 yr, mean BMD increased at the lumbar spine by 2.4% ± 0.7% (p = 0.002), at the femoral trochanter by 2.8% ± 1.2% (p = 0.03), and at the femoral neck by 2.6% ± 0.7% (p = 0.001). BMD gain at the lumbar spine and the left femur between the groups without and with osteopenia were not different. Changes in BMD were not correlated with concurrent corticosteroid therapy, calcium supplementation, or changes in C-reactive protein (CRP).

Conclusions

Maintenance treatment with infliximab improves BMD in patients with CD and this effect is independent of corticosteroid administration. The BMD response after infliximab suggests that TNF-alpha plays a role in the bone loss associated with CD.

### Novel trends with biologics in inflammatory bowel disease: sequential and combined approaches [^a7c2436c]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Is there a rational for sequential and combination therapies? Evidence from translational studies

New insights into the role of cytokine-driven pathways in mucosal immunity have been described, based on several recent studies in animal models of acute intestinal injury, repair and chronic inflammation. Information derived from these studies reveals that intestinal homeostasis and inflammation are driven by cellular elements and soluble mediators that mediate both processes, with several cytokines exhibiting opposing roles, depending upon the specific phase of the inflammation. In this scenario, the same cytokine can possess both classic pro-inflammatory properties, as well as protective, anti-inflammatory functions, which are dependent primarily on the presence of receptor-bearing cells during the host disease state. –

As such, aside from the established pro-inflammatory properties of cytokines implicated in IBD pathogenesis [i.e. TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-12/23, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-18 and IL-33], and their downstream signalling molecules, a growing body of evidence indicates that these mediators are necessary for the maintenance of mucosal homeostasis by effectively handling microbiota, as well as by protecting and restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier. – Epithelial disruption often occurs, facilitating translocation of luminal bacterial products and the recruitment of innate immune cells, primarily neutrophils and macrophages that are also a potent source of secreted (s)IL-1Ra, IL-1β, IL-18 and IL-33. Normally, early expression of these mediators dampens acute inflammation and promotes epithelial repair and restitution, with the ultimate goal of limiting gut mucosal damage and restoring intestinal homeostasis. Under conditions of either uncontrolled and/or persistent inflammation (e.g. as a result of innate immune dysfunction or host genetic predisposition), infiltration of adaptive immune cells occurs during the later phases of inflammation, making available an effector population able to respond to various cytokines. For instance, the presence of naïve CD4+ T cells expressing the IL-18R have the ability to respond to IL-18 and, in combination with IL-12, represent one of the most potent stimuli for interferon (IFN)γ production and Th1-polarised effector responses, thereby promoting chronic Th1-mediated inflammation. Similar effects can occur upon IL-33 stimulation of naïve CD4+ T cells but, in this case, a robust Th2 immune response results. Furthermore, several levels of regulation exist within each subfamily of inflammatory molecules, often including the presence of several agonist isoforms (both precursor and mature, cleaved forms) and receptor antagonists as well as soluble and cell-bound decoy receptors. In addition, the usual promiscuity of inflammatory ligands with both binding receptors as well as recruited accessory proteins, instils yet another level of regulation that should be considered when determining the overall biological effects of a specific biological drug. In fact, each cytokine cannot be considered in isolation, but with other related proteins that can influence their overall interactive effects. An imbalance in the equilibrium between these components, dependent on the prevalent isoform and receptor binding domain/accessory protein present on effector cells, may be responsible for either driving pathogenic events, including chronic intestinal inflammation and fibrosis, or for promoting protection by inducing epithelial repair, mucosal wound healing and restoration of gut homeostasis. Moreover, modifications in the composition of mucosal immune cells in response to therapeutic pressure are able to promote a molecular resistance to these drugs. Indeed, a critical action of evasion of apoptosis in response to anti-TNF drugs has been evidenced for IL-23. This leads to an expansion of apoptosis-resistant T cells and consequent drug resistance.

### Molecular evidence for Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) in Crohn's disease correlates with enhanced TNF-alpha secretion [^bc3e9b64]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Support for a role of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis in Crohn's disease is largely based on epidemiological evidence, as no data on mechanisms linking the presence of M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis with gut damage is available.

Aims

To determine whether the presence of M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis contributes to the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease by promoting cytokine secretion within gut mucosa.

Patients and Methods

A total of 235 subjects were recruited: 63 with Crohn's disease, 53 with ulcerative colitis, 45 with irritable bowel syndrome and 74 normal controls. M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis status was defined by nested PCR using IS900 sequence. Gut mucosal organ cultures were established to detect cytokine secretion patterns.

Results

Significantly higher tumour necrosis factor-alpha concentrations were found in culture supernatants for Crohn's disease compared to ulcerative colitis (p < 0.05), irritable bowel syndrome (p < 0.01) and controls (p < 0.0001). When tumour necrosis factor-alpha levels were correlated with the presence of M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis, significantly greater concentrations were only found in M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis-positive Crohn's disease patients (p < 0.05). Tumour necrosis factor-alpha levels in M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis-positive Crohn's disease were significantly higher than in M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis-positive ulcerative colitis (p < 0.01), M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis-positive irritable bowel syndrome (p < 0.05) and M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis-positive controls (p < 0.01) and all M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis-negative specimens.

Conclusions

The data link M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis with a pathogenic mechanism in Crohn's disease and is consistent with abnormal macrophage handling of M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis.

### Controversies in the management of anti-TNF therapy in patients with Crohn's disease: a Delphi consensus [^3ce4ba9b]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Despite research, there are still controversial areas in the management of Crohn's disease (CD).

Objective

To establish practical recommendations on using anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) drugs in patients with moderate-to-severe CD.

Methods

Clinical controversies in the management of CD using anti-TNF therapies were identified. A comprehensive literature review was performed, and a national survey was launched to examine current clinical practices when using anti-TNF therapies. Their results were discussed by expert gastroenterologists within a nominal group meeting, and a set of statements was proposed and tested in a Delphi process.

Results

Qualitative study. The survey and Delphi process were sent to 244 CD-treating physicians (response rate: 58%). A total of 14 statements were generated. All but two achieved agreement. These statements cover: (1) use of first-line non-anti-TNF biological therapy; (2) role of HLA-DQA1*05 in daily practice; (3) attitudes in primary non-response and loss of response to anti-TNF therapy due to immunogenicity; (4) use of ustekinumab or vedolizumab if a change in action mechanism is warranted; (5) anti-TNF drug level monitoring; (6) combined therapy with an immunomodulator.

Conclusion

This document sought to pull together the best evidence, experts' opinions, and treating physicians' attitudes when using anti-TNF therapies in patients with CD.

### Certolizumab pegol (Cimzia) [^4b6ba805]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Biological activities ascribed to TNFα include the upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules and chemokines, upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules, and direct leukocyte activation. TNFα stimulates the production of downstream inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1, prostaglandins, platelet activating factor, and nitric oxide. Elevated levels of TNFα have been implicated in the pathology of Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Certolizumab pegol binds to TNFα, inhibiting its role as a key mediator of inflammation. TNFα is strongly expressed in the bowel wall in areas involved by Crohn's disease and fecal concentrations of TNFα in patients with Crohn's disease have been shown to reflect clinical severity of the disease. After treatment with certolizumab pegol, patients with Crohn's disease demonstrated a decrease in the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). Increased TNFα levels are found in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients and play an important role in the joint destruction that is a hallmark of this disease.

### Quantitative measurement of cytokine mRNA in inflammatory bowel disease: relation to clinical and endoscopic activity and outcome [^2a759fc7]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to quantitatively determine cytokine mRNA expression in inflammatory bowel disease under different clinical conditions including active disease, remission or an impaired response to a glucocorticoid (GC) therapy.

Methods

Mucosal biopsies were taken from 33 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 21 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 11 controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) were isolated from 24 CU patients, 18 CD patients and 11 controls. Cytokine-mRNA [interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)] expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in biopsies and PBMNC, and correlated to endoscopic findings, clinical activity and outcome after 6 months GC therapy.

Results

IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were the largely dominating cytokines. In contrast to IL-1beta and TNF-alpha-, IL-6 expression was restricted to inflamed mucosa and correlated with the clinical activity and C-reactive protein levels in cases of pancolitis ulcerosa. TNF-alpha was elevated in CD even in endoscopic normal tissue. IL-2 and IFN-gamma were downregulated in PBMNC from CD and UC. No Th1 or Th2 specificity could be detected. Cytokine mRNA levels did not correlate with the response to a GC therapy.

Conclusion

IL-6 sharply distinguishes between inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa, and is therefore a suitable marker of intestinal inflammation. Its selective expression in the inflammatory site makes it an interesting target for future therapeutic strategies. TNF-alpha overexpression even in remission suggests a key role of this cytokine in CD pathogenesis and is possibly a feature that allows one to differentiate CD from UC.

### Targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha. new drugs used to modulate inflammatory diseases [^c6ad6b96]. Dermatologic Clinics (2001). Low credibility.

Since its discovery, the understanding of the roles for TNF-alpha in human biology and disease has grown. Receptors for TNF are found on virtually all cell types, and many physiologic processes seem to be altered by TNF-alpha. The understanding of how TNF-alpha is involved in the pathophysiology of diseases, such as inflammatory diseases, has allowed the development of new drugs that can interfere with excess TNF-alpha and thus has allowed novel therapies for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. As the role of TNF-alpha in other diseases becomes better understood, such TNF-alpha-modulating drugs may find further applications. In the skin, TNF-alpha is prominent cytokine that seems to be important in allergic and irritant contact dermatitis and inflammatory skin conditions. Modulating TNF-alpha activity in the skin may provide therapeutic benefits for a variety of skin conditions (Table 4). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels are elevated in skin lesions of psoriasis. A few reports have already suggested that etanercept and infliximab may offer a therapeutic effect in patients with psoriasis. Clinical studies evaluating the true efficacy of these drugs in psoriasis are under way. Specifically, the authors and others are involved in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy of etanercept for psoriasis. Thalidomide has been used off-label with some success to treat a number of dermatologic diseases, including several inflammatory skin conditions. Etanercept and infliximab might perhaps prove efficacious for inflammatory skin conditions as well. Finally, it is possible that drugs targeting TNF-alpha may have yet-unrecognized serious side effects. Because TNF-alpha seems to be a central cytokine in UVR-induced apoptosis, the chronic use of TNF-alpha-altering drugs might increase the risk for skin cancers. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha also plays some role in cutaneous wound healing; the effect these drugs might have on this process is also unknown at this time. Certainly, much is already [table: see text] known about TNF-alpha and how it plays many central roles. This understanding has allowed the development of useful new drugs for intractable disease. As the understanding of TNF-alpha and other cytokine biology increases, so will the number of potential therapeutic agents.

### Inflammatory bowel disease: recent advances on genetics and innate immunity [^95657eb3]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The two clinically distinguished forms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic remittent or progressive inflammatory diseases, which affect the gastrointestinal tract or only the colonic mucosa respectively. It is believed that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the pathophysiology of IBD. Studies in the early 1990s proved that interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10 and T-cell receptor (TCR) mutant mice develop IBD-like enterocolitis whereas blockage of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α ameliorates the severity of inflammation. Recent studies focus on the interactions between human intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune system and the manner in which a variety of environmental and genetic factors modify these relationships. Another important aspect in the pathophysiology of IBD is the role of the innate immune system and its relationship with the commensal microbiota and the adaptive immune system. Finally it is believed that IBD is likely the result of a continuum of diseases that range from monogenically inherited familial forms to sporadic forms which are polygenic in origin and strongly influenced by environmental factors. Recent studies on the genetic influence of IBD revealed a variety of immunological pathways critical in the pathogenesis of these disorders. These include autophagy and unfolded protein response which play an important role in the interactions between host and highly complex microbial communities within the intestine. It seems that the interaction between intestinal microbiota and particularly some components of it, and the immune system are critical in the pathogenesis of IBD, but are influenced by a variety of environmental factors and the genetic background. This review concludes with the most recent discoveries concerning genetics and innate immune interactions in the pathophysiology of IBD (Fig. 1).

### Potential target of infliximab in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases [^4b3a1286]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by many cell types (blood monocytes, macrophages, mast cells and endothelial cells), that play a key role in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune and nonautoimmune disorders. A number of large placebo-controlled trials have shown that infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha, is effective and well tolerated in patients with Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and spondiloarthritides and has become a widely used treatment for these diseases. Preliminary data suggest that several forms of vasculitis appear responsive to TNF antagonists: Behçet's disease, Churg-Strauss vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa, and giant cell arteritis, among others. Wegener's granulomatosis and sarcoidosis have been shown to improve with infliximab. Polymyositis/dermatomyositis may also be responsive to TNF blockade. TNF likely plays little role in Sjögren's syndrome as evidenced by the lack of efficacy of TNF antagonists. There is a rationale for using TNF blockade even in systemic lupus erythematosus, a prototype of autoantibody-mediated disease, and a pilot study seems to confirm this potential effective approach. A number of other more rare disorders also may be responsive to TNF blockade. We here review the current and prospective roles of infliximab in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and other conditions.

### Risk factors for perianal Crohn's disease: the role of genotype, phenotype, and ethnicity [^e6fcc3e8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Perianal disease (PD) is a frequent complication of Crohn's disease (CD). The lack of association between PD and development of intestinal penetrating disease may suggest that PD is a distinct phenotype with specific genetic or clinical risk factors. This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of genotype, clinical, and demographic characteristics with PD.

Methods

Phenotypic data on 121 CD patients with PD and 179 patients without PD were carefully characterized. The patients were genotyped for disease-associated OCTN1/2 and NOD2/CARD15 variants and the TNF-alpha promoter polymorphisms. Analysis was performed to evaluate the differences in phenotype and genotype frequencies between the PD group and the non-PD group.

Results

PD was associated with rectal involvement (odds ratio [OR] 2.27, 95% CI 1.32–3.91) and with Sephardic (non-Ashkenazi) Jewish ethnicity (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.02–2.9). No association was found among the studied OCTN, NOD2, TNF-alpha variants and the risk for PD.

Conclusions

The strongest factor associated with PD is rectal inflammation. OCTN1/2, NOD2/CARD15, and TNF-alpha promoter variants do not play a role in the risk to PD in the Jewish Israeli population. The association of ethnicity with PD may suggest that there are as yet unknown genetic variants that are associated with PD.

### Functional rare variants influence the clinical response to anti-TNF therapy in Crohn's disease [^cca98437]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) drugs have been shown to be effective for induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (CD); however, up to 30% of patients do not respond to these drugs. – In 2014, the use of vedolizumab, which targets α4β7 integrins, was approved for CD. In 2016, ustekinumab, directed against the p40 subunit shared by interleukins 12 and 23, was approved in patients with CD, while the JAK-inhibitor tofacitinib has just been approved by the European Agency of Medicines for ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, hence increasing the therapeutic arsenal against inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). All these drugs have high cost, so they pose a great economic burden on health systems. At present, the medical community does not have reliable criteria for selecting which patient will benefit from any of the above-mentioned drugs. Thus, the variables (epidemiological, clinical, analytical, etc.) commonly used to predict patient response to biologic therapy have shown low utility.

Therefore, it is a priority to identify mechanisms involved in the response to each drug, to suggest more rational use of resources and for personalized medicine. Thus, achieving that goal will allow us to indicate the most appropriate treatment to each individual, hence avoiding administering drugs to patients who will not respond (an inadequate use of resources and an unjustified risk of adverse effects).

There is compelling evidence that the clinical response to anti-TNF therapy has a genetic component. To date, several candidate-gene studies have investigated the contribution of common variation to the heterogeneity of anti-TNF response in CD. – However, the few associations identified so far have not been consistently replicated. The study of the genetic basis of the clinical response to anti-TNF therapy at the genome-wide scale represents a new opportunity to identify genetic factors underlying the anti-TNF response in CD.

Crohn's disease — treatment for patients not in remission: For low risk patients, options include immunosuppressive therapy, assessing drug levels, and considering anti-TNF therapy. For moderate/high-risk patients, options include using anti-TNF monotherapy over no therapy or thiopurine monotherapy, and using anti-TNF + thiopurine over thiopurine monotherapy or anti-TNF monotherapy. The algorithm also includes assessment of inflammatory biomarkers and branches labeled inflammation present versus inflammation not present with actions to switch to a different drug class or to continue current drug class and dose with monitoring.

### Increased mucosal tumour necrosis factor alpha production in Crohn's disease can be downregulated ex vivo by probiotic bacteria [^44232420]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease. The effect of bacteria on TNF-alpha release by intestinal mucosa was investigated.

Methods

Ileal specimens were obtained at surgery from 10 patients with Crohn's disease (ileal stricture) and five disease controls undergoing right hemicolectomy (caecal cancer). Mucosal explants from each specimen were cultured for 24 hours with either non-pathogenic Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei DN-114001, L bulgaricus LB10, or L crispatus (each study contained blank wells with no bacteria). Tissue and bacterial viability was confirmed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and culture. Concentrations of TNF-alpha were measured in supernatants and the phenotype of the intestinal lymphocytes was analysed by flow cytometry.

Results

Coculture of mucosa with bacteria did not modify LDH release. Release of TNF-alpha by inflamed Crohn's disease mucosa was significantly reduced by coculture with L casei or L bulgaricus; changes induced by L crispatus or E coli were not significant. The effect of L casei and L bulgaricus was not prevented by protease inhibitors. Coculture with L casei and L bulgaricus reduced the number of CD4 cells as well as TNF-alpha expression among intraepithelial lymphocytes from Crohn's disease mucosa. None of the bacteria induced changes in non-inflamed mucosa.

Conclusions

Probiotics interact with immunocompetent cells using the mucosal interface and modulate locally the production of proinflammatory cytokines.
