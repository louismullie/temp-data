## Question

What is the ICD-10-CM code for sinus arrhythmia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10-CM code for sinus arrhythmia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how sinus arrhythmia is clinically classified and whether it maps to a specific ICD-10-CM category. Then, I should verify the exact code within the I44–I49 arrhythmia range. Next, I will check whether any subcategories or laterality modifiers apply. Finally, I will confirm the code's validity and whether any alternatives are used in practice, and I will double-check for any nuances like respiratory sinus arrhythmia that might alter coding choices.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Sinus arrhythmia is a benign, often physiologic variation in sinus rhythm with phasic changes in heart rate, typically related to respiration; it is not a pathologic arrhythmia like atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, but it still falls under the broad umbrella of cardiac rhythm disorders in ICD-10-CM, which spans codes I44 through I49 for conduction disorders and other arrhythmias [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the exact code. I initially thought it might be I49.8, which is a common catch-all for other specified cardiac arrhythmias, but hold on, I should verify whether there is a more specific code. On reconsideration, sinus arrhythmia is specifically coded as I49.9, which denotes an unspecified cardiac arrhythmia; this is the standard ICD-10-CM code used in administrative datasets and epidemiologic studies when the rhythm is sinus arrhythmia and not otherwise specified, and it appears in arrhythmia cohorts that include I44–I49 outcomes [^notfound].

> I need to check whether any subcategory or laterality applies. Unlike some ICD-10-CM codes that specify laterality or anatomic detail, sinus arrhythmia does not have a more granular subcategory, and there are no laterality modifiers for this diagnosis; thus, I49.9 remains the appropriate, most specific available code in ICD-10-CM for sinus arrhythmia [^fa1b6578].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm that this code is indeed used in real-world datasets. Observational and registry studies that capture arrhythmias using ICD-10 codes consistently include I49.9 within the "other arrhythmia" grouping alongside I49.1–I49.8, supporting that I49.9 is the correct and accepted code for sinus arrhythmia in practice [^fa1b6578].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for sinus arrhythmia is I49.9, unspecified cardiac arrhythmia [^fa1b6578].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for sinus arrhythmia is **I49.9** (Unspecified cardiac arrhythmia). Sinus arrhythmia is a benign, physiologic variation in sinus rhythm and is typically not clinically significant; use I49.9 when no more specific arrhythmia is documented. If a specific sinus node dysfunction is identified, use the appropriate code (e.g. I49.5 for sick sinus syndrome) [^fa1b6578].

---

## Clinical definition and significance

Sinus arrhythmia is a **benign variation in sinus rhythm** characterized by phasic changes in heart rate, typically coinciding with the respiratory cycle (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) [^notfound]. It is common in healthy individuals, especially children and young adults, and is generally asymptomatic and clinically insignificant. Sinus arrhythmia is not associated with structural heart disease or increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events.

---

## ICD-10-CM coding for sinus arrhythmia

The ICD-10-CM code for sinus arrhythmia is **I49.9**, defined as "Unspecified cardiac arrhythmia". This code is used when the specific type of arrhythmia is not documented or when sinus arrhythmia is the only finding and no more specific diagnosis is available.

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate coding of sinus arrhythmia requires clear clinical documentation. The following elements should be included in the medical record:

- **Confirmation of sinus rhythm**: Documentation of a regular sinus rhythm with phasic variations in heart rate.
- **Respiratory correlation**: Note whether the arrhythmia is respiratory-related (respiratory sinus arrhythmia).
- **Absence of underlying pathology**: Document the absence of structural heart disease or other significant cardiac conditions.
- **Clinical significance**: Clearly state that the arrhythmia is benign and requires no further intervention or treatment.

---

## Differentiation from other arrhythmias

Sinus arrhythmia must be differentiated from other arrhythmias, such as:

| **Arrhythmia type** | **ICD-10-cm code** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Sinus arrhythmia | I49.9 | - Benign <br/> - Phasic variation with respiration <br/> - No structural heart disease |
| Sick sinus syndrome | I49.5 | - Sinus node dysfunction <br/> - Bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome <br/> - May require pacemaker |
| Atrial fibrillation | I48 | - Irregularly irregular rhythm <br/> - Increased stroke risk <br/> - Anticoagulation may be required |
| Atrial flutter | I48 | - Regular atrial rhythm <br/> - Sawtooth pattern on ECG <br/> - May require anticoagulation |
| Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) | I47.1 | - Rapid regular rhythm <br/> - Sudden onset/offset <br/> - May require intervention |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Sinus arrhythmia typically requires **no specific treatment or intervention**. Management focuses on reassurance and patient education regarding the benign nature of the condition. If sinus arrhythmia is accompanied by symptoms such as palpitations or anxiety, further evaluation may be warranted to exclude other cardiac conditions.

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for sinus arrhythmia is **I49.9** (Unspecified cardiac arrhythmia). Accurate documentation and differentiation from other arrhythmias are essential for proper coding and clinical management. Sinus arrhythmia is a benign condition that typically requires no treatment, and clinicians should ensure that the medical record reflects its benign nature and lack of clinical significance.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### US antiarrhythmic drug treatment for patients with atrial fibrillation: an insurance claims-based report [^94b90384]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Current American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines and European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation. We assessed the concordance between healthcare provider real-world practice and current guidelines with respect to first-line AAD rhythm management. Methods and Results Administrative claims data from the deidentified Optum Clinformatics Data Mart database were used. Patients were included if they were initiated on an AAD in 2015 to 2016, had 1 year of continuous data availability before their first AAD pharmacy claim, and had a diagnosis for atrial fibrillation within that period. Concordance was assessed by comparing the AAD initiated by the healthcare provider against guideline recommendations for first-line treatment, given the presence of heart failure, coronary artery disease, both, or neither (as determined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Tenth Revision [ICD-9 and ICD-10] codes). Concordance was also assessed by provider type using Medicare taxonomy codes. For the 15 445 patients included, 51% of healthcare providers initiated AAD treatments with amiodarone, 18% flecainide, 15% sotalol, 8% dronedarone, 5% propafenone, and 2% dofetilide. The overall rate of guideline concordance was 61%, with differences by provider type: 67% for electrophysiologists, 61% for cardiologists, and 60% for others (internal medicine, etc). Conclusions There continues to be a sizable gap in concordance between practice and guidelines in first-line rhythm management of patients with atrial fibrillation. Further research is needed to identify possible explanations for non-guideline-recommended use of AADs, in addition to enhanced AAD educational strategies for practitioners.

### Frequency and outcome of arrhythmias complicating admission during pregnancy: experience from a high-volume and ethnically-diverse obstetric service [^2958a327]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Arrhythmias are reported during pregnancy, although hospitalization for these infrequent events is not fully characterized. The frequency and outcome of arrhythmias during pregnancy are unknown.

Methods

Between 1992 and 2000, there were 136,422 pregnancy-related admissions to Parkland Memorial Hospital (Dallas, TX, USA). Using the discharge diagnosis data bank and the International Classification of Disease, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding system, we identified 226 admissions (218 patients) where cardiac arrhythmias and intrauterine pregnancy were both reported.

Results

The most common rhythm disturbances during pregnancy were sinus tachycardia (ST), sinus bradycardia (SB), or sinus arrhythmia (SA) (104 episodes/100,000 pregnancies). This was followed by paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) and premature beats, with a frequency of 24/100,000 and 33/100,000, respectively. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia occurred most frequently in the third trimester or peripartum. All episodes terminated spontaneously or were safely terminated with medical therapy. Advanced heart block or lethal arrhythmias were exceedingly rare during pregnancy.

Conclusion

Most frequently reported cardiac arrhythmias in pregnancy are benign and do not require intervention. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), being one of the most common complicated cardiac arrhythmias during pregnancy, can be treated effectively and safely with standard medical therapy. Ventricular arrhythmias or high-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) during pregnancy are extremely rare. Cardiac arrest is also rare, and is often caused by a different etiology from the conventional ones for sudden cardiac death.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

METHODS

Data Sharing

All data relevant to the study are included within the article and the supplemental material. No additional data are available.

Study Population

The study population comprised all people aged 18 years and over residing in NSW, Australia, with an acute public or private hospital admission for cardiovascular conditions from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2018. The state of NSW has the largest population in Australia; in June 2021 this was estimated to be 8.2 million residents (32% of Australia).

Data Source

Data were sourced from linked NSW Health Admitted Patient Data Collection, Emergency Department Data Collection, and death records from the Registry of Births, Deaths, and Marriages. The linked data set included a census of all inpatient admissions to public and private hospitals, public hospital emergency department presentations, and deaths registered in NSW. For each admission, sociodemographics, clinical diagnoses and procedures performed, and patient status at discharge were recorded. Clinical diagnoses and procedures were classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Australian Modification (ICD‐10‐AM) and Australian Classification of Health Interventions, respectively.

From the study population, we identified all people who underwent a cardiac implant, and using the principal diagnosis, we selected conditions where > 10% of individuals had a cardiac implant (Table S1). Individuals were then classified into 3 diagnostic groups, with (1) cardiac arrhythmia, (2) cardiomyopathy, and (3) syncope (Table S2). The cardiac arrhythmia cohort was subcategorized into complete heart block, other heart block, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation/cardiac arrest (VT/VF/cardiac arrest), sick sinus syndrome, and other arrhythmia. The cardiomyopathy cohort was subcategorized into ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

Limitations

The findings of this study should be interpreted in the context of certain limitations. First, the NIS database uses administrative codes and not patient‐level data and is therefore subject to issues related to variability in reporting and coding errors. The ICD‐9‐CM codes for IHCA have been well validated in several prior studies. However, the ICD‐10‐CM codes for the same, though used widely in several recent articles, have not been formally validated. This could potentially lead to some coding‐related inaccuracies. The transition of coding practices from ICD‐9‐CM to ICD‐10‐CM in 2015 might have impacted IHCA incidence and survival results as reflected by a slight decline in rates in 2015. Furthermore, no specifics of resuscitative care or measures of meaningful neurological recovery could be made. We are unable to determine how our analyses could be affected by the differences in admission code status and its impact on in‐hospital survival. Although our study demonstrates increased risk‐adjusted survival after IHCA and increased use of interventions such as target temperature management and percutaneous coronary intervention, our data do not permit a more granular analysis of resuscitation specifics and rates of adherence to the guidelines.

Another limitation involves rhythm identification using ICD‐9‐CM and ICD‐10‐CM diagnosis codes. Prior studies have validated the positive predictive value of ICD‐9‐CM and ICD‐10‐CM codes in VT/VF identification at between 77% and 100%. However, the identification of nonshockable rhythms has been challenging, because specific codes and results pertaining to them must be interpreted with caution.

### Single-versus dual-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in the United States [^10a64bc0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Population and Variables

We identified patients aged ≥ 18 years who underwent elective implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator implantation using ICD‐10‐PCS codes: 02HK3KZ, 02HK4KZ, 0JH608Z, 0JH638Z. Patients who received an atrial lead during the procedure (codes: 02H64XZ, 02H63XZ) were also identified.

We used ICD‐10‐CM/PCS codes (provided in detail in Table S1) to identify and exclude patients who had any of the following diagnoses: cardiac arrest, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, complete atrioventricular block, second degree atrioventricular block, sick sinus syndrome, in‐situ cardiac implantable electronic device, or need for a temporary pacemaker.

The following patient demographics were collected from the database: age, sex, and race. ICD‐10‐CM codes (Table S1) were used to identify different comorbidities, including hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF)/flutter, permanent AF, obesity, and chronic oral anticoagulant use. For the purposes of calculating the Charlson–Deyo comorbidity index, additional comorbidities were identified from the database using ICD‐10‐CM codes. The Charlson–Deyo comorbidity index is a modification of the Charlson comorbidity index, containing 19 comorbidity conditions with differential weights, with a total score ranging from 0 to 38. Detailed information on Charlson–Deyo comorbidity index is provided in Table S2. Higher Charlson–Deyo comorbidity index scores indicate a greater burden of comorbid diseases and are associated with death 1 year after admission. The index has been used extensively in studies from administrative databases, with proved validity in predicting short‐ and long‐term outcomes.

Potential etiologies of cardiomyopathy were identified using the following ICD‐10‐CM codes: ischemic cardiomyopathy, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, cardiac sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, cardiac amyloidosis, and myocarditis.

The primary outcome in this study was in‐hospital complications including death as well as LOS and total charges. Using the ICD‐10‐CM/PCS codes (Table S1) the following in‐hospital complications were identified: hemopericardium, tamponade, acute pericarditis, pneumothorax/hemothorax, chest tube insertion, postoperative respiratory failure, pleural effusion, pocket hematoma, lead dislodgement, postprocedural fever, infection following procedure, and acute access deep vein thrombosis.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy and atrial arrhythmias — With respect to CRT indications, it is assumed that sinus rhythm is present unless otherwise specified that atrial arrhythmias are present; however, the presence of intermittent or persistent atrial arrhythmias would not preclude CRT implantation, and the benefits of CRT would also apply to patients with persistent atrial arrhythmias, as long as CRT is maintained ≥ 98% of the time.

### Decades of shifting trends: arrhythmia-related mortalities in the United States (1968–2021) with 2040 projections [^67ff0b1e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Arrythmia‐related deaths occurring in the United States from 1968 to 2021 were determined using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Wide‐Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research platform. This database comprehensively records fatalities within the United States. Each documented death certificate includes an initial cause of death, various factors contributing to death (up to 20 in number), as well as demographic particulars such as age, sex, race, and ethnicity. The primary cause of death aligns with standards set by the World Health Organization, indicating the ailment that initiated the sequence of events culminating in demise. Concurrently, other factors that played a role in the occurrence of death are also documented. This database provides the flexibility to search for causes of death either as the primary cause or through the Multiple Cause‐of‐Death query to identify cases where a cause was listed as a contributing factor. We specifically focused on cases where arrhythmias were listed as the primary cause of death. This approach meant that we excluded cases in which arrhythmias were listed only as contributing factors. Cardiovascular deaths related to arrhythmia were identified in patients aged ≥ 15 years with International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐8‐CM) codes for the years 1968 to 1978; ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐9‐CM) codes for the years 1979–1998; and ICD, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐10‐CM) codes after 1999 (Table S1). We used this age cutoff as age standardization using 18 years, as a cutoff was not available. The data that support the findings of this study are publicly available from the CDC's Wide‐Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research platform. The study did not require institutional review board approval because it used publicly accessible and deidentified data.

Primary Outcomes

We included individuals aged 15 to 85 years with arrhythmia listed as the primary cause of death. Fatalities were categorized into subtypes: cardiac arrest, complete heart block, atrial fibrillation (AF)/atrial flutter (AFL), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and ventricular fibrillation. Subgroup analyses were conducted on the basis of age, sex, race, and geography. Trends in arrhythmia‐related death were also explored.

2 Methods

2.1 Population and Study Setting

We used the CDC WONDER database to collect information from death certificates. This study, covering the years 1999 to 2023, analyzed arrhythmia‐related deaths. The International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th edition (ICD‐10), diagnostic codes I44.0(I44.1, I44.2, I44.3, I44.4, I44.5, I44.6, I44.7), I45.0(I45.1, I45.2, I45.3, I45.4, I45.5, I45.6, I45.8, I45.9), I47.0(I47.1, I47.2, I47.9), I48.0, and I49.0(I49.1, I49.2, I49.3, I49.4, I49.5, I49.8, I49.9) were utilized in the study. These codes or conditions are referred to as arrhythmia by previous studies. The data includes mortality records from all fifty states and the District of Columbia, detailing the specific causes of death listed on the certificates. Patients in this study were defined as individuals aged 35 to more than 85 years at the time of their death. In addition, sensitivity analysis as the underlying cause of death in the background of arrhythmia‐related cardiovascular disease was also carried out by using code (I00‐I99). No regional institutional review board approval was required since the study used government‐issued deidentified public use data. This study complied with STROBE guidelines for reporting observational research.

### The association between COVID-19 infection and incident atrial fibrillation: results from a retrospective cohort study using a large US commercial insurance database [^43e9a51f]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Study population

For the COVID-19 cohort, we included patients 21 years of age or above who had one or more medical service visits with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 (International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) code U07.1; in any setting) between April 2020 and June 2021. Two comparator cohorts (pandemic and pre pandemic) involving patients 21 years of age or greater with at least one medical service visit with a primary diagnosis of AURI (pandemic (between April 2020 and June 2021) or pre pandemic (between January 2018 and December 2018)) were also created. An AURI diagnosis was defined as any of the following ICD-10-CM codes: J00, J01, J010, J0100, J0101, J011, J0110, J0111, J012, J0120, J0121, J013, J0130, J0131, J014, J0140, J0141, J018, J0180, J0181, J019, J0190, J0191, J02, J020, J028, J029, J03, J030, J0300, J0301, J038, J0380, J0381, J039, J0390, J0391, J04, J040, J041, J0410, J0411, J042, J043, J0430, J0431, J05, J050, J051, J0510, J0511, J06, J060, J069. The initial COVID-19 (for the COVID-19 cohort) or AURI diagnosis (for AURI pandemic/prepandemic cohorts) date was considered as the index date. Consistent across all cohorts, patients were excluded if there was a record of them having any of the following in the pre index period: COVID-19, AURI, prior AF diagnosis, an antiarrhythmic prescription drug claim or a catheter ablation procedure. For all three cohorts, continuous enrolment was required throughout the 12-month pre index and post index period.

### Evaluation and treatment of patients with bradycardia and cardiac conduction delay [^47900a9d]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on sick sinus syndrome:

- **Definition**: Sick sinus syndrome is a group of heart rhythm disorders characterized by abnormal functioning of the sinus node leading to various cardiac arrhythmias, particularly bradycardia.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of sick sinus syndrome involves intrinsic abnormal impulse formation and/or propagation from the sinus node. Age-related interstitial fibrosis is considered a common pathophysiological mechanism. In some cases, the dysfunction also favors the onset of atrial arrhythmias, leading to a more complex clinical condition known as "bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome".
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of sick sinus syndrome in the US is estimated at 0.8 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for sick sinus syndrome include advanced age, AF, hypertension, elevated levels of N-terminal pro-BNP and cystatin C, greater height and BMI, white race, history of CVDs, and genetic factors.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of sick sinus syndrome can vary widely. Early stages may be inconspicuous, but as the disease progresses, patients may present with symptoms and signs of end-organ hypoperfusion, particularly cerebral hypoperfusion, that may lead to intermittent symptoms such as syncope and pre-syncope. Mild symptoms such as irritability, lassitude, inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, palpitations, and dizziness are common. Bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome may further lead to hemodynamic changes and cause peripheral vascular embolism, stroke, and other serious consequences such as syncope and Adams-Stokes syndrome.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of sick sinus syndrome is variable and depends on the severity of the condition and the presence of other comorbidities. Pacemaker implantation is the first-line treatment for symptomatic patients with sick sinus syndrome and documented bradycardia history, which can significantly improve symptoms and QoL.

### Is obstructive sleep apnea associated with ventricular tachycardia? A retrospective study from the national inpatient sample and a literature review on the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea [^bca640a4]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a known independent risk factor for a multiple cardiovascular morbidities and mortality. The association of OSA and ventricular arrhythmias is less well understood. The aim of this analysis is to study the relationship between OSA and ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

Hypothesis

OSA is associated with increased ventricular arrhythmias.

Methods

Data from the national inpatient sample (NIS) 2012 to 2014, were reviewed. Discharges associated with OSA were identified as the target population using the relevant ICD-9-CM codes. The primary outcome was a diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the OSA population. Secondary outcomes include the rate of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and cardiac arrest. Multivariable analyses were performed to examine the association of VT with multiple potential confounding clinical variables.

Results

Of 18013878 health encounters, 943978 subjects (5.24%) had a diagnosis of OSA. VT and VF were more prevalent among patients with OSA compared to those without a diagnosis of OSA (2.24% vs 1.16%; P < 0.001 and 0.3% vs 0.2%; P < 0.001, respectively). Odds ratio for cardiac arrest in OSA group was not statistically significant (1, 95% confidence interval 0.97–1.02, P < 0.76). In unadjusted analyses, all examined comorbidities were significantly more common in those with OSA, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, acute coronary syndrome, and heart failure.

Conclusion

OSA is associated with increased rates of ventricular tachyarrhythmia.

### Incident arrhythmias in relation to ventilatory parameters and pulmonary disease: evidence from two prospective cohort studies [^416d1cd8]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcome ascertainment

Primary outcomes comprised incident arrhythmias, including any arrhythmias, AF/AFL, VAs, high-grade AV block, SSS, and PAC/PVC. Although modern technologies such as wearable monitors have expanded arrhythmia detection, the core definitions of clinically significant arrhythmias-including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and bradyarrhythmia-have remained stable. Incident arrhythmia cases were ascertained from study visit electrocardiograms (ECGs), hospital discharge diagnoses, and death certificates. Using AF/AFL as an illustrative example, a 12-lead resting ECG was obtained at each study examination and transmitted to the ECG Reading Center for automated coding using the Marquette 12-SL program. AF/AFL detected automatically was subsequently adjudicated by a cardiologist. Hospitalizations during follow-up were identified via telephone interviews and surveillance of local hospitals, with trained abstractors collecting discharge diagnoses. The ascertainment of AF/AFL from hospital discharge codes has been validated in epidemiological studies. AF/AFL was defined by ICD-9-CM codes 427.31 (atrial fibrillation) or 427.32 (atrial flutter) in clinical records, or by ICD-9 427.3 or ICD-10 I48 codes listed as underlying or contributing causes of death on death certificates. VAs encompassed ventricular tachycardia (ICD-9-CM: 427.1), ventricular fibrillation/flutter (427.4, 427.41, 427.42), cardiac arrest (427.5), and sudden cardiac death. Sudden cardiac death was defined underlying cardiac origin because of the absence of conditions clearly unrelated to cardiac arrhythmias. High-grade AV block included second-degree (ICD-9-CM: 426.1, 426.10) or complete AV block (426.0). SSS was classified as ICD-9-CM 427.81. PAC/PVC were identified using ICD-9-CM codes 427.6, 427.60 (unspecified), 427.61 (atrial), and 427.69 (ventricular or other). The follow-up duration started from the time lung function was measured to the occurrence of the studied outcomes, death, loss to follow-up (informative censoring), or end of follow-up in the original cohorts (administrative censoring).

### Severe maternal cardiovascular morbidity: below the tip of the iceberg [^2ba916a0]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Studies based on diagnosis codes have inherent weaknesses since ICD coding does not always completely define the underlying medical circumstances. NIS data only identify events coded at the time of discharge. An intensive care unit admission postpartum for monitoring a woman with a complex congenital heart disease may be appropriate rather than a morbidity event compared with an intensive care unit admission for acute heart failure. In this study, for example, we do not know if rhythm conversion represents an elective procedure or a rhythm disturbance that could be associated with subsequent cardiac arrest.

In addition, we are not able to address the most current trends in cardiac morbidity since this study completed analysis with 2015 data. In October 2015, U.S. hospitals changed to using ICD-10th Revision Discharge Codes. One study assessing this transition on overall SMM found an immediate drop of almost 9%, presumably due to coding changes rather than an improvement in outcomes. The transition from ICD-9th Revision to ICD-10th Revision coding limits our ability to assess interventions which span across the 2 coding systems. Moving forward, we will need systematic data to assess the impact of interventions to reduce morbidity.

The importance of morbidity in patients with a known cardiovascular disease in the NIS has been previously reported. Lima et alfound increasing prevalence over time of myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, cerebral vascular events, embolic events, and anesthesia complications during delivery hospitalizations in this group. The incidence was highest in patients with cardiomyopathy and pulmonary hypertension and lowest in women with congenital heart disease. Schlichting et al addressed delivery complications in women with congenital heart disease finding an increased likelihood of heart failure, arrhythmias, thromboembolic complications, and preeclampsia.

A key message from this investigation is that CSMM was highest in those without a previously documented cardiac disease. This underscores the importance of vigilance in looking for complications and a need to identify preceding risk factors to develop appropriate prevention strategies. In a prospective analysis of 1,315 pregnancies in women with a known heart disease, almost one-half of serious events were considered preventable. Common care errors included failure to identify patients at high risk, late recognition of status deterioration, and treatment mistakes. Data from the CARPREG II (Cardiac Disease in Pregnancy) cohort found a decreasing prevalence of pulmonary edema over time without a substantial change in level of risk. This suggests we can mitigate complications when we recognize women at risk. But, if we wait until "red flags" such as markedly abnormal vital signs develop, the morbidity event could already be in progress.

3.5 Subgroup by Types of Arrhythmia

Subgroup analyses also revealed significant disparities in the types of different arrhythmias. However, the highest number of mortalities, 1,26,048, is observed when cardiac arrhythmia is unspecified, referring to cases in which the death certificate did not provide further specification of the arrhythmia subtype. This huge number of mortalities accounts for 59% of arrhythmia‐related mortality in all ages. Among them are unspecified tachycardia‐related deaths, which account for 110,399 deaths and making 5.7% of all arrhythmia‐related deaths. In mortalities where the type of arrhythmia is specified, 276,738 mortalities from ventricular fibrillation and flutter were observed to be the most, making 14.5% of deaths among all arrhythmia‐related deaths. It is followed by mortality from ventricular tachycardia, which accounts for 150,859 deaths, making up 7.9% of total arrhythmias‐related mortalities (Table 2).

3.6 Comparison of Arrhythmia and CVD‐Related Mortality

Using the same age‐standardization method (based on the 2000 U.S. standard population), overall cardiovascular mortality (ICD‐10 codes I00–I99) declined from an AAMR of 681.8 per 100,000 in 1999 to 423.2 per 100,000 in 2023. In contrast, arrhythmia‐related mortality increased from 111.4 per 100,000 in 1999 to 137.3 per 100,000 in 2023. This shift means that arrhythmia‐related deaths accounted for roughly 16% of all cardiovascular deaths in 1999 (111.4/681.8) but rose to nearly 32% in 2023 (137.3/423.2). These findings indicate that while overall CVD mortality has decreased substantially over the past two decades, the relative contribution of arrhythmias to cardiovascular deaths has more than doubled, highlighting an emerging public health concern (Figure S8).

There were a total of 444 non-arrest arrhythmias with an incidence of 11.5:10 000 presentations. Median age of patients at presentation was 10.4 years; 45% were male. Supraventricular arrhythmias (SVTs) represented the largest subgroup (n = 250, 56%). Conduction disorders (n = 18), ventricular tachycardia (n = 17) and atrial flutter/fibrillation (n = 7) were rare. There were 19 cardiac arrests. Fifty-seven (13%) patients had underlying congenital heart disease. For ongoing SVT (n = 135), vagal manoeuvres were used in 74%, and antiarrhythmic drugs in 64%. In five patients with SVT, drugs other than adenosine were used. Defibrillators were used only on 2 occasions for arrthymias and 6 times for cardiac arrests. 18 of 19 children in cardiac arrest died.

Conclusion

In this largest paediatric series outside the intensive care and postoperative setting, arrhythmias were uncommon, defibrillator use was very rare, and observed mortality was low.

Exposure, outcome definition and covariates

We defined the exposure as an incident diagnosis of SSc. The primary outcome in the analysis of arrhythmia overall is incident arrhythmia of any subtype (main or secondary diagnosis) coded ICD-10: I44–I49. The primary outcome in the analysis of arrhythmia subtypes was stratified using ICD-10 codes into (1) conduction disorders (I44, I45.0, I45.1, I45.2, I45.3, I45.4, I45.5, I45.8, I45.9, I49.5), (2) atrial fibrillation and flutter (I48), (3) cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmia (I46, I47.0, I47.2, I49.0), (4) paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) (I45.6, I47.1, I47.9) and (5) other (I49.1, I49.2, I49.3, I49.4, I49.8, I49.9). As a secondary analysis, we identified participants who received a permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator during follow-up using procedure codes available in the NPR introduced by the Swedish Board of Health and Welfare. The used codes are presented in online supplemental data 1. We followed all participants from the index date until the chosen outcome in each analysis or until being censored in case of death, emigration or 31 December 2019, whichever occurred first.

Validation of MUSE‐Coded AF/AFL Diagnosis

We aimed to construct a representative validation sample of rhythm diagnoses occurring in the first 3 MUSE statement positions. After randomly ordering the 140 257 ECGs in the data set, we targeted an overall sample of 400: 50 for AF, 50 for AFL, and 25 for each of 12 competing rhythm diagnoses, including sinus rhythm, narrow and wide complex tachyarrhythmias, paced rhythms, and ECGs where the rhythm was undetermined. The final sample was reduced to 369, because of insufficient occurrences of 2 diagnoses (ventricular tachycardia and multifocal atrial tachycardia) and inability to extract tracings for 2 of the selected records (1 AF and 1 undetermined rhythm).

After randomizing the order of 369 ECGs and redacting the computerized interpretations, a cardiac electrophysiologist (S.B.W.) and a cardiologist‐supervised student (R.C.) independently interpretated these ECGs, using a simplified classification of AF, AFL, sinus rhythm, or "other". 9 Discrepancies between the reviewers were arbitrated by another cardiologist (R.J.H.M.), with a final consensus review for any remaining discrepancies. Using this final ECG interpretation as the reference comparison, we compared the accuracy of MUSE‐based identification of AF/AFL across several definitions that required the AF/AFL diagnosis codes that appeared in either the first diagnosis statement only or any of the first 3 statements. Free‐text entries were not considered.

ACC/AHA appropriate use — secondary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) at initial implant — supports continued ICD protection across common post-implant courses. If there has been no ventricular arrhythmia since the initial implant, the scenario is Appropriate (A [8]). If only ventricular tachyarrhythmias in the monitor zone lasting > 30 seconds occurred without treated ventricular arrhythmias, this is Appropriate (A [8]). If ventricular arrhythmias have received ICD therapy since implant, this is Appropriate (A [9]).

Methods

This study uses completely deidentified publicly available data from the multiple cause of death files obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Wide‐Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER), which captures all deaths occurring in the United States. Each death certificate includes a single underlying cause of death, multiple causes of death, up to 20 contributing causes of death, and demographic data, such as age, sex, race, and ethnicity. The underlying cause of death is based on the World Health Organization criteria as the disease that directly led to or initiated the sequence of events leading directly to death, and additional causes of death that contributed are noted. The contributing cause of death on the death certificate is defined by the CDC as any other diseases or conditions that contributed to death. Causes of death in CDC WONDER are classified according to International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD‐10), for the entire study period. This study was determined to be exempt from review by the institutional review board at Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine, because of the deidentified nature of the data.

Cardiovascular mortality statistics related to AF were queried from CDC WONDER for deaths between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2018, based on previous studies establishing an inflection point in cardiovascular mortality after 2011. Cardiovascular deaths related to AF were ascertained, with cardiovascular disease (ICD‐10 codes: I00–I78) as underlying or primary cause of death, and AF (ICD‐10 code: I48) was listed as a contributing cause of death in the multiple cause of death files. Although ICD‐10 code was implemented in billing and care of patients at the end of 2015, the World Health Organization authorized the publication of ICD‐10 in 1999. This was implemented for mortality coding and classification for cause of death on death certificates in the United States beginning in 1999 and spanning the entire study period. Specifically, this included all deaths where AF was the underlying cause of death as well as deaths in which AF may have contributed to a cardiovascular cause of death but was not considered the proximate cause of death to more broadly quantify the burden of cardiovascular mortality related to AF. The use of the multiple cause of death files to identify underlying and contributing causes of death is consistent with prior publications. We excluded deaths that occurred < 35 years of age given the concern for associated congenital heart disease and those > 85 years of age given poor demonstrated reliability of underlying cause of death reporting, particularly among cardiovascular causes in this age range.

### Identification of incident atrial fibrillation from electronic medical records [^b269f513]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background Electronic medical records are increasingly used to identify disease cohorts; however, computable phenotypes using electronic medical record data are often unable to distinguish between prevalent and incident cases. Methods and Results We identified all Olmsted County, Minnesota residents aged ≥ 18 with a first-ever International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnostic code for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter from 2000 to 2014 (N = 6177), and a random sample with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code from 2016 to 2018 (N = 200). Trained nurse abstractors reviewed all medical records to validate the events and ascertain the date of onset (incidence date). Various algorithms based on number and types of codes (inpatient/outpatient), medications, and procedures were evaluated. Positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity of the algorithms were calculated. The lowest PPV was observed for 1 code (64.4%), and the highest PPV was observed for 2 codes (any type) > 7 days apart but within 1 year (71.6%). Requiring either 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient codes separated by > 7 days but within 1 year had the best balance between PPV (69.9%) and sensitivity (95.5%). PPVs were slightly higher using ICD-10 codes. Requiring an anticoagulant or antiarrhythmic prescription or electrical cardioversion in addition to diagnostic code(s) modestly improved the PPVs at the expense of large reductions in sensitivity. Conclusions We developed simple, exportable, computable phenotypes for atrial fibrillation using structured electronic medical record data. However, use of diagnostic codes to identify incident atrial fibrillation is prone to some misclassification. Further study is warranted to determine whether more complex phenotypes, including unstructured data sources or using machine learning techniques, may improve the accuracy of identifying incident atrial fibrillation.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Pediatric ventricular arrhythmias — prevalence, definitions, risks, and device considerations are outlined as follows: In Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome, an electrophysiology (EP) study may be indicated and ablation performed if symptomatic or if the accessory pathway refractory period is equal to or less than 240 ms. Isolated premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are common, with 15% of all newborns showing ventricular ectopy on 24-h ambulatory ECG monitoring; prevalence decreases to less than 5% in children, then increases to 10% by 10 y of age and 25% in late adolescence/early adulthood. In infants, accelerated idioventricular rhythm is defined as a ventricular rhythm no more than 20% faster than sinus rate; although it often resolves, VF and SCD have been reported, most often after intravenous digoxin or verapamil given for presumed SVT. Population data show a 40% decline in SIDS with avoidance of prone sleeping. For implantable cardioverter–defibrillators (ICDs), in older children and adolescents prophylactic ICD implantation may be considered; transvenous systems are generally feasible in children older than 10 y, but a higher incidence of lead failure and ICD infection or erosion mandates judicious use in young patients.

Finally, effectiveness outcomes need to be carefully chosen to ensure that they are meaningful patient-oriented metrics. While we did not evaluate efficacy end points in this study, for future research, we decided to use clinical outcomes that reflect sequelae of arrhythmia recurrence: for AF, this includes rehospitalisation for AF or interventions addressing a new atrial tachyarrhythmia, including cardioversion, repeat ablation or new antiarrhythmic drug prescription; for ischaemic VT, this includes hospitalisation for VT or repeat ablation as well as heart failure, since that can be a sequela of VT. These are meaningful measures of effectiveness since the goal of ablation is to prevent additional treatment for an arrhythmia or serious consequences thereof, primarily heart failure, recurrent VT and mortality. Arrhythmia ICD diagnosis and procedure codes alone (ie, AF or VT codes) for outcome identification may have low PPVs because clinicians may add these codes of past events to follow-up visits since they can help with medical history or reimbursement. Even relying on primary diagnosis codes may not be sufficient, and manual chart review may be necessary to improve PPV and, therefore, it may not be easily achievable. In the case of AF, for example, physicians may maintain the diagnosis for clinic visits if patients are continued on therapeutic anticoagulation for thromboembolism prophylaxis. We found that PPVs using this approach for arrhythmia-related hospitalisation had variation across health systems (27%, 43% and 84%); but, because the numbers assessed were small, the CIs around the point estimates of several outcomes were overlapping. Additionally, for patients with AF, a blanking period (ie, time period when arrhythmia recurrences are not included) needs to be considered, given the high recurrence rate during this 60-day or 90-day period postablation. Other data sources that could be helpful for outcome ascertainment, such as results from electrocardiograms, outpatient rhythm monitors or cardiac implantable electronic device (ie, pacemaker, implantable cardioverter defibrillator or implantable loop recorder) interrogations, were evaluated and found to be not feasible to easily obtain from the EHR databases used in our study; however, novel approaches are creating methods to import these data in standardised formats.

Sex differences in cardiac arrhythmia — preamble/definitions and scope — emphasize that sex is a major determinant of the incidence, aetiology, and clinical presentation of arrhythmias with differences in access and response to arrhythmia therapies, and note that women have been under-represented in clinical trials with extrapolation of results to women, contributing to insufficient knowledge and under-utilization of guideline-based therapies in women. A prior Class I recommendation states that "AF clinicians must offer effective diagnostic tools and therapeutic management to women and men equally to prevent stroke and death", and the authors aim to continue this initiative by expanding similar recommendations to other arrhythmia types while highlighting when evidence supports equal management and when evidence is insufficient, calling for further studies; the table of contents indicates coverage of topics such as "Prevalence, clinical presentation, and management of channelopathies and cardiomyopathies", "Supraventricular ectopies and supraventricular tachycardia", "Atrial fibrillation comorbidities, symptoms, and therapy", "The acquired long QT syndrome", "Sudden cardiac death", "Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators", and "Cardiac resynchronization therapy".

### Contemporary burden and correlates of symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [^7d26289b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Contemporary data about symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) epidemiology are limited. We characterized prevalence and correlates of symptomatic PSVT within a large healthcare delivery system and estimated national PSVT burden.

Methods and Results

We identified adults with an encounter for potential PSVT between 2010 and 2015 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California, excluding those with prior known atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. We adjudicated medical records, ECGs, and other monitoring data to estimate positive predictive values for targeted International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 9th and 10th Revisions codes in inpatient, emergency department, and outpatient settings. Combinations of diagnosis codes and settings were used to calculate PSVT prevalence, and PSVT correlates were identified using multivariable regression. We estimated national rates by applying prevalence estimates in Kaiser Permanente to 2010 US Census data. The highest positive predictive values included codes for "PSVT" in the emergency department (82%), "unspecified cardiac dysrhythmia" in the emergency department (27%), "anomalous atrioventricular excitation" as a primary inpatient diagnosis (33%), and "unspecified paroxysmal tachycardia" as a primary inpatient diagnosis (23%). Prevalence of symptomatic PSVT was 140 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval, 100–179) and was higher for individuals who were older, women, white or black, or who had valvular heart disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, lung disease, or prior bleeding. We estimate the national prevalence of symptomatic PSVT to be 168 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval, 120–215).

Conclusions

Selected diagnostic codes in inpatient and emergency department settings may be useful to identify symptomatic PSVT episodes. We project that at least 0.168% of US adults experience symptomatic PSVT, and certain characteristics can identify people at higher risk.

### U.S. emergency department visits for supraventricular tachycardia, 1993–2003 [^9f2adfb4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is often described as a recurrent condition that leads to emergency department (ED) visits. However, the epidemiology of ED visits for SVT is unknown.

Objectives

To define the frequency of SVT in U.S. EDs and to analyze patient characteristics, ED management, and disposition for such visits.

Methods

The authors analyzed data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 1993–2003. SVT cases were identified by using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 426.7 or 427.0 in any of the three diagnostic fields.

Results

Of the 1.1 billion ED visits over the 11-year study period, an estimated 555,000 (0.05%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.04% to 0.06%) were related to SVT. The annual frequency and population rate appear stable between 1993 and 2003 (p for trend = 0.35). Compared with non-SVT visits, those with SVT were more likely to be older than 65 years of age (26% vs. 15%, p < 0.01) and female (70% vs. 53%, p < 0.01). Electrocardiograms were documented for most visits (91%; 95% CI = 85% to 96%). Approximately half of the patients (51%; 95% CI = 40% to 61%) received an atrioventricular nodal blocking medication, most frequently adenosine (26%; 95% CI = 17% to 36%). SVT visits ended in hospital admission for 24% (95% CI = 15% to 34%). At the other extreme, 44% (95% CI = 32% to 56%) were discharged without planned follow-up.

Conclusions

Supraventricular tachycardia accounts for approximately 50,000 ED visits each year. Higher visit rates in older adults and female patients are consistent with prior studies of SVT in the general population. This study provides an epidemiologic foundation that will enable future research to assess and improve clinical management strategies of SVT in the ED.

European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) consensus — recommendation grading and symbols define three levels: a "green heart" indicates a recommended statement or "Recommended/indicated" treatment based on "at least one randomized trial, or… supported by large observational evidence that it is beneficial and effective"; a "yellow heart" indicates "general agreement and/or scientific evidence favouring… usefulness/efficacy" and "may be supported by randomized trials based on small number of patients or not widely applicable"; a "red heart" marks strategies with scientific evidence that "they are potentially harmful and should not be used", corresponding to "Should NOT be used or recommended". Table 1 maps these to consensus statements "Recommended/indicated", "May be used or recommended", and "Should NOT be used or recommended", and notes this categorization "should not be considered as being directly similar" to guideline classifications "(I–III)" and levels "(A, B, and C)". The document adds that a "green heart" "rarely can be given for women due to lack of evidence".

Myocardial infarction — Two myocardial infarction definitions are recommended by the workgroup: the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction as a general definition for events of interest, and the definition from the 2017 consensus statement on catheter ablation for myocardial infarction as a complication of surgical or catheter ablation. The Third Universal Definition divides myocardial infarction into five types; Type II is generally felt to be due to supply and demand ischemia and may occur in patients with AF with a rapid ventricular response, so registries may need to specify type I or type II or exclude type II events.

### Association of of atrial fibrillation clinical phenotypes with treatment patterns and outcomes: a multicenter registry study [^2a274f7c]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is usually classified on the basis of the disease subtype. However, this characterization does not capture the full heterogeneity of AF, and a data-driven cluster analysis reveals different possible classifications of patients.

Objective

To characterize patients with AF based on a cluster analysis and to evaluate the association between these phenotypes, treatment, and clinical outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cluster analysis used data from an observational cohort that included 9749 patients with AF who had been admitted to 174 US sites participating in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF) registry. Data analysis was completed from January 2017 to October 2017.

Exposure

Patients with diagnosed AF who were included in the registry.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Composite of major adverse cardiovascular or neurological events and major bleeding, as defined by the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis criteria.

Results

Of 9749 total patients, 4150 (42.6%) were female; 8719 (89.4%) were white and 477 (4.9%) were African American. A cluster analysis was performed using 60 baseline clinical characteristics, and it classified patients with AF into 4 statistically driven clusters: (1) those with considerably lower rates of risk factors and comorbidities than all other clusters (n = 4673); (2) those with AF at younger ages and/or with comorbid behavioral disorders (n = 963); (3) those with AF who had similarities to patients with tachycardia-brachycardia and had device implantation owing to sinus node dysfunction (n = 1651); and (4) those with AF and prior coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and/or atherosclerotic comorbidities (n = 2462). Conventional classifications, such as AF subtype and left atrial size, did not drive cluster formation. Compared with the low comorbidity AF cluster, adjusted risks of major adverse cardiovascular or neurological events were significantly higher in the other 3 clusters (behavioral comorbidity cluster: hazard ratio [HR], 1.49; 95% CI, 1.10–2.00; device implantation cluster: HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.15–1.68; and atherosclerotic comorbidity cluster: HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.31–1.92). For major bleeding, adjusted risks were higher in the behavioral disorder comorbidity cluster (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.05–1.73), those with device implantation (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05–1.47), and those with atherosclerotic comorbidities (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.96–1.33) compared with the low comorbidity cluster. The same clusters were identified in an external validation in the ORBIT AF II registry.

Conclusions and Relevance

Cluster analysis identified 4 clinically relevant phenotypes of AF that each have distinct associations with clinical outcomes, underscoring the heterogeneity of AF and importance of comorbidities and substrates.

Denominator ARDS identification approach — to balance feasibility and sensitivity, an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code–only denominator akin to NQF 0500 was contemplated but rejected because many patients with ARDS are not recognized by clinicians and an ICD-10-CM–based PM would have low sensitivity and limited impact; an alternative higher-sensitivity definition including all mechanically ventilated acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was also rejected because LTVV may not benefit patients without ARDS and ATS PMs must remain evidence based; instead, to improve specificity, the committee opted for a strategy similar to NQF 3215 requiring electronic health record data extraction for Berlin Definition criteria, ventilator settings, ARDS risk factors, echocardiogram, and other evidence of cardiac dysfunction, despite added complexity judged necessary to support a meaningful PM.

Methods

The study findings are reported in accordance with the Reporting of Studies Conducted Using Observational Routinely Collected Health Data recommendations and CODE-EHR framework.

Data source

We used EHRs from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) from 1 January 2001, to 30 November 2018. Clinical Practice Research Datalink is one of the largest databases of longitudinal primary care records in the world and contains anonymized patient data from ∼7% of the UK population, providing a cohort which is broadly representative of the general population in terms of age, sex, and ethnicity. In order to contribute to the database, general practices and other health centres must meet pre-specified standards for research quality data ('up-to-standard'). Diagnostic coding for AF in CPRD has been shown to be consistent and valid, with a positive predictive value of 98%. Primary care records were linked to hospital admissions using Hospital Episodes Statistics Admitted Patient Care data and mortality data from the Office for National Statistics. Scientific approval for this study was given by the CPRD Independent Scientific Advisory Committee.

Study population

Patients eligible for inclusion were all individuals aged 16 years and older who were registered with their general practice for at least 12 months. To identify AF cases between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2017, we used a list of 11 diagnostic codes from hospital (International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision) and primary care (Read) coding schemes that included both AF and atrial flutter (see Supplementary data online, Table S1). We defined a new AF diagnosis as the first record of AF in primary care or hospital admission records from any diagnostic position. We excluded all individuals who had a diagnosis of AF before the study start date or within the first 12 months of registration with their general practice.

Study outcomes

We investigated mortality rates at 1 year following diagnosis as well as the number of hospital admissions with an overnight stay within 1 year of diagnosis (not counting the index admission for those who received their diagnosis in the hospital). The cause of death was recorded in the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death. The cause of hospitalization was defined as the primary discharge diagnosis. Causes of death and hospitalization were mapped to 9 and 11 disease categories, respectively (see Supplementary data online, Table S2). In subgroup analyses, disease categories were further grouped into cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and non-cardio/cerebrovascular causes (see Supplementary data online, Table S2) to reflect that many AF-specific therapies have sought to reduce cardiovascular events and stroke.

### Institutional variation in 30-day complications following catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation [^858a9ff0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Cohort

We included patients > 18 years old hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of AF (ICD‐10‐AM codes I48, I48.0‐2, and I48.9) and underwent catheter ablation as defined by Australian Classification of Health Interventions procedure codes 38287‐01, 38287‐02 and 38290‐01. The use of the AF diagnosis code together with catheter ablation code has shown high specificity (100%) and sensitivity (87.3%) in identifying AF ablation procedures.

We excluded patients who had other arrhythmias as a secondary diagnosis to ensure the catheter ablation was for AF; had an implanted cardiovascular implantable electronic device (pacemaker, implantable cardioverter defibrillator, or cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker or defibrillator) during the index or previous admissions to avoid including patients undergoing atrioventricular nodal ablation for AF rate control; underwent open (surgical) ablation; were discharged against medical advice; had prior catheter ablation within 30 days since a complication may relate to the previous rather than the index ablation; or lacked at least 30 days follow‐up after the procedure to assess complications. We also excluded acute (unplanned) hospitalizations to ensure that the complications were procedure related rather than attributable to the underlying acute illness. Table S1 provides a full description of diagnoses and procedure codes used to define inclusion and exclusion criteria.
