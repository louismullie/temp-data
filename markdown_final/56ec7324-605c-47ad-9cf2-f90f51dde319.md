## Question

What factors can lead to infertility?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about factors that can lead to infertility. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing the precise clinical definition and timeframes that trigger evaluation. Then, I should determine the distribution of causation across male, female, combined, and unexplained categories. Next, I will categorize etiologies by mechanism for males and females, consider shared lifestyle, environmental, medical, and iatrogenic contributors, and integrate immunologic and age-related effects. After that, I should synthesize the construct of unexplained infertility and its emerging genetic underpinnings. Finally, I will map these data to a practical, parallel evaluation algorithm for both partners and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary, while verifying each step against high-credibility guidelines and reviews [^1139X2JU] [^114Yosyt] [^112ijCDS] [^112sqXaf].

> Let me first confirm the clinical definition before proceeding any further, because timing thresholds impact when we call something infertility and how urgently we evaluate; infertility is defined as the failure to achieve pregnancy after 12 months of regular, unprotected intercourse, with the threshold shortened to 6 months when the female partner is older than 35 years, and this framing anchors both epidemiology and triage pathways [^1139X2JU] [^114Yosyt] [^115Pyeb6].

> Wait, let me verify the attribution distribution so I do not overstate any single domain; infertility is commonly apportioned as male-factor alone in roughly 20–30% of cases, female-factor alone in roughly 20–30%, combined factors in roughly 20–30%, with 10–25% categorized as unexplained after standard work-up, acknowledging heterogeneity across cohorts and methods [^1139X2JU] [^116FBmJR].

> I will now examine male-specific etiologies by mechanism, but hold on, I should verify that I span anatomic, endocrine, genetic, and gamete function domains; key contributors include varicocele, cryptorchidism, and genital tract obstruction causing obstructive azoospermia; hypothalamic–pituitary disorders producing hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and testosterone deficiency; hyperprolactinemia suppressing gonadotropins; genetic disorders such as Klinefelter syndrome, Y-chromosome microdeletions, and CFTR-related congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens; and sperm dysfunction involving oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, teratozoospermia, and oxidative DNA damage, all of which must be contextualized with semen analysis and targeted testing [^1139X2JU] [^117RhcLV] [^117FQPjR].

> Next, I should review female-specific etiologies, and let me double-check that I include both structural and ovulatory domains; uterine and endometrial factors such as fibroids and polyps can impair implantation, tubal disease from infection, endometriosis, or adhesions can impede gamete transport, and ovulatory disorders including PCOS, hypothalamic amenorrhea, diminished ovarian reserve, and hyperprolactinemia alter folliculogenesis and ovulation, with diagnosis guided by history, exam, ultrasound or hysterosalpingography, and targeted hormonal testing [^114Yosyt] [^115GasT8] [^114qMx9G] [^114XiTQi] [^117FQPjR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions and ignore shared or modifiable risks; in both sexes, obesity, low physical activity, tobacco use, and high alcohol intake adversely impact reproductive hormones and gamete quality, environmental and occupational exposures such as pesticides, heavy metals, and air pollution are associated with impaired fertility metrics, and medical comorbidities like diabetes, malignancy and its therapies, and chronic opioid or anabolic steroid exposure further suppress reproductive axes, while age exerts a steep effect on female fecundity after 35 and a gradual effect on male sperm integrity after 40, all of which warrant counseling and risk modification where feasible [^112ijCDS] [^1139X2JU] [^116h4aUf] [^111UxXvP] [^112W91BZ] [^11461Vjg].

> I need to check immunologic and emerging mechanistic factors so I do not overlook less obvious contributors; antisperm antibodies can impair sperm function in select contexts, and novel data suggest immune cell exhaustion signatures in certain male infertility phenotypes, indicating that immune dysregulation may be mechanistically relevant in a subset of cases [^1139X2JU] [^116FBmJR].

> Let me think about unexplained infertility and ensure I do not conflate it with insufficient testing; when standard evaluation of semen quality, ovulation and ovarian reserve, tubal patency, and uterine cavity is unrevealing, the label unexplained infertility is applied, but wait, emerging evidence points to occult genetic and thrombophilic contributors that may account for a fraction of these cases and could eventually refine categorization as diagnostics evolve [^114Yosyt] [^1125J1GZ] [^1161TnQy].

> I should confirm the distinction between non-modifiable and modifiable drivers, because this shapes counseling; non-modifiable factors include congenital anomalies, chromosomal disorders, and irreversible gonadotoxic injury or age-related decline, whereas modifiable domains include adiposity, smoking, alcohol intake, low physical activity, poorly controlled diabetes, certain medications, and some environmental exposures, with guideline-backed advice to optimize lifestyle to improve chances of conception and, in selected men, to consider endocrine therapies when indicated by phenotype and labs [^112ijCDS] [^114Yosyt] [^1176cw7J].

> Next, I should review the evaluation framework and verify that I emphasize parallel assessment for both partners; guidelines recommend concurrent evaluation of male and female partners beginning with history, focused physical examination, semen analysis for the male, and assessment of ovulation, ovarian reserve, and uterine–tubal anatomy for the female, escalating to targeted hormonal testing, selective imaging, and genetic testing when clinically indicated, while avoiding low-yield routine imaging such as abdominal scans for small right-sided varicoceles and coordinating care to inform decisions about timed intercourse, ovulation induction, intrauterine insemination, IVF, or ICSI as appropriate [^112sqXaf] [^116VvMTb] [^117NBoqJ] [^113GQYqb] [^113u7ssi] [^114xT5bZ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially considered using a simplistic "one-third male, one-third female, one-third both" split, but I should correct that to align with higher-quality evidence; more precise estimates show male-only and female-only factors each account for about 20–30% and combined for another 20–30%, with a remaining 10–25% unexplained, reflecting cohort and method variability rather than fixed thirds [^1139X2JU] [^116FBmJR].

> Let me reconsider the timing threshold one more time to avoid an oversight; I first defaulted to 12 months uniformly, but for female partners older than 35, evaluation after 6 months is appropriate because fecundity drops and time to treatment matters, which I should emphasize to prevent delays in care [^114Yosyt] [^115Pyeb6].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis remains clinically actionable: infertility arises from intersecting anatomic, ovulatory–endocrine, genetic, immunologic, lifestyle, environmental, medical, iatrogenic, and age-related factors that distribute across male and female partners, with a nontrivial unexplained fraction that is shrinking as genomics advances, and best practice is a parallel, least-invasive-first evaluation coupled with risk-factor modification and timely escalation to evidence-based therapies, informed throughout by guideline-directed counseling and shared decision-making [^1139X2JU] [^114Yosyt] [^112ijCDS] [^112sqXaf].

Infertility is defined as the **inability to conceive after 12 months** [^114Yosyt] of regular, unprotected intercourse; evaluation is recommended after 6 months for women older than 35 years [^115Pyeb6]. The main causes include **ovulatory disorders** [^114Yosyt] (e.g. PCOS, hyperprolactinemia, thyroid dysfunction), **tubal or uterine abnormalities** (e.g. endometriosis, fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease), and **male factors** [^1139X2JU] (e.g. abnormal semen parameters, hormonal imbalances, genetic abnormalities). Lifestyle factors such as **obesity, smoking, alcohol, and environmental exposures** also contribute to infertility [^112ijCDS] [^112HcktP]. A **comprehensive evaluation of both partners** [^112sqXaf] is essential to identify and address these causes [^113u7ssi].

---

## Female causes of infertility

### Ovulatory disorders

- **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**: A common endocrine disorder causing irregular ovulation or anovulation, often associated with insulin resistance and obesity [^117Kbn2A] [^114XiTQi].

- **Hyperprolactinemia**: Elevated prolactin levels suppress gonadotropin secretion, leading to ovulatory dysfunction [^117FQPjR].

- **Thyroid dysfunction**: Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can disrupt menstrual cycles and ovulation [^116tWQji].

- **Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)**: Early depletion of ovarian follicles, often due to genetic factors or autoimmune disorders [^113GQYqb].

---

### Tubal and uterine abnormalities

- **Endometriosis**: Ectopic endometrial tissue causes inflammation, adhesions, and tubal blockage [^113GQYqb].

- **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)**: Often due to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), leading to tubal scarring and blockage [^114Yosyt].

- **Uterine fibroids**: Benign tumors that can distort the uterine cavity, impair implantation, or cause miscarriage [^114Yosyt].

- **Congenital uterine anomalies**: Structural abnormalities such as septate uterus or bicornuate uterus [^113GQYqb].

---

### Other female factors

Other female factors include **advanced maternal age**, with fertility declining significantly after age 35 [^112W91BZ] because of reduced ovarian reserve and oocyte quality, and **lifestyle factors** — such as obesity [^115J9KMo], smoking [^114wK6NX], excessive alcohol consumption [^112ijCDS], and stress — that negatively impact fertility.

---

## Male causes of infertility

### Sperm production and function abnormalities

- **Abnormal semen parameters**: Low sperm count (oligozoospermia), poor motility (asthenozoospermia), or abnormal morphology (teratozoospermia) [^1139X2JU].

- **Genetic abnormalities**: Klinefelter syndrome, Y-chromosome microdeletions, and cystic fibrosis mutations [^116sWbVj].

- **Hormonal imbalances**: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia, and testosterone deficiency [^116VvMTb].

---

### Structural and functional abnormalities

Structural and functional abnormalities include **varicocele** [^111KPJtz], in which enlarged scrotal veins impair sperm production and quality, and **obstructive azoospermia** caused by blockage of the vas deferens or epididymis, often due to congenital absence or prior infection [^1139X2JU]. Ejaculatory dysfunction also contributes, such as **retrograde ejaculation** [^117A3GjA] or **erectile dysfunction**.

---

### Lifestyle and environmental factors

Lifestyle risks — including **obesity, smoking, alcohol, and drug use** — negatively impact sperm quality and testosterone levels [^112ijCDS] [^1143wG6U]. Environmental exposures, such as **pesticides, heavy metals, radiation, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals**, also contribute [^116h4aUf].

---

## Combined and unexplained infertility

**Combined infertility** occurs when both partners have identifiable contributing factors, whereas **unexplained infertility** is diagnosed when no cause is found despite thorough evaluation [^112dwU5N] and accounts for approximately 10–20% of cases [^113GQYqb].

---

## Evaluation and diagnosis

A **comprehensive evaluation of both partners** [^112sqXaf] is essential and includes medical history and physical examination [^113GQYqb] to identify risk factors and underlying conditions; laboratory tests such as hormonal assays [^116VvMTb], semen analysis [^1139X2JU], and genetic testing [^117RhcLV]; and imaging studies, including ultrasound, hysterosalpingography [^114Yosyt], and MRI, to assess reproductive anatomy.

---

Infertility is a complex condition with multiple causes, including **ovulatory disorders; tubal and uterine abnormalities; sperm production and function abnormalities; and lifestyle factors**. A **comprehensive evaluation of both partners** is essential to identify and address these causes [^116QxwXj].

### Diagnosis and management of infertility: A review [^1139X2JU]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on male infertility:

- **Definition**: Male infertility is defined as the inability to achieve pregnancy in a fertile female partner after 12 months of regular unprotected sexual intercourse.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of male infertility involves several mechanisms: hormonal imbalances, such as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism as well as androgen insensitivity; testicular dysfunction, usually due to varicocele or cryptorchidism; genital tract obstruction (obstructive azoospermia), such as epididymal, vas deferens, intratesticular, or ejaculatory duct obstruction; genetic abnormalities, such as Klinefelter syndrome, Y-chromosome microdeletions, and cystic fibrosis; and oxidative stress and DNA fragmentation in sperm.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of male infertility in the US is estimated at 11.4% in men aged 15–49 years and 12.8% in men aged 25–49 years.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for male infertility can include older age, lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol use, drug use), environmental exposures (pesticides, heavy metals, radiation), comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, malignancy), and certain medications (such as anabolic steroids).

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of male infertility can vary greatly. In some cases, infertility can be treated with lifestyle changes or medical treatment, while others may require assisted reproductive technologies.

### Infertility: Evaluation and management [^114Yosyt]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Infertility is defined as the inability to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse. Evaluation and treatment are recommended earlier than 12 months when risk factors for infertility exist, such as if the female partner is 35 years or older or in the setting of nonheterosexual partnerships. A comprehensive medical history and physical examination, emphasizing the thyroid, breast, and pelvic areas, should be performed to help direct diagnosis and treatment.

- **Causes of infertility in females include**: Uterine and tubal factors, ovarian reserve issues, ovulatory dysfunction, obesity, and hormone-related disorders.

- **Common male factor infertility issues include**: Abnormal semen, hormonal disorders, and genetic abnormalities.

Semen analysis is recommended for the initial assessment of the male partner. Evaluation of the female should include assessment of the uterus and fallopian tubes with ultrasonography or hysterosalpingography when indicated. Laparoscopy, hysteroscopy, or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed to evaluate for endometriosis, leiomyomas, or evidence of a previous pelvic infection.

- **Treatment options**: Ovulation induction agents, intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization, donor sperm or eggs, or surgery may be necessary.

Unexplained male and female infertility can be treated with intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization. Limiting alcohol intake, avoiding tobacco and illicit drug use, consuming a profertility diet, and losing weight (if obese) may improve pregnancy success rates.

### Female subfertility [^111ZivWR]. The Lancet (2002). Low credibility.

With an average monthly fecundity rate of only 20%, human beings are not fertile mammals. Approximately 10–15% of couples encounter difficulties conceiving or achieving the desired number of children, prompting them to seek specialist fertility care at least once during their reproductive lifetime. Dependent on the two main factors that determine subfertility — duration of childlessness and age of the woman — three questions need to be addressed before treatment is offered. Is it time to start the routine fertility investigation, i.e. has sufficient exposure to the chance of conception taken place? Are cost-effective, safe, and reliable treatments available for the disorder diagnosed? And should the couple be referred straightaway for assisted reproduction?

### Assisted reproductive technology: Short- and long-term outcomes [^111E3amJ]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Infertility is defined as a disease of the male or female reproductive system, characterized by the failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. While global epidemiological data are variable in content and depth, infertility affects as many as 186 million people worldwide. Male infertility is an underlying cause in approximately one-third of couples, female infertility in one-third, and the remaining one-third is undetermined or involves both partners. Male infertility can result from various causes, including genetic mutations, medical illnesses, medications, and lifestyle factors. Female infertility is often associated with reduced ovarian reserve, ovulatory dysfunction, and structural abnormalities. Stress, anxiety, and depression are proposed as risk factors but have not been definitively established.

For some couples, fertility education is sufficient for conception. Recommendations include appropriate timing of intercourse or making lifestyle changes, such as cessation of smoking and drug use, or dietary modifications. For others, treatment options may include hormones to promote ovulation, medical treatment of disorders like diabetes, or surgical procedures for tubal occlusion, which may lead to a successful pregnancy. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) can be considered when these approaches are unsuccessful.

When a patient undergoing ART has concerns about a possible genetic disorder, preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) is often utilized. There are three types of PGT currently available: PGT-aneuploidy, PGT-monogenic, and PGT-structural rearrangement. PGT-aneuploidy is especially helpful in cases where there is a risk of embryo genetic abnormalities.

### Contemporary approaches to the management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111eTeoJ]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder in women in their reproductive years, characterized by androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology. It is associated with several metabolic abnormalities, particularly insulin resistance and obesity, which play an important role in the pathophysiology of PCOS. These factors, in particular, negatively influence ovarian function and fertility. This review article summarizes the available treatment options for women with PCOS and discusses potentially new therapies.

### History of infertility and sexual dysfunction in midlife women: Is there a link [^1111HkoY]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Infertility has been linked with an increased risk of sexual dysfunction in reproductive-aged women, with longer periods of infertility associated with a greater risk.

- **Aim**: The study aimed to examine whether a history of infertility treatment in women is linked to sexual dysfunction during midlife.

- **Methods**: The cross-sectional study was conducted among sexually active women between the ages of 45 and 65 years, who sought consultation at women's health clinics at a US tertiary care center. History of infertility treatment was assessed with a single question that asked participants if they were treated for infertility in the past. The association between a history of infertility treatment and sexual dysfunction — which was diagnosed by a combination of Female Sexual Function Index score ≤ 26.55 and Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised score ≥ 11 — was assessed in a multivariable logistic regression model that adjusted for multiple confounders.

- **Outcomes**: The primary outcome was sexual dysfunction in midlife women.

- **Results**: The analysis included 5912 women, with a mean age of 54.1 years. Nearly 16% of women reported receiving treatment for infertility. More than half the women (55%) had sexual dysfunction: 56.3% of those with previous fertility treatments and 54.4% of those without any fertility treatment (P = .3). Receiving treatment for infertility in the younger years did not significantly increase the odds of sexual dysfunction in midlife in univariate (odds ratio: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.94–1.24; p = 0.3) and multivariable analyses (odds ratio: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.96–1.29).

### Male infertility [^117UX2fk]. Lancet (2021). Low credibility.

It is estimated that infertility affects 8–12% of couples globally, with a male factor being a primary or contributing cause in approximately 50% of cases. Causes of male subfertility vary highly, related to congenital, acquired, or idiopathic factors that impair spermatogenesis. Many health conditions can affect male fertility, underscoring the need for a thorough evaluation of patients to identify treatable or reversible lifestyle factors or medical conditions. Although semen analysis remains the cornerstone for evaluating male infertility, advanced diagnostic tests have been developed to investigate sperm quality and function, improving diagnosis and management. The use of assisted reproductive techniques has also substantially improved the ability of couples with infertility to have biological children. This Seminar aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the assessment and management of men with infertility, along with controversies and future endeavors.

### Specific types of male infertility are correlated with T cell exhaustion or senescence signatures [^116FBmJR]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Infertility affects up to 15% of couples worldwide. A pure male factor is responsible for about 20% of cases and is a contributing factor in up to 30% of all infertility cases. After a diagnostic work-up, at least one underlying cause of male infertility can be identified in most cases. The interest in understanding both the causes and consequences of male infertility has steadily grown over the last years. Several findings have contributed to redefining infertility from an epiphenomenon to a disease in itself and a clinical proxy of poorer general health status compared to age-matched fertile men. Indeed, infertile men are at high risk of premature development of non-malignant and malignant non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in a relatively short timeframe. Likewise, infertility has been associated with a high mortality risk, mostly observed in severely infertile individuals.

### Are sex and gender dimensions accounted for in NICE guidelines? A systematic review of 223 clinical guidelines [^1129R184]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Of a total of 223 NICE clinical guidelines, 197 covered non-sex-specific conditions and were included in this review. Of these, 120 guidelines (61%) included information on sex and/or gender dimensions, and 81 (41%) referenced sex and/or gender dimensions outside pregnancy and childbirth considerations.

Of the 197 reviewed guidelines, only one guideline, addressing fertility issues (CG156), achieved a 'Category 1' rating (0.5%), meaning it provided evidence-informed recommendations supporting different or shared approaches for men and women. Ten guidelines (5%) included sex and/or gender-specific reference values for laboratory data or clinical scoring systems ('Category 2'). Seventy-seven guidelines (39%) made no mention of sex or gender dimensions ('Category 5'), and 68 (35%) made only superficial mention of sex and/or gender dimensions, for instance, only in the context of pregnant women ('Category 4'). The average rating across reviewed guidelines was 4.07, where 5 represented the least consideration of sex and gender dimensions, and 1 represented the most.

- **Figure 2**: Number of NICE clinical guidelines according to the rating category they achieved. NICE, National Institute for Clinical Excellence.

Only four guidelines (2%) referenced sex and/or gender dimensions of disease pathophysiology. Examples include the role of menopause in worsening bone density in women (CG146) or the explanation that a significant proportion of male infertility likely results from abnormalities of genes on the Y chromosome.

### Population and fertility by age and sex for 195 countries and territories, 1950–2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 [^1151exfS]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Fertility data are obtained from vital registration systems, complete birth histories, or summary birth histories. Complete birth histories include the date of birth and, if applicable, the dates of death of all children ever born alive to each woman that is interviewed, whereas summary birth histories include the total number of children ever born alive to each mother and the total number of those children born alive to each mother that have died. In countries with complete birth registration, vital registration systems typically provide tabulations of births by age of the mother. Since 1890, some censuses have asked about the number of children ever born to a woman, and this question has been widely asked in censuses and many household surveys over the past 70 years.

Starting in the 1970s, fertility information has also been collected through complete birth histories, beginning with the World Fertility Survey, followed by the Demographic and Health Surveys, and, in some countries, the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys sponsored by the UN Children's Fund. We identified 977 censuses and household surveys that had summary birth history data, 429 household surveys that had complete birth history data, and 7,817 country-years of birth registration systems through searches of national statistical sources and the Demographic Yearbooks produced by the UN Statistics Division from 1948 to present. The number and type of sources for each location are provided in appendix 1 (section 5). The appendix provides the metadata for all these sources.

Given the heterogeneous nature of the data (vital registration systems, complete birth histories, summary birth histories), the study ensures comprehensive and systematic analysis across different time periods and locations.

### Long term exposure to road traffic noise and air pollution and risk of infertility in men and women: Nationwide Danish cohort study [^116h4aUf]. BMJ (2024). Low credibility.

Infertility is a major global health problem affecting one in seven couples trying to conceive. It affects all geographical areas of the world, with some of the highest rates observed in South and Central Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, North Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe. Infertility is defined as the lack of conception after one year of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse. The use of various assisted reproductive technologies has increased noticeably since the 1980s, and more than 10 million children have been conceived using such technologies worldwide. Infertility in both men and women is associated with various long-term adverse health effects, including shorter life expectancy and an increased risk of various psychiatric disorders and somatic diseases. Furthermore, infertility is often a harsh experience, with a high level of physical and psychological strain, including high stress levels, anxiety, and symptoms of depression.

Many of the established risk factors for infertility are similar for men and women and include advanced age (especially for women, where fertility drops rapidly after the late 30s), tobacco and alcohol use, sexually transmitted infections, various chronic conditions and diseases, obesity, and severe underweight. In addition, exposure to environmental factors such as air pollution, pesticides, and ionizing radiation are suspected risk factors for infertility. Ambient air pollution is a major environmental pollutant causing cardiometabolic and respiratory morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, during the past decade, the relationship between environmental exposures and infertility has gained significant attention.

### Unexplained infertility: Association with inherited thrombophilia [^1125J1GZ]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Unexplained infertility represents one of the most common diagnoses in fertility care. Attention is being paid to the association between inherited thrombophilia and infertility causes. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of inherited thrombophilia according to infertility causes.

- **Materials and methods**: We studied prothrombin gene G20210A mutation, Factor V Leiden, deficiencies in protein S and C, and antithrombin in 930 Caucasian infertile women referred to the Fertility Center of the Department of Sciences for Women's and Child's Health, University of Florence. This included 230 cases of unexplained infertility, 195 cases of female infertility, 283 cases of male infertility, and 240 women who conceived naturally without hormonal stimulation therapy.

- **Results**: A significant relationship between inherited thrombophilia [OR 95% CI 1.97 (1.05–3.68), p = 0.03] and unexplained infertility was observed, whereas no association between thrombophilia and female and male infertility was found. A significantly higher prevalence of prothrombin gene mutation in unexplained infertile women compared to fertile women was observed (5.7% vs. 2.1%, p = 0.04); the prevalence of the other thrombophilia determinants was higher, even if not significantly, in the unexplained infertile group.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates the relationship between inherited thrombophilia and unexplained infertility, thus suggesting the contribution of genetic components in modulating unexplained infertility, beyond anovulation, male, and tubal factors.

### Limitations and barriers in access to care for male factor infertility [^1166DREk]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

The primary challenge to identifying and addressing barriers in access to care for male factor infertility is the accurate measurement of the prevalence of male infertility. Estimates are based on couples pursuing assisted reproduction and likely underestimate the problem. These estimates also fail to account for the number of patients facing infertility due to cancer or cancer treatment. Lack of health insurance coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of infertility presents a major barrier for couples struggling with infertility. However, it is not the only barrier. Education level, household income, cultural norms, religious beliefs, geographic location, and the availability of specialty-trained reproductive urologists are all important factors in determining the ease with which patients access and obtain infertility care. Addressing each of these obstacles directly is imperative to improving reproductive care and outcomes for infertile couples in the United States.

In Western countries, infertility affects at least 15% of couples during reproductive age, and in 50% of all cases, a male factor contributes significantly. Impaired spermatogenesis can be attributed to oncologic or genetic causes in 4% to 10% of infertile men. This leaves about 72% of infertile men without clear etiologic factors, insufficient to explain their impaired fertility status. Among infertile men with unknown etiology, two conditions are distinguished: unexplained and idiopathic male infertility. Unexplained infertility comprises men in whom female and other etiologic factors are absent; these men show normozoospermia in their semen analyses. In contrast, idiopathic infertile men also lack etiologic and female factors but display abnormal semen parameters. In this heterogeneous condition, there is an urgent need to improve diagnostic workup by identifying genetic and endocrine factors influencing spermatogenesis.

The pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is essential for the initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis in humans. During prenatal and prepubertal stages, FSH stimulates Sertoli cell (SC) proliferation, determining their final number and potential for spermatogenic output. In the adult testis, FSH is crucial for qualitative and quantitative spermatogenesis. Together with testosterone, it signals for germ cell maturation via the SCs, initiates signaling for antiapoptotic survival factors, and facilitates adhesion complexes between SCs and germ cells.

### Anxiety and sexual stress in men and women undergoing infertility treatment [^117KmgqP]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

To better understand the specific nature of the relationship between anxiety and sexual infertility-related stress in men and women, a prospective study was conducted at a university-affiliated teaching hospital. The study involved consecutively referred patients who were undergoing in vitro fertilization and intrauterine insemination, including 306 women and 295 men.

The main outcome measures utilized were the Fertility Problem Inventory (FPI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Results indicated that women reported greater anxiety and sexual infertility stress than men. However, both genders exhibited a similar pattern concerning the relationship between anxiety symptoms and sexual infertility stress, with subjective anxiety and autonomic anxiety showing the strongest connection. Anxiety symptoms were found to account for a significant proportion of the variance in sexual infertility stress for both sexes and forecasted sexual stress to a considerable degree in men.

The conclusion drawn from the study was that there is more similarity than difference in how men and women experience anxiety and sexual infertility stress. The strong connection between anxiety and sexual stress in men was unexpected, as men typically report lower levels of sexual stress and anxiety. The findings suggest that sexual stress among infertile men may be more closely related to performance anxiety rather than a general decrease in sexual satisfaction associated with infertility.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome [^114XiTQi]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2024). Low credibility.

Despite affecting approximately 11–13% of women globally, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remains a substantially understudied condition. PCOS, possibly extending to men's health, imposes a considerable health and economic burden worldwide. Diagnosis in adults follows the International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, requiring two out of three criteria: clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and/or specific ovarian morphological characteristics or elevated anti-Müllerian hormone. However, diagnosing adolescents omits ovarian morphology and anti-Müllerian hormone considerations.

PCOS, marked by insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, strongly contributes to early-onset type 2 diabetes, with increased odds for cardiovascular diseases. Reproduction-related implications include irregular menstrual cycles, anovulatory infertility, and heightened risks of pregnancy complications and endometrial cancer. Beyond physiological manifestations, PCOS is associated with anxiety, depression, eating disorders, psychosexual dysfunction, and negative body image, collectively contributing to a diminished health-related quality of life in patients.

Despite its high prevalence persisting into menopause, diagnosing PCOS often involves extended timelines and multiple health-care visits. Treatment remains ad hoc owing to a limited understanding of underlying mechanisms, highlighting the need for research delineating the aetiology and pathophysiology of the syndrome. Identifying factors contributing to PCOS will pave the way for personalized medicine.

### Management of female infertility from hormonal causes [^116tWQji]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2013). Low credibility.

Hormonal causes of female infertility involve ovulatory dysfunctions that may result from dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, peripheral endocrine glands, nonendocrine organs, or metabolic disorders. It is important to consider anovulation not as a diagnosis but as a symptom of a metabolic or endocrine disorder that requires a thorough diagnostic evaluation to identify the specific cause and implement effective therapies that assure the best possible pregnancy outcome and avoid long-term adverse health consequences. In most instances, the medical history points to the underlying dysfunction, which can usually be confirmed with laboratory or imaging tests. For more challenging cases, more extensive evaluations may be needed, including perturbation studies.

Nevertheless, the management of anovulatory infertility is gratifying because its causes are often manifest, and the treatment usually results in the resumption of ovulatory cycles, restoration of fertility, and healthy offspring through natural conception without requiring expensive and intrusive assisted reproductive technologies.

### Consideration of gender differences in infertility evaluation [^115BpS2p]. Current Opinion in Urology (2019). Low credibility.

We aim to provide a review of the literature to summarize the potential causes that lead to a disparity in infertility evaluation and the implications of male factor infertility.

- **Recent findings**: Owing to social constructs, women are more likely to seek medical attention and establish reproductive health evaluations at an earlier age. The male factor evaluation in infertility usually gets delayed and can contribute to a couple's inability to conceive. Furthermore, the cost of assisted reproductive technology is not inconsequential, and identifying reversible causes of male infertility could lead to substantial cost-savings for the couple. Additionally, male infertility has been identified as a potential early surrogate for adverse health outcomes, and early identification could serve to counsel these patients on lifestyle modification.

- **Summary**: Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of unprotected intercourse, with 15% of couples reporting difficulties in conception. Traditionally, female factor evaluation has been the driver for the infertility workup. It is estimated that male factor is likely to play a role in 50% of infertile couples, with sole contribution in 20% of cases. It is therefore crucial to ensure appropriate investigations of both partners to rule out potentially reversible causes of infertility to improve their chances of natural fecundity.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): The Amsterdam ESHRE/ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^117Kbn2A]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in females, with a high prevalence. The etiology of this heterogeneous condition remains obscure, and its phenotype expression varies. Two widely cited previous ESHRE/ASRM-sponsored PCOS consensus workshops focused on diagnosis (published in 2004) and infertility management (published in 2008). The present third PCOS consensus report summarizes knowledge and identifies knowledge gaps regarding various women's health aspects of PCOS.

- **Relevant topics addressed**: All dealt with in a systematic fashion, include adolescence, hirsutism and acne, contraception, menstrual cycle abnormalities, quality of life, ethnicity, pregnancy complications, long-term metabolic and cardiovascular health, and finally cancer risk.

Additional, comprehensive background information is provided separately in an extended online publication.

### Increased infertility with age in men and women [^112W91BZ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of aging on the percentage of outwardly healthy couples who are sterile, completely unable to conceive without assisted reproduction, or infertile, unable to conceive within a year of unprotected intercourse.

Methods involved a prospective fecundability study conducted with a sample of 782 couples recruited from seven European centers for natural family planning, where women aged 18–40 years were eligible. Daily intercourse records were used to adjust for timing and frequency of intercourse when estimating the per-menstrual-cycle probability of conception. The number of menstrual cycles required to conceive a clinical pregnancy and the probability of sterility and infertility were derived from the estimated fecundability distributions for men and women of different ages.

Results indicated that sterility was estimated at about 1%, and this percentage did not change with age. The percentage of infertility was estimated at 8% for women aged 19–26 years, 13–14% for women aged 27–34 years, and 18% for women aged 35–39 years. Starting in the late 30s, male age became an important factor, with the percentage failing to conceive within 12 cycles increasing from an estimated 18–28% between ages 35 and 40 years. The estimated percentage of infertile couples that would be able to conceive after an additional 12 cycles of trying varied from 43–63% depending on age.

The conclusion drawn was that increased infertility in older couples is attributable primarily to declines in fertility rates rather than to absolute sterility. Many infertile couples will conceive if they try for an additional year.

### A variant in RNF212B may contribute to female infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss [^1161TnQy]. HGG Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Infertility is a highly complex yet common condition that affects nearly 1 in every 6 people of reproductive age worldwide. Etiologies of infertility can be broadly categorized into male factors, female factors, or a combination of both. Female factors alone account for at least 30%–35% of all infertility cases and include various physiological, hormonal, anatomical, and genetic components. Genetic causes of female infertility include structural chromosomal abnormalities, cytogenetic aberrations arising from errors in meiotic recombination, genomic copy-number variants, and single gene disorders. These women are also more likely to experience recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL).

At the time of writing, thousands of genes have been identified through various animal models to be essential for mammalian reproduction. However, only a small subset of these genes has been implicated in human infertility, and an even smaller proportion has shown a strong association with female infertility. Mutations in maternal effect genes, particularly those involved in biological processes such as DNA repair and regulation of mRNA stability, may contribute to early embryonic arrest. Modern advances in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for couples with infertility and those using assisted reproductive technology have allowed for the detection of various genes involved in the pathogenesis of infertility.

Here, we report the case of an RNF212B (c.448C > T, p. Arg150Ter) mutation in a reproductively young female with multiple aneuploidies in each of her 8 arrested and tested embryos from 1 in vitro fertilization.

### Counseling for the man with severe male infertility [^116CAChV]. Current Opinion in Urology (2023). High credibility.

This review summarizes the proper counseling strategies for men with severe male factor infertility.

- **Recent findings**: Men experiencing infertility should undergo a semen analysis. The results may suggest the need for additional investigations, including genetic and hormonal assessments. Furthermore, it is important to evaluate possible modifiable factors that could harm men's reproductive health. Multiple treatment options are available for consideration.

- **Summary**: Approximately 15% of couples struggle with infertility. A thorough evaluation of both men and women is necessary to determine the etiology of infertility and identify appropriate treatment options.

### Infertility: a marker of future health risk in women [^114Wu837]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

Infertility may be a harbinger for future health risks in women, including early mortality. Fertility status itself could serve as an early biomarker, present during a woman's reproductive years, for risk stratification later in life. The relationship between infertility and early mortality involves the impact of nulliparity on future adverse health events, potential sequelae from the underlying causes of infertility, the risks of fertility treatments, as well as the potential for risk reduction from a healthy pregnancy. This complex interplay, coupled with difficulties in ascertaining infertility on a population level, presents unique challenges to assessing infertility and early mortality risk. With further study, better understanding of the role of fertility status in health at various stages of life may provide unique opportunities for surveillance and risk reduction.

### History of infertility and pregnancy outcomes in Project Viva: a prospective study [^117KfUda]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Infertility is defined by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after ≥ 12 months of regular, unprotected attempts at conception and affects 15.5% of couples in the United States (US). Infertility encompasses a spectrum of reproductive dysfunction that includes secondary infertility (e.g. infertility following a previously established pregnancy), couples who meet the clinical definition of infertility but ultimately become pregnant without medical assistance, and those who require medical treatments to achieve a pregnancy. Infertility has implications for health status beyond the reproductive consequences, including an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Improving our understanding of the role of infertility and pregnancy outcomes has been identified as a research priority in the US.

There is consistent evidence regarding the relationship of infertility with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and preterm birth. Some evidence also suggests that infertility is associated with a greater risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and small birth size. However, these findings are less consistent, with some studies showing positive associations and others showing no associations. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the adverse associations between infertility and pregnancy outcomes: one related to underlying causes of infertility and another that revolves around the use of medically assisted reproduction (MAR). While the former suggests that adverse consequences associated with infertility are due to pre-existing pathophysiology, the latter focuses on the medical interventions involved.

### Are sex and gender dimensions accounted for in NICE guidelines? A systematic review of 223 clinical guidelines [^114kA7Xg]. BMJ Public Health (2025). Low credibility.

Management recommendations for women often referenced procedures or medications to be avoided, typically focusing on what not to do rather than providing alternative solutions. This approach supports the presence of a precautionary principle in care, which emphasizes reducing medication-related risk over considering the opportunity cost of undertreated or untreated disease in pregnancy. It also complicates decision-making in time-pressed primary care settings and poses a risk to patient safety. Notably, many guidelines accounting for sex and gender did so only in relation to reproductive anatomy and systems. The only guideline to achieve a 'Category 1' rating is for fertility problems (CG156). For females, 67% of the guidelines considering sex and/or gender failed to extend beyond reproductive contexts. Similarly, explicit sex differences cited for males often focused on reproductive anatomy, such as considerations for male infertility or erectile dysfunction. These findings reflect a broader trend where 'women's health' and 'men's health' are thought of as synonymous with sexual and reproductive health, neglecting important sex and gender differences across other diseases in clinical practice.

### The genetic causes of male factor infertility: A review [^116sWbVj]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

The objective is to illustrate the necessity for an enhanced understanding of the genetic basis of male factor infertility, present a comprehensive synopsis of these genetic elements, and review techniques being utilized to produce new insights in fertility research.

Background: Male factor infertility is a complex disorder that affects a large sector of the population; however, many of its etiologies are unknown. By elucidating the underlying genetic basis of infertile phenotypes, it may be possible to discover the causes of infertility and determine effective treatments for patients.

Methods: The PubMed database was consulted for the most relevant papers published in the last three years pertaining to male factor infertility using the keywords "genetics" and "male infertility".

Results: Advances have been made in the characterization of the roles of specific genes, but further research is necessary before these results can be used as guidelines for diagnosing and treating male factor infertility. The accurate transmission of epigenetic information also has considerable influence on fertility in males and on the fertility of their offspring.

Conclusions: Analysis of the genetic factors that impact male factor infertility will provide valuable insights into the creation of targeted treatments for patients and the determination of the causes of idiopathic infertility. Novel technologies that analyze the influence of genetics from a global perspective may lead to further developments in understanding the etiology of male factor infertility.

### Understanding new genetics of male infertility [^113Lxn5H]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Greater than 10% of couples are unable to achieve pregnancy. In at least 30% to 50% of these infertility cases, a male factor abnormality is involved. Genetic defects are believed to be the cause of a significant percentage of these abnormalities. Defects causing infertility, such as chromosomal disorders and congenital hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis syndromes, have long been recognized. With the development of gene-targeting technologies in animal models, many genes required for male fertility in animals are known. This contributes to our understanding of the etiology of this important health problem. We present not only recognized genetic disorders associated with male infertility, but also its emerging and previously unrecognized genetic etiologies.

- **Materials and methods**: This review is organized to enable the reader to recognize promptly the major types of genetic defects associated with male infertility, their clinical characteristics, and appropriate therapeutic approaches. Due to the explosion of knowledge in this field and length restrictions, the discussion of genetic defects is concise, referencing predominantly review articles relevant to the topic.

- **Results**: Assisted reproductive technologies for overcoming sterility resulting from unrecognized etiologies may have important potential consequences for infertile couples and their offspring.

- **Conclusions**: Familiarity with the genes associated with male infertility is essential for the urologist to better understand, diagnose, and treat the male factor couple.

### Genetic syndromes leading to male infertility: a systematic review [^116VL5Vf]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). Low credibility.

Male-factor infertility is a multifactorial, complex, and increasingly common condition in which genetic factors are more frequently implicated. The causal relationships between genetic variation and male infertility phenotypes are understudied, as are the differences in the frequency of disease-causing genetic alterations among different geographic and ethnic groups. Guidelines remain inconsistent regarding recommended genomic testing during the male infertility workup. Our fund of knowledge limits our diagnostic capability, with the etiology of male infertility remaining idiopathic in about 40% of patients, despite advances in genomic sequencing and testing.

### Comorbidities and male infertility: a worrisome picture [^1112idYW]. Current Opinion in Urology (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to analyze the literature concerning health status in the setting of male infertility, taking into account the potential contribution of each comorbidity.

- **Recent findings**: Latest findings almost unanimously confirm how infertile patients usually display quite precarious health, due to the collection of coexistent diseases observed in these men. More precisely, relevant comorbidities might influence not only a man's fertility but his life expectancy as well. Moreover, because of the increasing trend in delaying fatherhood observed in Western countries over time, age might somehow act as a possible detrimental factor. Overall, what emerges from these studies is a complex and worrisome scenario.

- **Summary**: General health status in the male reproductive setting is gaining increasing clinical attention and relevance. Infertile men appear to be rather unhealthy young men compared with fertile ones. Therefore, uroandrologists are challenged with the compelling task of assessing the infertile man, considering both his general and reproductive health, since relevant comorbid conditions may influence not only his life expectancy but his fertility as well.

### Novel concepts in the aetiology of male reproductive impairment [^116x9qv9]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Infertility is a widespread problem, with a male contribution involved in 20–70% of affected couples. A man's fertility relies on the quantity and quality of his sperm; thus, semen analysis is generally used as a proxy to estimate fertility or gain insight into the underlying reasons for infertility. Male reproductive impairment might result from factors affecting sperm production, quality, function, or transport. Although the origin of infertility remains unexplained in most men, genetic causes are increasingly being discovered. In this first of two papers in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology Series on male reproductive impairment, we propose a novel, clinically based aetiological construct with a genetic focus and consider how this might serve as a helpful way to conceptualize a diagnostic algorithm.

### A public health focus on infertility prevention, detection, and management [^111UjkeZ]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

In 2002, 2 million American women of reproductive age were infertile. Infertility is also common among men. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducts surveillance and research on the causes of infertility, monitors the safety and efficacy of infertility treatment, and sponsors national prevention programs. A CDC-wide working group found that, despite this effort, considerable gaps and opportunities exist in surveillance, research, communication, and program and policy development. We intend to consult with other federal agencies, professional and consumer organizations, the scientific community, the health care community, industry, and other stakeholders, and participate in the development of a national public health plan for the prevention, detection, and management of infertility.

### Infertility and risk of cardiovascular disease: A prospective cohort study [^113U3eCj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Although there has been limited research on the relation between infertility and cardiovascular disease (CVD), the research that does exist suggests that the severity of infertility and certain infertility diagnoses, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), confer the greatest risk. The largest study at the time of writing, using Swedish registry data, observed that parous women who experienced five or more years of infertility had a 19% greater risk of CVD compared with women who did not experience infertility. This is supported by recent findings from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study, which observed that gravid women who experienced twelve or more months of trying to conceive had a 14% greater risk of CVD. Cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that women with a history of infertility had approximately 1.8 times higher odds of experiencing metabolic syndrome and of having a cardiovascular event. However, the existing research on this topic has been restricted to analyses that are among parous women, cross-sectional, or with limited follow-up time for the development of CVD events (twelve years on average).

Additionally, certain infertility diagnoses, such as PCOS, endometriosis, and unexplained infertility, have been observed to be associated with CVD risk and adverse cardiometabolic profiles (e.g. hypertension, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes), which has not been thoroughly investigated in the literature. The objective of the study was therefore to investigate the association of infertility (overall and cause-specific infertility diagnoses) with CVD using data from the cohort.

### Female infertility in the era of obesity: The clash of two pandemics or inevitable consequence [^115J9KMo]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Obesity is an epidemic that has led to a rise in the incidence of many comorbidities; among others, reduced fertility is often under-evaluated in clinical practice. The mechanisms underlying the link between reduced fertility and obesity are numerous, with insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and the frequent coexistence of polycystic ovary syndrome being the most acknowledged. However, several other factors concur, such as gut microbiome alterations, low-grade chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress. Not only do women with obesity take longer to conceive, but in vitro fertilization (IVF) is also less likely to succeed. We herein provide an updated state-of-the-art regarding the molecular bases of what we could define as dysmetabolic infertility, focusing on the clinical aspects, as well as possible treatment.

### Sexual, marital, and social impact of a man's perceived infertility diagnosis [^116sz1yu]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Male factor infertility is a relatively common problem, and this diagnosis may increase sexual, marital, and relationship strain in male partners of infertile couples.

- **Aim**: To measure the personal, social, sexual, and marital impacts of a male factor infertility diagnosis among men in couples evaluated for infertility.

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted with 357 men from infertile couples, recruited from eight academic and community-based fertility clinics. Participants completed written surveys and participated in face-to-face and telephone interviews at study enrollment. This interview queried each participant's perception of their infertility etiology to determine the primary study exposure (i.e. male factor only, male and female factors, female factor only, unknown).

- **Main outcome measures**: Personal Impact, Social Impact, Marital Impact, and Sexual Impact scales.

- **Results**: Among the 357 men, no male factor was reported in 47%, isolated male factor was present in 12%, combined male and female factors were present in 16%, and unexplained infertility was present in 25% of couples. Male factor infertility was independently associated with worse Sexual (mean 39 vs. 30, standard deviation [SD] 2.7, P = 0.004) and Personal (mean 37 vs. 29, SD 3.8, P = 0.04) Impact scores relative to men in couples without male factor infertility. These differences remained statistically significant after controlling for male age, partner age, race, religion, educational level, employment status, prior pregnancy, duration of infertility, and prior paternity.

- **Conclusions**: Male partners in couples who perceive iso

### Infertility and risk of cardiovascular disease: A prospective cohort study [^115fh7uq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Certain symptoms associated with infertility are linked to cardiovascular disease, including menstrual cycle irregularity, early menopause, and obesity; however, few studies have investigated the association between infertility and cardiovascular disease risk. Participants in the NHSII (Nurses' Health Study II) who reported infertility (12 months of trying to conceive without success, including women who subsequently conceived) or were gravid, with no infertility, were followed from 1989 until 2017 for development of incident, physician-diagnosed coronary heart disease (CHD) (myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, angioplasty, stent) and stroke.

- **Methods and results**: Time-varying Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs and were adjusted a priori for potential confounding variables. Among 103,729 participants, 27.6% reported having ever experienced infertility. Compared with gravid women who had not reported infertility, women with a history of infertility had a greater risk of CHD (HR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.01–1.26]) but not stroke (HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.77–1.07]). The association between a history of infertility and CHD was strongest among women who reported infertility at an earlier age (HR for infertility first reported at ≤ 25 years, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.09–1.46]; HR at 26–30 years, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.93–1.25]; HR at > 30 years, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.70–1.19]). When specific infertility diagnoses were investigated, elevated risk of CHD was observed among women whose infertility was attributed to an ovulatory disorder.

### Infertility and risk of cardiovascular disease: A prospective cohort study [^111dQS6r]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is known to present differently among men and women, including a later age of onset for women, a higher risk of stroke for women, and a significant influence of women's reproductive factors and obstetric history. Although prior research among women has suggested an association between female‐specific risk factors (e.g. adverse pregnancy outcomes, age at menopause, miscarriage) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, few studies have investigated the association between overall infertility (trying to conceive for ≥ 12 months without success, including women who conceive thereafter) in relation to CVD risk.

Symptoms associated with certain infertility diagnoses are known to be associated with CVD, including menstrual cycle irregularity, early menopause, and obesity. Moreover, several studies suggest that infertile women may have a worse CVD risk factor profile, including having a higher body mass index (BMI), larger waist circumference, and elevated triglycerides than women without infertility.

### Diagnosis and management of infertility: A review [^115GasT8]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Infertility can result from several causes. Among these, notable factors include testosterone deficiency, endometrial polyps, Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, pelvic inflammatory disease, uterine fibroids, polycystic ovary syndrome, adrenal cortex insufficiency, pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a, true hermaphroditism, ciliary motility disorder, hypogonadism, male infertility, and female infertility.

Additionally, certain medications have been identified as potential contributors to infertility:

- **Chemotherapy and immunosuppressants**: mitoxantrone, epirubicin, ifosfamide, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, bendamustine, vinblastine, hydroxyurea
- **Hormonal agents**: cyclosporine, desmopressin, medroxyprogesterone, levothyroxine
- **Antipsychotics and antidepressants**: fluphenazine, chlorpromazine
- **Pain management agents**: hydromorphone, fentanyl ER, hydrocodone ER, meperidine, oxycodone, oxycodone ER, fentanyl, codeine
- **Other medications**: carbamazepine, carbamazepine ER, caffeine, naproxen sodium ER, naproxen DR, naproxen, ganciclovir, methotrexate, cidofovir, macitentan, eplerenone

These medications are known for their potential effects on fertility, and their usage should be carefully evaluated in the context of infertility management.

### Reproduction as a window for health in men [^116KoNyu]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). High credibility.

Male factor infertility is widely considered a harbinger for a man's general health. Failure of reproduction often accompanies other underlying processes, with growing evidence suggesting that a diagnosis of infertility increases the likelihood of developing future cardiac, metabolic, and oncologic diseases. The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the research on male fertility as a marker for future health. A multidisciplinary approach is essential, and there is growing consensus that the male fertility evaluation offers an opportunity to better men's wellness beyond their immediate reproductive ambitions.

### Congenital heart disease and fertility: A Danish nationwide cohort study including both men and women [^114c7K1c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Assessment of infertility and live births

If pregnancy is not achieved after 1 year of unprotected, active sexual activity, the couple is per definition infertile and can be referred for tax-financed assessment and medically assisted reproduction treatment at a public fertility clinic in Denmark. The only requirements are age less than 41 years in women and childlessness. In private fertility clinics, self-paid treatment is offered for all women up to age 46 years, regardless of parity. Today, around 50% of all treatments are performed at public clinics. In Denmark, lesbian and single women have free access to medically assisted reproduction treatment under the same requirements as heterosexual couples.

The DNPR and IVF register hold information on all individuals who are infertile and seek help in the Danish healthcare system. Since 1994, registration of all fertility treatments (both public and private) in the IVF register is mandatory by law. The IVF register contains detailed information on each treated woman, including indication for treatment (male or female indication), type of treatment, pregnancy outcomes, and information on her partner, if any. Before 1994, information on individuals who were infertile was only registered in the DNPR. The DNPR contains information on both diagnosis codes for infertility and procedure codes for fertility treatment. In the present study, we classified men and women as infertile using two different definitions of infertility. In model 1, we ignored the indication for infertility diagnosis or treatment (male or female factor) as no causes are identified in this context.

### Male infertility [^111KPJtz]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2023). Low credibility.

Clinical infertility is defined as the inability of a couple to conceive after 12 months of trying. Male factors are estimated to contribute to 30–50% of infertility cases. Infertility or reduced fertility can result from various causes, including testicular dysfunction, endocrinopathies, lifestyle factors (such as tobacco use and obesity), congenital anatomical factors, gonadotoxic exposures, and aging, among others. The evaluation of male infertility includes detailed history taking, focused physical examination, and selective laboratory testing, including semen analysis. Treatments range from lifestyle optimization and empirical or targeted medical therapy to surgical therapies that lead to measurable improvements in fertility. Although male infertility is recognized as a disease affecting the quality of life for both members of the infertile couple, fewer data exist on its specific quantification and impact compared with other health-related conditions.

### Frequency of the male infertility evaluation: Data from the National Survey of Family Growth [^111VpD1S]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

An estimated 7 million American couples per year seek infertility care in the United States. A male factor contributes to 50% of cases, but it is unclear what proportion of infertile couples undergoes male evaluation.

We analyzed data from cycles 5 to 7 of the National Survey of Family Growth, performed by the Centers for Disease Control, to determine the frequency of a male infertility evaluation and associated reproductive and demographic factors.

A total of 25,846 women and 11,067 men were surveyed. Male evaluation was not completed in 18% of couples when the male partner was asked, versus 27% when female partners were asked. This corresponds to approximately 370,000 to 860,000 men in the population who were not evaluated at the time of infertility evaluation. Longer infertility duration and white race were associated with increased odds of male infertility evaluation. The male and female samples showed no change in the receipt of male examination over time.

Many men from infertile couples do not undergo male evaluation in the United States. Given the potential implications to reproductive goals and male health, further examination of this pattern is warranted.

### Female infertility in the era of obesity: The clash of two pandemics or inevitable consequence [^1174ja94]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Dysmetabolic infertility represents a clash of two pandemics in an era where women seeking pregnancy are often heavier and older than in the past. Beyond a longer time to conceive, there is also a recognized smaller chance of success with IVF. Several treatments may have a beneficial impact, both at a lifestyle level and at a pharmacotherapy level. Furthermore, IVF techniques may be adjusted to improve outcomes. A deeper understanding of the less established mechanistic links between obesity and infertility is warranted to develop better ad hoc treatments: focusing on the role of the brain-gut axis and chronic inflammation on fertility outcomes may be beneficial, as well as conducting controlled studies investigating the efficacy of novel treatments.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA/ASRM guideline PART II [^114xT5bZ]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for male infertility, specifically concerning assisted reproductive technologies, ASRM/AUA 2021 guidelines recommend informing patients with a low total motile sperm count on repeated semen analyses about the reduced success rates of intrauterine insemination. They should consider offering assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection.

### Variants in deleted in azoospermia-like (DAZL) are correlated with reproductive parameters in men and women [^1143GWUb]. Human Genetics (2006). Low credibility.

Qualitative and quantitative defects in human germ cell production that result in infertility are common and determined at least in part by genetic factors [Matzuk and Lamb, Nat Cell Biol 4(Suppl):s41-s49, 2002]. Yet, very few genes associated with germ cell defects in humans have been identified. In this study, we examined whether variants of the deleted in azoospermia-like (DAZL) gene are associated with measures of germ cell production in three distinct populations of men and women. We identified 95 sequence variants in DAZL and further analyzed twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were present across ethnicities.

- **Association with reproductive parameters**: We found that seven of the twelve SNPs were associated with at least one of the parameters studied, including age at premature ovarian failure or menopause, total sperm count, or total motile sperm count.

- **Allelic effects**: Many alleles exhibited opposing effects in men and women, which may be a result of different genetic requirements in male and female germ cells.

- **Joint effects of SNPs**: Single SNP and haplotype analysis suggested that SNPs in the DAZL gene may act jointly to affect common reproductive characteristics in the human population.

### Sexuality and fertility after cancer [^111UxXvP]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

As more people achieve long-term survival after cancer, sexual dysfunction and infertility have increasingly been recognized as negative consequences that impact quality of life. Sexual dysfunction is a frequent long-term side effect of cancer treatment, but damage to different underlying physiological systems is salient in men versus women. Men frequently have erectile dysfunction (ED) related to damage to the autonomic nervous system and/or reduced circulation of blood to the penis. Hormonal impairment of sexual function is less common. Women, in contrast, are able to overcome damage to autonomic nerves if genital tissues remain structurally intact and estrogenized. Female sexual dysfunction is frequently associated with sudden premature ovarian failure or direct effects of radiation fibrosis or scar tissue causing pain with sexual activity.

The lack of validated interventions for sexual rehabilitation after cancer is a major problem, as is finding cost-effective ways of providing services. Concerns about fertility are also a major source of distress to people treated for cancer during childhood or young adulthood, yet many young survivors do not recall any discussion about future childbearing potential with their oncology team. Since fertility preservation is becoming more practical for both men and women, producing patient and professional educational materials and developing professional practice guidelines should be high priorities for oncology societies.

### Male infertility as a window to health [^113y839b]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

There is an emerging body of evidence suggesting that male infertility may be a harbinger of future health. Potential associations between infertility and health may arise from genetic, developmental, and lifestyle factors. Studies have explored possible links between male infertility and oncologic, cardiovascular, metabolic, and autoimmune diseases. Male infertility may also be a predictor of hospitalization and mortality. Additional research is required to elucidate the mechanisms by which male infertility affects overall health.

### Fallopian tube recanalization for the management of infertility [^114qMx9G]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Low credibility.

Infertility is defined as a disease characterized by the failure to establish a clinical pregnancy after 12 months of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse in a woman under age 35 or after 6 months in a woman over the age of 35. Infertility is a common problem throughout the world, with more than 186 million people affected, the majority residing in developing countries.

Infertility may be primary or secondary. Primary infertility refers to women who have never had a clinical pregnancy, whereas secondary infertility refers to the inability to establish a clinical pregnancy in women who have previously been diagnosed with a clinical pregnancy. There are both male and female causes for infertility, with the most common causes of female infertility being ovulatory dysfunction and tubal disease.

- **Tubal infertility**: This is estimated to account for between 11 and 67% of infertility diagnoses. It can be caused by internal blockage of the fallopian tubes, abnormalities of the internal tube from inflammation or infection, or pelvic adhesions which prevent normal functioning of the fallopian tubes.

- **Proximal tubal blockage**: This is frequently composed of debris that forms a plug in the proximal part of the tube.

- **Distal tubal blockage**: If the blockage is more distal, the cause is usually a previous infection, which may present as a hydrosalpinx with dilation of the fallopian tube.

### What advances may the future bring to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of male sexual and reproductive health [^115LZFdd]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). High credibility.

The advent of genetic and genomic testing may partially replace the routine semen analysis and provide more defined etiologies for teratozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, and spermatogenic failure.

An impressive area of success, showing the potential of these precision medicine-based genetic findings, is in the study of teratozoospermia, predominantly globozoospermia and macrozoospermia and/or asthenozoospermia (multiple abnormalities of the sperm flagella and primary ciliary dyskinesia). These sperm defects are seen in the andrology laboratory during a routine semen analysis. The identification of defective genes encoding proteins involved in cytokinesis during meiosis, resulting in macrozoospermia, sperm flagella formation, and function, results in a variety of anomalies seen in a routine semen analysis, including absent, short, bent/misaligned, coiled, and irregularly shaped flagella, severe motility defects, and occasional head anomalies.

Furthermore, the identification of globozoospermia is crucial. Such genetic information is used clinically to counsel patients about their chances for successful ICSI-IVF outcomes or other reproductive decisions regarding alternative paths to parenthood, as reviewed by Coutton et al. and Wang et al. Future studies of these genes and the other > 6,000 genes mentioned earlier are expected to have a powerful impact on improving the diagnosis and perhaps even medical treatment of some forms of male reproductive failure. This research also provides valuable insights about the probability of successful ICSI-IVF outcomes for these and other male reproductive issues.

### Congenital heart disease and fertility: A Danish nationwide cohort study including both men and women [^111RF5pP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Today, most patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) reach childbearing age, and birth rates are consequently increasing in this patient group. Despite infertility being recognized as a global public health issue by the World Health Organization, it remains unknown whether infertility is more common in patients with CHD compared to unaffected individuals. Fertility is mentioned in some, but not all, international guidelines that describe impaired fertility in women with Fontan circulation. For women with other cardiac defects, it is suggested that their fertility is most likely comparable to the female background population; however, these claims are unreferenced.

Although several case studies report higher rates of menstrual abnormalities and spontaneous abortions in women with severe heart defects, less is known about women with more simple lesions. More than one‐third of 505 Dutch and Belgian women with a septal defect were found to have a menstrual cycle disorder. Furthermore, a previous cohort study found unexpected results indicating that women with atrial septal defects had a higher risk of receiving fertility treatment compared to a matched reference cohort. This suggests that fertility may also be impaired in women with less severe heart defects.

Knowledge of fertility in men with CHD is nearly nonexistent. Only erectile dysfunction has been mentioned as an impaired outcome related to their reproductive health. Compromised blood flow to the male genitalia, as well as hypoxemia, may also potentially affect their reproductive health.

### Restorative reproductive medicine for infertility in two family medicine clinics in New England, an observational study [^1119KVVP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Infertility is a common concern in couples and is associated with increasing age. It can be caused by many underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms in women and/or men. Improved understanding of these mechanisms, along with their diagnosis and treatment, could improve obstetrical outcomes and the long-term health of both parents and offspring, while generating significant savings for the cost of fertility treatment. Primary care physicians, particularly family physicians, can play an important role in infertility evaluation and treatment because infertility:

- **Commonality**: It is a common issue.
- **Couple's issue**: It affects both partners.
- **Chronic disorders**: It involves coincident chronic disorders impacting fertility that can be addressed in primary care.

Initial management of infertility by primary care specialists, followed by referral as needed, can result in similar time to pregnancy as initial management by fertility subspecialists.

Treatment strategies for infertility include approaches that accomplish parts of the reproductive process outside the body, known as assisted reproductive technology (ART), as well as those that seek exclusively to restore normal physiologic fertility, termed restorative reproductive medicine (RRM). ART techniques include in vitro fertilization (IVF), with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and intrauterine insemination. RRM encompasses lifestyle changes to improve health and reproductive function, educating women and couples to understand their fertility cycle and fertile window, and medical treatments supporting ovulation, implantation, immune function, and spermatogenesis.

### Are sex and gender dimensions accounted for in NICE guidelines? A systematic review of 223 clinical guidelines [^1179WXTn]. BMJ Public Health (2025). Low credibility.

We designed a framework to assess if sex and/or gender dimensions had been accounted for, informed by similar studies conducted in Canada, Australia, and across Europe. All reviewers used a standardized form (see online supplemental materials) to extract the title, NICE reference code, publication date, the most recent update date, and committee details from each NICE guideline.

Reviewers searched guideline text electronically for the following keywords:

- **Gender and sex terms**: sex, gender, male, female, men, women, man, woman, boy, girl
- **Reproductive and sexual health**: pregnan*, menopause, fertility, breast, ova, vulva, vagina, cervi*, uter*
- **Male-specific anatomy and hormones**: penis, testic*, teste*, prostat*, testosterone
- **Female-specific hormones**: oestrogen, progest*

Reviewers extracted the name, role, and presumed gender of the most recent committee members. The committee roles were chair, committee member, and lay member. We identified presumed gender (categories: man, woman, and other) based on the latest committee membership documents published by NICE and gendered titles (e.g. Miss, Mr, Mrs, and Ms). When the guideline did not provide this information, we used the open-source online tool Gender API to provide a statistical probability as to which gender a given first name was most likely associated with.

Four reviewers (OW, VB, HM, and EH) undertook a preliminary analysis of 37 guidelines. An initial sample was selected according to clinical subjects which the group agreed were priority areas for consideration. Reviewers then convened to resolve inconsistencies in data extraction by consensus.

### Approach to the patient with prolactinoma [^117FQPjR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

The interplay between prolactin and fertility

Hyperprolactinemia is the most common cause of secondary hypogonadism and infertility in both sexes. In infertile women, prolactin (PRL) excess as the main cause of infertility has been found to vary from 7% to 20% of cases. This is lower than that reported in women with amenorrhea and/or galactorrhea, but at least 10-fold higher than the general population.

The impact of PRL excess on the reproductive axis reflects its peculiar actions at both the central and peripheral levels. At the central level, PRL modulates the reproductive axis by directly suppressing kisspeptin secretion, thus lowering GnRH activation and gonadotropin secretion, promoting hypogonadism and infertility.

At the peripheral level, PRL plays a direct inhibitory effect on sexual hormone synthesis and secretion. In women, PRL inhibits estrogen and progesterone synthesis. In men, PRL receptors have been identified on Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, and epithelial cells of efferent ducts, suggesting a potential role for PRL in promoting steroidogenesis, spermatogenesis, and the secretory/adsorptive functions of male reproductive organs. In infertile men, the prevalence of PRL increase as the main cause of infertility is still unknown. Nevertheless, endocrine disorders, including hyperprolactinemia, reportedly account for only 2% to 4% of cases of male infertility.
