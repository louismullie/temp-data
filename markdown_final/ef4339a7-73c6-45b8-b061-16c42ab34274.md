## Question

Is it a problem to keep a pregnant cat next to a pregnant woman

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is a problem to keep a pregnant cat in the same household as a pregnant woman, and what precautions are reasonable and evidence-based. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary zoonotic risk from cats during pregnancy, which is toxoplasmosis. Then, I should verify how pregnancy status in the cat changes that risk. Next, I will review authoritative prevention guidance to see what specific behaviors to modify. After that, I should consider other pet-related infections that could matter in pregnancy, like bartonellosis and enteric pathogens. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note any screening considerations for the pregnant woman, making sure I double-check that I'm not overstating any risks or omitting key caveats.

> Let me first confirm the main concern. The principal risk from cats in pregnancy is Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan parasite for which cats are the definitive host and shed oocysts in feces; primary maternal infection during gestation can lead to congenital toxoplasmosis with potentially severe sequelae for the fetus, so I need to ensure I frame the risk and prevention accurately [^116aqLCm] [^117CyarY].

> Wait, let me verify how the cat's pregnancy status affects this risk. I initially thought a pregnant cat might shed more oocysts, but hold on, I should verify that assumption. The key determinant of oocyst shedding is whether the cat is undergoing a primary T. gondii infection, not whether the cat itself is pregnant; after a primary infection, cats shed oocysts for a short period, then typically develop immunity and do not shed again, so a chronically infected, indoor cat that eats commercial food poses minimal risk compared with a newly infected cat with outdoor hunting exposure [^112e6yKt] [^116kWrvF].

> Next, I should review the transmission dynamics to avoid overemphasizing direct cat contact. Most human infections are foodborne from undercooked meat or from environmental oocyst contamination of produce and water, and large community outbreaks have been linked to contaminated drinking water and produce rather than direct cat contact. Thus, I need to ensure counseling covers food safety and environmental hygiene in addition to litter precautions [^116kWrvF] [^112e6yKt].

> I will now examine evidence-based prevention guidance. Authoritative HIV OI guidance, which is widely used for toxoplasmosis prevention counseling, advises keeping cats indoors, feeding only canned or dried commercial food or well-cooked table scraps, avoiding raw or undercooked meats for the cat, changing the litter box daily, and having someone who is not pregnant handle litter if possible. Importantly, it explicitly states patients need not part with their cats or have them tested for toxoplasmosis, which I should emphasize to avoid unnecessary separation [^114hzWF8] [^112e6yKt].

> Let me consider other pet-related infections that could be relevant in pregnancy. Bartonella henselae (cat-scratch disease) is associated with cats, particularly kittens and flea exposure; while pregnancy-specific data are limited, case series suggest most outcomes are favorable with appropriate care, and flea control is central to prevention; enteric pathogens like Salmonella can be linked to raw pet foods or reptiles, so I should confirm that the cat's diet is commercial and cooked and that general hand hygiene is practiced after pet contact [^112ukzHC] [^112qtCZj] [^113czjuU].

> Hold on, I should verify whether the cat's pregnancy introduces unique management steps. The cat's pregnancy does not inherently increase human risk beyond the general principles above; the priority remains verifying the cat is kept indoors, fed a safe diet, and that litter hygiene is maintained, with daily scooping and ideally delegation of litter duty to a nonpregnant household member, along with consistent handwashing after any soil or litter contact [^114hzWF8] [^116aqLCm].

> Next, I should review screening considerations for the pregnant woman. Routine universal serologic screening for toxoplasmosis is not recommended in the United States, but if there are concerning exposures or symptoms, targeted testing can be considered. If acute infection is suspected, confirmatory testing at a reference laboratory is advised due to false positives, and treatment decisions should follow obstetric infectious diseases protocols, which I need to ensure are coordinated with prenatal care [^1158FK7C] [^116VWgSK].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified answer. It is not inherently a problem to keep a pregnant cat in the same household as a pregnant woman if standard precautions are followed: keep the cat strictly indoors, feed only commercial or well-cooked food, change the litter box daily with someone else doing it if possible, use gloves if the pregnant woman must handle litter, and practice meticulous hand hygiene. These measures align with evidence-based guidance and should mitigate the main risk without requiring the cat to be rehomed or tested [^114hzWF8] [^116aqLCm].

> But wait, what if the cat is new, recently adopted, or goes outdoors and hunts? In that scenario, the risk of a primary T. gondii infection in the cat — and thus transient oocyst shedding — is higher, so I should double-check that the cat is transitioned to indoor-only status, placed on a cooked or commercial diet, and that litter precautions are strictly enforced for at least the first few months, while also reinforcing food safety and produce washing for the pregnant woman to address the larger, non-cat sources of exposure [^114hzWF8] [^116kWrvF].

> Finally, I need to ensure the counseling is balanced and realistic. Many pregnant women overestimate cat-related risk and underestimate foodborne and environmental sources. Providing clear, reference-aligned guidance helps reduce anxiety while empowering effective prevention, and I should confirm that the plan is documented and revisited during prenatal visits to support adherence and address questions as they arise [^112NMZXX] [^116kWrvF].

It is **safe for a pregnant woman to live with a pregnant cat** if standard hygiene precautions are followed [^114hzWF8]. The main concern is **toxoplasmosis**, which is transmitted via cat feces; however, indoor cats fed commercial diets have a low risk of shedding oocysts, and daily litter box cleaning by a non-pregnant person further reduces risk [^114hzWF8]. Pregnant women should avoid handling litter, wear gloves if they must, and wash hands thoroughly afterward [^115RDMff]. No evidence shows increased risk from the cat's pregnancy, and **no need to rehome the cat** or test it for toxoplasmosis [^114hzWF8].

---

## Risks associated with pregnant cats and pregnant women

### Toxoplasmosis

- **Transmission**: Toxoplasma gondii is transmitted by ingesting oocysts from cat feces or undercooked meat; cats shed oocysts only once after primary infection, and indoor cats fed commercial diets rarely shed oocysts [^112e6yKt].

- **Risk during pregnancy**: Primary infection in pregnancy can cause congenital toxoplasmosis, with risks of miscarriage, stillbirth, or fetal anomalies [^113ZiCzp].

- **Timing of risk**: Transmission risk rises with gestation, but fetal harm is greater with earlier infection [^117CyarY].

---

### Other potential infections

Other potential infections include **bartonellosis** (cat-scratch disease), which is rare in pregnancy and typically mild, though it can cause lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms [^112ukzHC], and **intestinal parasites** such as roundworms and hookworms, which are uncommon in well-cared-for indoor cats and preventable with routine deworming and hygiene [^notfound].

---

## Precautions and preventive measures

To minimize risks, **pregnant women should take the following precautions**:

| **Precaution** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Litter box hygiene | - Avoid changing litter if possible <br/> - If unavoidable, wear gloves and wash hands thoroughly afterward [^115RDMff] |
| Dietary management | Feed cats only commercial dry or canned food; avoid raw or undercooked meat [^114hzWF8] |
| Indoor confinement | Keep cats indoors to reduce exposure to infectious agents [^114hzWF8] |
| Regular veterinary care | Ensure cats are healthy, dewormed, and up-to-date on vaccinations [^notfound] |
| Hand hygiene | Wash hands thoroughly after handling cats or cleaning litter boxes [^112qtCZj] |

---

## Clinical evidence and expert recommendations

Evidence and expert guidance indicate that **indoor cats fed commercial diets pose minimal risk** of transmitting toxoplasmosis, and routine testing or rehoming is unnecessary [^115RDMff] [^114hzWF8]. With appropriate precautions, the risk of toxoplasmosis is low, and pregnant women can safely live with cats [^114hzWF8] [^112qtCZj].

---

## Psychological and emotional considerations

Pet ownership can reduce stress and anxiety and improve well-being during pregnancy; **unnecessary separation from pets may increase stress**, which can negatively affect maternal and fetal health [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

It is **safe for a pregnant woman to live with a pregnant cat** if standard precautions are followed. The main concern is toxoplasmosis, but indoor cats fed commercial diets have a low risk of shedding oocysts, and daily litter box cleaning by a non-pregnant person further reduces risk [^114hzWF8]. Pregnant women should avoid handling litter, wear gloves if they must, and wash hands thoroughly afterward [^115RDMff]. No evidence shows increased risk from the cat's pregnancy, and **no need to rehome the cat** or test it for toxoplasmosis [^114hzWF8].

### Prenatal toxoplasma gondii [^112ZDMz4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The article by Boyer et al raises significant questions about contemporary US screening recommendations. In their study, Boyer and colleagues used new and novel methodologies to determine whether mothers of infants with congenital toxoplasmosis could be identified by risk factor identification, thereby providing strong support for educating pregnant women about risk avoidance in an effort to eliminate this congenital disease. The investigators used stored serum samples obtained from a cohort of North American women who delivered infants who received a diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis and who were previously interviewed about recognized risk factors as part of the National Collaborative Chicago-Based Congenital Toxoplasmosis Study (NCCCTS). In this current investigation, the previously acquired serum samples were tested using a new method to identify an antibody specific to the T. gondii sporozoite, indicating infection of oocysts formed in cats.

The results of this study indicate that high rates of exposure to oocysts occurred in the NCCCTS mothers. However, the authors found that demographic characteristics did not reliably predict exposure to oocysts and that there was a lack of correlation between oocyst exposure and the severity of maternal or infant illness. In addition, the recognition of risk factors had limited sensitivity and specificity in identifying those individuals infected by oocysts.

The conclusions of this study are quite interesting from a scientific and epidemiologic perspective, but quite sobering from a clinician's point of view. Toxoplasmosis acquired during pregnancy can lead to devastating problems for the children of infected mothers. Patients need to be encouraged to avoid exposure to well-established environmental risk factors. However, the results of this study and other observations strongly suggest that, despite avoidance strategies, women are being exposed unknowingly to T. gondii oocysts. Even those who do not own or handle cats may be exposed to environmental feline fecal contaminants. Individuals may wear gloves while gardening, carefully wash fruits and vegetables, and thoroughly cook the meats that they consume but, theoretically, can acquire the T. gondii oocysts from their beloved canine companion whose fur was contaminated while rolling in the park where infected cats had been.

### A questioned authority meets well-informed pregnant women – a qualitative study examining how midwives perceive their role in dietary counselling [^111m5cjh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our results showed that the midwives felt that they were being listened to, but were uncertain what impact their counselling had on the pregnant women's behaviour. Their authority, therefore, was both ambiguous and questioned. The midwives viewed the pregnant women as eager information seekers who scoured the Internet for dietary information. However, the women were in need of guidance because they were considered to be too emotional and worried about interpreting the information and managing their diet on their own. The midwives were doubtful about the use of information sources on the Internet because they could not control or evaluate the information.

Pregnancy has traditionally been considered in midwifery as a normal life event. Nowadays, an increasing focus in midwifery care has been placed on risks and disease prevention instead of health promotion. In a Swedish observational study, the midwives in antenatal care emphasized pregnancy as being a healthy condition, but at the same time they used the antenatal visits to check the pregnancies for deviations and complications. Moreover, the midwives in our study seemed to medicalize dietary issues and prohibited intake of food items that might risk containing toxins or contaminants. They expected the pregnant women to follow their advice and to take responsibility for their diet while at the same time remaining relaxed and not too rigorous in relation to dietary issues. This is not an easy balancing act. Pregnant women receive advice and restrictions in the name of safety and risk-reduction, and they should certainly avoid an array of foods, but they should also avoid many other risky behaviours such as changing the cat litter and should take other precautions in their daily lives "just in case". Medicine in Western society plays an increasingly important role in shaping the ways we think about and treat our bodies. Thus medical advice influences many women to be more careful, but it can also lead to worry cf.; and worrying about being a bad mother is reported to be a significant problem among many pregnant women.

### Acetic acid and oxyquinoline sulfate (fem pH) [^112zKvaB]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Precautions

General

No special care is required for the safe and effective use of Fem pH.

Drug Interactions

No incidence of drug interactions has been reported with concomitant use of Fem pH and any other medication.

Laboratory Tests

The monitoring of vaginal acidity (pH) may be helpful in following the patient's response. (The normal vaginal pH has been shown to be in the range of 4.0 to 5.0)

Carcinogenesis

No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.

Pregnancy

Pregnancy Category C

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Fem pH. It is not known whether Fem pH can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Fem pH should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Fem pH is administered to a nursing woman.

### A randomized, controlled pilot study of cognitive analytic therapy for stressed pregnant women with underlying anxiety and depression in a routine health service setting [^111C4Yjf]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

A pilot study of cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) plus treatment as usual (TAU), versus TAU in stressed pregnant women with anxiety and depression, was undertaken as an essential preliminary to any definitive, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The trial was pragmatic, multicentre, parallel, randomized, controlled, and unblinded. Participants were pregnant women screened using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Treatment was standard 16-session CAT. Main outcome measures were Spielberger State/Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (primary outcome measure) at 24 weeks after randomization, therefore 1 month after therapy for the CAT group; HADS; Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM); Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS); 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36); and a brief Experiences of Therapy Questionnaire, completed at baseline and on average at 12, 24, 40, and 82 weeks after randomization. Thirty-nine patients (CAT + TAU, n = 20; TAU, n = 19) were randomized with mean baseline STAI State scores of 50.8 (SD 11.4) and 51.1 (SD 13.3), respectively. Sixteen patients had missing primary outcome data leaving 23 (n = 11 and n = 12) patients for analysis. The mean STAI State score was 38.5 (SD 13.8) and 45.7 (SD 16.8) in the CAT and TAU groups respectively at 24 weeks after randomization, with an adjusted difference in means of 7.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -7.9 to 20.6). No safety issues were reported. Patient retention for the CAT group was high (18/20; 90% of patients completed therapy). Ten out of 11 (90.9%) respondents 'agreed' or 'strongly agreed' that having CAT had been 'very helpful'. The study demonstrated the feasibility of safely undertaking CAT in this setting. Outcomes showed positive trends compatible with a clinically important effect, although statistically definitive conclusions cannot be drawn in such a study.

### Toxoplasma gondii, Brazil [^113zVkri]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

To the Editor

Recently, Jones et al. reported that past pregnancies increased risk for recent Toxoplasma gondii infection in Brazil. They did not, however, control for age. Previous seroepidemiologic studies have shown that age is a main confounding variable in analysis of risk factors for toxoplasmosis. Age can explain why mothers with more children are at higher risk for toxoplasmosis; the longer persons live in areas with high toxoplasmosis prevalence, the higher their risk for infection.

Also not explored were drinking water–related factors. Our recent study of pregnant women in Quindio, Colombia, found factors that explained attributable risk percent for infection to be eating rare meat (0.26%) and having contact with a cat < 6 months of age (0.19%). Drinking bottled water was more significantly protective for the group that did not consume undercooked or raw meat (odds ratio 0.06, 95% confidence interval 0.006–0.560, p = 0.008). We think that drinking water–related factors could explain up to 50% of toxoplasmosis infections in our region.

### Hydroxyurea (Hydrea) [^112tf3YZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

HYDREA can cause fetal harm based on findings from animal studies and the drug's mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no data with HYDREA use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, administration of hydroxyurea to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis produced embryotoxic and teratogenic effects at doses 0.8 times and 0.3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m2basis (see Data). Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with HYDREA.

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%–4% and 15%–20%, respectively.

Data

Animal Data

Hydroxyurea has been demonstrated to be a potent teratogen in a wide variety of animal models, including mice, hamsters, cats, miniature swine, dogs, and monkeys at doses within 1-fold of the human dose given on a mg/m2basis. Hydroxyurea is embryotoxic and causes fetal malformations (partially ossified cranial bones, absence of eye sockets, hydrocephaly, bipartite sternebrae, missing lumbar vertebrae) at 180 mg/kg/day (about 0.8 times the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m2basis) in rats and at 30 mg/kg/day (about 0.3 times the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m2basis) in rabbits. Embryotoxicity was characterized by decreased fetal viability, reduced live litter sizes, and developmental delays. Hydroxyurea crosses the placenta. Single doses of ≥ 375 mg/kg (about 1.7 times the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m2basis) to rats caused growth retardation and impaired learning ability.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Hydroxyurea is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant from hydroxyurea, including carcinogenicity, discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with HYDREA.

### Congenital toxoplasmosis [^117CyarY]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2013). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infection with Toxoplasma gondii is asymptomatic or mild in immunocompetent people and leads to lifelong immunity, but it can have serious consequences in pregnancy. About five per 1000 non-immune pregnant women may acquire toxoplasma infection, with a 10% to 100% risk of transmission to the baby. Risks of transmission to the baby are higher later in pregnancy, but risks of infection causing harm to the baby are greater earlier in pregnancy.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects on mother and baby of treating toxoplasmosis during pregnancy to reduce risk of vertical transmission and treat fetal infection? What are the effects of treating toxoplasmosis in neonates infected with toxoplasmosis prenatally? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found six systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antiparasitic drugs in pregnancy, and antiparasitic drugs in neonates.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^114hzWF8]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Toxoplasma prevention — food preparation and cat exposure guidance advises that all meat (lamb, beef, and pork) should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145°F for 3 minutes, noting that T. gondii can survive at 64°C (147.2°F) for 3 minutes so higher temperatures than this seem best for immunosuppressed patients; ground meat and wild game meat should be cooked to 71°C (160°F) and poultry to 74°C (165°F), and hands, fruits, and vegetables should be washed (BIII). Stray cats should not be handled or adopted; a cat already in the household should be kept inside and the litter box changed daily, preferably by an HIV-uninfected individual who is not pregnant (BIII); cats should be fed only canned or dried commercial food or well-cooked table food, not raw or undercooked meats (BIII); and patients need not be advised to part with their cats or to have their cats tested for toxoplasmosis (AII).

### ASHA kirana: when digital technology empowered front-line health workers [^116ykuz1]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

M-CAT: a digital tool for effective risk identification and clinical management

As an information technology-enabled tool, M-CAT was designed to enable ASHAs to collect clinical data from pregnant and postpartum women and assist MOs to identify maternal risks. It expanded the current focus on age, height, parity and spacing by including information about a woman's obstetric and medical history, as well as commonly occurring comorbidities. More importantly, it emphasised a cluster-based approach to diagnosing and grading the severity of both maternal risks and comorbidities. It oriented ASHAs to the idea that maternal risks require prompt action and provided doctors with case-sheets functioning like protocols to prompt systematic clinical assessments. In its design, the tool was an individualised response mechanism to clinical needs rather than a way of aggregating population level data to guide health programme planning.

M-CAT has four major components (table 1).

Table 1
Components of M-CAT

Drawing from a handbook on maternal risks, the forms included all potentially life-threatening obstetric conditions and comorbidities (acute and chronic) that can be algorithmically deduced from clusters of symptoms/signs and simple tests. Our medical team together with a group of experienced, practising obstetricians finalised this list of conditions (table 2).

Table 2
Conditions for which questions were included in the form

The tool excluded health problems that can be diagnosed only after detailed investigations (eg, domestic violence, postpartum depression) or sophisticated tests (eg, cortical venous thrombosis). It also excluded diseases that must be kept confidential (eg, HIV).

Questions in the tool were arranged in a systematic way. Algorithms to provide preliminary clinical assessments were created using the clinical guidelines in our handbook. The software was developed as an offline application written in Java, running on a Tomcat server with a MySQL database. The software had a simple user interface and could generate reports for each woman, identifying any risks and their severity, in a format similar to a short clinical case sheet.

### Exploring hygiene practices, prenatal recommendations and parental attitudes towards congenital cytomegalovirus prevention and screening in Sweden [^1141qCg2]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This large cross-sectional study conducted in Sweden examined parental attitudes regarding CMV prevention and cCMV screening and preventive behaviours during pregnancy. The findings indicate that parents' attitudes towards newborn screening for cCMV infection were largely positive, notwithstanding the increase in stress and worry that parents anticipated if their child received a positive screening test result. Similarly, most parents strongly agreed with the provision of information about CMV prevention during pregnancy; only 2% disagreed. Attitudes towards receiving information during pregnancy were positive regardless of anticipated worry or stress.

Additionally, results showed that most women who were previously pregnant with their child did not take precautions against CMV during their pregnancy, such as avoiding sharing eating utensils with young children, though they did take precautions against other infectious illnesses that could affect a fetus, such as avoiding changing the cat's litterbox. These findings underscore a critical gap in awareness and education around CMV prevention. In an era where health literacy and autonomy are at the forefront, it is clear that parents want to receive information about their health and the health of their baby despite any increase in stress. This highlights the importance of integrating evidence-based CMV prevention messages into routine prenatal care.

The survey distribution was widespread, and the Swedish population was geographically represented. The majority of respondents identified as women, which was likely due to the direction of the social media campaign. While this distribution does not represent the gender distribution of parents in Sweden, no gender differences were observed. Additionally, the questions on prenatal care were restricted only to parents who were previously pregnant with their child, which made up most of the total sample. Because the data collection process was anonymous, it was not possible to follow-up with any respondents after survey submission.

### Observational study to assess pregnant women's knowledge and behaviour to prevent toxoplasmosis, listeriosis and cytomegalovirus [^114FBJWj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Preventive practice knowledge

Of the 1,097 respondents, 75.3% (n = 794) had heard, read or seen some information about toxoplasmosis, 61.7% (n = 649) about listeriosis and 12.5% (n = 131) about CMV. Of these, the majority reported having heard about the infections from their health care provider or read about these in magazines, books, newspapers or on the Internet (Table 3).

Table 3
Sources where pregnant women get their information about infectious diseases from; N = 1.097

Percentages do not sum to 100%, because multiple answers were accepted.

Knowledge about how to prevent toxoplasmosis and listeriosis varied by topic (Table 4). In terms of preventing toxoplasmosis, respondents were most likely to correctly indicate that avoiding changing the cat's litter box (77.9%) and gardening with gloves (74.3%) were methods to prevent toxoplasmosis in pregnancy. Almost half of the respondents knew that not eating rare or undercooked meat (48.1%) and thoroughly washing and peeling fruits and vegetables (48.2%) are ways to prevent toxoplasmosis.

Table 4
Pregnant women's knowledge about preventive practices for infectious diseases; N = 1.097

* False statement.

Of the respondents, 63.9% (n = 691) correctly identified that listeriosis can be prevented by avoiding the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. Fewer respondents (45.8%) were aware that listeriosis can be prevented by thoroughly reheating all leftover foods and ready-to-eat foods.

Some statements were false (on purpose) and respondents seemed unsure about the answers to false statements for both toxoplasmosis and listeriosis prevention practices. For example, 73.9% (n = 797) of the respondents were unsure whether removing pet reptiles from your home would prevent toxoplasmosis and 65.6% (n = 707) of the respondents were unsure whether listeriosis could be prevented by avoiding areas where ticks live.

### Exploring hygiene practices, prenatal recommendations and parental attitudes towards congenital cytomegalovirus prevention and screening in Sweden [^112fdJSb]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

This study found that most parents in Sweden support cCMV screening for newborns. While a positive cCMV result may increase stress during the newborn period, parents did not believe it would negatively affect their bond with their baby. Their perspective does not support arguments against cCMV screening which state that stress or the potential impact of the parent–infant relationship are barriers to screening.

Parents also expressed support for providing pregnant women with information on hygiene practices to reduce the risk of CMV infection during pregnancy. However, many women reported engaging in behaviours that increased their risk of CMV infection, such as neglecting to wash hands after diaper changes, sharing utensils with young children and kissing young children on the lips. In contrast, risk behaviours like changing cat litter and consuming rare meat were rare, which aligns with the maternity healthcare advice women received. These findings highlight a gap in prenatal care, with little emphasis placed on CMV prevention. Future efforts should focus on identifying and addressing barriers so that pregnant women can be equipped with knowledge of this virus and how to prevent its infection.

### Cangrelor (Kengreal) [^112myTmM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of cangrelor IV (also known as Kengreal) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. Performance of neuraxial blockade procedures is not recommended during cangrelor use due to the potential risk of spinal hematoma. When possible, discontinue the use of cangrelor 1 hour prior to labor, delivery, or neuraxial blockade. Myocardial infarction is a medical emergency, which can be fatal to the pregnant woman and the fetus if left untreated. Do not withhold life-sustaining therapy due to the potential concerns about the effect of cangrelor on the fetus.

### Cat scratch disease during pregnancy [^112ukzHC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the pregnancy outcome, including long-term follow-up of the offspring, of pregnant women with cat scratch disease.

Methods

A surveillance study performed over 19 years identified eight pregnant women with cat scratch disease. A case of cat scratch disease was defined as a patient with a history of cat contact with regional lymphadenitis, other manifestations, or a combination of these consistent with the disease and one or more confirmatory laboratory tests. The clinical and laboratory manifestations and pregnancy outcome of all women diagnosed with cat scratch disease during pregnancy are described.

Results

Five of the eight pregnant women had typical disease with regional lymphadenitis; two had regional lymphadenitis with arthralgia, myalgia, and erythema nodosum; and one had neuroretinitis. Delayed diagnosis was common, although all women had a history of recent cat exposure. One woman who presented with clinical cat scratch disease during the first month of pregnancy had a spontaneous abortion. Another elected to terminate the pregnancy because of concerns related to radiation associated with abdominal computed tomography scan performed as part of an evaluation for suspected malignancy. The other six women gave birth to healthy newborns without congenital anomalies. No sequelae were recorded in mothers or children during a median follow-up of 4.5 years (range 0.5–9.5 years).

Conclusion

With the exception of one early spontaneous abortion in which causality to cat scratch disease could not be established, neither deleterious effects of cat scratch disease on newborns nor reports of long-term sequelae were found. Physicians, especially family physicians and obstetrician-gynecologists need to be more familiar with the clinical manifestations of cat scratch disease. Close monitoring of infected women during pregnancy is advisable until more data are available to determine the optimal diagnostic and therapeutic approach.

### Patterns of transmission and sources of infection in outbreaks of human toxoplasmosis [^116kWrvF]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Such events demonstrate the inadequate sanitation in industrial settings and restaurants and lack of quality control of commercial produce common in developing countries. Considering the increased attention given to safety for food of animal origin in recent years, and the concomitant increase in consumption of raw vegetables and fruits, foods contaminated by oocysts could become the main source for toxoplasmosis outbreaks.

When reviewing the number of cases in toxoplasmosis outbreaks, we noted that oocysts were responsible for outbreaks with high case counts, such as those occurring in city districts or entire municipalities. Although reported outbreaks due to oocysts and cysts occurred at similar rates, outbreaks from oocysts affected many more persons (> 1,400) than did outbreaks due to cysts (≈290 persons). Contaminated drinking water was responsible for the largest outbreak of toxoplasmosis described, but water also serves as a contamination route for vegetables and fruits when used in irrigation. Domestic and wild felids are known to have seroprevalence for T. gondii, and a single cat can eliminate > 100 million oocysts into the environment after primary infection. Such shedding can lead to water dispersion and large-scale outbreaks (Appendix). Cyst infection appears to affect fewer persons in intrafamilial or party-restricted outbreaks.

Public health prevention efforts for toxoplasmosis frequently focus on congenital infections to reduce the risk of miscarriage in pregnant women. However, with the occurrence of outbreaks in immunocompetent humans, we suggest that infection control and health education also should be directed to the rest of the population. According to World Health Organization estimates, toxoplasmosis is among the leading foodborne parasitic diseases and in recent years has affected > 10.3 million persons worldwide. Because toxoplasmosis is not a notifiable disease in most countries, reports of toxoplasmosis outbreaks in the literature are needed to increase our understanding of transmission and help reduce the number of outbreaks.

Through our review of published data, we believe the epidemiology of reported toxoplasmosis outbreaks has changed over the past 20 years. Consequently, we suggest that greater attention be paid to the production and disinfection of vegetables, to the quality of drinking and irrigation water, and to the adoption of legislation for tracking outbreaks with the aim of eliminating transmission routes, avoiding exposure, or inactivating the parasite before consumption.

### Eptifibatide [^114uHjcK]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.1	Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Available data on eptifibatide use in pregnant women from published literature and the pharmacovigilance database are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Untreated myocardial infarction can be fatal to the pregnant woman and fetus (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects when eptifibatide was administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits at approximately 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Myocardial infarction is a medical emergency in pregnancy which can be fatal to the pregnant woman and fetus if left untreated. Therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of potential concerns regarding the effects of eptifibatide on the fetus

Data

Animal Data

Embryo-fetal development studies have been performed by continuous intravenous infusion of eptifibatide in pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at total daily doses of up to 72 mg/kg/day (about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis) and in pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at total daily doses of up to 36 mg/kg/day (also about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis). These studies revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to eptifibatide.

8.2	Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no available data on the presence of eptifibatide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. As eptifibatide is a peptide, it is likely to be destroyed in the infant's gastrointestinal tract and not absorbed orally by the breastfed infant.

8.4	Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of eptifibatide in pediatric patients have not been studied.

### Bilateral ocular toxoplasmosis in a returning traveller: age and route of infection as potential risk factors [^114HCn5J]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Toxoplasmosis by T. gondii is one of the most common parasitic infections. Nearly one-third of the populationhas been exposed worldwide through ingestion of tissue cysts containing bradyzoites in undercooked meat or food/water contaminated with sporozoites contained in environmentally resistant oocysts from infected cat faeces. In the UK, seroprevalence-based studies estimate 350 000 people become infected annually, with 10%–50% being symptomatic. Most will have mild self-limiting low fever, flu-like illness, lymphadenopathy, generalised malaise and muscle pain. However, in vulnerable groups such as the elderly, pregnant women or immunocompromised (eg, fetus, cancer, HIV/AIDS, on systemic immunosuppressants) more severe disease might develop. The overall burden in the UK is unknown. In the Netherlands, Toxoplasmosis is the highest foodborne disease burden due to stillbirths and retinochoroiditis (both in congenital and acquired infections) with potential severe symptoms and long-term sequalae. The estimated lifetime risk of eye disease following acquired T. gondii infection for British-born individuals is 18 per 100 000. In comparison, in Canada, the risk of ocular toxoplasmosis (OT) after acquired toxoplasmosis is estimated to be 0.3% and as high as 25% in certain regions of Brazil.

### Latent toxoplasmosis and preeclampsia: evidence for the role of chronic infection in pregnancy complications [^113StNyo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Household activities, especially those involving contact with soil, cat feces, or raw meat, significantly increase the risk of T. gondii infection. Similarly, gardening without gloves exposes people to soil contaminated with oocysts from cat feces, which can survive for more than a year in warm, moist environments. Food preparation tasks also pose risks: handling undercooked meat can introduce tissue cysts or oocysts into the digestive tract. For pregnant women, these activities are of particular concern, as acute infection can lead to congenital toxoplasmosis associated with miscarriage, neurological damage, or eye damage. On the other hand, household physical activities and psychosocial stress may contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia through hemodynamic and inflammatory pathways. Strenuous activities (Such as prolonged standing, heavy lifting, or vigorous cleaning) can cause physiological stress and reduce uteroplacental perfusion by diverting blood flow to the working muscles. This ischemia-reperfusion injury in the placenta increases the release of antiangiogenic factors (Such as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, sFlt-1) and causes maternal endothelial dysfunction as a hallmark of PE. Epidemiological studies report a 3.1-fold increased risk of preeclampsia in pregnant women with high-stress jobs, a finding that could be extended to strenuous housework, particularly in resource-limited settings where the household burden is often not shared. Physical strain may also exacerbate oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine production (Such as TNF-α), further disrupting the angiogenic balance and increasing preeclampsia-related organ damage.

### The hubert de watteville memorial lecture. imagine a world where motherhood is safe for all women – you can help make it happen [^1179Xsxg]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2001). Low credibility.

The neglected tragedy of maternal mortality is a health scandal of our time. Motherhood can be made safe for all women and obstetricians have a global social responsibility to make it happen. Ten propositions are outlined: safe motherhood is to be recognized as a woman's human right; a woman's life is to be considered worth saving; life-saving emergency obstetric care is to made accessible to all women when they need it; all deliveries are to be attended by skilled birth attendants; all pregnant women are to have access to prenatal care; motherhood must be a voluntary woman's choice; making motherhood safe for all women is to be an international commitment; lack of resources in developing countries is not to be accepted as an excuse for inaction; women, North and South should mobilize for women's right to life; and our profession should act without national frontiers. The challenge is great, but so also is the reward.

### Seroprevalence and risk factors for toxoplasma gondii infection in women of reproductive age in Nigeria in 2018 [^112AWfdh]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Congenital transmission of Toxoplasma gondii can occur when a woman becomes infected for the first time during or just before pregnancy. Toxoplasma gondii in the fetus can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, ocular or neurological abnormalities at birth, or progressive visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive deficiencies. The national seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in Nigeria was previously unknown. The 2018 Nigeria HIV/AIDS Indicator and Impact Survey collected demographic, socioeconomic, and HIV-related data and stored blood specimens with consent for future analysis for other pathogens of public health importance. We evaluated toxoplasmosis seropositivity and risk factors in a sample of 44,269 women of reproductive age (WRA) between 15 and 44 years. The national T. gondii seroprevalence among WRA was 26.8% (95% CI: 25.8–27.7%). We found that WRA from all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory had T. gondii exposure. Seroprevalence was higher in 25- to 44-year-olds than in 15- to 24-year-olds. A similar proportion of pregnant and nonpregnant women were seropositive. Increased odds of seropositivity were associated with unimproved toilet facilities and drinking water sources, being in a higher wealth quintile, and primary and secondary education compared with no education. Decreased odds of seropositivity were associated with living in an urban area and owning livestock. This study provides the first-ever national seroprevalence estimate for WRA in Nigeria. Although information on known risk factors for toxoplasmosis (e.g., consumption of undercooked meat, cat ownership) was not collected, future studies could further investigate potential risk factors to inform the development of effective toxoplasmosis prevention measures.

### Intervention strategies to reduce human toxoplasma gondii disease burden [^114QWZf5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Infection with Toxoplasma gondii is acquired through consumption of undercooked infected meat, or by uptake of cat-shed oocysts. Although congenital toxoplasmosis is generally considered to contribute most to the disease burden of T. gondii, ocular disease from acquired infection was recently shown to add substantially to the burden. In addition, toxoplasmosis in immune-compromised individuals usually results from reactivation of an infection acquired earlier in life. Nevertheless, prevention of toxoplasmosis commonly targets mainly pregnant women. We summarize current prevention strategies of congenital toxoplasmosis and evaluate options to improve protection of the general population (including pregnant women). To protect the general population, freezing of meat destined for raw or undercooked consumption is the most readily applicable option, especially when limited to meat from animals originating from nonbiosecure husbandry systems. In the long term, more health benefits are expected from cat vaccination; therefore, development of a cat vaccine and evaluation of its implementation is a research priority.

### Methocarbamol (Robaxin) [^112NL2s3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects-Pregnancy Category C

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with methocarbamol. It is also not known whether methocarbamol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. ROBAXIN Injectable should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

Safe use of ROBAXIN Injectable has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. There have been reports of fetal and congenital abnormalities following in utero exposure to methocarbamol. Therefore, ROBAXIN Injectable should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards (see WARNINGS).

Nursing Mothers

Methocarbamol and/or its metabolites are excreted in the milk of dogs; however, it is not known whether methocarbamol or its
	metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when ROBAXIN Injectable is administered to a nursing
	woman.

### Risk factors for toxoplasma gondii infection in mothers of infants with congenital toxoplasmosis: implications for prenatal management and screening [^112buBoC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether demographic characteristics, history of exposure to recognized transmission vehicles, or illness that was compatible with acute toxoplasmosis during gestation identified most mothers of infants with congenital toxoplasmosis.

Study Design

Mothers of 131 infants and children who were referred to a national study of treatment for congenital toxoplasmosis were characterized demographically and questioned concerning exposure to recognized risk factors or illness.

Results

No broad demographic features identified populations that were at risk. Only 48% of mothers recognized epidemiologic risk factors (direct or indirect exposure to raw/undercooked meat or to cat excrement) or gestational illnesses that were compatible with acute acquired toxoplasmosis during pregnancy.

Conclusion

Maternal risk factors or compatible illnesses were recognized in retrospect by fewer than one half of North American mothers of infants with toxoplasmosis. Educational programs might have prevented acquisition of Toxoplasma gondii by those mothers who had clear exposure risks. However, only systematic serologic screening of all pregnant women at prenatal visits or of all newborn infants at birth would prevent or detect a higher proportion of these congenital infections.

### Rabies prophylaxis for pregnant women [^111r9b6L]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The 1999 recommendations of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices state, ". postexposure prophylaxis can be considered for persons who were in the same room as the bat and who might be unaware that a bite or direct contact had occurred". Bat bites may not be apparent when they occur, even with careful examination. In fact, most of the recent human rabies patients have no known history of exposure to a rabid animal. Of the 21 cases of bat-associated rabies in the United States during 1980–1999, 12 (57%) occurred in persons with apparent bat contact but no detectable bites. Our patient woke up with a bat flying in her room and did not know how long it had been there. The best course of action would have been to test the bat for rabies. However, because the animal had already been disposed of, laboratory testing for rabies was not possible. Furthermore, given that 5%–9% of bats tested in Washtenaw County, Michigan, are positive for rabies, the exposure risk was not insignificant. Therefore, it was our opinion that this patient qualified for rabies PEP.

Several studies of the safety of rabies PEP for pregnant patients demonstrated no association between treatment and adverse outcomes. In 1 study, tissue culture-derived vaccines and human immune globulin did not lead to an increased risk for congenital anomalies; no effects were observed on intrauterine or infant growth or development with a follow-up period of 1 year postpartum. Although these studies are not comprehensive in their assessment of all reproductive outcomes, they do suggest that PEP is generally safe.

On the basis of the exposure and our literature review, we recommended that the patient receive rabies PEP. After discussing options with her husband, the patient chose not to receive treatment, citing continued concern about the effect of rabies PEP on the fetus. There must be a greater public health effort to educate clinicians and the public about proper response to bat exposures, particularly undetectable bite exposures such as this case. Had public health authorities been contacted to collect and test the captured bat for rabies, there would have been no ambiguity as to the appropriate course of action.

### Chlamydia abortus in pregnant woman with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^115wm1ar]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The route of transmission to humans for C. abortus is uncertain, but direct contact with infected placenta and infective secretions are likely routes. The risk is limited mainly to those actively working with small ruminants, including veterinarians, and their immediate families. Large amounts of C. abortus are discharged through vaginal fluids of infected animals < 2 weeks before and < 2 weeks after abortion. Even without abortion, bacteria are eliminated through the placenta and vaginal fluids during labor in infected animals. Urine, milk, and feces also can contain small amounts of the bacteria following abortion. Women are at risk if they have close contact with small ruminants, but infection also has been associated with handling contaminated clothing and boots. We believe this patient had an indirect mode of transmission.

No effective human chlamydia vaccines are available. An early, phase 1 clinical trial assessed the safety and immunogenicity of a novel C. trachomatis vaccine in humans, but that vaccine would not be effective against C. abortus. An attenuated C. abortus vaccine is available for use in small ruminants but is not safe or approved for use in humans. Developing a human vaccine or adapting the existing veterinary vaccine to humans for such a rare zoonotic infection is not cost-effective. Instead, healthcare personnel should be educated on the importance of thorough anamnesis, and pregnant women living in farming areas should be informed about zoonotic infections. Prevention is the best course against human infection with C. abortus, but early recognition, targeted laboratory diagnosis, and appropriate treatment can reduce miscarriage and other effects in pregnant women.

### Perceived causes of adverse pregnancy outcomes and remedies adopted by kalenjin women in rural Kenya [^115w5ezW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Evil spirit of the dead

A pregnant woman is not supposed to eat meat of an animal carcass, as reported by 38% of the respondents. Such meat was believed to possess evil spirits that are transferable when eaten. The meat commonly reported to be avoided is an animal that was slaughtered because it suffered and died from pregnancy-related complications, such as placental retention, haemorrhage, an abortion or stillbirth. If eaten, it is believed that the "bad blood" that caused such complications is transferred, causing very similar complications to a pregnant woman who consumed it. Similarly, an animal that was slaughtered because it was sick, for unknown reasons, struck by lightning or by strangling itself with its umbilical cord, should not be consumed. The former is believed to cause maternal death whereas the latter will make the umbilical cord coil around the baby's neck resulting in stillbirth. Thus, a pregnant woman should be aware of the meat she eats. However, if she eats it without knowing its provenance, cleansing rituals must be performed to clear off the spirits of the bad blood.

In case there was a goat which died with kids in the stomach, that meat should not be eaten. Or a cow that died during labour, for example the calf came out but placenta retained she should not eat its meat. If she eats it, the placenta will also be retained during birth or she will die just like that animal.

On the other hand, as reported by 29% of the respondents, a pregnant woman or her husband should not kill any animal (wild nor domestic) or insects. Instead, they should get someone from the neighbourhood to do it for them. Otherwise it is believed that she will give birth to a baby with similar features of that animal. Unless they conduct rituals that involve giving the baby the name of that animal, the baby will retain those features to maturity, some of which are dangerous. The commonly mentioned animals were snakes, cats, dogs and chicken, and the killing was believed to cause disabilities such as blindness, lameness or even death.

### A multicenter survey on toxoplasmosis knowledge among pregnant women in Poland (the TOWER study) [^115Mgtbw]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite transmitted to humans through ingestion of food containing infectious oocysts that had been contaminated by feline feces (the definitive host), or ingestion of tissue cysts in undercooked meat of intermediate hosts, e.g. pork or lamb. The seroprevalence of T. gondii ranges widely in different areas of the world and different populations, from ≤ 10% to almost 100%. Although toxoplasmosis is typically benign and asymptomatic, it induces major complications in immunocompromised individuals and during pregnancy, where it can lead to miscarriage and congenital disease. Congenital toxoplasmosis is a substantial burden for public health worldwide. A previous report showed that about 41% and 5% of Polish pregnant women had specific IgG and IgM antibodies, respectively, and estimated that 1.5/1000 neonates were infected in utero.

Since there is no vaccine against T. gondii, prevention of maternal primary infection constitutes the major tool for avoiding congenital T. gondii infections and their complications. The preventive measures mostly depend on the women's knowledge about toxoplasmosis, its transmission, and origin. Previous studies have shown different levels of pregnant women's knowledge regarding the risk and consequences of toxoplasmosis infection during pregnancy. It remains controversial, however, if improved knowledge and access to reliable information about sources of infection are suitable to consequently change women's behavior during pregnancy. Nevertheless, the aim of the study was to assess the toxoplasmosis knowledge of pregnant women in Poland.

Although clinical trials address questions regarding drug safety for most segments of the population, pregnant women constitute one special group that is "orphaned" with respect to this issue. The lack of adequate pregnancy safety information for the vast majority of medications, combined with a need to make appropriate treatment decisions and to communicate risk information to a potentially vulnerable population, are some of the most challenging and critical women's health issues.

### It is not only the cat that did it: how to prevent and treat congenital toxoplasmosis [^115ZQrAr]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

The apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii was discovered a little over one hundred years ago and was soon recognized as a pathogen responsible for congenital infection. But detailed understanding of its epidemiology emerged only after 1970 with the discovery of its life cycle. In the last ten years, high resolution molecular tools have allowed the characterization of various strain types with different virulence patterns, and current studies are exploring the distribution of these different genotypes. In parallel, sophisticated diagnostic tools have been developed and awareness of disease burden has led some European countries with high prevalence rates to implement screening of pregnant women. In this article, the screening options and therapies used to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis are dissected in the light of recent data from cohort studies and other epidemiological data.

### ACOG committee opinion. air travel during pregnancy [^115Tx9Qv]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

In the absence of obstetric or medical complications, pregnant women can observe the same general precautions for air travel as the general population and can fly safely up to 36 weeks of gestation. In-craft environmental conditions, such as low cabin humidity and changes in cabin pressure, coupled with the physiologic changes of pregnancy, do result in maternal adaptations, which could have transient effects on the fetus. Pregnant air travelers with medical problems that may be exacerbated by a hypoxic environment, but who must travel by air, should be prescribed supplemental oxygen during air travel. Pregnant women at significant risk for preterm labor or with placental abnormalities should avoid air travel. Because air turbulence cannot be predicted and the risk for trauma is significant, pregnant women should be instructed to continuously use their seat belts while seated, as should all air travelers. Pregnant air travelers may take precautions to ease in-flight discomfort, and although no hard evidence exists, preventive measures can be employed to minimize risks.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

Advise the pregnant woman of the potential risk to the fetus based on the radiation dose from technetium Tc99m and the gestational timing of exposure (8.1)
Lactation - A lactating woman should pump and discard breastmilk for 60 hours after technetium Tc99m tetrofosmin administration (8.2)

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are no data with technetium Tc99m tetrafosmin use in pregnant women to inform any drug associated risks. Animal reproduction studies with technetium Tc99m tetrofosmin have not been conducted. However, all radiopharmaceuticals have the potential to cause fetal harm depending on the fetal stage of development and the magnitude of the radiation dose. If considering technetium Tc99m tetrafosmin administration to a pregnant woman advise the pregnant woman of risk to the fetus.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Technetium Tc99m tetrofosmin is present in human milk in small amounts (< 1% of maternal dose). There are no data available regarding the effects of technetium Tc99m tetrofosmin on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for MYOVIEW and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from MYOVIEW or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

To decrease radiation exposure to the breastfed infant, advise a lactating woman to pump and discard breast milk for 60 hours (10 half-lives) after technetium Tc99m tetrofosmin administration.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

### Efficacy of amniotic fluid, blood and urine samples for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in pregnant women candidates for amniocentesis using serological and molecular techniques [^116Q1eXG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease with a global distribution caused by the single-celled organism and obligate intracellular protozoan parasite T. gondii. It is primarily transmitted through ingestion of undercooked meat containing tissue cysts or food contaminated by cat feces. In the United States, it is estimated that 11% of the population aged 6 years and older have been infected with T. gondii. In various parts of the world, it has been shown that more than 60% of some populations have been infected with T. gondii, of course the incidence of the infection varies by population group and geographic locale. Infection is often highest in areas of the world that have hot, humid climates and lower altitudes, as the oocysts survive better in these types of environments. Most of toxoplasmosis infection were asymptomatic and some people may experience flu-like symptoms such as swollen lymph glands, muscle aches, and fatigue. Severe toxoplasmosis is usually happening in immuncompromised patients which can cause damage to the brain, eyes, or other organs.

### Awareness and knowledge of cytomegalovirus infection among pregnant women in French-speaking Switzerland [^116cmF5W]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Knowledge of preventive hygiene measures

Most participants (95%, 712/747) answered that hand washing protects against CMV, and 83% (620/747) considered that avoiding a child's eating or toilet utensils protects against CMV infection. Avoiding kissing a child on the mouth is a protective measure for 84% (626/747) of women surveyed. Not being in contact with a child's urine or tears would prevent infection for 86% (643/747) of women. More than half of the participants (62%, 464/747) believed that their partner could also transmit CMV via biological fluids and should apply the same prevention measures as them (Fig. 3).

Half participants (50%, 375/747) answered all 5 questions correctly. The median prevention score was 5 out of 5 (IQR 4–5, Supplementary Fig. 2).

Fig. 3
Knowledge and applicability of preventive hygiene measures

When asked about other preventive measures unrelated to CMV, 37% (279/747) wrongly believed that avoiding cat litter cleaning would protect against infection, and 24% (180/747) that avoiding raw meat and raw milk cheese would protect against CMV.

Applicability of hygiene measures

Most women surveyed (97%; 688/708) indicated that handwashing was a measure that was fairly or very easy to apply (Fig. 2). The same was true for avoiding child feeding utensils, which 78% (348/620) of women felt could be applied on a daily basis. On the other hand, 21% (130/624) of patients surveyed found kissing their child on the mouth difficult to avoid. Moreover, 60% (386/643) of participants found it difficult or very difficult to avoid contact with their child's urine. More than half (60%; 279/464) of the women thought it would be applicable to ask their partner to follow the same rules of hygiene as themselves to protect themselves against CMV (Fig. 2).

Factors associated with outcomes

The outcomes assessed in this study focused on participants' levels of CMV awareness, general knowledge, and knowledge of preventive hygiene measures. Multivariate analyses identified several factors associated with these outcomes, including multiparity, higher educational levels, and employment in high-risk professions such as healthcare or early childhood sectors. These findings reflect the determinants of awareness and knowledge, which are critical for improving preventive practices and reducing infection risks.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^1159xrHm]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Short QT syndrome (SQTS) in pregnancy — recommendation and context: In pregnant patients with SQTS, arrhythmia-specific treatment should be administered as in the nonpregnant patient and continued throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period (COR 1; LOE C-EO). There are no reported cases in the literature of pregnancy in patients with SQTS, so standard therapies should be continued throughout pregnancy since the safety of the mother and fetus takes priority; therapies proven effective for SQTS have been used safely during pregnancy, such as ICD implantation, and drugs such as quinidine have a long record of safety in pregnancy and lactation. AF is common in SQTS, and SQTS is a diagnostic possibility if a pregnant woman or fetus develops AF.

### Congenital toxoplasmosis [^116VWgSK]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Approximately 85 percent of women of childbearing age in the United States are susceptible to acute infection with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Transmission of T. gondii to the fetus can result in serious health problems, including mental retardation, seizures, blindness, and death. Some health problems may not become apparent until the second or third decade of life. An estimated 400 to 4,000 cases of congenital toxoplasmosis occur in the United States each year. Serologic tests are used to diagnose acute T. gondii infection in pregnant women. Because false-positive tests occur frequently, serologic diagnosis must be confirmed at a Toxoplasma reference laboratory before treatment with potentially toxic drugs is considered. In many instances, congenital toxoplasmosis can be prevented by educating pregnant women and other women of childbearing age about not ingesting raw or undercooked meat, using measures to avoid cross-contamination of other foods with raw or undercooked meat, and protecting themselves against exposure to cat litter or contaminated soil.

### Neglected parasitic infections: what family physicians need to know – A CDC update [^113TPHxq]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Chagas disease, cysticercosis, and toxoplasmosis affect millions of people in the United States and are considered neglected parasitic diseases. Few resources are devoted to their surveillance, prevention, and treatment. Chagas disease, transmitted by kissing bugs, primarily affects people who have lived in Mexico, Central America, and South America, and it can cause heart disease and death if not treated. Chagas disease is diagnosed by detecting the parasite in blood or by serology, depending on the phase of disease. Antiparasitic treatment is indicated for most patients with acute disease. Treatment for chronic disease is recommended for people younger than 18 years and generally recommended for adults younger than 50 years. Treatment decisions should be individualized for all other patients. Cysticercosis can manifest in muscles, the eyes, and most critically in the brain (neurocysticercosis). Neurocysticercosis accounts for 2.1% of all emergency department visits for seizures in the United States. Diagnosing neurocysticercosis involves serology and neuroimaging. Treatment includes symptom control and antiparasitic therapy. Toxoplasmosis is estimated to affect 11% of people older than six years in the United States. It can be acquired by ingesting food or water that has been contaminated by cat feces; it can also be acquired by eating undercooked, contaminated meat. Toxoplasma infection is usually asymptomatic; however, people who are immunosuppressed can develop more severe neurologic symptoms. Congenital infection can result in miscarriage or adverse fetal effects. Diagnosis is made with serologic testing, polymerase chain reaction testing, or parasite detection in tissue or fluid specimens. Treatment is recommended for people who are immunosuppressed, pregnant patients with recently acquired infection, and people who are immunocompetent with visceral disease or severe symptoms.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Toxoplasmosis — food safety and cat exposure prevention: All meat (lamb, beef, and pork) should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145°F for 3 minutes, with ground meat and wild game cooked to 71°C (160°F) and poultry to 74°C (165°F); a study found that T. gondii can survive at 64°C (147.2°F) for 3 minutes, so higher temperatures than this seem best for immunosuppressed patients, and hands, fruits, and vegetables should be washed before eating raw (BIII). Stray cats should not be handled or adopted; a cat already in the household should be kept inside and the litter box changed daily, preferably by an HIV-uninfected individual who is not pregnant (BIII), cats should be fed only canned or dried commercial food or well-cooked table food, not raw or undercooked meats (BIII), and patients need not be advised to part with their cats or to have their cats tested for toxoplasmosis (AII).

### Toxoplasmosis [^112e6yKt]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that infects up to a third of the world's population. Infection is mainly acquired by ingestion of food or water that is contaminated with oocysts shed by cats or by eating undercooked or raw meat containing tissue cysts. Primary infection is usually subclinical but in some patients cervical lymphadenopathy or ocular disease can be present. Infection acquired during pregnancy may cause severe damage to the fetus. In immunocompromised patients, reactivation of latent disease can cause life-threatening encephalitis. Diagnosis of toxoplasmosis can be established by direct detection of the parasite or by serological techniques. The most commonly used therapeutic regimen, and probably the most effective, is the combination of pyrimethamine with sulfadiazine and folinic acid. This Seminar provides an overview and update on management of patients with acute infection, pregnant women who acquire infection during gestation, fetuses or infants who are congenitally infected, those with ocular disease, and immunocompromised individuals. Controversy about the effectiveness of primary and secondary prevention in pregnant women is discussed. Important topics of current and future research are presented.

### Hydroxyurea [^116RVNRN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Hydroxyurea capsules can cause fetal harm based on findings from animal studies and the drug's mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no data with hydroxyurea capsules use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, administration of hydroxyurea to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis produced embryotoxic and teratogenic effects at doses 0.8 times and 0.3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m2basis (see Data). Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with hydroxyurea capsules.

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Data

Animal Data

Hydroxyurea has been demonstrated to be a potent teratogen in a wide variety of animal models, including mice, hamsters, cats, miniature swine, dogs, and monkeys at doses within 1-fold of the human dose given on a mg/m2basis. Hydroxyurea is embryotoxic and causes fetal malformations (partially ossified cranial bones, absence of eye sockets, hydrocephaly, bipartite sternebrae, missing lumbar vertebrae) at 180 mg/kg/day (about 0.8 times the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m2basis) in rats and at 30 mg/kg/day (about 0.3 times the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m2basis) in rabbits. Embryotoxicity was characterized by decreased fetal viability, reduced live litter sizes, and developmental delays. Hydroxyurea crosses the placenta. Single doses of ≥ 375 mg/kg (about 1.7 times the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m2basis) to rats caused growth retardation and impaired learning ability.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Hydroxyurea is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant from hydroxyurea, including carcinogenicity, discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with hydroxyurea capsules.

### A multicenter survey on toxoplasmosis knowledge among pregnant women in Poland (the TOWER study) [^112NMZXX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii ranges widely in different areas of the world and different populations. Although toxoplasmosis is typically benign and asymptomatic, it induces major complications in immunocompromised individuals and during pregnancy. Prevention of maternal primary infection constitutes the major tool for avoiding congenital T. gondii infections and toxoplasmosis complications. The preventive measures depend on the women's knowledge about toxoplasmosis. The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge on toxoplasmosis among pregnant women in Poland.

Methods

The study was conducted between October 2016 and January 2017 in 3 Polish cities. During a visit in a hospital outpatient clinic, pregnant women aged > 16 years fulfilled a previously validated questionnaire. The questions concerned personal data (age, parity, educational level, place of residence), toxoplasmosis knowledge (etiology, routes of transmission, symptoms, sequelae), and sources consulted to collect information.

Results

Overall, 465 pregnant women participated in the survey; 439 (94.4%) were aware of toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis was perceived as a zoonotic disease by 77.4%, as a parasitic disease by 41.7%, as a disease transmitted through poor hand hygiene by 8.6%, as a childhood illness by 4%, and as a congenital disease by 0.4%. Regarding the transmission route, 84.5% of women pointed at a domestic cat, 46.7% at eating raw or undercooked meat. The total of 84.3% did not know toxoplasmosis symptoms, and 12.0% stated that they did not present the symptoms. In multivariate analysis, younger age (OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.67–4.49; p < 0.001), city residence (OR, 13.45; 95% CI, 3.12–57.89; p < 0.003), and higher education level (OR, 6.81; 95% CI, 3.69–12.59; p < 0.001) were significantly associated with better knowledge of toxoplasmosis, and the number of children (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.22–0.48; p < 0.001) – with higher knowledge of the symptoms.

Conclusions

Among pregnant women in Poland, the basic knowledge on toxoplasmosis is very high (94.4%). Younger age, city residence, higher education level, and the number of children turned out significantly associated with better knowledge of T. gondii and toxoplasmosis symptoms.

### Congenital toxoplasmosis [^114CJLCw]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2014). Low credibility.

Toxoplasmosis is caused by infection with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. It is one of the most common parasitic infections in humans and is most typically asymptomatic. However, primary infection in a pregnant woman can cause severe and disabling disease in the developing fetus. Recent developments have included increased understanding of the role of parasite genotype in determining infectivity and disease severity. Risk factors for acquisition of infection have been better defined, and the important role of foodborne transmission has been further delineated. In addition, strategies have emerged to decrease mother-to-child transmission through prompt identification of acutely infected pregnant women followed by appropriate treatment. Refined diagnostic tools, particularly the addition of immunoglobulin G avidity testing, allow for more accurate timing of maternal infection and hence better decision making during pregnancy. Congenitally infected children can be treated, beginning in utero and continuing through the first year of life, to ameliorate the severity of disease. However, despite these many advances in our understanding of congenital toxoplasmosis prevention and treatment, significant areas of study remain: we need better drugs, well defined strategies for screening of pregnant women, improved food safety, and improved diagnostic tests.

### Pet-related infections [^1174vp8E]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Human contact with cats, dogs, and other pets results in several million infections each year in the United States, ranging from self-limited skin conditions to life-threatening systemic illnesses. Toxoplasmosis is one of the most common pet-related parasitic infections. Although toxoplasmosis is usually asymptomatic or mild, it may cause serious congenital infection if a woman is exposed during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester. Common pet-borne fungal infections include tinea corporis/capitis (ringworm); campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis are among the most common bacterial infections associated with pet ownership. Less commonly, pets can transmit arthropod-borne and viral illnesses (e.g., scabies, rabies). Infection in a pet can provide sentinel warning of local vectors and endemic conditions, such as Lyme disease risk. Treatment is infection-specific, although many infections are self-limited. Prevention involves common sense measures such as adequate hand washing, proper disposal of animal waste, and ensuring that infected animals are diagnosed and treated. Special precautions are indicated for immunocompromised persons. Increased communication between primary care physicians and veterinarians could improve treatment and prevention of these conditions.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Toxoplasma gondii exposure prevention in HIV infection includes serologic screening and food and cat-related hygiene. HIV-infected individuals should be tested for IgG antibody to Toxoplasma soon after HIV diagnosis to detect latent infection with T. gondii (BIII), and they should be counseled regarding sources of infection, especially if IgG negative. To minimize risk, patients should avoid raw or undercooked meat and raw shellfish, and lamb, beef, venison, and pork should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F to 170°F; meat cooked until no longer pink is usually 165°F to 170°F. Patients should wash hands after contact with raw meat and after gardening or soil contact, and wash fruits and vegetables before eating them raw (BIII). For cat ownership, seronegative patients should have someone who is HIV-negative and not pregnant change the litter box daily, or if they must do it themselves they should wear gloves and wash hands thoroughly afterwards (BIII); they should keep cats indoors, avoid adopting or handling stray cats (BIII), feed only canned or dried commercial food or well-cooked table food (not raw or undercooked meats) (BIII), and they do not need to part with their cats or have cats tested for toxoplasmosis (AIII).

### Prenatal toxoplasma gondii [^1158FK7C]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

(See the article by Boyer et al, on pages.)

One of the first lessons regarding congenital infections taught to third-year medical students on obstetrics and reinforced during their pediatric rotations are the variety and pathogenesis of perinatal viral and parasitic infections that can affect pregnant women and their fetuses. From the time of their residency training, obstetricians have been instructed to counsel their patients about strategies to reduce the risk of acquiring these infections. Ideally, these discussions should occur during visits focused on prepregnancy counseling. However, it is the standard of care to provide this information to pregnant women during early prenatal care visits.

Obstetricians focus on the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii because of the concern that maternal exposure, which is often asymptomatic, could lead to fetal infection resulting in congenital toxoplasmosis and the devastating neurologic and ocular sequelae that may occur in the affected child. Patients are counseled that avoidance of fecal contamination from cats and consumption of undercooked meat and meat products can significantly reduce the risk of exposure to this parasite. Strict avoidance strategies have been demonstrated by European investigators to be effective in reducing the rate of maternal toxoplasmosis infection.

To further reduce the disease burden of toxoplasmosis infection, the concept of prenatal serologic screening and treatment has been investigated by a number of researchers but is currently the source of significant controversy. Epidemiologic studies in Europe have supported the use of widespread serologic screening and treatment to avoid congenital toxoplasmosis. However, well-designed randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of both perinatal screening and treatment are currently lacking.

Routine prenatal screening and treatment has been the standard practice in France for many years. Currently, screening recommendations from respected authorities and professional societies in the United States, such as the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, do not recommend routine serologic screening during pregnancy except in immunocompromised patients, such as human immunodeficiency virus–infected women. These US recommendations have been supported by the lack of strong scientific evidence establishing the value of more aggressive screening strategies in pregnancy and the fact that the rate of toxoplasmosis is much higher in France and Latin America than in North America.

It is currently not known if there are detrimental effects of exposure to FAP tracers in utero. In case of documented pregnancy, alternative imaging procedures should be strongly considered. In women of childbearing potential, in case of uncertainty regarding potential pregnancy, point of care testing should be performed according to the PET center's standard procedure, which can include urinary or serum testing on the day of the examination. Precautions for lactating women depend on radionuclide and injected activity, and an interruption of 4 to 24 hours of lactation can be requested, depending on radionuclide and institutional policy.

### Pregnancy and the acceptability of computer-based versus traditional mental health treatments [^1138R3cA]. Journal of Women's Health (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Recent recommendations urge increased depression screening in pregnant and postpartum women, potentially increasing demand for treatment. Computer-based psychotherapy treatments may address some of perinatal women's unique mental health treatment needs and barriers.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a quantitative survey of pregnant women (≥ 12 weeks of gestation) on preferences regarding computer-based therapies compared with traditional therapies (psychotherapy and medication). Nonpregnant women and men served as comparison groups. Participants were provided descriptions of three computer-based therapies: video telehealth therapy (VTT), computer-assisted therapy (CAT), and self-guided online therapy (SGO). Participants were asked to select all options that they would consider for treatment as well as first choice preference. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) assessed current depressive symptomatology, and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) assessed psychiatric history.

Results

Participants included pregnant females (n = 111), nonpregnant females (n = 147), and males (n = 54). Among pregnant women, 77.5% (n = 86) indicated that they would consider some form of computer-based therapy for mental health treatment during pregnancy; VTT was the most commonly considered, followed by CAT and SGO. When asked to select their preferred intervention, traditional talk therapy was the first choice among all three groups, controlling for treatment history and PHQ-9 score. About one-third of pregnant women chose some form of computer-based therapy as their top choice.

Conclusions

While computer-based therapies were acceptable to most pregnant women in this sample, traditional talk therapy was the preferred option. Future research should consider how to tailor computer-based therapies to the unique needs of perinatal women.

### Prenatal toxoplasma gondii [^113mVLrk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

As the authors have concluded in this fascinating and thought-provoking study, "only systematic screening of pregnant women and/or a vaccine have the potential to prevent the fetal disease caused by acquisition of T. gondii during gestation by pregnant women in North America" [1]. Years ago, the French medical and public health authorities accepted the concept of perinatal screening and treatment to reduce the incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis. The current state of screening technology has evolved, and the economic argument against widespread screening appears to be dated. In the United States, can future mothers and their offspring afford to wait years for additional data to be accumulated from long-term, well-designed randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of both perinatal screening and treatment? Can this society afford the cost of funding these studies along with the additional financial and social burden of life-long support for those individuals who experience the major sequelae of congenital toxoplasmosis? It is time for these concepts to be seriously and carefully revisited in the United States.

In the absence of obstetric or medical complications, pregnant women can observe the same precautions for air travel as the general population and can fly safely. Pregnant women should be instructed to continuously use their seat belts while seated, as should all air travelers. Pregnant air travelers may take precautions to ease in-flight discomfort and, although no hard evidence exists, preventive measures can be used to minimize risks of venous thrombosis. For most air travelers, the risks to the fetus from exposure to cosmic radiation are negligible. For pregnant aircrew members and other frequent flyers, this exposure may be higher. Information is available from the FAA to estimate this exposure.

### Toxoplasmosis in pregnancy [^115GHB2N]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Pregnant women who acquire infection from Toxoplasma gondii usually remain asymptomatic, although they can still transmit the infection to their fetuses with severe consequences. Given the asymptomatic nature of most Toxoplasma infections, primary prevention in pregnant women may lower the risk of congenital toxoplasmosis. Both consumption of undercooked meat and unprotected contact with soil are independent risk factors for T. gondii seroconversion during pregnancy, while contact with cat litter may pose a risk in certain situations. However, many pregnant women lack knowledge of these risk factors. This article reviews toxoplasmosis infection in pregnancy, with an emphasis on risk factors and appropriate counseling of pregnant women.

### Safe motherhood in crisis; threats, opportunities, and needs: a qualitative study [^115LXMat]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Safe motherhood needs in crisis

Improving the living standards of pregnant mothers in crisis

Participants indicated that mothers need measures to improve their standard of living when pregnancy and childbirth are spent in crisis. For instance one participant mentioned

Considering the economic problems caused for the public during the pandemic (due to the quarantine), they could have considered some economic support programs such as providing main groups food packages or allowances for essential procedures, such as ultrasound for the pregnant women and new mothers. (P 14).

Improving the pregnant women access to pregnancy and childbirth related education and care during crisis

The participants raised the need to facilitate receiving child and maternity services and provide a safe environment for mother and child care during the crisis. One participant said

My greatest question, which was not responded to, was 'Why they did not allocate a specific ultrasound center or laboratory for pregnant women?' We had to refer to the centers where patients with coronavirus disease were referred for diagnosis tests or images. (P 19).

Improving the access of pregnant women to mental health services

The participants pointed out the need to improve mental health during the crisis and ways for facilitating access of pregnant women to mental health services. A multigravida woman said

Considering that pregnant mothers are under higher levels of pressure than other people in terms of mental and emotional health during the pandemic, in my opinion, there is a real need to take the required measures to provide this peace. To this end, educational pamphlets or short movies should be developed to calm down pregnant women so that they are not affected by negative thoughts. (P 13).

A primigravida participant mentioned:

I think that the health centers could have contacted us to give some information, reassurance, and training to reduce our fears and worries. This could have been very helpful because the worries and concerns of a pregnant woman are certainly different from those of ordinary individuals in a society. I believe the health authorities could have set up a special telephone line, a contact number, or a text message number to be used by pregnant mothers when they felt worried or anxious about the pandemic. If they truly did so, I think a better pregnancy experience could have been created during the COVID period. (P 1).

Toxoplasma-seropositive children aged < 6 years with CD4 percentage < 15% and those aged ≥ 6 years with CD4 < 100 cells/mm3 should be administered prophylaxis against Toxoplasma encephalitis (TE) (AIII), with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, one double-strength tablet daily for adolescents and adults (or weight-equivalent dosing for children), as the preferred agent (AII*). Primary preventive therapy can be discontinued after response to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with a sustained rise in CD4 percentage above 15% for children < 6 years of age, and > 200 cells/mm3 for children aged ≥ 6 years (BIII). Most experts recommend treating pregnant women with acute toxoplasmosis in an attempt to prevent fetal infection (BII), and empiric therapy should be strongly considered for newborns of HIV-infected mothers with primary Toxoplasma infection during pregnancy (BIII).

### Nifurtimox (Lampit) [^114oPzSi]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

Based on animal studies, LAMPIT may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Published postmarketing reports on nifurtimox use during pregnancy are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the fetus associated with Chagas disease (see Clinical Considerations).

Nifurtimox administered orally to pregnant rats, and rabbits during organogenesis was associated with reduced maternal body weights in rats, and abortions, reduced maternal weight gain, and reduced numbers of live fetuses in rabbits when nifurtimox was administered orally during organogenesis at doses approximately equal to the MRHD in rats and 2-times the MRHD in rabbits. An increased incidence of a fetal skeletal malformation (fusion of caudal vertebral bodies) occurred in rabbits at nifurtimox doses approximately 0.2 times the MRHD. In a pre-postnatal study, maternal body weights and fetal body weights of first-generation offspring were reduced at doses approximately equal to or 0.5 times the MRHD, respectively, and several male offspring in the nifurtimox treatment groups exhibited slightly small testes at doses ≥ 0.2 times the MRHD (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.

There is a pregnancy safety study for LAMPIT. If LAMPIT is administered during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving LAMPIT or within six months following the last dose of LAMPIT, healthcare providers should report LAMPIT exposure by calling 1–888–842–2937.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

### Knowledge and attitudes regarding preconception care in a predominantly low-income Mexican American population [^112wkYMc]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to determine knowledge and attitudes regarding preconception care in a low-income Mexican American population.

Study Design

This was a cross-sectional survey of 305 reproductive-age women at an urban public hospital.

Results

The sample was mostly Hispanic (88%) and pregnant (68%); 35% had not completed high school. Eighty-nine percent agreed that improving preconception health benefits pregnancy. Seventy-seven percent expressed some interest in preconception health care with the obstetrics gynecology office at the preferred location. The average knowledge of preconception care score was 76% (higher score more favorable). Areas of higher knowledge included the effects on pregnancy of folic acid; alcohol use; substance use; and verbal, physical, and sexual abuse; lower knowledge was found for the effects of cat litter and fish products.

Conclusion

There was interest in preconception education and agreement that preconception health has a positive effect on pregnancy. Fewer respondents agreed that it had a good effect than a suburban sample in the same region (89% vs 98%).

### A multicenter survey on toxoplasmosis knowledge among pregnant women in Poland (the TOWER study) [^115HyCHs]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Regarding the question about the transmission route of T. gondii, 84.5% of women responded that it was transmitted via a domestic cat, and 46.7% pointed at eating raw or undercooked meat. Only 0.6% of the participants thought the parasite was spread through insect bites and 5.2% did not have knowledge on the subject.

The total of 84.3% of the surveyed did not know toxoplasmosis symptoms, and 12.0% stated that they did not present any symptoms of the disease. The pregnant women reported that the symptoms of toxoplasmosis included enlarged lymph nodes (3.4%), diarrhea (1.3%), and constipation (0.4%).

Among the preventative measures against toxoplasmosis, the respondents most frequently enumerated: avoiding contact with cats (83.9%), personal hygiene (46.0%), avoiding consumption of raw meat (45.8%), avoiding sandy beaches (4.9%), and avoiding contact with previously infected patients (0.4%).

In general, 83.2% of the participants believed that toxoplasmosis might be dangerous during pregnancy and according to 49.9% infection with the parasite could cause premature labor or miscarriage. When asked whether toxoplasmosis was a cause of any developmental defects in children (epilepsy, hypopigmentation, cataract, hydrocephalus, or heart defects), the vast majority of respondents (84.7%) reported no knowledge; 13.1% indicated heart defects as a potential consequence of toxoplasmosis, 11.4% pointed at hydrocephalus, 3.9% at epilepsy, and 1.3% at smallpox.

In the studied group, 83% did not know which trimester of pregnancy was associated with the greatest fetal risk related to the disease, whereas 17% indicated the first trimester.

### Neglected parasitic infections: what every family physician needs to know [^111kTbw1]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Neglected parasitic infections, including Chagas disease, toxocariasis, cysticercosis, and toxoplasmosis, affect millions of persons in the United States. Relatively few resources have been devoted to surveillance, prevention, and treatment of these diseases. Chagas disease primarily affects Latin American immigrants and can cause heart failure and death if not treated. Immediate antiparasitic treatment is indicated for most patients with acute Chagas disease. Treatment is recommended for patients younger than 18 years who have chronic Chagas disease and is generally recommended for adults younger than 50 years who do not have advanced cardiomyopathy; treatment decisions for other patients should be made on an individual basis. Toxocariasis primarily affects children and can cause gastrointestinal, respiratory, and ophthalmologic disease. Treatment options include albendazole and mebendazole. Patients with ocular infection require referral to an ophthalmologist. Neurocysticercosis, a form of cysticercosis, is the most common infectious cause of seizures in some parts of the United States. Initial treatment should focus on symptom control. Humans generally acquire toxoplasmosis by eating undercooked contaminated meat or ingesting things that have been contaminated with cat feces. Congenital infection can result in miscarriage or adverse fetal effects. Treatment is recommended for immunosuppressed persons, pregnant women, and immunocompetent persons with severe symptoms.

### Global seroprevalence of toxoplasma gondii in pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112D132F]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis study investigated the global seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii in pregnant women. In this regard, 138 eligible studies with the sample size of 135,098 prgnant women individuals were examined. The overall seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii in pregnant women was found 36.6%, the highest prevalence reported based on meta-analysis was reported in South America with 52.8%, while only 15 studies were reviewed in this continent, most of which were in Brazil. Therefore, after the continent, the highest prevalence reported was reported in Africa with 46.8% Also, the lowest prevalence reported based on meta-analysis was in North America with 19.7% and Europe with 24.6%.

According to the researches, Toxoplasmosis in pregnancy are mostly diagnosed in the third trimester of pregnancy. This fact returns to the suppressive role of immune system in gestation, especially in third trimester.

However, the severity of fetal complications is higher in first months of pregnancy such as mental retardation, chorioretinitis, and blindness. Thus, TG screening is strictly recommended for those exposed to the associated risk factors. The prevalence of TG infection depends on the presence of several risk factors such as living environment, education level, presence of cat in home, consumption of undercooked meat, and contact with contaminated soil. However, some other differences are associated with cultural beliefs and lifestyles.

Most of the studies reported a considerable relationship between the prevalence of Toxoplasmosis and raw meat. However, some studies reported no significant relationship in this regard. These different reports also depend on the frequency of raw meat consumption and type of meat (pig, sheep). According to studies, the educational status of women represents a considerable relationship with the seroprevalence of TG. Thus, a lower educational level is considered a risk factor for onset of TG in pregnant women.

### Seroprevalence of toxoplasma gondii and associated risk factors among pregnant women in Algeria [^113ZiCzp]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Toxoplasmosis is a common worldwide parasitic zoonoses, caused by an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Although most infections are asymptomatic, infection can have severe consequences if pregnant women become infected. Toxoplasma gondii is capable of crossing the transplacental barrier from a primo-infected pregnant woman to her fetus, leading to congenital toxoplasmosis, although the risk of fetal transmission depends on the exact timing of exposure during pregnancy. Consequently, depending on the trimester of pregnancy, infection with T. gondii can cause not only miscarriage or stillbirth but also serious and progressive visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive complications for the child. Therefore, early diagnosis of toxoplasmosis crucial to enable treatment in sufficient time to minimize transplacental transmission. In the majority of cases, toxoplasmosis is an asymptomatic disease in adults, but it can have devastating consequences in immunocompromised patients and nonimmunized pregnant women. Toxoplasma gondii is commonly transmitted to humans by accidental ingestion of the oocyst stages of the parasite in water or food, in soil contaminated with feces from infected cats, or by eating raw or undercooked meat containing tachyzoites or bradyzoites.

### Pet-related infections [^112qtCZj]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Physicians and veterinarians have many opportunities to partner in promoting the well-being of people and their pets, especially by addressing zoonotic diseases that may be transmitted between a pet and a human family member. Common cutaneous pet-acquired zoonoses are dermatophytosis (ringworm) and sarcoptic mange (scabies), which are both readily treated. Toxoplasmosis can be acquired from exposure to cat feces, but appropriate hygienic measures can minimize the risk to pregnant women. Persons who work with animals are at increased risk of acquiring bartonellosis (e.g., cat-scratch disease); control of cat fleas is essential to minimize the risk of these infections. People and their pets share a range of tick-borne diseases, and exposure risk can be minimized with use of tick repellent, prompt tick removal, and appropriate tick control measures for pets. Pets such as reptiles, amphibians, and backyard poultry pose a risk of transmitting Salmonella species and are becoming more popular. Personal hygiene after interacting with these pets is crucial to prevent Salmonella infections. Leptospirosis is more often acquired from wildlife than infected dogs, but at-risk dogs can be protected with vaccination. The clinical history in the primary care office should routinely include questions about pets and occupational or other exposure to pet animals. Control and prevention of zoonoses are best achieved by enhancing communication between physicians and veterinarians to ensure patients know the risks of and how to prevent zoonoses in themselves, their pets, and other people.

### Global seroprevalence of toxoplasma gondii in pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114t6Nzx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Toxoplasmosis is an infectious-parasitic disease in humans and animals, caused by Toxoplasma gondii (TG). Felines are the only definitive hosts of this parasite and other vertebrates are considered intermediate hosts. TG infection is transmitted through the presence of oocytes in water and food or soil (contaminated with cat feces), raw meat, organ transplantation, blood transfusion, and also placenta to fetus transfer during pregnancy.

Toxoplasmosis can affect healthy and immunocompromised individuals and can also be a life-threatening disease in immunosuppressed individuals. The parasite is transmitted through raw meat containing TG cysts or water containing oocysts from cat feces. Although felines are the only definitive host, TG can infect and replicate in almost any nucleated vertebrate cell. The life cycle TG has an asexual phase that occurs in nucleated cells and a sexual phase in the digestive tract of cats. Fertilized gametes from sexual reproduction are produced in the cat's small intestine, and excreted oocysts can persist in the environment for up to 18 months. Both waterborne and foodborne transmission have been reported.

This pathology is demonstrated in three forms of acute, latent, or cutaneous. Although TG infection is often asymptomatic, the acute type of TG infection is resembling the Influenza symptoms such as fever, sore throat, weakness, inflamed lymph nodes, and muscle pain. However, Toxoplasmosis is more severe in immunocompromised individuals with detrimental effects on the fetus.

Toxoplasmosis is often self-limiting in people with healthy immune systems, but it is a significant risk in immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women. Acute TP is associated with many complications for the fetus and pregnant mother. The risk of vertical transmission of TG from the placenta to the fetus increases from 25% in the first to 65% in the third trimesters followed by more severe complications such as miscarriage, premature birth, congenital-related Toxoplasmosis, retinopathy, neuropathy, homeopathy, hydrocephaly, microcephaly, and cerebral calcification. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment of acute Toxoplasmosis in pregnant women are necessary to reduce the severity of complications.

### Tazarotene [^1131tcMp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of tazarotene TOP (also known as Tazorac, Tazorac) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. A negative pregnancy testing should be obtained within 2 weeks of initiating therapy; this drug should be started during a normal menstrual period. If pregnancy occurs during treatment, this drug should be discontinued and women apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus; women of child-bearing potential should be warned of potential risks to the fetus and advised to use effective contraception. The drug tazarotene TOP (also known as Tazorac, Tazorac) is classified under category D in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has caused, is suspected to have caused, or may be expected to cause, an increased incidence of human fetal malformations or irreversible damage.

### Rabies prophylaxis for pregnant women [^114JGefq]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Rabies poses a 100% risk for death to pregnant women and an indeterminate risk to the fetus. Although a theoretical risk exists for adverse effects from rabies immune globulin and killed rabies virus vaccines, several studies assessing the safety of this treatment have failed to identify these risks. Indeed, the consensus is that pregnancy is not a contraindication to rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). Despite this concensus, healthcare providers resist treating pregnant women with rabies PEP. We describe a case of a pregnant woman with uncertain rabies exposure.

A 35-year-old pregnant woman (at 34 weeks gestation) sought treatment 3 weeks after being exposed to a bat. The patient reported awakening at 3:00to find a bat flying in her bedroom. She attempted to confine the bat to 1 section of the home and then called for help. A relative trapped and retrieved the bat, then disposed of the animal without further incident. The patient denied being bitten by the bat, and she had no obvious bite marks after the event. Initially, the patient sought information from online resources, her primary care physician, and her obstetrician. She was uncertain whether rabies PEP was warranted, given what she believed to be the low probability of the bat being rabid and the low likelihood of her having had direct exposure to the bat. The patient did express concern about the safety of rabies PEP in pregnant women. Because no unequivocal recommendations were made by either her primary care physician or obstetrician, she sought further advice from the Infectious Diseases Department at the University of Michigan on how best to proceed.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy: responding to a rapidly evolving situation [^115gPi7u]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

As the world confronts coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an illness caused by yet another emerging pathogen (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]), obstetric care providers are asking what this means for pregnant women. The global spread has been swift, and many key questions remain. The case-fatality rate for persons cared for in the United States and whether asymptomatic persons transmit the virus are examples of questions that need to be answered to inform public health control measures. There are also unanswered questions specific to pregnant women, such as whether pregnant women are more severely affected and whether intrauterine transmission occurs. Although guidelines for pregnant women from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been rapidly developed based on the best available evidence, additional information is critically needed to inform key decisions, such as whether pregnant health care workers should receive special consideration, whether to temporarily separate infected mothers and their newborns, and whether it is safe for infected women to breastfeed. Some current recommendations are well supported, based largely on what we know from seasonal influenza: patients should avoid contact with ill persons, avoid touching their face, cover coughs and sneezes, wash hands frequently, disinfect contaminated surfaces, and stay home when sick. Prenatal clinics should ensure all pregnant women and their visitors are screened for fever and respiratory symptoms, and symptomatic women should be isolated from well women and required to wear a mask. As the situation with COVID-19 rapidly unfolds, it is critical that obstetricians keep up to date.

American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Comprehensive risk assessment — existing tools do not incorporate nonmedical or contextual factors that may modify an individual woman's risk, so workshop participants emphasized the need for new, comprehensive tools early in pregnancy or in an outpatient setting and proposed a novel algorithm to comprehensively evaluate both medical and contextual factors to assist in the decision of whether to continue or terminate a complicated pregnancy. The algorithm incorporates patient-level factors, including the fetal prognosis, the capacity of the woman to manage her condition, and desire to be pregnant, together with external factors such as the ability of the system to safely manage her condition and the expertise of local providers, and the assessment of risk from the provider's perspective can then be multiplied by the assessment of risk from the perspective of the woman.

### Rights to safe motherhood and newborn health: ethical issues [^113F3Jyj]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2009). Low credibility.

Worldwide, one woman dies every minute as a result of being pregnant. This statistic highlights the denial of women's rights to safe motherhood in many parts of the world, particularly in low-resource countries where 98% all maternal deaths occur. The majority of pregnant women die because they deliver unattended by a properly trained birth professional. According to the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, every woman has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of herself and her family, including medical care. The principle of moral philosophy supporting women's rights to safe motherhood may be difficult to implement. Philanthropy is diverted by other competing needs, such as HIV prevention and treatment, or provision of urgent food supplies. Equity is denied because women's health is too often set as a low priority. Utilitarianism advocates that safe motherhood is an investment of societal shared interest.
