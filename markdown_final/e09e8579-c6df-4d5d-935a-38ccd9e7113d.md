## Question

Benadryl and elderly

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risks of diphenhydramine (Benadryl) in older adults and how to manage or avoid its use safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanism and why it matters in geriatrics. Then, I should verify the specific adverse effects and their evidence base. Next, I will review guideline positions and how to interpret "potentially inappropriate" versus "never use". After that, I need to check for any legitimate exceptions where benefits might outweigh risks. Finally, I will outline safer alternatives, deprescribing strategies, and a practical decision framework with monitoring and shared decision-making considerations.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism and its geriatric implications. Diphenhydramine is a first-generation H1 antihistamine with potent anticholinergic activity. In older adults, reduced hepatic clearance and increased CNS sensitivity amplify anticholinergic effects, which can manifest as sedation, cognitive slowing, delirium, urinary retention, constipation, blurred vision, and falls, and these risks rise with cumulative anticholinergic burden from polypharmacy [^113Mot8u] [^117G33az] [^111wk9rN].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for cognitive and functional harms. A high-quality JAMA study in hospitalized older adults found diphenhydramine was associated with cognitive decline, behavioral disturbance, and urinary catheterization, with a dose–response pattern, supporting causality concerns in this population. Meta-analyses also link anticholinergic drug exposure, particularly long-term, to incident dementia and cognitive decline, though observational designs limit certainty and heterogeneity is substantial, so I should frame this as a risk signal rather than absolute proof [^111vyCrg] [^113AgTQe] [^113iyeWZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm how guidelines position this. The AGS Beers Criteria list first-generation antihistamines, including diphenhydramine, as potentially inappropriate medications in older adults due to anticholinergic burden and safer alternatives, and the 2023 update explicitly recommends discussing non-sedating second-generation antihistamines and intranasal therapies instead. Surgical geriatrics guidance similarly advises caution with H1 antagonists with strong anticholinergic effects, especially around delirium risk [^115GbH6Z] [^111SnnQS] [^112kPcuH].

> I need to ensure I'm interpreting "potentially inappropriate" correctly. The Beers materials emphasize that inclusion is a warning light, not a prohibition. Use may be acceptable in select circumstances after weighing risks and benefits, documenting rationale, and planning mitigation, so I should avoid dogmatic "never use" language and instead apply clinical judgment with shared decision-making [^111SnnQS] [^1179AJV9].

> But wait, what if there are legitimate exceptions where diphenhydramine is reasonable? Let me consider scenarios like acute allergic reactions when epinephrine is first-line and a sedating antihistamine is adjunctive, or rare insomnia cases after safer options fail. Even then, I should use the lowest effective dose, avoid routine or scheduled dosing, and reassess promptly, because the balance still tilts unfavorably in most older adults [^notfound].

> Next, I should review safer pharmacologic alternatives. Second-generation antihistamines such as fexofenadine, loratadine, and cetirizine (with caution for sedation at higher doses) are preferred for allergies. Intranasal corticosteroids and saline rinses are effective for rhinitis. For pruritus, consider gabapentin in selected older adults. For insomnia, prioritize CBT-I and, if medication is needed, use agents with less anticholinergic burden and start low and go slow, reassessing frequently [^115GbH6Z] [^111wk9rN] [^113JqW13] [^112MKD9n].

> I should double-check deprescribing and substitution tactics. If diphenhydramine is already on the regimen, taper and discontinue when possible, substituting a second-generation antihistamine for allergies or intranasal therapy for rhinitis. For sleep, implement sleep hygiene and CBT-I and, if a sedative is still required, choose a short-course, lowest effective dose alternative with explicit stop criteria and close follow-up, documenting rationale if any exception is maintained [^115GbH6Z] [^116hxKXp] [^112MKD9n].

> Let me think about a practical decision framework. Before prescribing, screen for fall risk, baseline cognition, narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention risk, and total anticholinergic burden. Avoid scheduled diphenhydramine for sleep or chronic pruritus. If an exception is made, use the lowest effective dose, avoid parenteral routes when possible, and reassess within days to weeks for cognitive changes, falls, urinary retention, and delirium. Stop if any adverse effect emerges or if no meaningful benefit is observed [^112MrzV8] [^111vyCrg] [^111wk9rN].

> Hold on, I should verify perioperative and inpatient nuances. Geriatric surgical guidance flags H1 antagonists with strong anticholinergic effects as high-risk for postoperative delirium; in the hospital, routine "QHS Benadryl" orders should be avoided, and any use should be indication-specific, time-limited, and accompanied by delirium precautions and monitoring plans [^112kPcuH] [^111vyCrg].

> I will now examine communication and documentation. I need to ensure the rationale for any exception is recorded, counsel patients and caregivers about anticholinergic risks, provide a written action plan for monitoring, and schedule timely follow-up to confirm ongoing need and detect early harms. This aligns with Beers implementation guidance emphasizing education, shared decision-making, and vigilant adverse effect surveillance [^111SnnQS] [^1179AJV9].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: diphenhydramine in older adults carries meaningful risks of cognitive decline, delirium, falls, and urinary retention, particularly with cumulative anticholinergic burden. It is generally best avoided in favor of second-generation antihistamines, intranasal therapies, and nonpharmacologic sleep interventions, reserving short-course, low-dose use for compelling indications with explicit monitoring and deprescribing plans [^115GbH6Z] [^111vyCrg] [^111wk9rN] [^111SnnQS].

Benadryl (diphenhydramine) is **best avoided in older adults** because of its strong anticholinergic effects, which increase risks of cognitive impairment, delirium, falls, and urinary retention [^111wk9rN] [^111vyCrg]. It is listed as a **potentially inappropriate medication** in the AGS Beers Criteria for patients aged 65 and older, and safer alternatives (e.g. loratadine, fexofenadine, intranasal corticosteroids) should be used when possible [^115GbH6Z] [^111wk9rN]. If use is necessary, use the lowest effective dose, monitor closely for adverse effects, and reassess frequently.

## Pharmacological properties relevant to geriatric use

Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine with **significant anticholinergic activity**. It crosses the blood-brain barrier, causing sedation and cognitive effects that are especially concerning in older adults [^111vyCrg].

---

## Risks and adverse effects in elderly patients

### Cognitive impairment and delirium

Diphenhydramine use in older adults is associated with **cognitive decline and delirium**, particularly in hospitalized patients [^111vyCrg]. Anticholinergic burden is linked to an **increased risk of dementia and cognitive decline** [^113AgTQe] [^113iyeWZ].

---

### Falls and fractures

Diphenhydramine's sedative effects increase the risk of **falls and fractures** in older adults, especially with concurrent sedatives or antidepressants [^notfound].

---

### Urinary retention and other anticholinergic effects

Diphenhydramine can cause **urinary retention**, constipation, dry mouth, and blurred vision, which are particularly problematic in older adults with preexisting conditions [^113Mot8u].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria explicitly recommends avoiding **first-generation antihistamines**, including diphenhydramine, in older adults due to their anticholinergic burden and associated risks [^notfound]. The AGS also advises using **safer alternatives** such as second-generation antihistamines (loratadine, fexofenadine) and intranasal corticosteroids for allergy management in older adults [^115GbH6Z].

---

## Safer alternatives

| **Condition** | **Safer alternatives** |
|-|-|
| Allergies | - Loratadine <br/> - Fexofenadine <br/> - Intranasal corticosteroids [^115GbH6Z] [^111wk9rN] |
| Insomnia | - Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) <br/> - Melatonin <br/> - Non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (short-term use) [^112MKD9n] [^116SKGrA] |
| Pruritus | - Gabapentin <br/> - Topical corticosteroids <br/> - Moisturizers [^113JqW13] [^114i7Fxh] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where Benadryl may still be considered

Despite the risks, diphenhydramine may be considered in specific scenarios, such as:

- **Acute allergic reactions**: Short-term use in acute allergic reactions when alternatives are unavailable or ineffective.
- **Palliative care**: Short-term use for severe pruritus or anxiety in palliative care settings with careful monitoring.

---

## Monitoring and precautions

If diphenhydramine must be used in older adults, clinicians should:

- **Use the lowest effective dose**: Start at the lowest possible dose and titrate cautiously.
- **Monitor closely**: Watch for cognitive impairment, delirium, falls, and urinary retention.
- **Reassess frequently**: Regularly reassess the need for continued use and discontinue as soon as possible.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) is **best avoided in older adults** because of its anticholinergic effects and associated risks of cognitive impairment, delirium, falls, and urinary retention [^111wk9rN]. Clinicians should prefer safer alternatives and use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring if it is absolutely necessary.

### Iloperidone (Fanapt) [^1126vQRE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Tardive Dyskinesia

Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. The risk appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, but it is impossible to predict, which patients will develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration of treatment and cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment.

Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment itself may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, FANAPT should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to reduce the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: 1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on FANAPT, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with FANAPT despite the presence of the syndrome.

### Use of antipsychotic drugs and cholinesterase inhibitors and risk of falls and fractures: self-controlled case series [^117G33az]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Sensitivity analyses

To examine the robustness of our findings, we conducted sensitivity analyses with different definitions of the study population, treatments, outcomes, and lengths of the pretreatment period. We grouped patients by sex (men or women) and age group (65–74, 75–84, and ≥ 85) to examine any differential effects within these groups (supplementary tables 3–1 and 3–2). Anticholinergic burden (that is, the cumulative effect of taking multiple drugs with anticholinergic activities) is a critical issue that might also be associated with falls and fractures in elderly people. A high anticholinergic burden has been reported to adversely affect cognitive and physical functions and might also increase the risk of falls, admission to hospital, and death. To account for the potential effect, we included the anticholinergic drug scale to classify patients by their anticholinergic burden for the sensitivity analyses (supplementary table 3–3). To examine the effect of dose, we grouped the study population based on their cumulative doses of antipsychotic drugs (above or below the median) with the ratio of prescribed daily dose to defined daily dose (supplementary table 3–4).

### Comparative safety of medications for severe agitation: a geriatric emergency department guidelines 2.0 systematic review [^114j72y9]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Key points ○ Utilize nonpharmacologic approaches in the care of older adults with severe agitation as serious adverse events occurred in 16.8% of older adults who were administered antipsychotic or anxiolytic medications, though rates and types of events varied widely across drugs. ○ Midazolam posed an elevated risk of serious adverse events without any gains in clinical efficacy. ○ Oral medications, particularly quetiapine, had the best safety profile among the reported medications. ○ We observed an increased risk of adverse events with escalating doses of lorazepam. A comparable and clinically relevant signal in dose–response, though lacking statistical difference, was also observed for droperidol and quetiapine. ○ Intravenous and intramuscular use of antipsychotic or anxiolytic medications increased the risk for adverse drug events relative to oral administration.
Why does this paper matter? ○ Emergency clinicians should be aware of excessive risk in using antipsychotic or anxiolytic medications to treat severe agitation in older adults. Where possible, emergency clinicians should avoid benzodiazepines, favor oral medications, and use the lowest effective dose.

### Deferasirox [^111EGRrC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Age-Related Risk of Toxicity

Elderly Patients

Deferasirox has been associated with serious and fatal adverse reactions in the postmarketing setting among adults, predominantly in elderly patients. Monitor elderly patients treated with deferasirox more frequently for toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Pediatric Patients

Deferasirox has been associated with serious and fatal adverse reactions in pediatric patients in the postmarketing setting. These events were frequently associated with volume depletion or with continued deferasirox tablets for oral suspension doses in the 20 to 40 mg/kg/day range equivalent to 14 to 28 mg/kg/day deferasirox when body iron burden was approaching or in the normal range. Interrupt deferasirox in patients with volume depletion, and resume deferasirox when renal function and fluid volume have normalized. Monitor liver and renal function more frequently during volume depletion and in patients receiving deferasirox in the 14 to 28 mg/kg/day range when iron burden is approaching the normal range. Use the minimum effective dose to achieve and maintain a low iron burden [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Unusual reaction following benadryl administration… [^112pzdEP]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Numerous toxic reactions, of a relatively mild nature, have been reported following the administration of Benadryl. 1 Drowsiness, dizziness, weakness and nausea are those most frequently encountered. Sixty-three per cent of the patients in one series2 experienced side reactions, the chief one being drowsiness of varying degree up to narcolepsy. In view of the extensive and almost indiscriminate use of Benadryl at the present time, the following case history should be of general interest. REPORT OF CASE R. S., a white woman aged 26, was admitted to the First Medical Service because of a generalized seborrheic dermatitis of unknown origin. The lesions involved almost the entire body, including the face. On admission the temperature was 103. 2 F., the blood pressure was 90 systolic and 60 diastolic, and the pulse rate was 90. The blood count was normal. The lesions of both feet and both legs were secondarily infected. GEIGER J, ROSENFIELD SZ, HARTMAN DL.

### Anticholinergic drugs and incident dementia, mild cognitive impairment and cognitive decline: a meta-analysis [^113AgTQe]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points

We synthesised evidence from 26 observational studies.
Anticholinergic drug use, particularly long-term use, is associated with greater incidence of dementia and cognitive decline.
However, all but one study was at serious or critical risk of bias, and the findings were heterogeneous.
The potential benefits and harms should be carefully considered when initiating and continuing anticholinergic drugs.
Higher-quality studies are needed, targeting specific medication classes, and designed to reduce biases in previous studies.

Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. The risk appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, but it is impossible to predict, which patients will develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration of treatment and cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment.

Antipsychotic treatment itself may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, Iloperidone should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to reduce the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: 1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on Iloperidone, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with Iloperidone despite the presence of the syndrome.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: evaluation and management of asthma in the elderly [^112fDX1b]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2016). Medium credibility.

Asthma in the elderly — pharmacologic management, monitoring, and rescue/controller therapy considerations are outlined with age-specific caveats. "Current pharmacological management of AIE is based on guidelines developed for younger patients with asthma with Th2-high or eosinophilic airway inflammation", yet "Studies have shown that Th2 immune deviation may not be generalizable to all patients with asthma, particularly the elderly". Evidence gaps include that "Limited inclusion of older patients in clinical trials and alterations in medication pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics associated with aging impedes conclusions on optimal asthma management in this population". In trials, "Traditional lung function measurements to evaluate asthma medications in clinical trials may be less useful in the elderly due to increased prevalence of irreversible obstruction", whereas "Outcomes that are symptom-driven may be more effective". For routine care, "Furthermore, careful monitoring of inhaler technique (due to decreased muscle strength and loss of coordination), medication adherence, and potential adverse reactions to asthma medications are essential". Regarding rescue therapy, "Although β2-receptor responsiveness and affinity may decline with age, this has not been consistently established", but "elderly patients may be more sensitive to adverse effects of β2-agonists, particularly those with unstable cardiovascular disorders". Anticholinergics are addressed: "Short-acting anticholinergic medications may be useful bronchodilators in the elderly and do not have the cardiac side effects of β2-agonists", though "cognitive impairment, falls, symptomatic urinary outlet obstruction, and closed-angle glaucoma are potential risks of inhaled anticholinergics and should be used with caution". For controllers, "Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) constitute the cornerstone of chronic asthma management, yet they are underutilized in elderly patients", and "ICS use reduces hospital admissions and mortality in this population".

### Anticholinergic burden in the elderly population: an emerging concern [^117XZweP]. European Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Antimuscarinics are commonly used to treat overactive bladder, but increase anticholinergic burden, which has been associated with multiple adverse outcomes in older patients. We advocate for standardization of anticholinergic risk assessment and reevaluation of anticholinergic prescribing practices for the elderly.

### American Geriatrics Society identifies five things that healthcare providers and patients should question [^112f65hE]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines and Z-compounds in older adults — "benzodiazepines and the newer Z-compounds should be used sparingly in older adults and only after other behavioral interventions have been tried and failed".

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116YPY5z]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Older adults and switching to longer-acting benzodiazepines are of particular concern because they may be at greater risk of medication-related harm due to age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes, including reduced clearance of certain sedative–hypnotic medications and increased sensitivity to CNS effects; older adults' decreased hepatic metabolism changes how the body processes and responds to medications, causing them to stay in the body longer and increasing the risk of adverse effects; chronic BZD use is also a concern for older adults as they are likely to be prescribed multiple medications, increasing their risk of morbidity and mortality from polypharmacy.

### Canadian guidelines on cannabis use disorder among older adults [^112u8qD7]. Canadian Geriatrics Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cannabis use disorder, more specifically with respect to elderly patients (clinical assessment), CCSMH 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- potential adverse effects of cannabis use in older adults include changes in depth perception risking balance instability and falls, changes in appetite, cognitive impairment, cardiac arrhythmia, anxiety, panic, psychosis, and depression

- mental health disorders (such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia/psychosis) are commonly comorbid with CUD.

### Importance of considering competing risks in time-to-event analyses: application to stroke risk in a retrospective cohort study of elderly patients with atrial fibrillation [^114xVd8D]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2018). Low credibility.

In this article, we use the example of stroke in the setting of atrial fibrillation (AF) to demonstrate the potential degree of misestimation when failing to account for competing risks. We also show the potential implications for decision-making about primary prevention of stroke using risk models that do not account for competing risks. AF is a pertinent example as an increasingly prevalent disease that frequently affects elderly patients with multiple noncardiovascular morbidities. Among such patients, the occurrence of stroke after AF can be precluded by death from other causes. We aimed to demonstrate the impact of common comorbidities that may increase the risk of death with a less prominent effect on the risk of stroke. We hypothesized that the incidence of stroke is overestimated by the Kaplan–Meier method, and that the degree of overestimation will be higher among patients with a higher incidence of competing risks.

Based on the considerations described above, Cox regression methods may overestimate stroke incidence in AF patients. The CHA₂DS₂ VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age > 75 years, diabetes, stroke, vascular disease, age > 65 years, sex category)score is commonly used to guide anticoagulation in patients with AF. Most guidelines recommend anticoagulation for patients with CHA₂DS₂ VASc scores > 0 or 1, because the predicted stroke incidence is high enough to make the risk-benefit balance favorable. However, risk estimates that ignore competing risks may lead to anticoagulation of patients who do not have a high enough stroke risk to justify the risk, cost, and inconvenience of anticoagulation. We compared the performance of Cox and Fine-Gray regression models at predicting stroke risk using variables that constitute the CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score. We hypothesized that the predicted risk of stroke will be systematically overestimated by prediction models that use Cox regression rather than Fine-Gray regression.

### Clinical consensus statement: association of anticholinergic medication use and cognition in women with overactive bladder [^115ejF6e]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Overactive bladder/detrusor overactivity recommendations — when behavioral therapies fail and pharmacologic treatment for OAB/DO is considered, providers should counsel on the associated risk of cognitive impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer disease associated with anticholinergic medications in comparison with the potential benefits related to improvement in quality of life or overall health of the individual patient. To reduce overall anticholinergic burden, the lowest effective dose should be prescribed, and consideration should be given to alternative medications such as β-3 agonists. Consideration should be given to changing or decreasing the dosage of other anticholinergic medications that a patient may be taking. As recommended by the American Urogynecologic Society's "Choosing Wisely" campaign, use of anticholinergic medications to treat OAB in women older than 70 years should be avoided. When anticholinergic medications have to be used in elderly patients, consideration should be given to those that have low potential to cross the blood-brain barrier, recognizing that there are limited clinical data. Third-line therapies such as intradetrusor onabotulinum toxin A or neuromodulation should also be considered in patients not desiring to use medications for OAB/DO because of their adverse effects.

### How to use the American Geriatrics Society 2015 beers criteria – A guide for patients, clinicians, health systems, and payors [^111SnnQS]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Medium credibility.

American Geriatrics Society (AGS) 2015 Beers Criteria — detailed guidance emphasizes nuanced application: "Key Principle 1: Medications in the AGS 2015 Beers Criteria are potentially inappropriate, not definitely inappropriate", and "There is a common misperception that any use of a medication in the Beers Criteria is considered inappropriate. This is not correct". The criteria list medicines "generally best avoided in older adults because they are ineffective or pose unnecessarily high risk for harms", yet "there are some older adults in whom use of these medications is appropriate", so they merit scrutiny but are not universally inappropriate. Users should "Read the rationale and recommendations statements for each criterion. The caveats and guidance listed there are important", and "clinical judgment is required", since "a drug that the criteria consider "potentially inappropriate" may not always be a bad choice" and "just because a medication is subject to an exemption (or not included in the criteria at all) does not automatically mean it is a good choice". It is "important not only to know that a medication is included on the Beers list, but also to know why", which "should be used to guide decision-making", because "The risks of AGS 2015 Beers Criteria medications vary with the situation of each individual", for example a medication that "increases risk of falls may be especially unsafe in an individual already at high risk of falls". Optimal application includes identifying PIMs and "offering safer nonpharmacological and pharmacological therapies"; "Prior versions of the Beers Criteria have not offered alternatives", and "The AGS and AGS 2015 Beers Criteria Expert Panel are working on developing these lists of alternative therapies". Finally, the criteria "capture only a small percentage of the total burden of medication-related problems in older adults" and "work best when used as a starting point to review and discuss an individual's entire medication regimen".

### Carbidopa and levodopa (Rytary) [^116RwW36]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence

Patients treated with levodopa, a component of RYTARY, have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on levodopa, some perceived that they had no warning signs (sleep attack), such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events have been reported more than 1 year after initiation of treatment.

It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in a setting of pre-existing somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness in RYTARY-treated patients, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities.

Before initiating treatment with RYTARY, advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically ask about factors that may increase the risk for somnolence with RYTARY such as concomitant sedating medications or the presence of a sleep disorder. Consider discontinuing RYTARY in patients who report significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.).

If a decision is made to continue RYTARY, patients should be advised not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities that might result in harm if the patients become somnolent. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living.

5.2 Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion

A symptom complex that resembles neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. Avoid sudden discontinuation or rapid dose reduction in patients taking RYTARY. If the decision is made to discontinue RYTARY, the dose should be tapered to reduce the risk of hyperpyrexia and confusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^112mqJyW]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Beta-blockers for agitation in dementia — evidence, dosing concerns, and recommendation — Beta-blockers, notably propranolol, metoprolol, and pindolol, have been reported to be helpful for some agitated patients with dementia, but most case reports had somewhat atypical clinical features, raising questions about generalizability. Large doses (e.g., 200–300 mg/day of propranolol) were used and create a considerable risk of bradycardia, hypotension, and delirium for elderly patients; one small randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of propranolol in Alzheimer's disease showed benefit over placebo for certain symptoms but beta-blocker use was contraindicated for many otherwise eligible subjects. Therefore, routine use of beta-blockers to treat agitation in patients with dementia is not recommended.

### Verapamil vs quinine in recumbent nocturnal leg cramps in the elderly… [^114gYr3v]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — I read with interest the article entitled "Verapamil vs Quinine in Recumbent Nocturnal Leg Cramps in the Elderly" by Baltodano et al that appeared in the September 1988 issue of the Archives.

1. The third paragraph of the article starts off with the statement, "To date, the most effective treatment has been quinine. " The source of this statement was Medical Letters Drug Therapy. 2 The article then goes on to state that, in patients whose nocturnal leg cramps do not respond to quinine, use of verapamil at bedtime was beneficial. I was surprised that no mention was made of the use of diphenhydramine hydrochloride at bedtime in the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps. I have been using this drug as a first-line treatment for nocturnal leg cramps with great success. If the FARBER HI. Verapamil vs Quinine in Recumbent Nocturnal Leg Cramps in the Elderly.

### Morphine sulfate (depoDur) [^1158Zzn6]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Use in the Elderly

DepoDur was studied in clinical trials of 876 subjects; 222 were 65 years of age and older, and 43 of these patients were 75 years of age and over. The efficacy and opiate adverse event profiles in these elderly patients, at the same or lower dose of DepoDur, were similar to those in younger adults (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). However, elderly patients (65 years of age or older) may have increased sensitivity to morphine. Comorbid conditions may predispose the elderly population to serious adverse events such as respiratory depression, ileus, hypotension and myocardial infarction.

In general, caution should be exercised in the selection of the dose of DepoDur for an elderly patient. Dosing normally should be at the low end of the range.

DepoDur should be administered to elderly patients (> 65 years) after careful evaluation of their underlying medical condition and consideration of the risks associated with DepoDur. Provision for vigilant perioperative monitoring should be arranged for elderly patients receiving DepoDur.

### Anticholinergics for symptomatic management of Parkinson's disease [^114Gwz7F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Anticholinergics were the first drugs available for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease and they are still widely used today, both as monotherapy and as part of combination regimes. They are commonly believed to be associated with a less favourable side effect profile than other antiparkinsonian drugs, in particular with respect to neuropsychiatric and cognitive adverse events. They have been claimed to exert a better effect on tremor than on other parkinsonian features.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of anticholinergics in the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Strategy

The literature search included electronic searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2001), MEDLINE (1966 to 2001), Old Medline (1960–1965), Index Medicus (1927–1959), as well as handsearching the neurology literature including the reference lists of identified articles, other reviews and book chapters.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of anticholinergic drugs versus placebo or no treatment in de-novo or advanced Parkinson's disease, either as monotherapy or as an add-on to other antiparkinsonian drugs were included. Trials of anticholinergic drugs that were never in general clinical use were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data was abstracted independently by two authors. Differences were settled by discussion among all authors. Data collected included patient characteristics, disease duration and severity, concomitant medication, interventions including duration and dose of anticholinergic treatment, outcome measures, rates of and reasons for withdrawals, and neuropsychiatric and cognitive adverse events.

Main Results

The initial search yielded 14 potentially eligible studies, five of which were subsequently excluded. In three cases this was because they dealt with substances that had never been marketed or had not been licensed for as far as could be traced back. One trial had been published twice in different languages. One study was excluded based on the assessment of its methodological quality. The remaining nine studies were all of double-blind cross-over design and included 221 patients. Trial duration was between five and 20 weeks and drugs investigated were benzhexol (mean doses: 8 to 20 mg/d), orphenadrine (mean dose not reported), benztropine (mean dose not reported), bornaprine (8 to 8.25 mg/d), benapryzine (200 mg/d), and methixine (45 mg/d). Only one study involved two anticholinergic drugs. Outcome measures varied widely across studies and in many cases, the scales applied were the authors' own and were not defined in detail. Incomplete reporting of methodology and results was frequent. The heterogeneous study designs as well as incomplete reporting precluded combined statistical analysis. Five studies used both tremor and other parkinsonian features as outcome measures. Outcome measures in these five studies were too different for a combined analysis and results varied widely, from a significant improvement in tremor only to significant improvement in other features but not in tremor. All studies except one (dealing with methixine) found a significant improvement from baseline on the anticholinergic drug in at least one outcome measure. The difference between placebo and active drug was reported in four studies and was found to be significant in all cases. No study failed to show superiority of the anticholinergic over placebo. The occurrence of neuropsychiatric and cognitive adverse events was reported in all but three studies (in 35 patients on active drug versus 13 on placebo). The most frequently reported reason for drop-outs from studies was in patients on placebo due to withdrawal from pre-trial anticholinergic treatment.

Reviewer's Conclusions

As monotherapy or as an adjunct to other antiparkinsonian drugs, anticholinergics are more effective than placebo in improving motor function in Parkinson's disease. Neuropsychiatric and cognitive adverse events occur more frequently on anticholinergics than on placebo and are a more common reason for withdrawal than lack of efficacy. Results regarding a potentially better effect of the anticholinergic drug on tremor than on other outcome measures are conflicting and data do not strongly support a differential clinical effect on individual parkinsonian features. Data is insufficient to allow comparisons in efficacy or tolerability between individual anticholinergic drugs.

### Third-line therapy for overactive bladder in the elderly: nuances and considerations [^116VYA3W]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2022). Medium credibility.

4.3 Considerations

There are several considerations specific to the elderly population when contemplating SNM for refractory OAB:
Incomplete emptying/underactive detrusor: Older patients are prone to both incomplete emptying and OAB. Because SNM therapy is also indicated for nonobstructive urinary retention, it should be considered in patients with OAB/UUI and incomplete emptying when obstructive etiologies have been ruled out.
Ability to use the device: For safe and effective therapy, patients (or their caregivers) must be able to navigate and adjust the device. Comfort with technology and/or willingness to learn device use as well as dexterity and vision should be assessed when offering SNM.
Anesthesia/sedation risks: Older patients are more vulnerable to postprocedural cognitive dysfunction and delirium risks following anesthesia and sedation. Lightest sedation possible should be considered in older patients undergoing staged/full implants to minimize these risks.​​​​​​
Newer device technology: a. MRI compatibility: Historically, available SNM leads were not MRI compatible. However, with the introduction of the Axonics SNM System (Axonics) in 2019 and Medtronic's InterStim SureScan MRI lead (Medtronic) in 2020, current SNM implants do not preclude full‐body MRI. b. New peripheral nerve evaluation (PNE) wires: Although there is not yet published research to support it, improvements in PNE wire design may theoretically reduce the risk of wire displacement during the test phase. If the case, this should result in a more reliable test phase, allowing patients to undergo only one anesthetic following successful PNE rather than a traditional staged approach. c. Rechargeable batteries: Patients must be able to remember to charge the device at periodic intervals. In 2022, Medtronic and Axonics introduced recharge‐free devices that are expected to provide up to 15 years of battery life with low energy settings, potentially eliminating the lifespan advantage rechargeable batteries had over older nonchargeable iterations (15 vs. 5 years).

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116R9qeg]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — partnering with patients: Clinicians should develop the BZD tapering strategy in coordination with patients and their care partners in a shared decision-making process, whenever possible. Implementation considerations state that clinicians can consider utilizing educational resources when developing BZD tapering strategies with patients and can consider utilizing a motivational interviewing (MI) framework, which is patient-centered and seeks to involve patients in resolving ambivalence to change. In addition to discussing the risks and benefits of BZD use, clinicians should acknowledge and discuss the risks and benefits associated with BZD tapering or discontinuation, and patients can experience life-threatening withdrawal symptoms with abrupt or rapid discontinuation of BZDs, with some patients experiencing significant symptoms even with gradual dose reduction. As such, it is important for clinicians to adopt a patient-centered approach when considering BZD tapering, acknowledging patient concerns and engaging in a shared decision-making process, and discussions on tapering should prepare patients for what they can expect during the process, including potential withdrawal symptoms and how they will be managed. Education is a vital component of conversations about tapering; clinicians should inform patients on how the clinical benefits of BZDs can decrease over time while the risk of adverse effects increases or persists, may stress benefits such as improved cognition and psychomotor functioning, and should acknowledge the reality of physical dependence as well as potential withdrawal and/or rebound symptoms that may arise during tapering.

5.5 Tardive
Dyskinesia

Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. The risk appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, but it is not possible to predict which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

The risk of tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after a relatively brief treatment period, even at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment.

Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

Given these considerations, CAPLYTA should be prescribed in a manner most likely to reduce the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: 1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs; and 2) for whom alternative, effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on CAPLYTA, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with CAPLYTA despite the presence of the syndrome.

Conclusions

Medicines with anticholinergic activity are frequently prescribed in older people, and several rating scales have been developed to quantify anticholinergic burden. There is not one standardised rating scale for measuring anticholinergic burden. The reference composite scale developed would be a useful tool for clinicians to identify medicines with anticholinergic activity.

Discussion

Consideration of frailty

After evaluating the evidence for older adults, we considered how the evidence could apply to frailty.

What is frailty?

Frailty describes the loss of physiologic reserve that results in vulnerability to adverse events. Frailty can be identified in several ways, such as with the Clinical Frailty Scale or FACT tool, both of which define frailty as the lifelong accumulation of health issues that result in declining function, mobility, or cognition. Although there is heterogeneity among frail patients, frailty is generally progressive and robustly correlates with increased mortality and dependency. In contrast, successful aging is associated with illness avoidance, high physical and cognitive function, and active engagement in life.

Frailty and polypharmacy

There is growing awareness about the importance of reducing unnecessary medications for older adults but little consensus about the best way to approach medication appropriateness. One popular strategy is to use tools like the Beers or STOPP criteria, which identify potentially inappropriate medications. While these tools have made important contributions to clinical care, they have several limitations. First, adverse drug events are often related to non-list medications. In one study, Beers criteria medications caused low numbers of emergency department visits compared to non-list medications, such as warfarin, insulin, and digoxin. Also, lists may inappropriately discourage the use of medications to meet individual circumstances, such as using antipsychotic medications to palliate severe behavioral symptoms in advanced dementia. Third, despite admonitions to avoid certain medications, health professionals still endeavor to treat symptoms and may prescribe similarly risky non-list medications; for example, treating insomnia with trazodone to avoid using a benzodiazepine. Finally, the Beers and STOPP criteria do not address the degree to which individuals with advanced frailty should adhere to standard clinical guidelines for common medical conditions, a practice that can result in large numbers of prescribed medications and, thus, become a significant driver of polypharmacy. Therefore, one way to improve prescribing appropriateness is to develop frailty-specific recommendations — an approach we have adopted for the treatment of hypertension, diabetes, and prevention of cardiovascular disease with statins.

### Importance of considering competing risks in time-to-event analyses: application to stroke risk in a retrospective cohort study of elderly patients with atrial fibrillation [^115gEE7K]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2018). Low credibility.

There is less appreciation among clinicians that similar considerations may apply to the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease over the long term for elderly patients with multiple morbidities. A potential source of bias with time-to-event methods is that competing risks are ignored and not considered in the analysis. Although this practice may result in minimal bias when the incidence of the competing risk is small, the consequences of this practice become more serious as the incidence of the competing risk increases. Consider a cohort of 100 patients, of whom 1 patient dies of cardiovascular disease every year over 5 years. An intuitive description of their risk of cardiovascular death is that 5% will die of cardiovascular causes over the next 5 years. However, in a cohort of 100 patients with cancer, of whom 20 patients die of their malignancy every year for the first 4 years, the estimate of cardiovascular disease based on the complement of the Kaplan–Meier would be 12% (survival table provided in Appendix I in the). Accordingly, traditional methods of time-to-event analysis can overestimate the incidence of nonfatal events in the presence of competing risks. Rote application of interventions for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease based on these risk estimates may favor treatment of individuals from the lung cancer cohort rather than the healthier cohort.

This highlights the importance of accounting for competing risks in time-to-event analyses, which requires careful consideration of the questions to be answered. These can be broadly classified into 2 categories. An analysis may be conducted to describe the etiologic relationship between risk factors and the outcome. An alternative objective would be to provide an estimate of the risk of the outcome based on the combination of risk factors applicable to a patient. Lau et alwrite that questions about etiologic relationships are better served by cause-specific hazard regression models. In contrast, the cumulative incidence function (CIF) is better suited to describe event incidence in the setting of competing risks. Moreover, prediction of the absolute event rate in the setting of competing risks may be better served by a Fine-Gray regression model which allows estimation of the effect of covariates on the CIF.

### Potentially inappropriate medications used by the elderly: prevalence and risk factors in Brazilian care homes [^111qtTvN]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The Beers Criteria are used to classify and describe the risks related to these medications. For 20 years, the Beers Criteria list has been the most widely consulted list for evaluating the prescription of medication to the elderly.

However, these criteria must be updated regularly to reflect newly launched medications and the publication of new evidence related to the use of these medications. As a result, a multidisciplinary panel of specialists (American Geriatrics Society [AGS]) after a rigorous systematic review, recently updated and expanded the criteria.

The medications included in the new list are subdivided into three main categories: 34 medications that are potentially inappropriate because they have a high risk of adverse reactions or are of limited effectiveness in the elderly; 14 medications that are potentially inappropriate for elderly people with certain pathologies and/or syndromes since they can exacerbate the pre-existing disease/syndrome; 14 medications that should be used with caution by the elderly. These medications can be associated with greater risk than benefit in the elderly. In light of this situation, the main objectives of this study were to verify the prevalence of prescribing inappropriate medications to the elderly by using the updated Beers Criteria and to determine what factors are associated with inappropriate prescriptions in elderly institutionalized Brazilians.

### American Geriatrics Society identifies five things that healthcare providers and patients should question [^116SKGrA]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines and other sedative-hypnotics in older adults — "Don't use benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics in older adults as first choice for insomnia, agitation, or delirium" — are associated with quantified harms including injurious falls in Swedish women (relative risk = 1.853, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10, 3.06), hip fracture after initiating zolpidem (3.11 (95% CI = 1.96, 4.91)), adverse cognitive effects in randomized trials (odds ratio (OR) = 4.78, 95% CI = 1.47, 15.55), postoperative delirium (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.3, 6.8), and motor vehicle crashes (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.29, 1.97). The 2012 American Geriatrics Society Updated Beers Criteria notes that older adults should avoid benzodiazepines and that nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics should not be prescribed for chronic use, and nonpharmacological alternatives exist, with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolling 46 older adults showing cognitive behavioral therapy was more effective — immediately and over the long term — than zopiclone.

### Prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications use among older adults and risk factors using the 2015 American Geriatrics Society beers criteria [^114DfVCk]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The United Nation estimated that the population of older adults defined as those age 65 or older will almost double in Saudi Arabia from 3% in 2000 to 6% or more by the year 2025. As older adults population is growing, the prevalence of chronic comorbid health conditions secondary to the inevitable nature of ageing expected to increase. This, therefore, is potentially associated with an increase in the use of multiple drugs (polypharmacy) to well manage these comorbidities or to prevent associated complications.

Polypharmacy among older adults is common and consequently older patients are at higher risk of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) use. PIMs are defined as "medications that should be avoided due to their risk which outweighs their benefit and when there are equally or more effective but lower risk alternatives are available". PIMs are considered one of the commonly encountered medication-related problems among the older population. The use of PIMs is commonly evaluated using different scales and criteria such as the Beers criteria, which are a set of explicit criteria to identify PIMs. It was first developed in 1991 and consequently updated with the latest update in 2015.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^112hzVdL]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — psychosis and agitation management emphasizes nonpharmacological interventions first with careful risk–benefit assessment. Clinicians must weigh the risk of not treating against the risks of active treatment and the consideration and use of behavioral, psychosocial, and psychotherapeutic treatments is particularly critical. If symptoms cause significant distress or are associated with behavior that may place the patient or others at risk, treatment with low doses of antipsychotic medication is indicated in addition to nonpharmacological interventions, and treatment with an antipsychotic is also indicated if a patient is agitated or combative in the absence of psychosis, with the use of these agents reevaluated and their benefit documented on an ongoing basis. When antipsychotics are ineffective, carbamazepine, valproate, or an SSRI may be used in a careful therapeutic trial, and a low-dose benzodiazepine may prove useful for symptoms limited to specific times or settings, noting problematic side effects in elderly patients. Although mood stabilizers and SSRIs are commonly used for agitation, delusions, and aggression, they have not been consistently shown to be effective or safe and should not be seen as having improved safety or comparable efficacy compared to antipsychotics. As illness evolves, the continued use of any intervention must be evaluated and justified on an ongoing basis, and periodic reevaluation and revision of the treatment plan, including a change in dose, a change in medication, or medication discontinuation, may be indicated, with patients whose initial symptom severity was relatively low potentially more easily withdrawn from psychotropics.

### Advanced age as a consideration in spinal cord stimulation [^116rpog1]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Today, at age 102, with the aid of a spinal cord stimulator, VV's level of pain, functional status, and quality of life have all substantially improved. He underwent a SCS trial, permanent SCS implant, and later IPG replacement surgery without complication. This is not to suggest that all advanced elderly with appropriate pain-related indications for SCS should be offered the treatment modality. There are risks involved associated with SCS that must be considered, particularly in patients of advanced age who tend to have more comorbidities compared to younger individuals as well as a shorter life expectancy. As with any procedure, a risk-benefit approach must be utilized and thoroughly discussed with the patient. In this case, maintaining some degree of mobility and independence was of high importance to the patient, and this priority aided in the decision to proceed with SCS, which was made via shared decision making between the patient and his providers.

This case illustrates an excellent outcome with SCS in an extreme elderly patient. In the future, more studies on SCS outcomes will be required in both the elderly and extreme elderly populations to strengthen the evidence that can be included in these risk-benefit discussions with patients. We also advocate for the inclusion of extreme elderly patients in SCS clinical trials to better understand the efficacy and risk profile of SCS in this population. Lastly, we advocate for an ethical approach to treating pain and utilizing SCS in the extreme elderly. Such an approach should be free of bias against the extreme elderly, should extensively consider the potential improvement in overall quality of life that can be associated with SCS as well as the risk to quality of life that can be associated with not offering the therapy, and should respect patient autonomy by utilizing shared decision making. What we are strongly advocating is a patient-centered approach to care that does not disenfranchise individuals from consideration of spinal cord stimulation (or other pain-related therapies) based solely on age.

### How to use the American Geriatrics Society 2015 beers criteria – A guide for patients, clinicians, health systems, and payors [^113mwkfC]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Low credibility.

The Beers Criteria are a valuable tool for clinical care and quality improvement but may be misinterpreted and implemented in ways that cause unintended harms. This article describes the intended role of the 2015 American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria and provides guidance on how patients, clinicians, health systems, and payors should use them. A key theme underlying these recommendations is to use common sense and clinical judgment in applying the 2015 AGS Beers Criteria and to remain mindful of nuances in the criteria. The criteria serve as a "warning light" to identify medications that have an unfavorable balance of benefits and harms in many older adults, particularly when compared with pharmacological and nonpharmacological alternatives. However, there are situations in which use of medications included in the criteria can be appropriate. As such, the 2015 AGS Beers Criteria work best not only when they identify potentially inappropriate medications, but also when they educate clinicians and patients about the reasons those medications are included and the situations in which their use may be more or less problematic. The criteria are designed to support, rather than supplant, good clinical judgment.

### Collaborating with patients to make treatment decisions based on benefits and risks of medications associated with tardive dyskinesia [^114xEfhP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

​​​​​​ Many patients who are at risk for tardive dyskinesia fear that they might develop the involuntary neurological movement disorder, yet it is possible for clinicians to convey a realistic assessment of the benefits and risks of medications that might induce TD. Clinicians need to be aware of the importance of communicating reasonable risk in a way that will not alarm patients, using tools such as probabilities and phronesis in discussions with their patients.

Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2012). Medium credibility.

2012 AGS Beers criteria — pain medications in older adults list multiple agents to avoid and provide limits for non–COX–selective NSAIDs. Meperidine — Avoid because it is not an effective oral analgesic in dosages commonly used and may cause neurotoxicity; safer alternatives available. Non–COX–selective NSAIDs, oral (e.g., aspirin > 325 mg/day, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen) — Avoid chronic use unless other alternatives are not effective and patient can take gastroprotective agent (proton-pump inhibitor or misoprostol); high-risk groups include those > 75 years old or taking oral or parenteral corticosteroids, anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents, and upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2%–4% of patients treated for 1 year. Indomethacin and ketorolac (includes parenteral) — Avoid; of all the NSAIDs, indomethacin has most adverse effects. Pentazocine — Avoid because it causes CNS adverse effects, including confusion and hallucinations, more commonly than other narcotic drugs, and is also a mixed agonist and antagonist; safer alternatives available. Skeletal muscle relaxants (carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, methocarbamol, orphenadrine) — Avoid; most are poorly tolerated by older adults because of anticholinergic adverse effects, sedation, increased risk of fractures, and effectiveness at dosages tolerated by older adults is questionable.

### Fentanyl (Lazanda) [^1133fE38]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Fentanyl is present in breast milk. One published lactation study reports a relative infant dose of fentanyl of 0.024%. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of fentanyl on the breastfed infant and the effects of fentanyl on milk production.

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with LAZANDA.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor infants exposed to LAZANDA through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2), Nonclinical Toxicology(13.1)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of LAZANDA have not been established in patients below the age of 18 years.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 523 opioid tolerant cancer patients with breakthrough cancer pain in clinical studies of LAZANDA, 148 (28%) were aged 60 years and over. No clinically meaningful difference was noted in the safety profile of the group aged over 60 years versus that of younger patients in LAZANDA clinical trials.

Elderly patients have been shown to be more sensitive to the effects of fentanyl when administered intravenously compared with the younger population. Therefore, exercise caution when individually titrating LAZANDA in elderly patients to provide adequate efficacy while minimizing risk.

Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of LAZANDA slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Fentanyl is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

### Insomnia in the elderly [^112MKD9n]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to 40% of adults have insomnia, with difficulty getting to sleep, early waking, or feeling unrefreshed on waking. The prevalence of insomnia increases with age. Other risk factors include psychological factors, stress, daytime napping, and hyperarousal.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of non-drug treatments for insomnia in elderly people? What are the effects of drug treatments for insomnia in elderly people? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 28 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: benzodiazepines (brotizolam, flurazepam, loprazolam, midazolam, nitrazepam, quazepam, temazepam, and triazolam), cognitive behavioural therapy, diphenhydramine, exercise programmes, timed exposure to bright light, zaleplon, zolpidem, and zopiclone.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113cQ6CJ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Although BZDs may offer short-term benefits, the adverse effects associated with their use — including risk of falls and cognitive impairment — have generally been shown to outweigh the marginal benefits in adults 65 years and older. Chronic BZD use is also a significant concern for older adults given they are likely to be prescribed multiple medications, increasing their risk of morbidity and mortality from polypharmacy. For these reasons, the AGS Beers Criteria recommends avoiding the use of both long- and short-acting BZDs in adults over 65 years of age. Clinicians should generally consider alternative treatment options with more favorable safety profiles.

The CGC recommends that clinicians make every effort to taper BZD use in older adults unless there are compelling reasons for continuation. However, they noted that the decision to taper should still be made based on a careful assessment of risks and benefits for the patient. For example, BZD are sometimes prescribed to control agitation in older adults. The benefits of controlling the patient's agitation may outweigh the potential adverse effects of the BZD and be a compelling reason for continuing the medication.

AGS 2015 Beers Criteria — recognition and evaluation of adverse drug effects in older adults: Adverse events "may not be recognized or reported by patients, caregivers, or clinicians as symptoms of an underlying condition or simply a result of old age", so "careful inquiry is often necessary", with attention to the adage that "any symptom in an older adult is a medication side effect until proven otherwise", and "the only way to determine if an individual's symptoms are due to a drug is to withdraw the medication and see whether the symptoms improve, informally or as part of a more systematic N-of-1 trial".

### Cognitive and other adverse effects of diphenhydramine use in… [^111vyCrg]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Diphenhydramine administration in older hospitalized patients is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and other adverse effects with a dose-response relationship. Careful review of its use is necessary in this vulnerable population. The current data about the effect of anticholinergic medications on cognitive function in the elderly are conflicting. This study shows that diphenhydramine use in hospitalized elderly patients carries substantial risk. Diphenhydramine use was associated with significant risk of cognitive decline, behavioral disturbance, and urinary catheter placement, of which the latter 2 may be markers of the anticholinergic effects of delirium resulting in agitation and urinary retention. This study lends strong support to a previously published expert consensus report on inappropriate medication use in the elderly, which deemed that diphenhydramine was inappropriate for use as a sedative in the elderly, independent of patient diagnosis.

28 A thorough patient history, physical examination, and review of proper sleep hygiene is the recommended clinical workup, and therapy using nonpharmacologic intervention is the preferred management. 29 Our results suggest that the clinician's review of a patient's list of daily medications to remove the "routine" or "as needed for sleep" prescriptions is critically important in reducing unwanted outcomes such as cognitive decline. Ultimately, appropriate use of diphenhydramine in the elderly remains an important clinical issue, not only because it is widely prescribed in older hospitalized patients, but also because it is present in a vast array of over-the-counter preparations and is used frequently in skilled nursing facilities. Thus, the magnitude of diphenhydramine use demands that clinicians carefully consider the potential for adverse outcomes in a population that is already at high risk based on age, baseline cognitive impairment, and other medical comorbidities.

In summary, this study suggests that diphenhydramine use in the hospitalized older patient contributes most notably to cognitive decline, behavioral disturbance, and initiation of bladder catheterization. Based on these data, we recommend that diphenhydramine be used with caution in elderly patients and not, for instance, administered as a routine sleep aid. Also, the practice of administering diphenhydramine prophylactically prior to blood transfusions in the absence of previous transfusion reaction has no documented benefit and should be curtailed. Increased attention to the potential for serious adverse effects in the elderly should lead to modification of common prescribing patterns and heightened awareness concerning the limited use of diphenhydramine in geriatric patients.

### Any versus long-term prescribing of high risk medications in older people using 2012 beers criteria: results from three cross-sectional samples of primary care records for 2003 / 4, 2007 / 8 and 2011 / 12 [^111P6oNA]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Polypharmacy, the use of multiple drugs by the same individual, is increasingly common in older people in both the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK).

Over the past decade, the average number of prescribed items per person per year in England rose from 12.4 in 2002 to 18.7 in 2012; patients aged 60 years or over received half of all prescribed items. Any medicine has the potential for benefits as well as risks, but older people are at greater risk of adverse reactions because of age-associated changes affecting pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

Various tools, including the START/STOPP toolkit and the Beers Criteria, have been created to help clinicians to minimise risk by avoiding the use of drugs with a higher risk-to-benefit ratio in older people. Although historically, it has been proposed that Beers criteria have weaknesses when used in European clinical settings, recently it has shown the Beers criteria to be more sensitive and complementary to tools developed for use in Europe (e.g. STOPP). The Beers Criteria is endorsed by the American Geriatrics Society and their recommendations have recently been updated through systematic review of the evidence base. Beers lists drugs (or drug classes) with potentially harmful effects in the older population, including those consistently associated with poor patient outcomes (adverse drug reactions, hospitalisation, and mortality). To develop the 2012 update, a multidisciplinary panel of experts used a modified Delphi method to select drugs (or drug classes) with a potentially high risk-to-benefit ratio in older people and to reach consensus on their safest use, including explicit recommendations regarding drugs to avoid in all or selected circumstances. Aside from clinical use, the Beers Criteria have been used extensively in epidemiological studies, and implemented in healthcare settings to assess the quality of care. In the US, the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) has used the Beers Criteria as one of the main criteria to define the list of high risk medications (HRM) to avoid in the elderly. Based on the NCQA list, approximately a quarter of the US older population received at least one HRM in 2006 and 2007.

### Pimozide [^111f2dF6]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

The use of pimozide in the treatment of Tourette's Disorder involves different risk/benefit considerations than when antipsychotic drugs are used to treat other conditions. Consequently, a decision to use pimozide should take into consideration the following (see also PRECAUTIONS - Information for Patients).

Tardive Dyskinesia

A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

Both the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.

There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

### Dronabinol [^111pMFu5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PATIENT INFORMATION

DRONABINOL capsules, for oral use, CIII

What is the most important information I should know about dronabinol capsules? Dronabinol capsules can cause serious side effects, including:

Worsening mental (psychiatric) symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms can worsen in people who have mania, depression, or schizophrenia and who take dronabinol capsules. Dronabinol capsules taken with medicines that cause psychiatric symptoms can worsen psychiatric symptoms. Elderly people who take dronabinol capsules may have a greater risk of having psychiatric symptoms. Tell your doctor if you have new or worsening mood symptoms, including symptoms of mania, depression, or schizophrenia.
Problems thinking clearly. Tell your doctor if you have trouble remembering things, concentrating, have increased sleepiness, or confusion. Elderly people may have a greater risk of having problems thinking clearly.
Changes in your blood pressure. Dronabinol capsules may increase or decrease your blood pressure, especially when you start taking dronabinol capsules or when your dose is changed. Tell your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of changes in your blood pressure including: headaches, vision problems, dizziness, feeling lightheaded, fainting, or a fast heartbeat. Elderly people, especially those with dementia, and people with heart problems may have an increased risk of changes in blood pressure and an increased risk of falls.

### Quetiapine (Seroquel) [^116Nqa5T]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking SEROQUEL XR.

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementia-related psychoses treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death compared with placebo. SEROQUEL XR is not approved for elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^111wk9rN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Elderly rhinitis — prevalence, pathophysiology, and treatment considerations: In older adults, rhinitis is common, occurring "in up to 30% of the elderly, with > 40% of these patients rating their rhinitis as moderate/severe, and almost 70% experiencing ocular symptoms", and "drug-induced rhinitis is not infrequent". Age-related nasal changes are described, and "the clear rhinorrhea reported to be the major rhinitis symptom in over 70% of this older population" is linked to "cholinergic hyperactivity and excessive rhinorrhea". For management, "intranasal ipratropium seems to be a logical intervention", while "Second-generation oral antihistamines, INAH, leukotriene inhibitors, and INCS are effective and well tolerated in the elderly… but controlled data… are lacking". Importantly, "Sedating antihistamines… should be avoided in the elderly due to the risk of urinary retention, constipation, delirium, and ocular pressure changes", and a "2015 US prospective population-based cohort study" suggested a dementia risk signal with stronger anticholinergic agents including sedating oral antihistamines.

### Carbidopa [^113E3ssx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of carbidopa did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease and other drug therapy.

### Anticholinergic effects of medication in elderly patients [^113Mot8u]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Anticholinergic toxicity is a common problem in the elderly. It has many effects ranging from dry mouth, constipation, and visual impairments to confusion, delirium, and severe cognitive decline. The toxicity is often the result of the cumulative anticholinergic burden of multiple prescription medications and metabolites rather than of a single compound. The management of elderly patients, particularly those suffering from dementia, should therefore aim to reduce the use of medications with anticholinergic effects.

### Amitriptyline hydrochloride (Elavil 25 mg) [^1136Zq3Y]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Caution is advised if patients receive large doses of ethchlorvynol concurrently. Transient delirium has been reported in patients who were treated with one gram of ethchlorvynol and 75 to 150 mg of amitriptyline hydrochloride.

Pediatric Use:

Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established (see BOX WARNING and WARNINGS - Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk). Anyone considering the use of amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need.

Geriatric Use:

Clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic function, concomitant disease and other drug therapy in elderly patients.

Geriatric patients are particularly sensitive to the anticholinergic side effects of tricyclic antidepressants including amitriptyline hydrochloride. Peripheral anticholinergic effects include tachycardia, urinary retention, constipation, dry mouth, blurred vision, and exacerbation of narrow-angle glaucoma. Central nervous system anticholinergic effects include cognitive impairment, psychomotor slowing, confusion, sedation, and delirium. Elderly patients taking amitriptyline hydrochloride may be at increased risk for falls. Elderly patients should be started on low doses of amitriptyline hydrochloride and observed closely (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Carbinoxamine maleate [^114LdBJM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Geriatric Use

Carbinoxamine maleate is more likely to cause dizziness, sedation, and hypotension in elderly patients (approximately 60 years or older). Sedating drugs may also cause confusion and over sedation in the elderly. Therefore, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

### Taking care of persistent sleepiness in patients with sleep apnea [^115LhMJY]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The investigators addressed potential concerns regarding medication use. Adverse events were common (68% vs. 48% for placebo) but overwhelmingly mild to moderate in severity (95%). At lower doses, few adverse events led to drug discontinuation (< 6%), whereas at the highest dose, more participants were affected (14%). Of some concern, the highest dose caused a 2.5-mg increase in systolic and 1.5-mg increase in diastolic blood pressure. Further, heart rate increased by 2–3 beats per minute at doses above 75 mg. To put the potential effect of these small changes into perspective, it has been estimated that a 2 mm Hg decrease in average blood pressure in the general population would reduce all-cause mortality annually by 3%, whereas a 2–3 beats per minute increase in heart rate in healthy middle-aged men has been estimated to increase mortality over the course of 16 years by 3.2–4.8%.

This study has notable strengths. The investigators used a double-blind placebo control design, assessed a variety of doses, incorporated both objective and subjective measures of sleepiness, and monitored for a reasonable range of adverse effects over the course of 12 weeks. There is little doubt that solriamfetol has robust clinically important effects on alertness at doses of 75 mg and higher and is reasonably tolerated by many patients in the short term. The authors note two limitations: the study's duration limits an assessment of potential long-term cardiovascular consequences, and the lack of an active comparator such as modafinil prevents a firm understanding of relative efficacy.

An important issue that cannot be addressed in the context of an efficacy study is whether the medication will eventually be used in an appropriate population. Specifically, will primary and reversible causes of persistent hypersomnia be addressed before patients are prescribed the medication? This concern is heightened by some of the trial's inclusion criteria: patients not currently using effective OSA therapy and those with as few as 6 hours of sleep per night. Although there are valid scientific reasons to retain these patients, their inclusion may encourage the use of this medication in cases in which reversible causes of sleepiness are not adequately addressed. This would unnecessarily expose patients not only to the unknown long-term adverse consequences of the medication but also to the potential adverse effects of untreated OSA and sleep deprivation.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^116z1MqW]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Implementation of pharmacological treatments in elderly patients with dementia states that low starting doses, small dose increases, and long intervals between dose increases are necessary, although some patients may ultimately need doses as high as would be appropriate for younger patients. Anticholinergic side effects may also lead to worsening cognitive impairment, confusion, or even delirium, orthostasis is common in elderly patients, and medications associated with central nervous system sedation may worsen cognition, increase the risk of falls, and put patients with sleep apnea at risk for additional respiratory depression; elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or dementia with Lewy bodies are especially susceptible to extrapyramidal side effects. For all these reasons, medications should be used with considerable care, and polypharmacy should be avoided whenever possible, and in nonemergency situations or when neuropsychiatric symptoms are not severe, nonpharmacological approaches should be attempted first to avoid the very significant morbidities associated with psychotropic medication use in elderly patients.

### Adverse intraoperative medical events and their association with anesthesia management strategies in cataract surgery [^114Q7bR8]. Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare adverse medical events by different anesthesia strategies for cataract surgery.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Participants

Patients 50 years of age and older undergoing 19,250 cataract surgeries at nine centers in the United States and Canada between June 1995 and June 1997.

Intervention

Local anesthesia applied topically or by injection, with or without oral and intravenous sedatives, opioid analgesia, hypnotics, and diphenhydramine (Benadryl).

Main Outcome Measures

Intraoperative and postoperative adverse medical events.

Results

Twenty-six percent of surgeries were performed with topical anesthesia and the remainder with injection anesthesia. There was no increase in deaths and hospitalizations associated with any specific anesthesia strategy. No statistically significant difference was observed in the prevalence of intraoperative events between topical and injection anesthesia without intravenous sedatives (0.13% and 0.78%, respectively). The use of intravenous sedatives was associated with a significant increase in adverse events for topical (1.20%) and injection anesthesia (1.18%), relative to topical anesthesia without intravenous sedation. The use of short-acting hypnotic agents with injection anesthesia was also associated with a significant increase in adverse events when used alone (1.40%) or in combination with opiates (1.75%), sedatives (2.65%), and with the combination of opiates and sedatives (4.04%). These differences remained after adjusting for age, gender, duration of surgery, and American Society of Anesthesiologists risk class.

Conclusions

Adjuvant intravenous anesthetic agents used to decrease pain and alleviate anxiety are associated with increases in medical events. However, cataract surgery is a safe procedure with a low absolute risk of medical complications with either topical or injection anesthesia. Clinicians should weigh the risks and benefits of their use for individual patients.

The 2 most widely used explicit criteria regarding inappropriate medication use in older adults are the American Geriatrics Society's Beers Criteria and the Screening Tool of Older People's Prescriptions/Screening Tool to Alert to Right Treatment (STOPP/START). Both documents were updated recently. They are important educational tools that highlight medications for which risks of use may often exceed benefits in older adults and situations in which potentially appropriate medications should be considered for use. The application of these tools has the potential to significantly affect patient care. Thus, it is important for clinicians to be familiar with both documents.

American Geriatrics Society Choosing Wisely — pharmacologic and supplement approaches for unintentional weight loss in older adults note that megestrol acetate results in small appetite/weight gains without improvement in quality of life or survival and increases risks, with specific event frequencies: "One in four individuals who take megestrol acetate will experience an increase in appetite, one in 12 will have an increase in weight, and one in 23 will die", and "The AGS 2012 Beers Criteria lists megestrol acetate among potentially inappropriate medications for older adults". For cannabinoids, "Dronabinol has been studied to only a limited extent in geriatric care, and its pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in older adults. Its therapeutic benefit has not been clearly demonstrated in this population, and it consequently cannot be considered for routine treatment of unintentional weight loss in elderly adults". "Cyproheptadine has strong anticholinergic properties, can produce delirium, and is listed as a potentially inappropriate medication for use in older adults in the 2012 Beers Criteria". High-quality reviews report that "dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid), thalidomide, and anabolic steroids have not found clear evidence of the efficacy or safety of these agents for weight gain in late life or advanced progressive illness", and nutrition support evidence shows that oral supplements "consistently produce small weight gains and may reduce mortality in undernourished older people", although "most of the studies of nutritional supplements have been considered to be of poor quality" and "There appear to be no clear improvements in other clinical outcomes, such as hospital length of stay, functional status, and mood".

Application of key principles — patients and caregivers — advises, "Older adults should not stop taking a drug just because it is included in the Beers Criteria. Instead, they should discuss with their clinicians whether that medication is the right choice for them and ask whether there are safer or more-effective alternatives", and emphasizes engagement: "Care is improved when patients and caregivers are actively involved in their care".

### AGA clinical practice update on management of inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients: expert review [^115gZMH1]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Thiopurines and methotrexate in older inflammatory bowel disease — effectiveness, malignancy risk, and use considerations: Although thiopurines are effective in maintaining remission in both CD and UC, the data are limited, particularly in elderly patients, and thiopurine use is associated with a higher absolute risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer among those older than 65 years compared with those younger than 50 years. The absolute incidence of lymphoproliferative disorders with thiopurine use has been shown to be increased in elderly patients with IBD compared to those younger than 50 years (5.41 vs 0.37/1000 person-years), whereas the age-related difference was less pronounced in thiopurine nonusers (1.68 vs 0 person-years). On balance, thiopurines are convenient and inexpensive options for many older patients, but routine discontinuation or absolute avoidance solely based on chronologic age is not appropriate and consideration should be on a case-by-case basis. Methotrexate represents an attractive option in older patients with CD, with data supporting its role in inducing and maintaining remission, and it can be an alternative when combination therapy is used in individuals at high risk for thiopurine-related adverse effects, including malignancy.

### Duloxetine for the long-term treatment of major depressive disorder in patients aged 65 and older: an open-label study [^117BcWQK]. BMC Geriatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Concomitant medications

Patients were not permitted to receive other antidepressant, antimanic, or antipsychotic agents during the study. Episodic use (≤ 3 consecutive days, and no more than 100 total days) of benzodiazepines was permitted. The use of benadryl, chloral hydrate, cough and cold medications, and narcotics, was allowed on an episodic basis only. Subjects were permitted to take antihypertensives, antiarrhythmics, antibiotics, and multivitamins among other medications while in the study.

Efficacy measures

Efficacy was assessed using the CGI-S scale (a priori specified as the primary outcome), the HAMD 17 total score, HAMD 17 subscales (core – Items 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8; Maier – Items 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, and 10; anxiety/somatization – Items 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 17; retardation – Items 1, 7, 8, and 14; sleep – Items 4, 5, and 6), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scale. Patient-rated quality of life was evaluated using the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), which is a composite of 3 self-rated 10-point Likert response subscales (0 = no disability, 1–3 = mild, 4–6 = moderate, 7–9 = marked, 10 = extreme) to assess work, family, and social functioning during the past month. All outcomes were assessed at Weeks 6, 28, and 52, or upon early discontinuation, except for PGI-I and CGI-S scales which were collected at all visits. Patients were defined as responders if they had a decrease from baseline of at least 50% in HAMD 17 total score. Patients were defined as remitters if they had a HAMD 17 total score ≤ 7.

### How to use the American Geriatrics Society 2015 beers criteria – A guide for patients, clinicians, health systems, and payors [^113wECYu]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Medium credibility.

American Geriatrics Society (AGS) 2015 Beers Criteria — medication discontinuation and tapering — state that many Beers medications should not be stopped abruptly because of the high risk of precipitating a withdrawal reaction, and a good rule of thumb is that a drug dose is usually safe to taper down at the same rate that it can safely be tapered up.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Alzheimer's disease is a disorder occurring primarily in individuals over 55 years of age. The mean age of patients enrolled in the clinical studies with donepezil hydrochloride was 73 years; 80% of these patients were between 65 and 84 years old, and 49% of patients were at or above the age of 75. The efficacy and safety data presented in the clinical trials section were obtained from these patients. There were no clinically significant differences in most adverse reactions reported by patient groups ≥ 65 years old and < 65 years old.

### How to use the American Geriatrics Society 2015 beers criteria – A guide for patients, clinicians, health systems, and payors [^1179AJV9]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Medium credibility.

American Geriatrics Society (AGS) 2015 Beers Criteria — intended use and implementation guidance emphasize that the article describes the intended role of the 2015 AGS Beers Criteria and provides guidance on how patients, clinicians, health systems, and payors should use them, with a key theme to use common sense and clinical judgment and remain mindful of nuances; the criteria serve as a "warning light" to identify medications with an unfavorable balance of benefits and harms in many older adults, yet there are situations in which use of medications included in the criteria can be appropriate, and the criteria are designed to support, rather than supplant, good clinical judgment. The Beers Criteria were first introduced in 1991, and since then efforts to educate clinicians and use them in quality improvement have had meaningful impacts, including that use of many included medications has declined, others have been withdrawn from the market, and there is greater appreciation of the unique considerations that should be applied when prescribing for older adults, but implementation has been problematic when clinicians mistakenly believe all listed drugs are universally inappropriate, when health systems implicitly consider any use problematic, when payors adopt prior authorization that may be misapplied, and when inflexible, dogmatic use generates resentment, lack of faith in the recommendations, negatively affects quality of care by restricting access in appropriate use, and creates troublesome and unnecessary burdens for prescribers. The goal is to improve how stakeholders use the AGS 2015 Beers Criteria with guidance and recommendations for implementation that reflect this intent, and to support this the AGS convened a workgroup consisting of four members of the update panel.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1178XPmj]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Older adults — The AGS Beers Criteria recommends avoiding the use of both long- and short-acting benzodiazepines (BZD) in adults over 65 years of age; clinicians should generally consider alternative treatment options with more favorable safety profiles. The CGC recommends that clinicians make every effort to taper BZD use in older adults unless there are compelling reasons for continuation; however, they noted that the decision to taper should still be made based on a careful assessment of risks and benefits for the patient, and BZD are sometimes prescribed to control agitation in older adults when the benefits of controlling the patient's agitation may outweigh the potential adverse effects of the BZD and be a compelling reason for continuing the medication.

### Advanced age as a consideration in spinal cord stimulation [^114pD8ME]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

We surmise that many providers, including perhaps some of VV's previous providers, may be hesitant to place an SCS or perform other surgical intervention on a patient of such advanced age with medical comorbidities and would cite the principles of nonmaleficence and justice in doing so. While we recognize that it is certainly our job as physicians to first do no harm, we argue that there is harm in allowing an extreme elderly patient to live out what time he has remaining with essentially no quality of life, particularly if there is still a potential treatment option available. In this case, SCS was VV's remaining option, and we believed that the potential benefit in terms of improving his quality of life and helping him regain the independence and functionality that was so vital to him outweighed both any potential risks related to the surgery and implant itself and the risk of allowing him to continue in a state of pain so severe and disabling that palliative care had been seriously considered. This thought process was extensively shared with the patient and his family to guide shared decision-making and to ensure that there was clear informed consent prior to proceeding with these interventions. We would encourage others reading this analysis to use a similar ethics-guided decision-making process when considering the use of spinal cord stimulation in their extreme elderly patients.

PATIENT INFORMATION

MARINOL (mare in all) (dronabinol) capsules, for oral use, CIII

What is the most important information I should know about MARINOL?

MARINOL can cause serious side effects, including:

Worsening mental (psychiatric) symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms can worsen in people who have mania, depression, or schizophrenia and who take MARINOL. MARINOL taken with medicines that cause psychiatric symptoms can worsen psychiatric symptoms. Elderly people who take MARINOL may have a greater risk of having psychiatric symptoms. Tell your doctor if you have new or worsening mood symptoms, including symptoms of mania, depression, or schizophrenia.

Problems thinking clearly. Tell your doctor if you have trouble remembering things, concentrating, have increased sleepiness, or confusion. Elderly people may have a greater risk of having problems thinking clearly.
Changes in your blood pressure. MARINOL may increase or decrease your blood pressure, especially when you start taking MARINOL or when your dose is changed. Tell your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of changes in your blood pressure including: headaches, vision problems, dizziness, feeling lightheaded, fainting, or a fast heartbeat. Elderly people, especially those with dementia, and people with heart problems may have an increased risk of changes in blood pressure and an increased risk of falls.

### Third-line therapy for overactive bladder in the elderly: nuances and considerations [^116Juez2]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2022). Medium credibility.

3.3 Considerations

In light of the above evidence, clinicians should consider the following when contemplating BTX‐A for refractory OAB in the elderly:
Self‐catheterization: In addition to willingness, does the patient have the mobility and dexterity required to perform self‐catheterization? If not, are caregivers available, able, and willing to perform if needed? If not, would the patient and/or caregiver accept a temporary indwelling catheter and associated follow‐up visits for trials of the void?
UTI treatment burden: Treatment of acute cystitis carries greater risk in older patients. Multiple antibiotics are included in the American Geriatric Society Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults, including nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole‐trimethoprim, and macrolides. Furthermore, the risk of Clostridium difficile colitis is significantly higher with advanced age and antibiotic exposure. Asymptomatic bacteriuria increases with age, with incidence up to 21% in patients ≥ 65 compared to 1%–5% in younger cohorts. Thus, it is important also to treat only clinically symptomatic UTIs.

### A different challenge with benadryl: adolescent diphenhydramine ingestions reported to national poison database system, 2007–2020 [^115Cq9RE]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The US Food and Drug Administration released a warning related to potential adverse effects related to intentional misuse or abuse ingestions of diphenhydramine in September 2020. We sought to evaluate adolescent-aged (13–19y) diphenhydramine ingestions reported to US poison control centers to characterize these exposures, adverse effects, outcomes, and trends in outcomes and reasons for ingestion.

Methods

The US National Poison Database System was queried for all exposures to diphenhydramine between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2020.

Results

47,644 ingestions were included for analysis. An increase in the number of ingestions, percentage of cases due to an intentional reason for ingestion and suspected suicide was observed. More serious outcomes, cardiac complications, seizures, and deaths were more common following intentional ingestions and specifically suspected suicide over misuse or abuse.

Conclusions

Adolescent ingestions of diphenhydramine increased between 2007 and 2020. More serious outcomes, intentional reasons, and suspected suicide also increased over the study interval. Suspected suicide was associated with cardiac complications, seizures, coma, and death at higher rates than misuse or abuse. While misuse and abuse remain a concern, public health interventions focusing on the risk that diphenhydramine pose as an agent of suicide attempt may be of higher impact.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide)

17.1 Information for Patients

Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with SEROQUEL XR and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for SEROQUEL XR. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking SEROQUEL XR.

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementia-related psychoses treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death compared with placebo. SEROQUEL XR is not approved for elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
