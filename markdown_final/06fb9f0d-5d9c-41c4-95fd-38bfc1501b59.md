## Question

Hip cam deformity

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hip cam deformity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and terminology to anchor the discussion. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and biomechanics that link cam morphology to symptoms and joint damage. Next, I will review epidemiology and risk factors, including activity and genetics. After that, I need to examine diagnostic criteria and imaging strategies, especially the limitations of the alpha angle. Then, I will appraise nonoperative management, followed by surgical indications, techniques, and outcomes. Finally, I should consider special scenarios like dysplasia and SCFE, and synthesize a practical clinical algorithm with attention to pitfalls and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't conflate morphology with disease. Cam morphology refers to an aspherical femoral head–neck junction with reduced head–neck offset, whereas femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) denotes a movement-related clinical disorder with symptoms and signs attributable to that morphology. Importantly, consensus statements advise using "morphology" rather than "deformity" or "lesion" to avoid over-medicalizing a common anatomic variant, and they distinguish primary cam morphology from secondary causes such as SCFE or Perthes [^116LTzhA] [^116rVco4] [^115cAGjd].

> Wait, let me verify the biomechanics before I over-attribute symptoms to bone alone. The cam prominence abuts the acetabular rim during flexion and internal rotation, transmitting 21–27% of torsional load to the chondrolabral junction and driving shear stress, labral tears, and cartilage delamination. Dynamic 4D CT shows impingement can occur as early as ~40° of flexion in large anterior cams, explaining pain with routine tasks and the predilection for superolateral cartilage injury [^116rq2m9] [^115wDvLC] [^113ZPgTU] [^1164jXUi].

> I need to check the epidemiology and risk modifiers carefully. Cam morphology is common in asymptomatic individuals (~9–25% in men, ~2–10% in women), yet athletes in high-impact, repetitive flexion–internal rotation sports (e.g., ice hockey, soccer, basketball) show substantially higher prevalence and severity, with dose–response relationships to training intensity during skeletal maturation. Familial clustering suggests genetic susceptibility, and some cam-like morphologies reflect subtle SCFE phenotypes rather than purely idiopathic forms [^114HwmED] [^1137oBSa] [^115JvrY4] [^1176TNHt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis based on a single angle. The alpha angle is widely used but imperfect; thresholds vary across studies (commonly ≥ 55–60°), and no single planar measurement captures the 3D extent or clock-face location of the cam, so relying on one view risks misclassification; Meyer lateral and 90° Dunn views best approximate 3D shape, and 3D CT/MRI or radial sequences improve localization and surgical planning, while intraoperative fluoroscopy correlates with CT for verifying resection adequacy [^11679iVx] [^1174ehkf] [^116HzYiR] [^114AzCne] [^117LSGjN].

> Let me consider nonoperative management next, and I should double-check the strength of evidence. High-quality guidance supports a structured, exercise-based program of at least 3 months emphasizing load management, ROM restoration, and motor control, with progression tailored to symptoms; however, contemporary RCTs comparing arthroscopy to physiotherapy are mixed and often limited by outdated rehab protocols, so expectations should be calibrated and shared decision-making emphasized, especially in athletes with high-demand goals [^116LA3yH] [^113WrRXM] [^114xWbEf].

> I will now examine surgical indications and technique, and I need to ensure I'm precise about thresholds. Surgery is reasonable for persistent, activity-limiting symptoms despite quality nonoperative care, with better outcomes in younger patients with Tönnis 0–1 joints and intact joint space; residual cam is a leading cause of failure, so adequate resection restoring head–neck offset and achieving an alpha angle typically < 50–55° is critical, while avoiding over-resection that risks iatrogenic instability or fracture; arthroscopic femoroplasty achieves correction comparable to open techniques for most anterior/anterosuperior lesions, but posterosuperior or complex deformities may favor open approaches [^1164jXUi] [^113pvz8C] [^112dJM4s] [^115MZXVq] [^112n7J5n].

> But wait, what about capsular management and dynamic confirmation intraoperatively. Biomechanical studies show the capsule contributes substantially to rotational restraint, so a balanced approach — limited T-capsulotomy with repair when indicated — helps mitigate iatrogenic instability. Dynamic impingement testing and systematic fluoroscopic views (e.g., six-position protocol) improve the likelihood of complete cam correction and reduce revision risk, which is crucial given the steep learning curve and documented rates of under-resection [^115fa4FD] [^113RuAcv] [^117LSGjN] [^112vzWeN].

> Next, I should review outcomes and prognostic factors, and I need to separate hope from data. Mid-term outcomes after arthroscopic cam correction show meaningful improvements in pain and function with low conversion to arthroplasty in appropriately selected patients, yet larger cam volume predicts poorer short-term outcomes, and over-correction is associated with worse results than under-correction. Elite athletes generally return to sport at high rates, though strength deficits may persist at the time of clearance, underscoring the need for criterion-based rehab and load management [^115mMR5C] [^115YZjJT] [^113Lmj81] [^1125MA6X].

> Let me think about special scenarios, starting with coexisting acetabular dysplasia. I initially thought PAO alone would normalize mechanics enough to obviate femoral osteochondroplasty, but computational modeling shows unaddressed cam can elevate contact stresses after PAO, particularly when the alpha angle exceeds 60°. Thus, many centers combine PAO with arthroscopic treatment of cam and labral pathology, though evidence quality varies and surgeon expertise often dictates timing and staging [^113jEsQF] [^11623xDs] [^1159gK9C].

> I should confirm the SCFE-related cam pathway and its implications. Even mild SCFE can produce impingement and chondrolabral damage, and residual cam after in situ pinning may persist or evolve. Prophylactic pinning of the contralateral hip does not eliminate later cam development, and some advocate early osteoplasty in select cases, though optimal timing remains debated and should be individualized to symptoms and joint status [^116kUw3W] [^116kwoe3] [^112TZXdD].

> Hold on, I should verify the natural history and prevention angle so I don't overpromise. Cam morphology is a recognized risk factor for early osteoarthritis, with prospective data suggesting roughly a twofold increased risk, and mechanobiologic models indicate adolescent loading patterns can shape the physis and promote cam formation. This supports load-management strategies during growth and early identification of high-risk athletes, while acknowledging that most cam morphology remains asymptomatic and that screening programs must weigh harms of overdiagnosis [^114UWaiv] [^115YR6XD] [^114HwmED] [^114WbYK5].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic workup to ensure nothing critical is missing. A practical pathway includes AP pelvis and dedicated lateral views (Dunn, cross-table, or Meyer) to screen for cam and assess joint space, MRI or MR arthrography with radial sequences to define chondrolabral injury and femoral torsion, and CT for complex 3D deformity or dysplasia planning. Intraoperative fluoroscopy correlates with CT for resection adequacy, and postoperative imaging should scrutinize for residual cam or overcorrection when symptoms persist [^114AzCne] [^111boELU] [^117LSGjN] [^1178fpqH].

> Finally, I should synthesize a clinical algorithm and sanity-check each step. Start with history, exam, and plain radiographs to confirm cam morphology and exclude advanced arthritis. Trial a structured, load-aware physiotherapy program for at least 3 months in Tönnis 0–1 patients. If symptoms persist, proceed to arthroscopic femoroplasty with labral treatment, using dynamic assessment and fluoroscopic confirmation to achieve adequate but not excessive resection. In dysplasia, plan PAO with concurrent or staged arthroscopy for cam and labral pathology when indicated. And throughout, counsel on expectations, return-to-sport timelines, and the possibility of persistent symptoms if morphology is incompletely addressed or arthritis progresses [^116LA3yH] [^1164jXUi] [^113RuAcv] [^11623xDs].

Cam deformity is a **non-spherical femoral head** with reduced head-neck offset, causing impingement and joint damage [^116KnwQU] [^113WrRXM]. It is common in active males and linked to early osteoarthritis [^114UWaiv] [^112yy6LE]. Diagnosis relies on **alpha angle > 60°** on Dunn or cross-table lateral radiographs [^11679iVx] [^116KnwQU], with MRI/CT for 3D mapping and cartilage assessment [^114AzCne] [^111boELU]. First-line care is **conservative therapy** [^113WrRXM]; arthroscopic femoroplasty is indicated for persistent symptoms or structural progression, with outcomes best in younger patients without advanced arthritis [^1164jXUi] [^113pvz8C]. Residual or undertreated cam is a major cause of revision [^117YDivP] [^112dJM4s], so precise resection and patient selection are critical [^113RuAcv] [^115YZjJT].

---

## Pathophysiology and biomechanics

Cam deformity reflects **loss of femoral head sphericity** and reduced head-neck offset, producing abnormal contact during flexion/internal rotation [^1132XQ1g] [^113ZPgTU]. This mechanical conflict drives labral tears, cartilage delamination, and early osteoarthritis [^113WrRXM] [^112yy6LE]. Biomechanically, the cam accounts for 21–27% of torsional resistance in deep flexion/internal rotation; resection reduces this adverse loading and improves motion [^116rq2m9] [^115wDvLC].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Cam morphology is present in **10–25%** of the general population and is more common in males and athletes [^115mHwrP] [^114HwmED]. High-impact youth sports (soccer, ice hockey, basketball) increase risk via **repetitive loading during skeletal maturation** [^1137oBSa] [^111ggZUP]. Familial clustering suggests **genetic susceptibility** [^114HwmED] [^1137oBSa].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically report:

- **Groin pain**: worsened by flexion/internal rotation (FADIR) [^112yXuro] [^115XjqoV].
- **Stiffness**: reduced hip ROM, especially internal rotation [^1118xy62].
- **Mechanical symptoms**: clicking, locking, or instability [^115XjqoV].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

| **Modality** | **Role and findings** |
|-|-|
| Plain radiographs | - Alpha angle > 60° on Dunn or cross-table lateral [^11679iVx] [^116KnwQU] <br/> - Reduced head-neck offset [^116KnwQU] |
| MRI | - 3D mapping of cam size/location [^114AzCne] <br/> - Cartilage/labral lesions [^111boELU] |
| CT | - Detailed bony anatomy <br/> - Surgical planning [^114AzCne] |

---

## Conservative management

Conservative care is **first-line** and includes:

- **Physical therapy**: core/hip strengthening, flexibility, and load modification [^notfound].
- **Activity modification**: avoid high-impact sports and prolonged sitting [^notfound].
- **Analgesia**: NSAIDs and intra-articular corticosteroids for flares [^notfound].

---

## Surgical management

Indications include persistent symptoms despite conservative care, structural progression, or **young patients with early cartilage damage** [^113WrRXM] [^1164jXUi]. Arthroscopic femoroplasty restores head-neck offset and relieves impingement; outcomes are best in patients < 40 years with Tönnis grade 0–1 and no dysplasia [^115MZXVq] [^1164jXUi] [^115YZjJT]. Complications include under-resection (persistent impingement), over-resection (fracture, instability) [^112n7J5n], and heterotopic ossification [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Untreated cam deformity increases the risk of early osteoarthritis and hip replacement [^114UWaiv] [^116oFjRB]. Arthroscopic treatment improves pain, function, and ROM, with 85–95% good/excellent outcomes at 2–5 years; durability depends on age, cartilage status, and resection adequacy [^113pvz8C] [^113WrRXM]. Residual cam is the **leading cause of revision**, underscoring the need for precise correction [^117YDivP] [^112dJM4s].

---

## Current research and controversies

Controversies include the **optimal alpha angle threshold** [^11679iVx], the role of prophylactic surgery in asymptomatic athletes [^1164jXUi], and the need for standardized imaging and surgical techniques [^116rVco4]. Emerging areas include 3D imaging, patient-specific biomechanics, and long-term osteoarthritis prevention [^114AzCne] [^113jEsQF].

---

Cam deformity is a **common, activity-related morphology** that can cause impingement and early joint damage; careful diagnosis and individualized management — with conservative care first and arthroscopic femoroplasty for refractory cases — yield the best outcomes [^113WrRXM] [^113pvz8C].

### Complications of arthroscopic femoroacetabular impingement treatment: a review [^112vzWeN]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2009). Low credibility.

Recent developments in hip arthroscopy techniques and technology have made it possible in many cases to avoid open surgical technique for treating pincer-type and cam-type femoroacetabular impingement and rather treating it arthroscopically. Early reports suggest favorable results using arthroscopic techniques. The frequency of complications reported for hip arthroscopy for all indications is generally less than 1.5%, suggesting the procedure is safe. Little information is available on complications directly related to the arthroscopic treatment of femoroacetabular impingement. Failure to recognize and treat or incompletely reshape impingement deformities may be the most frequent cause for a second hip arthroscopy and redébridement of the deformity. There has been no report of avascular necrosis related to the arthroscopic treatment of femoroacetabular impingement; only one femoral neck fracture after arthroscopic cam remodeling has been reported in a large series of patients. Other clinical concerns include hip dislocation secondary to extensive capsulotomies or overresection of the anterior acetabular rim in the case of pincer impingement.

### Case reports: acetabular damage after mild slipped capital femoral epiphysis [^116kUw3W]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a common hip problem in adolescents that results in a cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) deformity. Although the treatment for mild (slip angle of 0°-30°) and moderate (slip angle of 31°-60°) SCFE has historically been in situ fixation, recent studies have demonstrated impingement-related articular damage, irrespective of slip severity. Our series confirms previous reports that acetabular chondral injury occurs in mild to low-moderate (slip angle of ≤ 40°) SCFE.

Case Description

We retrospectively reviewed five patients who underwent arthroscopy and femoral osteoplasty within 18 months after in situ stabilization. All had labral and/or acetabular damage.

Literature Review

Osteoarthritis rates after SCFE range from 24% to 92% at 11 to 28 years, depending on how osteoarthritis is defined. Long-term followup suggests patients have acceptable outcomes, but these studies are limited by heterogeneity and a ceiling effect from the instruments used to assess function. Although the femoral deformity remodels, it is unclear what secondary changes occur in the acetabulum. Recent investigations suggest patients are functionally limited after SCFE owing to FAI compared with controls. MRI findings and surgical reports document impingement-related joint damage after SCFE, even in the absence of symptoms. Based on this, some advocate timely correction of the cam deformity inherent in SCFE.

Purposes and Clinical Relevance

Further study is warranted to determine whether immediate osteoplasty after in situ fixation of mild SCFE is beneficial to limit articular damage and improve long-term outcomes.

### Contemporary techniques in femoral osteoplasty [^112n7J5n]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

As the number of primary hip arthroscopy procedures continues to rise, revision rates are similarly increasing; a 2021 database study of more than 15,000 patients found a 19% revision rate with 15.1% of patients undergoing a revision hip arthroscopy. Previous literature reports that incomplete or inadequate femoral cam correction has been one of the leading causes for revision hip arthroscopy. - Cam lesions have been historically defined by using the alpha angle, which essentially measures asphericity of the femoral head commonly located along the anterolateral femoral neck. Using a burring device, a surgical resection of the cam lesion is performed. However, intraoperative assessment of optimal resection is challenging and may result in overresection or underresection.

Although historically underresection has been the bigger issue, there is now mounting literature discussing overresection as well. Overresection can lead to fractures of the femoral neck, disruption of the labral seal, hip instability, and new mechanical symptoms for patients. The consequences of overresection are potentially unsalvageable as well. Overresection can lead to loss of the labral-femoral head suction seal that helps maintain intra-articular pressures and the appropriate biomechanical environment for cartilage health. A 2018 study by Mansor et alfound inferior outcomes in an overresection subgroup of patients when compared with underresected group within their population.

So how do young surgeons get it right? Undoubtedly, thorough intraoperative evaluation is necessary to confirm bony resection adequacy and rule out persistent bony impingement. Preoperative imaging can be compared with intraoperative fluoroscopy to evaluate completeness of the femoroplasty. Ross et aldescribed six fluoroscopic views that can reliably detect cam deformity and provide a surgeons with a consistent evaluation of cam deformity intraoperatively. In recent years, there have been multiple methods described to guide and assist in creating a spherical femoral head and restoring the normal head-neck offset. - This review aims to compile commonly used techniques for femoral osteoplasty and discuss the differences between them. The authors posit that the ideal method for guiding resection adequacy has not yet been discovered, but the knowledge of each available technique should help minimize risk and potential complications for the young practicing hip arthroscopist.

### The alpha angle [^1174ehkf]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

What Is the Utility of the Alpha Angle?

Alpha angle measurements from skeletal samples since the fourth centurysuggest an exponential growth in the prevalence of FAI, attributed to increases in height, weight, and body mass index. One proposed etiology of cam lesions is developmental, being related to high levels of physical activity during skeletal development. The most common reason for revision hip arthroscopy is residual FAI, specifically residual cam-type FAI.

Lohan et al. found that using the alpha angle in a retrospective, blinded manner to evaluate patients with known treatment pathways offered no value in predicting the presence of cam lesions that would require surgical treatment. They proposed 2 other measurements, 1 of which (the anterior femoral distance) did perform better than the alpha angle, although none of the measurements performed well enough to be considered useful in routine clinical practice. This is likely because cam lesions are 3D deformities, and no single angle, or even combination of angles on planar imaging, can adequately capture the deformity.

In the practical, clinical setting, particularly when it comes to diagnosis and decision-making, the alpha angle value itself is likely less important than the presence or absence of a pathologic cam deformity. In this context, the presence or absence of a cam lesion, and the accurate determination of whether such a lesion is a source of the patient's symptoms, is the most important question to be answered. From an academic perspective, the wide variability in accuracy, reliability, and techniques used to measure the alpha angle limits its interpretability and our ability to compare results across different studies.

It is clear that if the alpha angle is to be measured, it should ideally be measured on 3D imaging or, at the very least, on multiple different radiographic views, with an understanding of which anatomic locations are best visualized on each view. Measurement methods should use a circle of best-fit method rather than a simple angle, and (semi)automated measurements hold the promise of improved accuracy and reliability in a time-efficient manner. Table III summarizes our recommendations with corresponding grades of recommendation.

### Best practices: hip femoroacetabular impingement [^114AzCne]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. Imaging plays a critical role in the assessment of patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). With better understanding of the underlying pathomechanics and advances in joint-preserving surgery, there is an increasing need to define the most appropriate imaging workup. The purpose of this article is to provide guidance on best practices for imaging of patients with FAI in light of recent advances in corrective FAI surgery. CONCLUSION. Pelvic radiography with dedicated hip projections is the basis of the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected FAI to assess arthritic changes and acetabular coverage and to screen for cam deformities. Chondrolabral lesions should be evaluated with unenhanced MRI or MR arthrography. The protocol should include a large-FOV fluid-sensitive sequence to exclude conditions that can mimic or coexist with FAI, radial imaging to accurately determine the presence of a cam deformity, and imaging of the distal femoral condyles for measurement of femoral torsion. CT remains a valuable tool for planning of complex surgical corrections. Advanced imaging, such as 3D simulation, biochemical MRI, and MR arthrography with application of leg traction, has great potential to improve surgical decision-making. Further research is needed to assess the added clinical value of these techniques.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 2-research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip [^114AXWcq]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussing the feasibility of load management studies during growth, discussion groups stressed the importance of involving 'methodology experts' (eg, study design and training-load monitoring) and the target group in the development of any research. Load management studies on primary cam morphology development during growth may not be the right priority for new research. Patient buy-in is likely to be low — 'elite sports children may be unwilling to reduce participation in their preferred sport' and more attention needs to be given to context: 'optimal study designs may not be generalisable to suboptimal context'.

Warning 'not to focus on cam morphology as a problem', stakeholder groups mentioned seven critical elements of effective physiotherapy/rehabilitation (best practice physiotherapy) for patients with FAI syndrome: clinicians should (1) apply a 'holistic approach to rehabilitation' that uses the 'same language'; (2) deal with 'patient expectations, especially time: lifelong'; (3) address 'fear of movement'; (4) modify 'what the patient do'; (5) consider 'who the advocate for the athlete/patient should be'; (6) deliver 'treatment programmes' of 'at least 6 months in duration', and (7) develop treatment programmes with 'exercise interventions' as the 'foundation, with potential room for manual therapy'. Finally, the field 'needs individual participant data studies with subgroup analysis to inform this [best practice physiotherapy], as much of the therapy approaches that "work" has been mixed methods so likely needs to be teased out as to which factors offer the greatest benefit'.

### Hip joint torsional loading before and after cam femoroacetabular impingement surgery [^11259Mx2]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Labral tears and groin pain resulting from cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) constitute a large portion of athletic hip injuries. The cam deformity is characterized by an enlarged, aspherical femoral head-neck and is associated with progressive hip pain and early joint degeneration, whereas mechanical impingement occurs when the femoral cam deformity obstructs the chondrolabral junction in flexion and rotation, resulting in limited mobility and adverse joint loading. Although previous pathoanatomic studies linked limited hip mobility primarily with the cam deformity, a growing population of athletes have asymptomatic cam morphologic features associated with preadolescent physical activity.,

Interest is emerging in how symptomatic FAI can be attributed to other causative anatomic and functional factors, in addition to the bony cam deformity. One such factor is the contribution of the capsular ligaments and their role in functional joint stability. Conventional hip preservation techniques involve either an arthroscopic or open surgical approach, accessing the anterosuperior head-neck deformity through an incised capsular portal. Although surgical cam resection aims to restore joint function, and preserve the native hip, it is still unknown how the removal of the cam deformity influences hip joint loading. Moreover, it is unclear how capsular release and repair influence joint mechanics to balance functional mobility. Because joint-preserving surgery for FAI is a recurring subject of interest for athletic hip injuries, these topics warrant closer examination.

A subject of debate regards whether an approach that entails capsulotomy alone can restore hip mobility to levels similar to those achieved by resection of the cam deformity or whether capsular repair is necessary after cam resection. A few recent biomechanical studies examined the effects of a capsulotomy and subsequent capsular repair on cadaveric hips. However, none of the studies examined changes in torque restraint of pathological hips, which would help characterize each surgical procedure's effect on joint loading and stability. Previous computational models also estimated the adverse loading mechanics attributed to cam FAI, although none of the models included the contributions of the capsular ligaments. More recently, increasing interest has turned to implementation of robotic testing platforms to examine soft tissue contributions and various implants on knee, and hip joint mechanics; however, the effects of surgical stages on hips with cam morphologic features have yet to be examined. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to quantify the contributions of the capsule and cam deformity to hip joint mechanics and investigate the influence of capsular repair during surgical intervention of FAI.

### Do osteochondroplasty alone, intertrochanteric derotation osteotomy, and flexion-derotation osteotomy improve hip flexion and internal rotation to normal range in hips with severe SCFE? – A 3D-CT simulation study [^111NNfRr]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, the software for collision detection calculates the osseous range of motion without considering soft tissue (labrum, ligaments, or cartilage). Therefore, we believe the clinical hip motion may be even lower in these hips. Assessment of the soft tissues limiting motion may be unavoidable using pelvic CT imaging, although it could be integrated using magnetic resonance imaging in the future. However, previous collision detection studies used the same specific software to analyze hips with complex morphology, including post-Perthes disease, underlining the software's validity for collision detection in hips with severe deformity. Second, we only tested 3 types of surgical intervention (osteochondroplasty, femoral derotation osteotomy, and flexion-derotation osteotomy, figures in supplementary material, Supplemental Digital Content 1). Other types of proximal femoral osteotomies could result in more significant improvement in impingement-free motion. No translation was performed for the flexion osteotomy. The rationale for selecting the 3 specific surgical interventions was based on the increased popularity of arthroscopic osteochondroplasty for treating hips with SCFE and the fact that femoral derotation osteotomy is a universally available and relatively low-demanding technique. Similarly, the flexion-derotation osteotomy is a well-accepted procedure for treating SCFE deformity that is technically less demanding than some of the procedures we did not test (eg, the modified Dunn procedure). Third, our study focused on the simulated surgical procedure without assessing the actual results of such procedures. No postoperative alpha angles after cam resection were calculated because of the severe displacement of the epiphysis and the femoral head center. Therefore, we lack information about those procedures' complications and clinical improvement. Although comparing patient-specific interventions and outcomes was not the goal of our study, all patients were symptomatic at the time of image acquisition, and most of them underwent surgical treatment. Therefore, future studies should investigate the simulation of additional isolated or combined hip preservation procedures to investigate clinical and functional improvements of such procedures to establish the clinical application of the software in the clinical setting. A combination of femoral osteotomy and cam resection was not studied and could be an additional treatment approach for severe SCFE patients. Finally, our study was limited to hips with severe SCFE, and we cannot make any inference about the effects of the investigated procedures on the improvement of hip motion for hips with mild and moderate SCFE.

### Hip joint capsular anatomy, mechanics, and surgical management [^115fa4FD]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2019). Medium credibility.

Effects of Hip Preservation Surgery

Although the functional anatomy and biomechanics of the hip joint and encapsulating ligaments have been well described, surgical intervention and capsular management in hip arthroscopy and arthroplasty continue to raise many pressing concerns. With emerging interest in improving capsular management for hip preservation and postoperative joint arthroplasty mechanics, it is imperative to delineate the contribution of each surgical stage toward functional mobility and stability. The following recent in vitro laboratory studies contributed substantially to the understanding of hip arthroscopy and arthroplasty surgery, addressing several issues of demographics, stepwise surgical stages, varying implant parameters (e.g. implant type, head size, neck length, and anterior or posterior approach), and provided detailed insights into capsular function, mechanics, and management (see Appendix Table III).

Although it has been well established that surgically resecting the cam morphology can delay the pathomechanical process of subchondral bone stiffening, cartilage degeneration, and adverse loading, it was elusive how much the actual morphology or any of the individual surgical stages contributed to these aspects. In what we believe is the only documented in vitro cadaveric study that has examined a well-represented pathological cohort with cam morphologies, Ng et al. evaluated a large group of hip specimens with moderate-to-high alpha angles (representative of the symptomatic cam population) from young, male donors. The study examined how the capsulotomy, cam resection, and capsular repair affected passive range of motion and torque loading (Fig. 5), using a 6-degrees-of-freedom robotic testing platform. The study quantified the contribution of the cam deformity, which accounted for 21% to 27% of the torsional loading of the intact hip in deep flexion and internal rotation (Fig. 6), where the specimens indicated secondary at-risk parameters of smaller femoral neck-shaft - and higher spinopelvic incidence angles -. Capsular repairs restrained external rotation during deep flexion and were ineffective in other testing positions, partly because of the inherently large native head that maintained joint stability and partly because the cam deformities were not overresected (i.e. no proximal concavity or "cookie bite"). As the femoral head is naturally conchoidaland may be precisely shaped to maintain the labral seal and effectively distribute load, there may be suboptimal outcomes if a smaller cam morphology is resected. Translations of the hip joint center should be further examined to help characterize microinstability over the series of surgical stages. In addition, the balance between capsular repair and plication should be compared with established objective measures to minimize iatrogenic instability in hips with pathology.

### Editorial commentary: If you can' T see It, you can' T treat It: proper hip radiographic views are critical [^116VZQqb]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Hip arthroscopy has become a common surgical treatment for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome and hip labral tears. In addition to being a complex procedure with a steep learning curve, understanding the required imaging to provide a comprehensive view of femoral cam deformities can be challenging. Because of the 3-dimensional anatomy of the hip joint, 2-dimensional imaging with plain radiographs may miss areas of pathomorphology that are not in the plane of the specific radiographic view.

### Editorial commentary: hip arthroscopy benefits patients with Tönnis grade 0 or 1 hip arthritis and is not recommended for grade 3: optimal treatment of femoroacetabular impingement syndrome for grade 2 arthritis may Be determined by age and body mass index [^1164jXUi]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is a possible cause of early osteoarthritis, and restoration of normal anatomy can potentially prevent future major cartilage damage. Symptomatic cam lesions can lead to debonding of articular cartilage, resulting in superolateral cartilage lesions in 93% of patients. Patients with pincer lesions often exhibit cartilage lesions in the anterior and superolateral glenoid rim. Whereas the efficacy of prophylactic surgery remains uncertain, surgical intervention appears to yield superior short-term clinical outcomes compared with conservative treatment. Yet, there is a relatively high prevalence of asymptomatic individuals in the general population with either cam (25%) or pincer (67%) deformities, so prophylactic treatment of asymptomatic patients cannot be recommended. Symptomatic FAIS patients with Tönnis grades 0 and 1 (minimal hip arthritis) benefit from hip arthroscopy. Patients with higher grades of osteoarthritis may be unsuitable hip arthroscopy candidates and face a higher risk of conversion to hip replacement. The existing evidence regarding the treatment of patients with FAIS and Tönnis grade 2 or higher remains inconclusive. Generally, surgery tends to have favorable outcomes for younger patients with a normal body mass index, whereas nonsurgical alternatives should be explored in cases with severe joint space narrowing, Tönnis grade 3, and bilateral cartilage lesions.

### Femoroacetabular impingement: preoperative planning and postoperative MR imaging evaluation [^111boELU]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging plays a critical role in the preoperative and postoperative evaluation of patients with femoroacetabular impingement. Non-contrast MR imaging and direct magnetic resonance arthrography of the hip are the modalities of choice for the preoperative assessment of chondrolabral lesions. The MRI protocol should include radial images for detailed analysis of the cam deformity and fast sequences covering the pelvis and knee for measurement of femoral torsion. In patients with postoperative pain, a comprehensive analysis of residual deformities and signs of osseous overcorrection should be performed as they can cause residual impingement or iatrogenic instability.

### Cam deformity and acetabular dysplasia as risk factors for hip osteoarthritis [^114UWaiv]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Cam deformity and acetabular dysplasia have been recognized as relevant risk factors for hip osteoarthritis (OA) in a few prospective studies with limited sample sizes. To date, however, no evidence is available from prospective studies regarding whether the magnitude of these associations differs according to sex, body mass index (BMI), and age.

Methods

Participants in the Rotterdam Study cohort including men and women ages 55 years or older without OA at baseline (n = 4,438) and a mean follow-up of 9.2 years were included in the study. Incident radiographic OA was defined as a Kellgren/Lawrence grade of ≥ 2 or a total hip replacement at follow-up. Alpha and center-edge angles were measured to determine the presence of cam deformity and acetabular dysplasia/pincer deformity, respectively. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to assess the associations between both deformities and the development of OA.

Results

Subjects with cam deformity (OR 2.11, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.55–2.87) and those with acetabular dysplasia (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.50–3.21) had a 2-fold increased risk of developing OA compared with subjects without deformity, while pincer deformity did not increase the risk of OA. Stratification analyses showed that the associations of cam deformity and acetabular dysplasia with OA were driven by younger individuals, whereas BMI did not influence the associations. Female sex appears to modify the risk of hip OA related to acetabular dysplasia.

Conclusion

Individuals with cam deformity and those with acetabular dysplasia are predisposed to OA; these associations were independent of other well-known risk factors. Interestingly, both deformities predisposed to OA only in relatively young individuals. Therefore, early identification of these conditions is important.

### Does high level youth sports participation increase the risk of femoroacetabular impingement? A review of the current literature [^111MSYFd]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Femoroacetabular impingement is a recognised cause of hip pain and reduced activity, particularly in adolescents and young adults. Multiple aetiologies have been proposed by recent epidemiological studies and an understanding of skeletal maturation suggests that excessive activity during the adolescent growth period may play a key role in the development of FAI. In particular, adolescent males who participate in ice-hockey, basketball and to a lesser extent soccer, whilst performing a minimum of three training sessions and games per week are currently at greatest risk of developing a cam deformity and potentially progressing to symptomatic hip impingement. Further research by way of longitudinal studies or a systematic review looking at the comparison between sporting participation and a control cohort in athletes with open physis is required.

Identified prevalence data in the current literature suggests that highly regular activity during adolescent development, particularly in the presence of an open physis can encourage the development of a cam deformity. Similarly, sports that require repetitive high impact loading, hip flexion and internal rotation such as basketball, ice hockey and soccer employ movement patterns most likely to contribute to cam development.

Pediatric rheumatologists have an important role in identifying and diagnosing at risk individuals with femoroacetabular impingement, particularly given the potentially long-term consequences.

### Total volume of cam deformity alone predicts outcome in arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement [^115mMR5C]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Rates for arthroscopic surgery for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) are rising and there is growing concern related to the effectiveness and costs associated with this treatment. There is a general lack of consensus as to the criteria for surgical selection of patients. The purpose of this study was to determine whether patient outcome following arthroscopic surgery for FAI could be predicted based on the size and location of deformity. The specific questions were: (1) what is the morphology of FAI in terms of size and location of deformity in a cohort of patients selected for surgery? (2) Do morphological factors predict postoperative improvement in hip scores? (3) Do morphological factors predict preoperative hip scores? (4) Are there clusters of morphological factors which explain postsurgical improvement in hip scores?

Materials and Methods

Computer tomography (CT) surgical plans of 90 hips in 79 patients who had undergone primary hip arthroscopy for FAI were retrospectively reviewed. Four parameters for the femur and acetabulum were created: total depth of deformity, maximal depth, extent and the position of maximal deformity. This data were compared with prospectively acquired preoperative and postoperative patient outcome data using generalised linear models.

Results

The cohort comprised 33 males and 46 females aged 37.9 (18–61). The majority (74%) had mixed morphology, 23% isolated cam, and 3% isolated pincer. Overall, the bone depth was greatest and more extensive on the femur. Increased total additional cam deformity alone predicted poorer postoperative outcome (p = 0.045). None of the morphological factors were related to preoperative scores and there was no association between the meta-variables and postoperative outcome.

Conclusions

The results of this study indicate that a greater total volume of cam deformity led to poorer postoperative patient outcome scores at 1 year. This information provides the surgeon with more accurate patient-specific data for prediction of expected outcomes.

### What are the results of surgical treatment of hip dysplasia with concomitant cam deformity? [^11623xDs]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) is a reliable procedure to correct the deficient acetabular coverage in hips with developmental dysplasia. It is unclear how the presence of additional femoral cam-type deformity might influence the clinical and radiographic treatment results of PAO.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Are there differences in clinical scores (WOMAC, EQ-5D) and examination findings (impingement sign) or radiographic measures of acetabular orientation and head sphericity after PAO for isolated acetabular dysplasia when compared with the combined pathology of dysplasia and additional femoral cam deformity? (2) Are these clinical and radiographic findings after combined surgical therapy for additional cam deformity influenced by different pathology-adjusted surgical techniques?

Methods

From July 2005 to December 2010, 86 patients (106 hips) underwent PAO for hip dysplasia. Surgical and outcome data were prospectively collected and retrospectively reviewed in a comparative observational study. Indications for surgery were a lateral center-edge angle less than 25° and hip pain for at least 6 months. The contraindications for surgery were advanced radiographic osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 3), incongruency of joint space, and patient age > 50 years. Depending on preoperative hip ROM, impingement test, and presence of a radiographically visible cam deformity, treatment allocation was performed: Group I: isolated PAO in patients without symptomatic asphericity, Group IIa: PAO with subsequent osteochondroplasty through arthrotomy for patients with symptomatic cam deformity and no labrochondral pathology, and Group IIb: arthroscopically assisted osteochondroplasty and additional labrochondral repair with subsequent PAO when patients had labrochondral lesions in addition to a symptomatic cam deformity. Clinical outcome (impingement test, EQ-5D, WOMAC) as well as radiographic parameters (lateral center-edge angle, crossover sign, alpha angle, osteoarthritis grade) were obtained after a mean followup of 63 ± 18 months (range, 31–102 months) and compared with the baseline data. Eleven patients (13%) were lost to followup. With the numbers available, our study had 80% power to detect a difference between Groups I and II of 10 points on the WOMAC scores.

Results

There was no difference in the increase of WOMAC scores in patients with PAO alone (Group I; preoperative score 74 ± 17 versus postoperative 91 ± 15, p = 0.033) when compared with PAO and concurrent osteochondroplasty (Groups II A and B preoperative 73 ± 19 versus postoperative 90 ± 13 p < 0.001). The mean postoperative alpha angles in Group II (38° ± 6°) improved when compared with preoperative values (56° ± 15°; p < 0.001) and were even lower than native offset alpha angles in Group I (47° ± 11°). Clinical scores as well as postoperative radiographic parameters were not different between patients with conventional osteochondroplasty alone (Group IIA) and patients with arthroscopically assisted cam resection and intraarticular labrochondral repair (Group IIB).

Conclusions

With the numbers available, we detected no differences in outcome scores and radiographic results between patients who had been treated with PAO alone and patients who underwent combined PAO and offset correction for cam deformity. Although arthroscopically assisted treatment of advanced labrochondral lesions together with osteochondroplasty is possible during PAO and the results were not different in this small study when compared with patients with PAO and osteochondroplasty alone, the type and extent of damage that would indicate additional cartilage surgery over cam resection alone remain unclear.

### Cam impingement of the hip: a risk factor for hip osteoarthritis [^112yy6LE]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is characterized by abnormal contact between the proximal femur and the acetabulum. Two subtypes have been described: pincer impingement, caused by an overcovered acetabulum; and cam impingement, which occurs as a result of an aspherical femoral head (cam abnormality). A strong correlation exists between cam impingement and the subsequent development of hip osteoarthritis (OA). Major cam abnormalities confer a high risk of OA. However, the association between cam abnormalities and the pathology of OA has been difficult to compare between studies, as different methods have been used to define the abnormality. Cam abnormalities are acquired during skeletal growth and could be influenced by high impact sporting activities. Preventative treatments aiming to reduce the incidence of cam abnormalities and subsequent OA could, therefore, be developed. In this Perspective, we discuss the current understanding of FAI, focusing on cam abnormalities and their association with OA.

### Clinical and radiological hip parameters do not precede, but develop simultaneously with cam morphology: a 5-year follow-up study [^113bDLrY]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, a varus orientation of the hip, an extended growth plate, and limited hip internal rotation develop simultaneously with cam morphology. None of these hip parameters preceded cam morphology development. These findings underline the importance of the distribution of biomechanical stresses on the growing proximal femur in the etiology of cam morphology.

### Diagnosing hip microinstability: an international consensus study using the Delphi methodology [^116bVX2h]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Hip instability is characterised by excessive motion, can occur due to a variety of conditions (such as DDH, post-traumatic, connective tissue disorders, microtrauma, idiopathic and iatrogenic) often leading to pain and disability. Hip microinstability is a relatively new diagnosis which has gained increasing recognition both clinically and in the literature over the last decade. Microinstability has generally been defined as persistent excessive hip motion (insufficient to be classed as dislocation or subluxation) that has become symptomatic especially with pain. The condition classically presents in younger patients (16–50 years) which may be explained by increased participation in causative activities or the natural stiffening of joints with age. Females may also be more likely to present with hip microinstability, a theory supported by a demonstration that female ballet dancers show greater joint distraction on split antero-posterior radiographs compared with their male counterparts. In addition the pattern of chondral injury is different in those without dysplasia but having instability in the hip joint. The proposed treatment for hip microinstability is physiotherapy-directed muscle strengthening programme and changes to activity/sport to strengthen the muscles around the hip, abdomen and lower back. Oral anti-inflammatory analgesia may be used to ease symptoms followed by an intra-articular corticosteroid injection (if required after 6–12 weeks of physiotherapy). In patients who are persistently symptomatic following non-operative treatment with physiotherapy, a surgical approach may be undertaken, either arthroscopically or open, to correct underlying aetiology. Some of the surgical options are periacetabular re-directional osteotomy for acetabular dysplasia, arthroscopic thermal capsulorraphy or plication, thermal shrinkage and labral repair/reconstruction. However iatrogenic microinstability, especially in deep flexion, could be caused due to over resection of cam lesion.

### Twelve percent of hips with a primary cam deformity exhibit a slip-like morphology resembling sequelae of slipped capital femoral epiphysis [^115JvrY4]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In some hips with cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), we observed a morphology resembling a more subtle form of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). Theoretically, the morphology in these hips should differ from hips with a primary cam-type deformity.

Questions/Purposes

We asked if (1) head-neck offset; (2) epiphyseal angle; and (3) tilt angle differ among hips with a slip-like morphology, idiopathic cam, hips after in situ pinning of SCFE, and normal hips; and (4) what is the prevalence of a slip-like morphology among cam-type hips?

Methods

We retrospectively compared the three-dimensional anatomy of hips with a slip-like morphology (29 hips), in situ pinning for SCFE (eight hips), idiopathic cam deformity (171 hips), and 30 normal hips using radial MRI arthrography. Normal hips were derived from 17 asymptomatic volunteers. All other hips were recruited from a series of 277 hips (243 patients) seen at a specialized academic hip center between 2006 and 2010. Forty-one hips with isolated pincer deformity were excluded. Thirty-six of 236 hips had a known cause of cam impingement (secondary cam), including eight hips after in situ pinning of SCFE (postslip group). The 200 hips with a primary cam were separated in hips with a slip-like morphology (combination of positive fovea sign [if the neck axis did not intersect with the fovea capitis] and a tilt angle [between the neck axis and perpendicular to the basis of the epiphysis] exceeding 4°) and hips with an idiopathic cam. We evaluated offset ratio, epiphyseal angle (angle between the neck axis and line connecting the center of the femoral head and the point where the physis meets the articular surface), and tilt angle circumferentially around the femoral head-neck axis. Prevalence of slip-like morphology was determined based on the total of 236 hips with cam deformities.

Results

Offset ratio was decreased anterosuperiorly in idiopathic cam, slip-like, and postslip (eg, 1 o'clock position with a mean offset ranging from 0.00 to 0.14; p < 0.001 for all groups) compared with normal hips (0.25 ± 0.06 [95% confidence interval, 0.13–0.37]) and increased posteroinferiorly in slip-like (eg, 8 o'clock position, 0.5 ± 0.09 [0.32–0.68]; p < 0.001) and postslip groups (0.55 ± 0.12 [0.32–0.78]; p < 0.001) and did not differ in idiopathic cam (0.32 ± 0.09 [0.15–0.49]; p = 0.323) compared with normal (0.31 ± 0.07 [0.18–0.44]) groups. Epiphyseal angle was increased anterosuperiorly in the slip-like (eg, 1 o'clock position, 70° ± 9° [51°-88°]; p < 0.001) and postslip groups (75° ± 13° [49°-100°]; p = 0.008) and decreased in idiopathic cam (50° ± 8° [35°-65°]; p < 0.001) compared with normal hips (58° ± 8° [43°-74°]). Posteroinferiorly, epiphyseal angle was decreased in slip-like (eg, 8 o'clock position, 54° ± 10° [34°-74°]; p < 0.001) and postslip (44° ± 11° [23°-65°]; p < 0.001) groups and did not differ in idiopathic cam (76° ± 8° [61°-91°]; p = 0.099) compared with normal (73° ± 7° [59°-88°]) groups. Tilt angle increased in slip-like (eg, 2/8 o'clock position, 14° ± 8° [-1° to 30°]; p < 0.001) and postslip hips (29° ± 10° [9°-48°]; p < 0.001) and decreased in hips with idiopathic cam (-7° ± 5° [-17° to 4°]; p < 0.001) compared with normal (-1° ± 5° [-10° to 8°]) hips. The prevalence of a slip-like morphology was 12%.

Conclusions

The slip-like morphology is the second most frequent pathomorphology in hips with primary cam deformity. MRI arthrography of the hip allows identifying a slip-like morphology, which resembles hips after in situ pinning of SCFE and distinctly differs from hips with idiopathic cam. These results support previous studies reporting that SCFE might be a risk factor for cam-type FAI.

### Editorial commentary: cam lesion location and size in hip arthroscopy: which matters most? [^115upc2C]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

The femoral cam lesion, initially recognized as the "pistol grip" deformity in femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS), has long been a focal point in hip arthroscopy. While residual cam deformity is widely acknowledged as a major cause of revision surgery, emerging studies have questioned whether cam lesion location impacts surgical outcomes. This line of inquiry essentially revolves around three interconnected aspects: first, given the near-spherical morphology of the femoral head-neck junction, whether isolated superolateral, anterolateral, or anterior cam locations can exist-a fundamental question regarding the conceptual framework of cam location taxonomy; second, how the size and location of cam lesions influence the practical execution of femoroplasty, encompassing considerations of surgical technique and operative precision; and third, assuming standardized femoroplasty regardless of lesion size or location, whether the topographical location of the cam itself truly impacts surgical outcomes, exploring the intrinsic effect of cam location on clinical results. Notably, cam lesions seen on AP radiographs-often appearing as classic "pistol grip" deformities-tend to be larger, which may underlie their association with more severe labral-cartilage injury and poorer outcomes, pointing to size rather than location as the key prognostic factor. Our perspective emphasizes the need for intuitive methodologies to better define how cam volume and location interact to affect arthroscopic outcomes, ultimately guiding surgical strategy and individualized prognosis.

### Arthroscopic treatment of cam-type femoroacetabular impingement: preliminary report at 2 years minimum follow-up [^116u7hcy]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2008). Low credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement is defined as anterior hip abutment between the acetabular rim and proximal femur. When it is secondary to acetabular overcoverage, it is pincer impingement. When it is secondary to femoral head and neck deformity, it is cam impingement. Open remodeling of impinging deformities is the standard treatment of this condition. We describe arthroscopic treatment of cam impingement in 19 patients using standard hip arthroscopy portals by the lateral approach. Sixteen patients improved their symptoms after the procedure; and 3 patients deteriorated, with 1 needing a total hip arthroplasty at 2 years follow-up. We had no cases with postoperative femoral neck fractures or avascular necrosis. Hip arthroscopy can be successfully used to treat cam impingement. The precautions used in open surgery to preserve femoral neck bone stock and hip vascularity should be followed.

### Labral disease associated with femoroacetabular impingement: do we need to correct the structural deformity? [^115HVx1D]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2009). Low credibility.

In this study, we compared the clinical results of arthroscopic partial labral resection to augmentation of this procedure with limited open osteochondroplasty for the treatment of symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement. Two consecutive cohorts were evaluated: (a) group I, arthroscopic treatment of labrum and articular cartilage, and (b) group II, hip arthroscopy augmented with limited osteochondroplasty of the femoral head-neck junction. Group I (23 hips) and group II (25 hips) patients had no difference in age, labral disease patterns, osteoarthritis grade, or chondromalacia. Mean follow-up was slightly longer in group I. The modified Harris Hip Score showed a trend toward higher values in group II. A 10-point improvement was more common in group II, and fewer group II patients required subsequent surgery. These preliminary data suggest that patients with cam femoroacetabular impingement may have improved clinical outcomes when the impingement deformity is corrected.

### Hip pain and mobility deficits-hip osteoarthritis: revision 2017 [^113hNC1K]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis natural history and deformity-related risk — The natural history of hip OA is not completely understood; arthritic changes occur both inside and outside of the hip joint, resulting in loss of joint space, development of osteophytes, and subchondral sclerosis and cysts, and joint range of motion (ROM) is reduced with muscle weakness developing around the joint as OA progresses. Degenerative hip changes develop more frequently in those with developmental dysplasia, those with cam deformities develop hip OA more rapidly, and cam deformities that develop after slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) are related to early hip OA. Evidence updates note that degenerative hip changes occur most rapidly in those with developmental dysplasia of the hip, and in 121 patients with stable SCFE, 96 had signs of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and all 121 had some radiographic signs of hip OA.

### The cam-type deformity of the proximal femur arises in childhood in response to vigorous sporting activity [^111ggZUP]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of a cam-type deformity in athletes and its association with vigorous sports activities during and after the growth period is unknown.

Questions/Purposes

We therefore compared the prevalence and occurrence of a cam-type deformity by MRI in athletes during childhood and adolescence with an age-matched control group.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 72 hips in 37 male basketball players with a mean age of 17.6 years (range, 9–25 years) and 76 asymptomatic hips of 38 age-matched volunteers who had not participated in sporting activities at a high level.

Results

Eleven (15%) of the 72 hips in the athletes were painful and had positive anterior impingement tests on physical examination. Internal rotation of the hip averaged 30.1° (range, 15°-45°) in the control group compared with only 18.9° (range, 0°-45°) in the athletes. The maximum value of the alpha angle throughout the anterosuperior head segment was larger in the athletes (average, 60.5° ± 9°), compared with the control group (47.4° ± 4°). These differences became more pronounced after closure of the capital growth plate. Overall, the athletes had a 10-fold increased likelihood of having an alpha angle greater than 55° at least at one measurement position.

Conclusions

Our observations suggest a high intensity of sports activity during adolescence is associated with a substantial increase in the risk of cam-type impingement. These patients also may be at increased risk of subsequent development of secondary coxarthrosis.

### Hip pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^112yXuro]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT Femoroacetabular impingement is one of the most common causes of hip pain in young adults. 24 It can be caused by a cam deformity, which is bony overgrowth of the femoral head and neck, a pincer deformity of the acetabulum, or both. Femoroacetabular impingement often has a gradual onset without a specific injury. It usually presents earlier in the disease process with less bony changes in athletes than in nonathletes and is more bothersome to athletes whose activities require hyperflexion and wide range of motion at the hip joint. 2, 5, 9 Positive results on the flexion adduction internal rotation and flexion abduction external rotation tests are indicative of intra-articular hip pathology. 4, 7. Radiography is used to help diagnose femoroacetabular impingement, although the preferred radiographic views may vary.

Standing anteroposterior radiographs of the pelvis may be most helpful for diagnosing of the pincer deformity, 26 whereas Meyer lateral and 90-degree Dunn views may be best to visualize the cam deformity.
27. 2, 5, 9 Physical examination for labral tears should include flexion adduction internal rotation and flexion abduction external rotation tests. 7 A standing radiograph should be the initial imaging test. PIRIFORMIS AND DEEP GLUTEAL SYNDROME Piriformis syndrome is thought to be a result of the piriformis muscle entrapping the sciatic nerve, causing hip and buttock pain and sciatica. Piriformis syndrome is a subset of deep gluteal syndrome, which includes entrapment of the sciatic nerve and/or pudendal nerve by the piriformis muscle, gemelliobturator internus, or proximal hamstrings. HAMSTRING INJURIES Posterior hip/buttock pain around the ischium may be indicative of a hamstring strain, tear, or avulsion.

Patients may have a history of a traumatic, sports-related, or overuse injury. A complete hamstring tear or avulsion often causes ecchymosis of the posterior thigh. This article updates previous articles on this topic by Wilson and Furukawa, and O'Kane. 4 6.

### Arthroscopic hip surgery compared with physiotherapy and activity modification for the treatment of symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^113WrRXM]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a hip condition where adverse morphology predisposes to premature joint degeneration. This adverse morphology is classified as cam, pincer, or mixed. Cam morphology describes a loss of sphericity of the femoral head, pincer morphology describes an acetabulum with excessive coverage of the femoral head, and mixed morphology describes a combination of the two deformities (fig 1). These hip shapes can cause the femoral neck to impact against the acetabular rim during a functional range of movement, with resultant damage to the labrum (which is attached to the rim), delamination of the adjacent acetabular cartilage, and, over time, secondary osteoarthritis.

Fig 1
Anteroposterior radiographs showing (A) normal morphology, (B) cam morphology, and (C) pincer morphology. Dashes represent abnormal morphology that predisposes to femoroacetabular impingement, and which is excised with a burr during arthroscopic surgery to prevent impingement

The prevalence of FAI morphology is high and is observed in about one fifth of the general population. Less than 25% of those affected develop pain(FAI syndrome) or osteoarthritis, although up to 50% of all hip osteoarthritis might develop secondary to FAI. Identifying those at greatest risk of developing joint disease secondary to FAI remains a challenge.

Physiotherapy and activity modification represents the principal treatment for symptomatic FAI; however, arthroscopic surgery is increasingly adopted to reshape the hip and deal with the damage to the labrum and cartilage (fig 2). The primary treatment goal is to improve pain and function, but interventions that modify contact between the femoral neck and acetabular rim may subsequently reduce cartilage and joint damage, the risk of osteoarthritis, and need for future hip arthroplasty.

### Radiological predictors of outcomes in hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement [^115YZjJT]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Hip arthroscopy has gained prominence as a primary surgical intervention for symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). This study aimed to identify radiological features, and their combinations, that predict the outcome of hip arthroscopy for FAI.

Methods

A prognostic cross-sectional cohort study was conducted involving patients from a single centre who underwent hip arthroscopy between January 2013 and April 2021. Radiological metrics measured on conventional radiographs and magnetic resonance arthrography were systematically assessed. The study analyzed the relationship between these metrics and complication rates, revision rates, and patient-reported outcomes.

Results

Out of 810 identified hip arthroscopies, 359 hips were included in the study. Radiological risk factors associated with unsatisfactory outcomes after cam resection included a dysplastic posterior wall, Tönnis grade 2 or higher, and over-correction of the α angle. The presence of acetabular retroversion and dysplasia were also significant predictors for worse surgical outcomes. Notably, over-correction of both cam and pincer deformities resulted in poorer outcomes than under-correction.

Conclusion

We recommend caution in performing hip arthroscopy in patients who have three positive acetabular retroversion signs. Acetabular dysplasia with a lateral centre-edge angle of less than 20° should not be treated with isolated hip arthroscopy. Acetabular rim-trimming should be avoided in patients with borderline dysplasia, and care should be taken to avoid over-correction of a cam deformity and/or pincer deformity.

Despite strong consensus that PCM develops during skeletal maturation 'as a normal physiological response to load' (statement 1) further qualified as 'high-load sporting activity' (statement 11), some panellists, during the online discussions, felt 'normal' is 'potentially problematic'. However, the high prevalence of PCM in largely asymptomatic professional athletes — 'several studies showed > 80% prevalence' — begs the question: 'when does it [physiological response] become abnormal? when it's very painful?' Furthermore, high-load sporting activity for one athlete might be normal-load sporting activity for another; load type ('torsion, varus/valgus') and skeletal maturation status are both important variables to consider in clinical practice and research.

Box 2
Interacting Group Process: mixed stakeholder group discussion summary — terminology domain

The Delphi panel achieved strong consensus on using the term 'morphology' and to abandon 'lesion', 'deformity' and 'abnormality': 'large foreign words set the tone for fear, unknown, not in control, especially about [the] outcome'. Although the majority agreed, some felt that 'language didn't necessarily change things for patients', and that the consequences ('the pathology part') of primary cam morphology 'is the bigger problem and needs to be part of the file, but the patient doesn't necessarily need to know about this [wording]'. Others thought that 'morphology should be avoided in patient consultations as it's unfriendly, not well understood and likely medical "jargon"'. A further problem is that 'morphology' doesn't always translate well into other languages.

### The alpha angle [^114jSeev]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

TABLE III
Grades of Recommendation

Overall, the utility of the alpha angle as a single measurement in today's hip preservation practice is unclear. A single angle is likely inadequate to capture a complex 3D and dynamic pathologic process, and the methods for measuring this angle are rife with imprecision and variable reliability. That being said, the alpha angle is still the most commonly used and reported method for quantifying cam deformity. Also, it is important to correlate preoperative localization of the maximal alpha angle with direct intraoperative visualization of the lesion, as this can help to prevent under-resection. Although the alpha angle may continue to play a role in the diagnosis and management of FAI, the path forward will likely include much more 3D standardization, automation, and dynamic assessment of these measurements.

Disease course, clinical presentation, and risk factors for osteoarthritis (OA) — OA is diagnosed at a median of 55 years of age, and patients may live approximately 30 years with the disease; patients with symptomatic OA typically present with joint pain, aching, stiffness, and limited walking ability; knee OA is usually bilateral but one knee may be affected more severely, while hip OA is frequently unilateral; OA can progress to severe, disabling pain eventually resulting in structural and functional joint failure; depression and catastrophizing are common, and sleep problems were reported in 72% of adults older than 55 years with OA; patient-level risk factors include older age, female sex, overweight and obesity, genetics, race, and engagement in certain work or recreational activities; weight gain can exacerbate symptoms and for Veterans and active duty Service Members with OA, providers should try to avoid prescription medications that promote weight gain and suggest the use of agents that promote weight loss; heavy work activities or work that requires frequent kneeling, heavy lifting, or repetitive use of joints is associated with the development of OA, and studies also show a strong association between high-impact sports and the development of OA; joint-related factors include previous injury to the knee or hip, knee malalignment, joint shape, increased bone density, knee extensor muscle weakness, joint laxity, joint deformities such as cam deformity and acetabular dysplasia, and abnormal loading of joints, with less well-defined potential risk factors including knee extensor muscle weakness and smoking; there is no cure for OA and overall management is aimed at reducing pain and improving function, and for patients with refractory, disabling pain, the most effective treatment is total joint replacement.

### Contemporary techniques in femoral osteoplasty [^113Sa6Sj]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Hip arthroscopy has a steep learning curve with femoral osteoplasty being one of the most challenging technical aspects of the procedure. The authors discuss a methodical system of preoperative templating and intraoperative fluoroscopic evaluation to ensure adequacy of resection and correction of impingement. There have been multiple methods developed to help aid surgeons in intraoperative decision making during cam correction. Using the available techniques may help limit complications and revision arthroscopic procedures, and understanding the nuances and limitations of each method will be paramount for the success of hip arthroscopists when addressing cam morphology. Future studies comparing long-term outcomes of these various resection techniques will be important in guiding our understanding of femoroacetabular impingement management.

### Mechanical factors explain development of cam-type deformity [^115YR6XD]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

A cam-type deformity drastically increases the risk of hip osteoarthritis (OA). Since this type of skeletal anomaly is more prevalent among young active adults, it is hypothesized that the loading conditions experienced during certain types of vigorous physical activities stimulates formation of cam-type deformity. We further hypothesize that the growth plate shape modulates the influence of mechanical factors on the development of cam-type deformity.

Design

We used finite element (FE) models of the proximal femur with an open growth plate to study whether mechanical factors could explain the development of cam-type deformity in adolescents. Four different loading conditions (representing different types of physical activities) and three different levels of growth plate extension towards the femoral neck were considered. Mechanical stimuli at the tissue level were calculated by means of the osteogenic index (OI) for all loading conditions and growth plate shape variations.

Results

Loading conditions and growth plate shape influence the distribution of OI in hips with an open growth plate, thereby driving the development of cam-type deformity. In particular, specific types of loads experienced during physical activities and a larger growth plate extension towards the femoral neck increase the chance of cam-type deformity.

Conclusions

Specific loading patterns seem to stimulate the development of cam-type deformity by modifying the distribution of the mechanical stimulus. This is in line with recent clinical studies and reveals mechanobiological mechanisms that trigger the development of cam-type deformity. Avoiding these loading patterns during skeletal growth might be a potential preventative strategy for future hip OA.

### Bone density changes following surgical correction of femoroacetabular impingement deformities [^113WeszD]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) involves abnormal hip biomechanics due to deformities and is associated with osteoarthritis. Bone mineral density (BMD) in the acetabulum is higher in subjects with convex femoral (cam) FAI deformities compared to control subjects. The objective of this study was to assess post-operative changes of BMD with and without surgical correction of the cam deformity.

Design

Thirteen patients with bilateral cam deformities but unilateral symptoms underwent pre-operative and follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans of both hips. The deformity was surgically removed from the symptomatic hip. BMD was measured in regions of interest (ROI) around the superior acetabulum from CT scans at both time points. The contralateral untreated hip was used as a within-patient control. Changes in BMD were assessed by two-way repeated measures ANOVA (side, time) and paired t-tests.

Results

A greater BMD decrease was seen in the treated compared to the untreated hip (P < 0.0018). BMD within the superior acetabulum decreased by 39 mg/cc on the treated side (P < 0.0001) but only 9 mg/cc (P = 0.15) in the untreated contralateral hip. These changes represent 7.1% and 1.7% of the pre-operative BMD on the respective sides.

Conclusions

BMD decreased in the treated hip, suggesting a positive effect of surgical correction in relieving stresses within the hip joint. Longer term follow-up is required to assess the ultimate fate of the articular cartilage within the joint. This study showed that surgical correction of the cam deformity in patients with FAI may alter the pathological biomechanics within the joint.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 2-research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip [^112nvcDv]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Although the Delphi panel did not prioritise qualitative or mixed-methods studies to 'explore perspectives/preferences/attitudes/concerns/experiences of primary cam morphology and FAI syndrome stakeholders' (statements 61 and 74), mixed stakeholder groups highlighted the importance of 'understanding a patient's journey'. They emphasised the importance of involving stakeholders in coproduction — especially athletes, parents and coaches. Stakeholder discussions underscored the fertile ground for coproducing qualitative research, especially with minoritised populations, to address pertinent questions. Taking an evidence-based research approach, these studies should build on the results of systematic reviews and qualitative evidence synthesis relevant to the specific question.

How agreement on a prioritised research agenda advances research on primary cam morphology and its natural history?

Strong consensus on primary cam morphology's conceptual and operational definitions, taxonomy and terminology reported and discussed in a linked paper (Oxford consensus study, part 1) empowers researchers and their patient and public partners to do more rigorous research — research that is more credible, consistent, replicable, valid, and of higher quality. Combining rigorous research with consensus on a prioritised research agenda catalyses focused, high-quality research that is systematic in its inquiry, employs appropriate design and asks challenging questions that matters. This consensus informs future research priorities, illuminating challenging questions that are relevant to the minoritised, including athletes and athlete-patients. It also invites authentic collaboration, setting the scene for a more inclusive approach to research.

### Origin of cam morphology in femoroacetabular impingement [^1176TNHt]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Cam morphology of the proximal femur is an abnormal contour of the femoral head-neck junction present in approximately 15% to 25% of the asymptomatic population, predominantly in males. Alpha angle and femoral head-neck offset ratio are 2 objective measurement tools that define cam morphology. Both primary (idiopathic) and secondary cam deformity develops through distinct mechanisms. The cause of primary (idiopathic) cam morphology remains incompletely understood. Mounting evidence suggests that idiopathic cam morphology develops during adolescence through alterations in the capital femoral epiphysis in response to participation in vigorous sporting activity. While the exact cause of epiphyseal extension has not yet been determined, preliminary evidence suggests that epiphyseal extension may reflect a short-term adaptive response to provide stability to the physis at the long-term cost of the development of cam morphology. Commonly recognized causes of secondary cam deformity include frank slipped capital femoral epiphysis, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, and deformity after fracture of the proximal femur. Recent studies also support subtle slipped capital femoral epiphysis as a unique and silent cause of a small percentage of subjects previously thought to have idiopathic cam deformity.

### Arthroscopic femoroplasty in the management of cam-type femoroacetabular impingement [^112Y9Nb5]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2009). Low credibility.

Cam-type femoroacetabular impingement is a recognized cause of intraarticular pathology and secondary osteoarthritis in young adults. Arthroscopy is reportedly useful to treat selected hip abnormalities and has been proposed as a method of correcting underlying impingement. We report the outcomes of arthroscopic management of cam-type femoroacetabular impingement. We prospectively assessed all 200 patients (207 hips) who underwent arthroscopic correction of cam impingement from December 2003 to October 2007, using a modified Harris hip score. The minimum followup was 12 months (mean, 16 months; range, 12–24 months); no patients were lost to followup. The average age was 33 years with 138 men and 62 women. One hundred and fifty-eight patients (163 hips) underwent correction of cam impingement (femoroplasty) alone while 42 patients (44 hips) underwent concomitant correction of pincer impingement. The average increase in Harris hip score was 20 points; 0.5% converted to THA. We had a 1.5% complication rate. The short-term outcomes of arthroscopic treatment of cam-type femoroacetabular impingement are comparable to published reports for open methods with the advantage of a less invasive approach.

### Full recovery of hip muscle strength is not achieved at return to sports in patients with femoroacetabular impingement surgery [^1125MA6X]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is an anatomical hip deformity, which causes a conflict between the femur and the acetabulum. FAI is a syndrome divided into CAM-type, Pincer-type and mixed-type. CAM involves a deformity of the femoral neck while Pincer refers to a deformity of the acetabulum. FAI syndrome could result in damage to the labrum and joint cartilage, hip pain, reduced mobility, muscle strength deficit of the hip, altered movement patterns and reduced hip functions. FAI syndrome is a strong risk factor to develop hip osteoarthritis. The exact prevalence of FAI syndrome has not been thoroughly determined. FAI syndrome is common in young adults who are healthy, active and participate in sports, although the exact prevalence of FAI syndrome has not been determined.

Surgical treatment of FAI syndrome using arthroscopy has become increasingly common even though conservative treatment is often recommended prior to surgery. There are studies in the literature regarding the long-term effects of arthroscopic treatment of FAI syndrome. In these studies, self-assessment forms were used during follow-ups, whereas strength tests were not performed. The outcome of arthroscopy seems to be generally good with a gradual return to sports at 4–6 months after surgery. Because studies in which hip strength testing is performed following FAI surgery are lacking in the literature, it is not clear whether these patients are ready to return to sports.

Sufficient hip muscle strength plays an important role for the athlete from a performance and injury prevention perspective. Reduced hip strength can be associated with an increased risk of various conditions of the lower extremities, for example iliotibial band syndrome, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear and patellar tendinopathy.

### Five-year outcomes after arthroscopic surgery for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome in elite athletes [^113Lmj81]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is a well-recognized cause of hip pain in the athletic population. In FAIS, an abnormal osseous morphology of the femoral head (cam) or acetabulum (pincer) generates pathological contact in the hip joint and can damage the labrum and cartilage. FAIS morphologies are observed in athletes presenting with hip pain, reduced range of motion (ROM) of the hip, and restrictions in sports participation. Athletes with high demands in terms of hip flexion, such as ice hockey and soccer players, run an increased risk of developing hip pain caused by cam and/or pincer deformities.

Arthroscopic treatment for FAIS has become increasingly common during the past decade and has yielded good clinical outcomes. The purpose of surgical intervention is to reduce pain and increase ROM by removing cam and pincer deformities, striving for impingement-free hip anatomy and improved hip function. The literature also suggests a low rate of complications and reoperations after arthroscopic treatment for FAIS. Although several studies have reported positive results in elite athletes treated with arthroscopic surgery, most use return to sports (RTS) or performance outcome. However, only a few studies have used patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to present the results, and the reports on the long- or midterm outcome in this patient category are limited. Nevertheless, arthroscopic treatment in athletes presenting with FAIS is increasing, and studies suggest that high-level athletes will improve their hip function and have a high rate of return to preinjury activity levels.,

Follow-up after hip surgery generally includes PROMs. Early PROMs, such as the modified Harris Hip Score, were developed for an elderly population with osteoarthritis and are therefore not suitable for younger, more active patients. Lately, PROMs validated for young and active patients have been established; they include the International Hip Outcome Tool short version (iHOT-12)and the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS). These scores are recommended by the scientific community for evaluating FAIS in this patient population.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the 5-year results after arthroscopic treatment for FAIS in elite athletes with PROMs validated for an active population. The primary hypothesis was that elite athletes experience improved outcomes 5 years after surgical treatment.

### Orthopedic perspectives on femoroacetabular impingement [^111uPy2X]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a cause of hip pain in which there is abnormal and repetitive contact between the proximal femur and the acetabulum. FAI can occur as a primary condition in children with distinct anatomical abnormalities or can occur as a secondary process in cases of developmental hip conditions or trauma. There are two main categories of FAI, cam and pincer, which are distinguished based on whether the anatomical abnormality is on the femoral side or the acetabular side of the hip joint, respectively. Good outcomes have been achieved with early surgical intervention, but once advanced degenerative changes have occurred the chances for a successful surgical outcome are severely diminished. The orthopedic surgeon's ability to appropriately treat FAI depends on an accurate understanding of the etiology and features of each child. The ability to make an early, accurate diagnosis is enhanced with the use of imaging modalities such as radiographs, MRI and CT. This review will focus on orthopedic perspectives in the use of these imaging modalities in defining the anatomical features of and guiding treatment for FAI.

### Hip joint torsional loading before and after cam femoroacetabular impingement surgery [^116Rzz5f]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical management of cam femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) aims to preserve the native hip and restore joint function, although it is unclear how the capsulotomy, cam deformity, and capsular repair influence joint mechanics to balance functional mobility.

Purpose

To examine the contributions of the capsule and cam deformity to hip joint mechanics. Using in vitro, cadaveric methods, we examined the individual effects of the surgical capsulotomy, cam resection, and capsular repair on passive range of motion and resistance of applied torque.

Study Design

Descriptive laboratory study.

Methods

Twelve cadaveric hips with cam deformities were skeletonized to the capsule and mounted onto a robotic testing platform. The robot positioned each intact hip in multiple testing positions: (1) extension, (2) neutral 0°, (3) flexion 30°, (4) flexion 90°, (5) flexion-adduction and internal rotation (FADIR), and (6) flexion-abduction and external rotation. Then the robot performed applicable internal and external rotations, recording the neutral path of motion until a 5-N·m of torque was reached in each rotational direction. Each hip then underwent a series of surgical stages (T-capsulotomy, cam resection, capsular repair) and was retested to reach 5 N·m of internal and external torque again after each stage. During the capsulotomy and cam resection stages, the initial intact hip's recorded path of motion was replayed to measure changes in resisted torque.

Results

Regarding changes in motion, external rotation increased substantially after capsulotomies, but internal rotation only further increased at flexion 90° (change +32%, P = 0.001, d = 0.58) and FADIR (change +33%, P < .001, d = 0.51) after cam resections. Capsular repair provided marginal restraint for internal rotation but restrained the external rotation compared with the capsulotomy stage. Regarding changes in torque, both internal and external torque resistance decreased after capsulotomy. Compared with the capsulotomy stage, cam resection further reduced internal torque resistance during flexion 90° (change -45%, P < .001, d = 0.98) and FADIR (change -37%, P = 0.003, d = 1.0), where the cam deformity accounted for 21% of the intact hip's torsional resistance in flexion 90° and 27% in FADIR.

Conclusion

Although the capsule played a predominant role in joint constraint, the cam deformity provided 21% to 27% of the intact hip's resistance to torsional load in flexion and internal rotation. Resecting the cam deformity would remove this loading on the chondrolabral junction.

Clinical Relevance

These findings are the first to quantify the contribution of the cam deformity to resisting hip joint torsional loads and thus quantify the reduced loading on the chondrolabral complex that can be achieved after cam resection.

### Incidence of hip pain in a prospective cohort of asymptomatic volunteers: is the cam deformity a risk factor for hip pain? [^116qMs3u]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Although cam-type femoroacetabular impingement is commonly associated with labral chondral damage and hip pain, a large proportion of asymptomatic individuals will have this deformity.

Purpose

To determine the incidence of hip pain in a prospective cohort of volunteers who had undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of their hips.

Study Design

Case control study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

A total of 200 asymptomatic volunteers who underwent an MRI of both hips were followed for a mean time of 4.4 years (range, 4.01–4.95 years). Thirty were lost to follow-up, leaving 170 individuals (77 males, 93 females) with a mean age of 29.5 years (range, 25.7–54.5 years). All patients were blinded to the results of their MRI. All completed a follow-up questionnaire inquiring about the presence of hip pain or a history of hip pain lasting longer than 6 weeks since the original MRI. Each patient was asked to draw where the pain was on a body diagram.

Results

Eleven patients (5 males, 6 females; 6.5% of sample; mean age, 29.9 years; range, 25.7–45.6 years) reported hip pain, of which 3 (1 male, 2 females) had bilateral pain for a total of 14 hips. Seven of the 14 painful hips had a cam-type deformity at the time of the initial MRI versus 37 of the 318 nonpainful hips (P = 0.0002). This gave a relative risk of 4.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3–7.8) of developing hip pain if cam deformity was present. Those 14 painful hips had a significantly greater alpha angle at the radial 1:30 clock position than did those who did not develop pain with a cam deformity: 61.5° (range, 57.3°-65.7°) versus 57.9° (range, 56.9°-59.1°), respectively (P = 0.05). A significantly greater proportion of patients (12%) with limited internal rotation ≤ 20° (versus 2.7% with internal rotation > 20°) went on to develop hip pain (P = 0.009; relative risk = 3.1 [95% CI, 1.6–6.0]).

Conclusion

The presence of a cam deformity represents a significant risk factor for the development of hip pain. An elevated alpha angle at the 1:30 clock position and decreased internal rotation are associated with an increased risk of developing hip pain. However, not all patients with a cam deformity develop hip pain, and further research is needed to better define those at greater risk of developing degenerative symptoms.

### Does the type of sport influence morphology of the hip? A systematic review [^113yLLVE]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Positional Differences

Ice hockey butterfly goalkeepers are suggested to be most at risk of cam-type FAI owing to the biomechanical demands of flexion and internal rotation, similar to the flexion, adduction, internal rotation impingement test. Similar demands of extreme internal rotation are placed on athletes in balletand golf. Indeed, butterfly goalkeepers have a significantly higher alpha angle in comparison with outfield players, and the maximum alpha angle is located in a more lateral position in goalkeepers (1 vs 1:45 o'clock). Anterosuperior impingement may be related to end-range internal rotation. Siebenrock et alnoted higher alpha angles in symptomatic versus asymptomatic ice hockey players at 1-, 2-, and 12-o'clock. At these positions, a negative correlation was reported between alpha angle and internal rotation. This suggests that symptomatic cam is associated with functional deficits relating to the "at risk" positions, including decreased internal rotation. However, it is not known whether the relationship between cam deformity and internal rotation relationship is functional and a result of osseous impingement or a consequence of the symptomatic pain experienced. Kinematic exposure through positional differences may affect not only the development of the deformity itself and the associated symptoms but also the outcomes of treatment. In soccer, linemen were less likely to return to play after hip arthroscopy in comparison with other positions (odds ratio, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.1–35; p = 0.04) (Table 6). This has been attributed to the additional movement and rapid changes of direction required in this position, which may result in more severe morphology.

### Can the alpha angle assessment of cam impingement predict acetabular cartilage delamination? [^116z9fbp]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Substantial acetabular cartilage damage is commonly present in patients suffering from femoral acetabular impingement (FAI). A better understanding of which patient is at risk of developing substantial cartilage damage is critical for establishing appropriate treatment guidelines.

Questions/Purposes

We asked: (1) Does the cam deformity severity in FAI as assessed by alpha angle predict acetabular cartilage delamination? And (2) what are the clinical and radiographic findings in patients with acetabular cartilage delamination?

Methods

One hundred sixty-seven patients (129 males, 38 females) with a mean age of 38 years (range, 17–59 years) underwent joint preservation surgery for cam-type FAI. All data were collected prospectively. We assessed center-edge angle and Tönnis grade on AP radiographs and alpha angle on specialized lateral radiographs. Acetabular cartilage damage was assessed intraoperatively using the classification of Beck et al., with Type 3 and greater qualifying as delamination.

Results

For all hips, mean alpha angle was 65.5° (range, 41°-90°), and mean center-edge angle was 33.3° (range, 21°-52.5°). Patients with an alpha angle of 65° or greater had an odds ratio (OR) of 4.00 (95% CI, 1.26–12.71) of having Type 3 or greater damage. Increased age (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01–1.07) and male sex (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.09–4.62) were associated with Type 3 or greater damage, while this was the opposite for acetabular coverage as assessed by center-edge angle (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–0.99).

Conclusions

Patients with cam-type FAI and an alpha angle of 65° or more are at increased risk of substantial cartilage damage while increasing acetabular coverage appears to have a protective effect.

Level Of Evidence

Level III, prognostic study. See the Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

### Radiographic and dynamic assessment for resection of cam lesions in patients with femoroacetabular impingement [^113RuAcv]. Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Cam-type femoroacetabular impingement is characterized by a pathologic asphericity of the femoral head-neck junction, and arthroscopic femoral osteoplasty is indicated to correct the bony abnormality and restore normal hip mechanics when symptomatic. Residual femoroacetabular impingement deformity after arthroscopy is a leading cause of failure, and it is therefore critical to perform a thorough fluoroscopic and dynamic assessment when addressing cam deformities arthroscopically. The fluoroscopic assessment uses 6 anteroposterior views, including 3 in hip extension (30° internal rotation, neutral rotation, and 30° external rotation) and 3 in 50° flexion (neutral rotation, 40° external rotation, 60° of external rotation), performed before, during, and after the femoral resection. The dynamic assessment includes evaluation of impingement-free range of motion and "end feel" (a subjective description of the tactile feedback during assessment of hip motion), and should be performed before and after the femoral resection in 3 specific positions (extension/abduction, flexion/abduction, and flexion/internal rotation). Although the anterior aspect of the head-neck junction is readily accessed through standard arthroscopic portals with the hip in 30 to 50° of flexion, the posterolateral, posteromedial, and posterior extent of the femoral head-neck junction are challenging to address. The natural external rotation of the proximal femur during flexion and internal rotation during extension can be used to gain posterior lateral and medial access. Antero/posteromedial femoral access can be obtained with > 50° of hip flexion with the burr in the anteromedial portal. Posterolateral femoral access is achieved with hip extension with the burr in the anterolateral portal, and further posterolateral access can be achieved with the addition of traction, allowing resection of posterolateral deformities extending beyond the lateral retinacular vessels while remaining proximal to the vessels. This comprehensive intraoperative fluoroscopic and dynamic assessment and surgical technique can lead to a predictable correction of most cam-type deformities.

### Favorable outcomes of revision hip arthroscopy irrespective of whether index surgery was performed by the same surgeon or a different surgeon [^111J4bDP]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Arthroscopic treatment for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome with labral débridement or repair has resulted in notable long-term improvements in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and satisfaction. Ganz et alproposed that early surgical intervention for the treatment of FAI may not only relieve symptoms but also decelerate the progression of degenerative processes in young patients. In addition, the effect of arthroscopic intervention on PROs and degenerative changes has been shown to be longitudinal, with excellent long-term survivorship in patients with labral tears and low-grade cartilage damage. However, despite these promising outcomes, failures do occur. Residual or unaddressed structural deformities of the hip, such as cam and pincer morphologies, adhesive capsulitis, unaddressed hip microinstability, and underlying osteoarthritis, are commonly associated with failure after hip arthroscopy.

Hip arthroscopy as a technique in itself has a steep learning curve and with an exponential rise in the number of newly trained surgeons performing this procedure; paved the way for increased primary and revision hip arthroscopies. Novel revision capsulolabral treatment options enabled subsequent arthroscopy in select patients to address pathology that was overlooked or incompletely addressed during the primary surgery. Given the high volume of arthroscopic hip-preserving procedures done annually in the United States, a percentage of patients remain symptomatic with suboptimal PROs. In addition, a notable proportion of active patients attempt to return to sport or activity at their preinjury level, potentially increasing the risk of reinjury. When pain persists or recurs, patients must decide whether they will return to the surgeon who conducted their index surgery or seek a second opinion. Differences in index surgeon come along with differences in surgical technique, and therefore, the decision to labral débridement versus repair versus reconstruction made during the primary procedure. With this in mind, we ventured to explore the outcomes after revision hip arthroscopy in a high-volume setting, to see whether it is possible for patients inherited from outside surgeons to achieve uniform and comparable outcomes with those who chose to undergo their secondary surgery with the same surgeon (SS).

The purpose of this study was to compare minimum 2-year PROs after revision hip arthroscopy in a group who underwent primary hip arthroscopy with labral treatment at the same institution (same surgeon [SS] group) with a cohort who had their primary arthroscopy at an outside institution (different surgeon [DS] group). We hypothesized no difference in clinical outcomes between both groups despite differing intraoperative findings.

### The alpha angle [^1132XQ1g]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is defined by pathological contact between the acetabulum and the femoral head-neck junction -. Articular cartilage damage, acetabular labral tears, and early-onset degenerative changes (in some patients) are potential consequences of this mechanical conflict. FAI can be described in terms of 2 morphologic abnormalities, pincer and cam-type, although patients may present with both (mixed-type FAI). The true prevalence of cam morphology is unclear, with estimates ranging from 5% to 75%, and has variations across age, sex, ethnicity, the presence or absence of symptoms, and activity levels. Cam-type FAI is characterized by asphericity of the femoral head due to an osseous prominence at the femoral head-neck junction. In classic cam-type FAI, the prominent femoral head-neck junction impinges on the acetabular rim, causing damage to the peripheral cartilage and labrum, with movement of the hip joint. However, FAI is a 3-dimensional (3D) deformity; hence, the exact movements causing the most impingement vary by case, according to the anatomical position of the lesion.

FAI syndrome refers to the clinical scenario in which FAI leads to symptoms such as pain, restricted range of motion, and secondary changes to muscle length and tension. This is particularly important when considering the impact of FAI syndrome on quality of life, given the higher prevalence of this condition in the athletic population. Moreover, FAI syndrome carries a substantial economic burden on the individual and societal levels. Evidence consistently demonstrates that early detection and surgical intervention improve outcomes in patients with FAI syndrome and may decelerate the progression to osteoarthritis. Hip arthroscopy is among the most common surgical treatments to alleviate symptoms and restore function in patients with FAI syndrome. Preoperative arthritis reduces the likelihood of benefit from hip arthroscopy in FAI syndrome, with lower postoperative scores and increased risk of conversion to arthroplasty. Hence, early detection and appropriate management of FAI syndrome are critical. Importantly, surgical management should be reserved for carefully selected symptomatic patients, as morphology alone is not a sufficient indication for operative management.

### Prevalence of cam-type femoroacetabular impingement morphology in asymptomatic volunteers [^115mHwrP]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Femoroacetabular impingement is a cause of hip pain in adults and is a possible precursor of osteoarthritis, with the cam type of impingement being the most common. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of cam-type morphology of the hip in asymptomatic patients.

Methods

Two hundred asymptomatic volunteers with no prior hip surgery or childhood hip problems underwent magnetic resonance imaging targeted to both hips. The subjects were examined at the time of magnetic resonance imaging for internal rotation of the hips at 90° of hip flexion and for a positive impingement sign. The contour of the femoral head-neck junction was quantified with use of the alpha angle. A value of > 50.5° was considered positive for cam morphology. Measurements were performed independently by two musculoskeletal radiologists.

Results

The mean age of the individuals was 29.4 years (range, 21.4 to 50.6 years); 79% were white, and 55.5% were women. The mean alpha angle anteriorly at the three o'clock position was 40.9° ± 7.0° on the right and 40.6° ± 7.1° on the left, whereas the mean alpha angle anterosuperiorly at the 1:30 position was 50.2° ± 8.0° on the right and 50.1° ± 8.3° on the left. Fourteen percent of the volunteers had at least one hip with cam morphology: 10.5% had an elevated alpha angle on either the right or the left side, and 3.5% had the deformity in both hips. Seventy-nine percent (twenty-two) of twenty-eight individuals who had an elevated alpha angle were men, and 21% (six) were women. Individuals with an elevated alpha angle on at least one side tended to be male (p < 0.001), with 24.7% (twenty-two) of eighty-nine men having cam morphology compared with only 5.4% (six) of 111 women.

Conclusions

The prevalence of cam-type femoroacetabular impingement deformity is higher in men as well as in individuals with decreased internal rotation. Defining what represents a normal head-neck contour is important for establishing treatment strategies in patients presenting with prearthritic hip pain.

### Patients with lateral and anterolateral cam morphology have greater deformities versus typical anterolateral deformity alone but No differences in postoperative outcomes: a propensity-matched analysis at minimum 5-year follow-up [^113vypsm]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare pre- and postoperative findings between patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome with lateral impingement versus those without lateral impingement METHODS: Patients who underwent primary hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome between 2012 and 2017 with minimum 5-year follow-up were included. Alpha angle (AA) was measured on preoperative anteroposterior (AP) and 90° Dunn radiographs. Patients with AA > 60° on Dunn view but not AP view (no lateral impingement) were propensity matched by sex, age, and body mass index in a 1:3 ratio to patients with AA > 60° on both views (lateral impingement). Demographic characteristics, radiographic and intraoperative findings, reoperation rates, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were compared between groups. Categorical variables were compared using the Fisher exact testing and continuous variable using 2-tailed Student t tests.

Results

Sixty patients with lateral impingement (65.0% female, age: 35.3 ± 13.0 years) were matched to 180 patients without lateral impingement (65.0% female, age: 34.7 ± 12.5 years, P ≥ .279). Patients with lateral impingement had larger preoperative AAs on both Dunn (71.0° ± 8.8° vs 67.6° ± 6.1°, P = 0.001) and AP radiographs (79.0° ± 12.1° vs 48.2° ± 6.5°, P < .001). However, there were no differences in postoperative AAs on either view (Dunn: 39.0° ± 6.1° vs 40.5° ± 5.3°, AP: 45.8° ± 9.0° vs 44.9° ± 7.0°, P ≥ .074). Labral tears began more superiorly in patients with lateral impingement (12:00 ± 0:49 vs 12:17 ± 0:41, P = 0.030), and they demonstrated greater rates of acetabular and femoral cartilage damage (P = 0.030 for both); however, there were no differences in PROs or reoperation rates between the groups at 5-year follow-up.

Conclusions

Although cam deformities located laterally and anterolaterally are larger than those located anterolaterally alone, both can be resected adequately, resulting in similar postoperative radiographic measurements, PROs, and survivorship.

Level Of Evidence

### Contemporary techniques in femoral osteoplasty [^113tPQzf]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Hip arthroscopy has a steep learning curve with femoral osteoplasty being one of the most challenging technical aspects of the procedure. The authors recommend that each surgeon create a methodical system of preoperative templating and intraoperative fluoroscopic evaluation to ensure adequacy of resection and correction of impingement. There have been multiple methods developed to help aid surgeons in intraoperative decision making during cam correction. Using the available techniques may help limit complications and revision arthroscopic procedures, and understanding the nuances and limitations of each method will be paramount for the success of hip arthroscopists when addressing cam morphology. Future studies comparing long-term outcomes of these various resection techniques will be important in guiding our understanding of FAI management.

### Surgical correction of cam deformity in association with femoroacetabular impingement and its impact on the degenerative process within the hip joint [^113mZFjr]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cam morphology in association with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a recognized cause of hip pain and cartilage damage and proposed as a leading cause of arthritis. The purpose of this study was to analyze the functional and biomechanical effects of the surgical correction of the cam deformity on the degenerative process associated with FAI.

Methods

Ten male patients with a mean age of 34.3 years (range, 23.1 to 46.5 years) and a mean body mass index (and standard deviation) of 26.66 ± 4.79 kg/m underwent corrective surgery for cam deformity in association with FAI. Each patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan to assess acetabular bone mineral density (BMD), high-resolution T1ρ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hips to assess proteoglycan content, and squatting motion analysis as well as completed self-administered functional questionnaires (Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [HOOS]) both preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively.

Results

At a mean follow-up of 24.5 months, improvements in functional scores and squat performance were seen. Regarding the zone of impingement in the anterosuperior quadrant of the acetabular rim, the mean change in BMD at the time of follow-up was -31.8 mg/cc (95% confidence interval [CI] -11 to -53 mg/cc) (p = 0.008), representing a 5% decrease in BMD. The anterosuperior quadrant also demonstrated a significant decrease in T1ρ values, reflecting a stabilization of the cartilage degeneration. Significant correlations were noted between changes in clinical functional scores and changes in T1ρ values (r = -0.86; p = 0.003) as well as between the BMD and maximum vertical force (r = 0.878; p = 0.021).

Conclusions

Surgical correction of a cam deformity in patients with symptomatic FAI not only improved clinical function but was also associated with decreases in T1ρ values and BMD. These findings are the first, to our knowledge, to show that alteration of the hip biomechanics through surgical intervention improves the overall health of the hip joint.

### Evaluation of the magnitude and location of cam deformity using three dimensional CT analysis [^115ReTWV]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2014). Low credibility.

The cam-type deformity in femoroacetabular impingement is a 3D deformity. Single measurements using radiographs, CT or MRI may not provide a true estimate of the magnitude of the deformity. We performed an analysis of the size and location of measurements of the alpha angle (α°) using a CT technique which could be applied to the 3D reconstructions of the hip. Analysis was undertaken in 42 patients (57 hips; 24 men and 18 women; mean age 38 years (16 to 58)) who had symptoms of femoroacetabular impingement related to a cam-type abnormality. An α° of > 50° was considered a significant indicator of cam-type impingement. Measurements of the α° were made at different points around the femoral head/neck junction at intervals of 30°: starting at the nine o'clock (posterior), ten, eleven and twelve o'clock (superior), one, two and ending at three o'clock (anterior) position. The mean maximum increased α° was 64.6° (50.8° to 86°). The two o'clock position was the most common point to find an increased α° (53 hips; 93%), followed by one o'clock (48 hips; 84%). The largest α° for each hip was found most frequently at the two o'clock position (46%), followed by the one o'clock position (39%). Generally, raised α angles extend over three segments of the clock face. Single measurements of the α°, whether pre- or post-operative, should be viewed with caution as they may not be representative of the true size of the deformity and not define whether adequate correction has been achieved following surgery.

### Protrusio acetabuli: contraindication or indication for hip arthroscopy? And the case for arthroscopic treatment of global pincer impingement [^112aNBbq]. Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Protrusio acetabuli has been considered a contraindication for hip arthroscopy. We present the case of a 33-year-old man with bilateral symptomatic protrusio acetabuli-the most extreme form of global pincer femoroacetabular impingement-and cam femoroacetabular impingement. We demonstrate the feasibility of the arthroscopic correction of severe deformities and describe key surgical steps permitting central compartment access, subtotal acetabuloplasty, labral reconstruction, and femoroplasty of the right hip, followed by later subtotal acetabuloplasty, labral refixation, and femoroplasty of the left hip, with improved outcomes at 2 and 1 years, respectively, as measured by the nonarthritic hip score. Though challenging, global pincer impingement, even acetabular protrusion, may be successfully treated with dual-portal outpatient hip arthroscopy. The modified midanterior portal enables central compartment access and extended posterior "reach" in the arthroscopic treatment of major global pincer femoroacetabular impingement, potentially making this contraindication a historical one while respectfully challenging the "global" recommendation for open surgery in this setting.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^114HwmED]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) — terminology, epidemiology, and diagnostic approach are defined as follows: The term FAI is used for morphological variation of the acetabulum and/or femoral head relevant to clinical care, whereas FAIS establishes a movement-related disorder with symptoms and clinical findings. Imaging findings of FAI are common in the general population, ranging from 9% to 25% in asymptomatic males and 2% to 10% in asymptomatic females; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment of FAIS should occur in the presence of symptoms and positive clinical signs, in addition to imaging findings of morphological variation. Evidence suggests cam-type morphology results from alterations of the capital femoral epiphysis secondary to repetitive sports-related loading during adolescence, while pincer morphology is associated with global acetabular overcoverage patterns. Familial risk has been reported, with siblings of individuals with cam-type morphology having a 2.8 times increased risk and siblings of patients with pincer morphology having a relative risk (RR) of 2.0 for the same morphology; authors recommended caution in interpreting these findings due to unaccounted environmental factors. Observational and cross-sectional studies report cam morphology with related symptoms more commonly in younger, athletic males, with high prevalence in high-level impact sports, and females in a cohort of soccer athletes displayed smaller cam-type morphologies compared to males.

### Does high level youth sports participation increase the risk of femoroacetabular impingement? A review of the current literature [^114uk8k3]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Femoracetabular impingement (FAI) was first described in 1936 by Smith-Peterson before Ganz et al. in 2003 proposed FAI as an aetiological factor for the development of early osteoarthritis (OA) in non-dysplastic hips. Recent evidence suggests that FAI is not only a cause of premature osteoarthritis but also a cause of hip pain and reduced activity both in young adults and athletically active individuals, including elite athletes.

Femoroacetabular impingement is a condition of abnormal contact between the proximal femur and the acetabulum, secondary to either abnormal bony morphology or excessive range of motion in those with seemingly normal anatomy. The two surfaces do not come into contact in normal physiological range but do so in FAI. FAI can be divided into two major sub-groups — pincer and cam-type deformity, with 50–70% of patients having evidence of both forms of impingement.

In pincer type FAI the pathology is in the acetabulum caused by an increased acetabular depth resulting in acetabular overcoverage (Fig. 1). During hip flexion the femoral head-neck repeatedly abuts the acetabulum. The repeated microtrauma to the anterior acetabular margins causes labral tears and articular cartilage damage, eventually leading to OA. In cam-type FAI the abnormality is an aspherical femoral head as well as reduced cranial offset of the femoral head-neck junction, often secondary to extra bone formation (Fig. 1). Like pincer type FAI, flexion and internal rotation of the hip results in repetitive impingement of the prominent femoral head and acetabulum, leading to labral tearing, cartilage delamination and ultimately OA.

### Primary cam morphology; bump, burden or bog-standard? A concept analysis [^113knAdd]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary cam morphology definition based on five conceptual attributes and how they can be operationalised

We propose primary cam morphology should be defined as a cartilage or bony prominence (bump) of varying size at the femoral head-neck junction of the hip which changes the shape of the femoral head from spherical to aspherical. It often occurs in asymptomatic male athletes in both hips. The most common outcome measure is a cartilage or bone alpha angle as a dichotomised or continuous variable on radiographs, CT scans or MRI, and reported per hip, per person or both (table 2; figure 6).

This definition is based on the five defining attributes of primary cam morphology: (1) tissue type, (2) size, (3) site, (4) shape and (5) ownership. Our concept analysis confirmed inconsistent operational definitions for primary cam morphology; many different imaging modalities and outcome measures were used to report the shape, size and location of cam morphology. The included articles in our concept analysis used different dichotomous and continuous imaging outcome measures to operationalise primary cam morphology on radiographs, DXA scans, CT scans and MRI. Primary cam morphology is a three-dimensional entity with as yet no agreed diagnostic threshold.

The alpha angle is the most common outcome measure reported in the risk factor literature and, despite its limitations, is widely accepted as the best way to operationalise the different primary cam morphology attributes. However, to date, no agreement exists on a diagnostic alpha angle cut-off value, and we doubt a specific alpha angle cut-off value will benefit clinical practice or research. A recent systematic review by van Klij et al suggested a 'diagnostic' alpha angle cut-off value of ≥ 60°. Significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity compromised this systematic review outcome and the authors recommended further research to evaluate whether this threshold is applicable for all imaging modalities and/or views before introducing diagnostic criteria.

Researchers should not dichotomise continuous outcome variables in regression models to investigate aetiology or prognosis — it leads to serious flaws. We agree that alpha angle — as a continuous variable on MRI — should be the gold standard empirical referent in prospective research on how primary cam morphology develops (aetiology), taking into account the radiation risk associated with CT scans and regular radiographs, especially in children. Alpha angles on AP pelvis and lateral radiographs is an acceptable alternative for long-term research on prognosis and in clinical practice.

### Radiographic comparison of surgical hip dislocation and hip arthroscopy for treatment of cam deformity in femoroacetabular impingement [^115MZXVq]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Whether open or arthroscopic techniques are employed, the goal of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) surgery is to achieve impingement-free range of motion. While arthroscopic approaches have improved and gained popularity, an objective evaluation of the surgical correction achieved with this approach compared with open surgery remains to be defined in the literature.

Purpose

This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of arthroscopic osteoplasty and open surgical dislocation in treating FAI dysmorphology in a consecutive series of patients.

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

Surgical treatment was performed in 60 male patients under 40 years of age for symptomatic FAI refractory to nonoperative management. Patients were matched (not randomized) to treatment groups: 30 patients (15 left and 15 right hips) underwent arthroscopic cam and/or rim osteoplasty with labral debridement and/or refixation by an arthroscopic surgeon; and 30 (14 left and 16 right hips) underwent open surgical dislocation, cam and/or rim osteoplasty, and labral debridement or refixation by a hip preservation surgeon. Anteroposterior (AP) pelvis and extended-neck (Dunn) lateral radiographs were obtained and the depth of resection and arc of resection were measured by assessment of anterior femoral head-neck offset, AP and lateral α angle, and β angle on preoperative and postoperative radiographs.

Results

In the arthroscopic group, the extended-neck lateral α angle was reduced by a mean of 17.2° (28.3%, P < .05), AP α angle was reduced by a mean of 12.6° (16.8%), anterior head-neck offset improved 5.0 mm (111%, P < .05), and β angle increased by a mean of 23.1°. In the open dislocation group, the extended-neck lateral α angle was reduced by a mean of 21.2° (30.7%, P < .05), AP α angle was reduced by a mean of 20.1° (25.7%), anterior head-neck offset improved 6.56 mm (108%, P < .05), and β angle increased by a mean of 18.35°.

Conclusion

Arthroscopic osteoplasty can restore head-neck offset and achieve similar depth, arc, and proximal-distal resection with comparable efficacy to open surgical dislocation for anterior and anterosuperior cam and focal rim impingement deformity. The open technique, however, may allow greater correction of posterosuperior loss of femoral offset and may be favorable for FAI patterns that demonstrate considerable proximal femoral deformity on AP radiographs.

### Evaluation of the clinical parameters and kinesiophobia in femoroacetabular impingement syndrome… [^115XjqoV]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of the Clinical Parameters and Kinesiophobia in Femoroacetabular Impingement SyndromeClinicalTrials. gov ID. Symptomatic patients with Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome typically present with pain, primarily in the groin but also potentially in the lower back, hip, and posterior thigh. In addition to pain, patients may complain of a mechanically perceptible 'click' sound, locking sensation, or instability in the hip. Symptoms particularly worsen with activities such as squatting, hip rotation, sitting, climbing stairs, and prolonged sitting. The resulting symptoms lead to a decrease in functional capacities related to physical activities. The radiographic measurements of the FAIS-Cam deformity are typically done using the alpha angle. An angle of 58 degrees or higher is considered abnormal. However, abnormal morphology is not always indicative of a pathological lesion.

A holistic approach, including patient symptoms and a physical examination, is necessary for a comprehensive assessment. In patients with Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome, hip biomechanics notably change during activities such as walking, squatting, and climbing stairs. Due to pain, individuals with FAIS may exhibit protective behaviors, such as keeping the hip in flexion or adopting a Trendelenburg gait to avoid loading forces on the extremity. This situation can lead to kinesiophobia, defined as an exaggerated fear of movement and avoidance behavior based on the belief that movement may lead to injury. In patients with FAIS, it is believed that high levels of kinesiophobia are associated with lower physical function. The participants' sociodemographic information will be recorded using a Sociodemographic Information Form. For pain assessment, the Visual Analog Scale and Algometer will be employed.

Joint range of motion will be measured using the Clinometer mobile application, hip asymmetry will be assessed through the Weight Bearing Asymmetry Test using a scale, movement fear will be gauged using the Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale, and hip dysfunction will be evaluated using the Harris Hip Score. Additionally, the "Sit-to-Stand Test" will be utilized for functional measurement. The alpha angle for patients will be evaluated through pelvic anteroposterior radiography. Participants will be individuals who are not candidates for surgery during the treatment process and will be selected from patients who have not undergone surgery before. The inclusion criteria involve receiving a diagnosis of 'cam' type femoroacetabular impingement syndrome through radiographic and physical examination assessments.

### High prevalence of hip lesions secondary to arthroscopic over-or undercorrection of femoroacetabular impingement in patients with postoperative pain [^1178fpqH]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recent years have led to an exponential increase in the number of hip arthroscopies performed for treatment of osseous deformities and intra-articular lesions secondary to femoroacetabular impingement. This development has been fostered by innovations in surgical techniques, improved preoperative imaging, and the widely reported short- to long-term benefit of FAI surgery. Despite the favorbale surgical outcome of FAI correction up to 18% of patients present with postoperative pain and up to 10% reportedly undergo revision surgery within 2 years. These patients are exposed to a substantially higher risk for worse surgical outcome following revision surgery than patients who do not require further surgical treatment. Further cross-sectional imaging is commonly recommended to diagnose deformities resulting from surgical over- or undercorrection such as residual cam deformities and intra-articular lesions. However, imaging assessment is challenging in the setting of postoperative hip pain due to the difficulties in identifying the relevant osseous deformities and differentiating normal postoperative findings from relevant pathology.

Currently, few studies have assessed the prevalence of osseous deformities following arthroscopic FAI surgery with cross-sectional imaging. MR arthrography has been used in the setting of postoperative hip pain to detect recurrent labrum lesions, cartilage damage, and capsular lesions. However, to date, the prevalence of osseous deformities and intra-articular lesions including their potential association following failed hip arthroscopy is unclear which would provide useful information for treatment planning.

Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of osseous deformities and intra-articular lesions in patients with persistent pain following arthroscopic FAI correction between pre- and postoperative imaging and to identify imaging findings associated with progressive cartilage damage and postoperative labrum lesions.

### The cam-type deformity – what is it: SCFE, osteophyte, or a new disease? [^111XgUmr]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2013). Low credibility.

Cam-type deformity of the proximal femur is a risk factor for the development of cam-type femoroacetabular impingement and a prearthrotic condition of the hip. The etiology of cam-type deformity remains unclear. There are a number of causes of cam-type deformity including sequellae of slipped capital femoral epiphysis, Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease or Perthes-like deformities, postinfectious, and traumatic. However, the majority of cam-type deformities arise without any apparent preexisting hip disease. These "idiopathic" cam-type deformities likely represent a majority of cases, and show clear racial and sex differences, as well as developmental and genetic influences. Idiopathic cam-type deformity also seems to be a distinct entity from residual or silent slipped capital femoral epiphysis, as well as osteoarthritis-induced osteophytes. In this paper we examine the different pathogenetic aspects of the proximal femur that contribute to cam-type deformity and/or symptomatic cam-type femoroacetabular impingement.

### Personalised hip therapy: development of a non-operative protocol to treat femoroacetabular impingement syndrome in the FASHIoN randomised controlled trial [^114xWbEf]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome is a motion-related clinical hip disorder with a triad of symptoms, clinical signs and imaging findings. It represents a symptomatic premature contact between the proximal femur and the acetabulum. Typically, the morphology of the hip exhibits shapes that predispose to impingement, often described with the terms cam and pincer morphology. The epidemiology of cam and pincer morphology is not well defined but may be present in 30% of the general population. Not all patients with cam and/or pincer morphology develop FAI syndrome, but the treatment of those who do is controversial. Over the past 10 years, increasing numbers of patients have been treated for FAI syndrome with shape changing surgery, most frequently through hip arthroscopy. Surgery has been shown to provide improvements in patient symptoms, although patient expectations are not always met.

It has been suggested that clinicians should be cautious in the use of surgery for FAI syndrome and that non-operative approaches should be considered. Patients with FAI syndrome have altered hip muscle strength, range of motion (ROM) and gait biomechanics, and these offer potential targets for treatment through physiotherapy. While many authors recognise the likely value of non-operative or conservative care, there is very little published guidance and evidence on how this care should be delivered.

Given the uncertainty and lack of evidence about treatment for FAI syndrome, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing hip arthroscopy and conservative care was proposed to guide future practice. In 2012, the UK National Institute of Health Research (UK NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme (HTA) commissioned us to perform a feasibility and pilot study for an RCT to compare hip arthroscopy with 'best conservative care' for patients with FAI syndrome (FASHIoN HTA10/41/02). At the time, there was no established 'best conservative care', and we are not aware of any that has been published since. To design this trial, we needed to develop a suitable conservative care protocol.

The aim of this study was to develop an agreed conservative treatment protocol for patients with FAI syndrome that was deliverable within the UK National Health Service (NHS), was safe, and that could be used in the planned RCT.

### Does the femoral cam lesion regrow after osteoplasty for femoroacetabular impingement? Two-year follow-up [^1119k862]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There are currently no studies that have examined the recurrence of the cam lesion after femoral neck osteoplasty for femoroacetabular impingement. Although patient-reported outcome (PRO) scores at midterm follow-up have shown continued success, the maintenance of a normalized alpha angle has not been shown radiographically.

Purpose

To assess the radiographic recurrence of cam deformity at 2-year follow-up after adequate decompression during the index hip arthroscopic procedure and correlate the findings with PRO scores. The hypothesis was that there would be no recurrence or regrowth of the cam deformity at the 2-year postoperative time point after adequate cam decompression during hip arthroscopic surgery.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

Between March 2009 and January 2011, data were prospectively collected on all patients undergoing hip arthroscopic surgery with femoral neck osteoplasty. Minimum follow-up was 2 years, with radiographic images for review.

Results

A total of 47 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the participants at the start of the study was 37.18 years (range, 31.70–47.43 years). There were 28 men (59.57%) and 19 women (40.43%). The mean follow-up duration was 28.32 months (range, 24–41 months). The mean preoperative alpha angle (Dunn view) was 70° (range, 60°-97°), compared with 42.79° (range, 32°-50°) at 2 weeks postoperatively (P < .0001). The mean 2-year alpha angle was 42.72° (range, 32°-54°), which was not significantly different compared with the mean 2-week alpha angle (P = 0.93). Additionally, the mean femoral offset measurement was 3.7 mm (range, 0–9.9 mm) preoperatively and 7.8 mm (range, 0.3–13.9 mm) 2 weeks postoperatively (P < .0001). The mean 2-year postoperative femoral offset measurement was 8.0 mm (range, 2.4–12.8 mm), which was not significantly different compared with the mean 2-week femoral offset measurement (P = 0.63). All PRO scores were significantly improved at 3 months compared with preoperative scores and, except for visual analog scale score, continued to show improvement at 2-year follow-up.

Conclusion

There was no recurrence of cam deformity at 2 years after femoral neck osteoplasty for femoroacetabular impingement. PRO scores were improved at the 3-month and 2-year postoperative time points.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 2-research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip [^114WbYK5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The panel prioritised studies to determine best criteria for rehabilitation progression and RTS following management of hip-related pain. Such a study recently investigated RTS after criteria-based rehabilitation for acute adductor injuries.RTS is complex, sport-specific, multifactorial (depending, eg, on the intervention) and an exercise in risk management. The Delphi panel emphasised six considerations for rehabilitation and RTS studies, including (1) athlete expectations, (2) intervention quality, (3) career stage, (4) type of sport, (5) athlete contract status, and (6) athlete support structures.

The panel prioritised studies to investigate the role of exercise intervention (load management) on the development and prognosis of (1) FAI syndrome and (2) primary cam morphology. This should involve different demographic and load cohorts and include studies to develop and validate diagnostic and prognostic models for primary cam morphology in young athletes. While these studies should involve different sport, dance and physical activity cohorts, the panel highlighted the importance of prioritising prospective research in girls'/women's sport. To date, few prospective cohort studies investigated how [primary] cam morphology develops in athletes. However, none involved girls/women athletes, and only one involved a control group. Finally, load intervention studies involving maturing athletes are easier said than done; they 'may be unwilling to reduce participation in their preferred sport'.

Diagnostic criteria for cam and pincer morphology are contested. The results of a recent systematic review to determine the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for cam or pincer morphology in individuals with suspected FAI syndrome were inconclusive due to high risk of bias and low statistical precision of included studies. There is to date no agreement on a radiographic definition of cam or pincer morphology. This Delphi panel agreed that an alpha angle threshold of ≥ 60 degrees to classify cam morphology (Oxford consensus study, part 1), recently proposed in a systematic reviewand another consensus, is appropriate; however, further research should verify this.

Screening for primary cam morphology is contentious. The panel acknowledged the risk of harm — overdiagnosis and overtreatment — of 'a normal finding', prevalent in many athletes. Screening might benefit 'a small percentage of those with primary cam morphology who go on to develop significant hip problems later in life', offering them 'preventative support at an earlier stage'. The WHO's Wilson-Junger criteria should inform whether screening is appropriate or not.

### Increased hip stresses resulting from a cam deformity and decreased femoral neck-shaft angle during level walking [^115HMzSq]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

It is still unclear why many individuals with a cam morphology of the hip do not experience pain. It was recently reported that a decreased femoral neck-shaft angle may also be associated with hip symptoms. However, the effects that different femoral neck-shaft angles have on hip stresses in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals with cam morphology remain unclear.

Questions/Purposes

We examined the effects of the cam morphology and femoral neck-shaft angle on hip stresses during walking by asking: (1) Are there differences in hip stress characteristics among symptomatic patients with cam morphology, asymptomatic individuals with cam morphology, and individuals without cam morphology? (2) What are the effects of high and low femoral neck-shaft angles on hip stresses?

Methods

Six participants were selected, from a larger cohort, and their cam morphology and femoral neck-shaft angle parameters were measured from CT data. Two participants were included in one of three groups: (1) symptomatic with cam morphology; (2) asymptomatic with a cam morphology; and (3) asymptomatic control with no cam morphology with one participant having the highest femoral neck-shaft angle and the other participant having the lowest in each subgroup. Subject-specific finite element models were reconstructed and simulated during the stance phase, near pushoff, to examine maximum shear stresses on the acetabular cartilage and labrum.

Results

The symptomatic group with cam morphology indicated high peak stresses (6.3–9.5 MPa) compared with the asymptomatic (5.9–7.0 MPa) and control groups (3.8–4.0 MPa). Differences in femoral neck-shaft angle influenced both symptomatic and asymptomatic groups; participants with the lowest femoral neck-shaft angles had higher peak stresses in their respective subgroups. There were no differences among control models.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that the hips of individuals with a cam morphology and varus femoral neck angle may be subjected to higher mechanical stresses than those with a normal femoral neck angle.

Clinical Relevance

Individuals with a cam morphology and decreased femoral neck-shaft angle are likely to experience severe hip stresses. Although asymptomatic participants with cam morphology had elevated stresses, a higher femoral neck-shaft angle was associated with lower stresses. Future research should examine larger amplitudes of motion to assess adverse subchondral bone stresses.

### Optimal treatment of cam morphology may change the natural history of femoroacetabular impingement [^113pvz8C]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There is debate in the literature whether cam morphology is associated with increased risk for hip osteoarthritis. The capability of femoroplasty to alter the natural history of cam morphology is still in question.

Purpose

To (1) investigate the correlation between cam morphology and damage to the articular cartilage and (2) assess whether correction of the cam morphology affects survivorship of the joint, progression to arthroplasty, and functional patient-reported outcome scores.

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

Data were prospectively collected for patients presenting for hip arthroscopy between February 2008 and April 2017. Cases were divided into 3 groups: control group with an alpha angle < 50° pre- and postoperatively, treated group with an alpha angle > 55° preoperatively and < 50° postoperatively, and a group with an alpha angle > 55° pre- and postoperatively. All patients had minimum 2-year postoperative follow-up for the modified Harris Hip Score, the Non-arthritic Hip Score, and visual analog scale for pain. Conversion to total hip arthroplasty was recorded.

Results

A 1:1:1 match successfully yielded 98 hips for each group. Follow-up time was 50.77 ± 24.60 months (mean ± SD). The pre- and postoperative mean alpha angles were 45.2° ± 3.4° and 40.6° ± 4.3° in the control group, respectively; 66.2° ± 8.4° and 42.3° ± 5.9° in the treated group; and 68.5° ± 9.4° and 61.4° ± 7.6° in the alpha > 55° group. Intraoperatively, the alpha > 55° and treated groups had greater acetabular cartilage damage than the control group (P = 0.0245 and P = 0.0036, acetabular labrum articular disruption, respectively; p = 0.0347 and P = 0.0211, acetabular Outerbridge). The alpha > 55° group achieved the patient acceptable symptomatic state for the modified Harris Hip Score (58.2%) significantly less than the treated (75.5%; p = 0.0100) and control (73.5%; p = 0.0239) groups. Progression to arthroplasty was significantly higher in the alpha > 55° group (n = 17) when compared with the control (n = 8) and treated (n = 10) groups (P = 0.0034 and P = 0.0338, respectively).

Conclusion

Cam deformity was associated with higher-grade damage of the acetabular articular cartilage. An alpha angle > 55° after surgery was associated with lower native hip joint survivability and less successful functional outcomes when compared with that of treated cam deformity as well as no deformity. These data suggest that correcting the cam deformity may positively affect the natural history of these patients.

### The effect of the cam deformity on the insertion of the femoral component in hip resurfacing [^116xU4Zc]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2011). Low credibility.

Surface arthroplasty simulations were generated using 3-dimensional computed tomographic scans from 61 consecutive patients presenting with idiopathic osteoarthritis to evaluate the change in femoral component positioning that would allow optimal alignment when resurfacing a cam-type deformity. Anatomical parameters were measured to quantify the influence of the deformity on the insertion technique of the femoral implant. A modified femoral head ratio was initially calculated from plain radiographs to define the severity of cam deformity in these patients. A severe deformity required more superior translation of the entry point and greater reaming depth to allow safe insertion with optimal implant alignment. This could be achieved while preserving the leg length, minimizing the component size, and maximizing the amount of host bone contact, although the horizontal femoral offset was reduced. These findings suggest that the femoral component can be safely inserted by modifying the surgical technique despite progressive deformity of the femoral head.

### Intraoperative fluoroscopic imaging to treat cam deformities: correlation with 3-dimensional computed tomography [^117LSGjN]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In the diagnosis and surgical treatment of cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), 3-dimensional (3D) imaging is the gold standard for detecting femoral head-neck junction malformations preoperatively. Intraoperative fluoroscopy is used by many surgeons to evaluate and verify adequate correction of the deformity.

Purpose

(1) To compare radial reformatted computed tomography (CT) scans with 6 defined intraoperative fluoroscopic views before surgical correction to determine whether fluoroscopy could adequately depict cam deformity, and (2) to define the influence of femoral version on the clock-face location of the maximum cam deformity on these views.

Study Design

Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2.

Methods

A consecutive series of 50 hips (48 patients) that underwent arthroscopic treatment for symptomatic FAI by a single surgeon were analyzed. Each patient underwent a CT scan and 6 consistent intraoperative fluoroscopy views: 3 views in hip extension and 3 views in hip flexion of 50°. The alpha angles of each of the fluoroscopic images were compared with the radial reformatted CT using a 3D software program. Femoral version was also defined on CT studies. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student t test, with P < .05 defined as significant.

Results

Fifty-two percent of patients were male, average age 28 years (range, 15–56 years). The maximum mean alpha angle on fluoroscopy was 65° (range, 37°-93°) and was located on the anteroposterior (AP) 30° external rotation (ER) fluoroscopy view. In comparison, the mean CT-derived maximum alpha angle was 67° and was located at 1:15 (P = 0.57). The mean clock-face positions of each of the fluoroscopy views (standardized to the right hip) were AP 30° internal rotation, 11:45; AP 0° (neutral) rotation, 12:30; AP 30° ER, 1:00; flexion/0° (neutral) rotation, 1:45; flexion/40° ER, 2:15; and flexion/60° ER, 2:45. Increased femoral anteversion (> 20°) was associated with a significant change in the location of the maximum alpha angle (1:45 vs 1:15; p = 0.002).

Conclusion

The described 6 fluoroscopic views are very helpful in localization and visualization of the typical cam deformity from 11:45 to 2:45 and can be used to reliably confirm a complete intraoperative resection of cam-type deformity in most patients. These views correlate with preoperative 3D imaging and may be of even greater importance in the absence of preoperative 3D imaging.

### Which two-dimensional radiographic measurements of cam femoroacetabular impingement best describe the three-dimensional shape of the proximal femur? [^116HzYiR]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Many two-dimensional (2-D) radiographic views are used to help diagnose cam femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), but there is little consensus as to which view or combination of views is most effective at visualizing the magnitude and extent of the cam lesion (ie, severity). Previous studies have used a single image from a sequence of CT or MR images to serve as a reference standard with which to evaluate the ability of 2-D radiographic views and associated measurements to describe the severity of the cam lesion. However, single images from CT or MRI data may fail to capture the apex of the cam lesion. Thus, it may be more appropriate to use measurements of three-dimensional (3-D) surface reconstructions from CT or MRI data to serve as an anatomic reference standard when evaluating radiographic views and associated measurements used in the diagnosis of cam FAI.

Questions/Purposes

The purpose of this study was to use digitally reconstructed radiographs and 3-D statistical shape modeling to (1) determine the correlation between 2-D radiographic measurements of cam FAI and 3-D metrics of proximal femoral shape; and 2) identify the combination of radiographic measurements from plain film projections that were most effective at predicting the 3-D shape of the proximal femur.

Methods

This study leveraged previously acquired CT images of the femur from a convenience sample of 37 patients (34 males; mean age, 27 years, range, 16–47 years; mean body mass index [BMI], 24.6 kg/m, range, 19.0–30.2 kg/m) diagnosed with cam FAI imaged between February 2005 and January 2016. Patients were diagnosed with cam FAI based on a culmination of clinical examinations, history of hip pain, and imaging findings. The control group consisted of 59 morphologically normal control participants (36 males; mean age, 29 years, range, 15–55 years; mean BMI, 24.4 kg/m, range, 16.3–38.6 kg/m) imaged between April 2008 and September 2014. Of these controls, 30 were cadaveric femurs and 29 were living participants. All controls were screened for evidence of femoral deformities using radiographs. In addition, living control participants had no history of hip pain or previous surgery to the hip or lower limbs. CT images were acquired for each participant and the surface of the proximal femur was segmented and reconstructed. Surfaces were input to our statistical shape modeling pipeline, which objectively calculated 3-D shape scores that described the overall shape of the entire proximal femur and of the region of the femur where the cam lesion is typically located. Digital reconstructions for eight plain film views (AP, Meyer lateral, 45° Dunn, modified 45° Dunn, frog-leg lateral, Espié frog-leg, 90° Dunn, and cross-table lateral) were generated from CT data. For each view, measurements of the α angle and head-neck offset were obtained by two researchers (intraobserver correlation coefficients of 0.80–0.94 for the α angle and 0.42–0.80 for the head-neck offset measurements). The relationships between radiographic measurements from each view and the 3-D shape scores (for the entire proximal femur and for the region specific to the cam lesion) were assessed with linear correlation. Additionally, partial least squares regression was used to determine which combination of views and measurements was the most effective at predicting 3-D shape scores.

Results

Three-dimensional shape scores were most strongly correlated with α angle on the cross-table view when considering the entire proximal femur (r = -0.568; p < 0.001) and on the Meyer lateral view when considering the region of the cam lesion (r = -0.669; p < 0.001). Partial least squares regression demonstrated that measurements from the Meyer lateral and 90° Dunn radiographs produced the optimized regression model for predicting shape scores for the proximal femur (R = 0.405, root mean squared error of prediction [RMSEP] = 1.549) and the region of the cam lesion (R = 0.525, RMSEP = 1.150). Interestingly, views with larger differences in the α angle and head-neck offset between control and cam FAI groups did not have the strongest correlations with 3-D shape.

Conclusions

Considered together, radiographic measurements from the Meyer lateral and 90° Dunn views provided the most effective predictions of 3-D shape of the proximal femur and the region of the cam lesion as determined using shape modeling metrics.

Clinical Relevance

Our results suggest that clinicians should consider using the Meyer lateral and 90° Dunn views to evaluate patients in whom cam FAI is suspected. However, the α angle and head-neck offset measurements from these and other plain film views could describe no more than half of the overall variation in the shape of the proximal femur and cam lesion. Thus, caution should be exercised when evaluating femoral head anatomy using the α angle and head-neck offset measurements from plain film radiographs. Given these findings, we believe there is merit in pursuing research that aims to develop the framework necessary to integrate statistical shape modeling into clinical evaluation, because this could aid in the diagnosis of cam FAI.

### Cam morphology but neither acetabular dysplasia nor pincer morphology is associated with osteophytosis throughout the hip: findings from a cross-sectional study in UK biobank [^116oFjRB]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hip osteoarthritis (OA) is a common condition that causes considerable morbidity often leading to costly total hip replacements (THR). Differences in hip morphology have long been postulated as risk factors, including acetabular dysplasia (AD), and cam and pincer morphologies. AD is associated with under-coverage of the acetabulum over the femoral head and is considered a consequence of milder forms of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Severe DDH is strongly associated with hip OA whereas AD shows inconsistent associations. Cam morphology, which represents bulging of the lateral femoral head leading to an aspherical appearance, and pincer morphology, comprising increased coverage of the acetabulum over the femoral head, both have been suggested to cause OA via femoro-acetabular impingement (FAI). The biomechanical concept of aberrant forces due to impingement of the superolateral femoral head on the lateral acetabulum during hip movement in particular flexion, abduction and internal rotation.

An individual's hip morphology develops through gestation, childhood and adolescence well before the onset of OA. Genetic loci have been associated with different hip morphologies including DDH indicating a genetic predisposition. Observational studies suggest cam morphology forms in adolescence when the metaphysis fuses, with increased physical activity implicated as a risk factor. FAI syndrome is recognised as a cause of hip pain in younger individuals, diagnosis of which is supported by relevant examination findings and either cam and/or pincer morphologies in the absence of OA. Several studies suggest that surgery to correct the hip morphologies implicated in FAI improves symptoms such as pain. Conceivably, surgery to correct these hip morphologies and prevent FAI might also prove useful in reducing the risk of developing OA. However, whether FAI is a risk factor for hip OA in the general population remains unclear. Whereas cam morphology is associated with an increased risk of radiographic hip OA (rHOA) and THR, pincer morphology does not appear to be a risk factor for hip OA. FAI has been proposed to cause hip OA in patients with cam and/or pincer morphologies secondary to impingementbut as yet the precise mechanism remains unclear. A systematic review showed labral deformities are associated with cam morphology but the authors concluded causality could not be inferred from the studies. No population studies have explored the distribution of osteophytes in individuals with these shape morphologies, which might give some indication as to any underlying biomechanical disturbance.

### Editorial commentary: comprehensive treatment of hip acetabular dysplasia plus labral and / or cam pathology with combined periacetabular osteotomy and hip arthroscopy [^1159gK9C]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) is the agreed-upon treatment for symptomatic hip dysplasia in the skeletally mature patient. Many surgeons perform hip arthroscopy to address intra-articular damage around the time of the PAO. Other surgeons believe that correcting the dysplasia with the PAO unloads the soft tissues, which negates the need for arthroscopy. Current evidence is unclear as to whether hip arthroscopy, whether concomitant or staged, is needed when performing PAO for hip dysplasia. In the United States, the chosen approach often is determined by surgeon training, comfort level, and logistical issues. Over time, the chosen approach may change, as more surgeons are trained in both open and arthroscopic hip preservation. Certainly, some patients benefit from hip arthroscopy along with PAO for labral pathology and/or femoral cam deformity.

### Does the type of sport influence morphology of the hip? A systematic review [^1137oBSa]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Other Factors Influencing Cam Development

Intense exercise from a young age places increased stresses on the hip joint, and repetitive microtrauma associated with sport predisposes athletes to hip pathology that would not exist or remain asymptomatic otherwise. Tak et alfound a significant dose-response relationship between the frequency of training among adolescent soccer players and the development of cam, supporting the notion that high-impact activity during skeletal immaturity can lead to cam development. The prevalence of cam was significantly lower in soccer players playing for an amateur club from the age of 12 years onward than those who started playing for a professional club before 12 years (P = 0.042). In the same age groups, a significant difference in the prevalence of a pathological cam deformity was found (alpha angle > 78°) (P = 0.038). However, there was no statistical significance between the age at which athletes started playing soccer and the prevalence of FAI in athletes competing at the same level (P = 0.1). This suggests that the frequency and intensity of training could have a greater effect on the development of FAI than the age at which training began.

A significant positive correlation between age and alpha angle has, however, been identified in ice hockey players throughout adolescence. Philippon et alfound that 37% of peewee players, 63% of bantam players, and 93% of midget players had alpha angles ≥ 55°. In fact, ice hockey players in the midget group (16–19 years) were 36 times more likely than skiers to have an alpha angle > 55° (Table 4). Agricola et alshowed that cam develops during skeletal immaturity in soccer players and likely remains stable after. As age increases, so does the cumulative duration of training and skill level, implying that age, frequency, duration, and level of training all correlate with alpha angle and cam morphology.

Finally, it was interesting to observe an ethnic difference in the prevalence of cam deformity across athletes competing in the same sport at the same level. While it is impossible in this observational study to control the activity in adolescence exactly, this points to a role of genetic factors in the development of cam deformity. Indeed, Pollard et alnoted an increased prevalence of cam deformity in the siblings of those treated for FAI.

Although the relative contributions of these disease-modifying factors still must be established, early screening in those at risk will allow for preventive strategies to be developed, thereby promoting joint and sporting longevity.

### Hip joint torsional loading before and after cam femoroacetabular impingement surgery [^116696vN]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To avoid suboptimal clinical outcomes and potential iatrogenic instability, it is imperative to understand the effects of hip preservation surgery. Surgical injury to the soft tissues must be minimized to ensure that athletes can return to competition quickly and safely. This was the first study to use cadaveric hips with cam morphologic features to investigate the effects of the stages of hip preservation surgery for cam FAI (ie, capsulotomy, cam resection, capsular repair) on functional range of motion and resistance to applied torsional load. The most important finding in this study was that although the capsulotomy procedure was responsible for substantial overall changes in joint restraint, the cam deformity was responsible for 21% to 27% of the intact torsional resistance in flexion and internal rotation. Therefore, surgical cam resection would remove this load at the chondrolabral junction.

During load control testing (ie, changes in range of motion), external rotation increased substantially for all hip positions after the capsulotomy stage, which was comparable with findings of previous biomechanical studies that examined healthy control hips. During hip extension, cam resections did not affect range of motion or torque restraint, which suggests that any limited mobility at hip extension may be due to other pathoanatomic characteristics. However, resecting the cam deformity increased internal rotation compared with the intact case at the flexion 90° and FADIR positions, supporting the theory that removing the deformity would improve range of motion. It was important to examine changes in motion and torsional resistance after the capsulotomy stage and then again after the cam resection stage, as this isolated the contributions of the cam deformity and provided the amount of residual capsular restraint. We conducted the study in a stepwise manner, collecting the data of the intact hip before the capsulotomy, after the capsulotomy procedure (before the cam deformity was removed), and then after the cam deformity was removed. By doing so, we were able to observe the effects of the capsulotomy-only approach and, subsequently, were able to isolate the contributions of the cam morphologic feature toward internal and external rotational resistance. Interestingly, external rotational motion and torques were unaffected after the cam resections and did not change in FABER. This contradicts earlier suggestions that Drehmann sign or FABER tests can indicate cam FAI. Rather, this suggests that during physical examination, FABER can help indicate capsular tightness and soft tissue irritations (eg, due to psoas or iliocapsularis impairment) secondary to the cam deformitybut not directly for cam FAI.

### Validity of the alpha angle measurement on plain radiographs in the evaluation of cam-type femoroacetabular impingement [^116KnwQU]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Cam-type femoroacetabular impingement is secondary to lack of concavity at the anterosuperior femoral head-neck junction, resulting in reduced femoral head-neck offset and femoral head asphericity. This morphologic deformity can be detected by MRI and plain radiographs and quantified using the alpha angle.

Questions/Purposes

We evaluated the accuracy and reproducibility of plain radiography in the diagnosis of cam-type deformity.

Methods

Sixty-eight patients (37 females, 31 males) with a mean age of 38 years (range, 17–60 years) were treated for intraarticular hip pathology with 43 hips having cam-type femoroacetabular impingement and 25 having isolated labral tears. All patients had alpha angle measurements made on plain radiographs (AP pelvis, crosstable lateral, Dunn view) and multiplanar MRI using an alpha angle of more than 50.5° as the gold standard.

Results

The Dunn view had a sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 88%, positive predictive value of 93%, negative predictive value of 84%, and accuracy of 90% for diagnosing the cam deformity associated with femoroacetabular impingement. The Pearson correlation coefficients between the MRI and plain radiography values were 0.702, 0.552, and 0.349 for the Dunn, crosstable lateral, and AP views, respectively.

Conclusions

Our observations validate the clinical use of the Dunn view in the evaluation of the femoral head-neck contour in cam-type femoroacetabular impingement.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 2-research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip [^116LA3yH]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

An international Delphi panel of expert clinicians, athletes, patients and their representatives, and researchers — representing the YAHiR Collaborative — agreed on set of research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip focusing on primary cam morphology and its natural history, reported here following REPRISE guidelines. They outlined seven research domains: (1) best practice physiotherapy, (2) rehabilitation progression and RTS, (3) exercise intervention and load management, (4) primary cam morphology aetiology and prognosis, (5) FAI syndrome aetiology and prognosis, (6) diagnostic criteria, and (7) screening. This consensus serves as a roadmap for researchers, policy-makers and funders to prioritise research dedicated to reducing the cost and burden of conditions affecting the young person's hip, including hip disease related to primary cam morphology.

In what follows, we discuss the Delphi panel's opinions on a prioritised research agenda and summarise how agreement and areas of tension and dissent might inform future work — a more rigorous, inclusive and evidence-based approach to research on primary cam morphology and its natural history. This consensus builds on recent consensus statementsand a primary cam morphology concept analysisand consensus (Oxford consensus study, part 1).

Best practice physiotherapy is central to the treatment of hip-related pain in active adults, crucial to the understanding of effective treatment options for FAI syndrome, yet elusive and contested. The panel recommended research to (1) clarify what best practice physiotherapy is, (2) illuminate how it influences FAI syndrome prognosis and (3) reinvestigate its position as an effective treatment option compared with hip arthroscopy in patients with hip-related pain. First, practitioners and patients are confused by an elusive definition for best practice physiotherapy. A recent consensus on physiotherapist-led treatment for young to middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain recommended treatments that are exercise-based of at least 3 months duration and recommended further research to investigate optimal frequency, intensity, time, type, volume and progression of exercise therapy. Second, heterogeneous physiotherapist-led interventions might improve pain and function when compared with other non-surgical treatments or sham treatments in young and middle-aged adults with hip-related pain (including FAI syndrome); however, no high-quality trials exist to cement its superiority. Finally, the only three RCTs comparing hip arthroscopy with prescribed physiotherapywere compromised by out-of-date exercise therapy programmes. New trials should do better.

### Editorial commentary: navigating the cam: balancing precision, cost, and patient-reported outcomes for computer-assisted femoral resections [^111UixD6]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Accurate correction of cam or combined deformities in femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is essential, as under- and over-resection can lead to complications and inferior patient-reported outcomes. Yet consistent visualization and complete resection remain challenging, with under-resection being a leading cause of revision surgery. Computer-assisted navigation (CAN) in hip arthroscopy offers the potential to improve accuracy and reduce variability. Recent studies show improved adherence to preoperative plans, reduced residual impingement, and favorable short-term functional scores. However, long-term, patient-centered outcomes remain unknown, and there is limited evidence for improved clinical outcomes compared to traditional freehand fluoroscopic techniques. Drawbacks, including longer operative time and increased system cost, may limit efficiency and raise cost-effectiveness concerns. Larger, prospective studies with extended follow-up are needed to clarify CAN's true clinical impact and identify the settings in which it may provide maximal benefit.

### Do osteochondroplasty alone, intertrochanteric derotation osteotomy, and flexion-derotation osteotomy improve hip flexion and internal rotation to normal range in hips with severe SCFE? – A 3D-CT simulation study [^112TZXdD]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

Hip arthroscopy is the mainstay of surgical treatment of cam-type FAI, and the role of arthroscopic cam resection of the femoral head-neck junction has been expanded to the treatment of symptomatic residual deformity associated with SCFE.–However, arthroscopic treatment may be limited to restoring the normal range of motion in hips with severe SCFE. Several femoral osteotomies have been described to improve the alignment of the proximal femur in hips with residual deformity due to severe SCFE, including the Imhauser flexion-derotational intertrochanteric osteotomy, the Southwick triplane proximal osteotomy, an osteotomy at the base of the femoral neck, the femoral neck closing wedge osteotomy according to Dunnand Fish, a simple diaphyseal derotation osteotomy with intramedullary fixation. More recently, the modified Dunn procedure using the surgical hip dislocation approach has gained popularity because of the possible complete restoration of the proximal femoral anatomy and improved outcomes.–However, this procedure is not widely available, and indications are discussed controversially. Therefore, proximal femoral osteotomies still play an important role in treatment. Nevertheless, independent of the treatment used, deformity correction of severe SCFE is challenging due to its 3-dimensional complexity.–Although 2-dimensional radiographs are used to diagnose SCFE, the head-neck angle measurement, and SCFE classification are affected by the patient's position, and radiographs do not allow for a comprehensive deformity analysis. Previous studies have described the application of 3D-CT for surgical planning. However, its application remains restricted due to radiation exposure.

This study investigates the improvement of impingement-free motion following a simulated osteochondroplasty, a derotation-osteotomy, and a combined flexion-derotation osteotomy in hips with untreated severe SCFE using 3D-CT and collision detection software.

### Hip pain in young adults: femoroacetabular impingement [^116Dvd6P]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2007). Low credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement is a more recently noticed cause of hip pain in young patients, and early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent development of osteoarthritis and/or delay the need for a more radical treatment option such as arthroplasty surgery. Two general types of femoroacetabular impingement have been described. In the cam impingement, the femoral deformity, usually a bump on the head-and-neck junction, impinges on the acetabular rim. The pincer type of impingement is caused by the deformity on the acetabular side, which may be a deep socket, or an acetabular overcoverage due to retroversion that creates an obstacle for flexion and internal rotation. This article attempts to examine the underlying pathogenesis and discusses diagnostic and treatment modalities.

### Hip joint torsional loading before and after cam femoroacetabular impingement surgery [^113NTNEr]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Our study had certain limitations to note. First, our cohort consisted of young male specimens, which made it difficult to compare our study with previous cadaveric studies that examined older specimens. However, the cam deformity is more prevalent in younger males, and thus our cohort may be the most representative of cam FAI and capsular joint mechanics using in vitro cadaveric methods. We included 12 hips in our study, which was higher than many previous acceptable sample sizes that tested cadaveric hip specimens (n = 3–10 hips). However, including female specimens would further stratify the effect of anatomic structures on the pathological variances in joint mechanics, and a larger sample size would further increase the predictive power of the statistical models. Second, muscles were not included in the experiments, as we focused on the contributions of the bony deformity and capsular ligament to torque restraint and range of motion. As muscles provide a balance of passive and dynamic joint torque and stability, it would be important to further examine the effects of the surrounding muscles on microinstability. Third, it was not known whether the individuals who provided their hips for this study experienced any clinical symptoms of FAI that would have qualified them as candidates for hip preservation surgery. Interestingly, from the anatomic measurements, 1 hip had a small femoral neck-shaft angle (121°) and 4 hips had larger spinopelvic incidence angles (61°-76°), which were anatomic characteristics associated with symptomatic cam FAI (secondary to the cam deformity). All lateral iliofemoral ligaments were also relatively thick, as measured after the capsulotomy. This finding coincided with previous imaging studies that found thicker anterosuperior capsules in symptomatic cam FAI, and suggested that our cohort was representative of individuals at risk of symptoms. Fourth, we performed the T-capsulotomy instead of an interportal-only capsulotomy. As our specimens were male hips with large cam morphology, the T-capsulotomy provided greater visualization and access to the joint space. Our interportal and vertical limb incisions were conservative, in comparison with conventional practice, and were more similar to a half-T. Previous biomechanical studies showed marginal differences in rotational restraint between unrepaired interportal and T-capsulotomies, and we further postulated that a small T-capsulotomy would not disrupt the structural integrity of the capsule, as the small vertical limb aligns with the lateral iliofemoral ligament's fiber direction. Fifth, a relatively small compressive load was applied to the hip joint so as to not risk any damage to the joint and tissues. The minimal load demonstrated the passive range of motion and resistance of the hip joint capsule and cam, similar to what would be observed during a physical examination (ie, supine patient performing FADIR and FABER on a bench). Sixth, the cadaveric study examined the contributions of the capsule and cam deformity at time zero (ie, during and immediately after surgery); as such, the study did not consider the effects of subsequent healing and stabilization on range of motion and torque restraint.

### Does the type of sport influence morphology of the hip? A systematic review [^1122CasG]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Cam Morphology and Hip Kinematics

The position of a cam deformity is described across a radial clock face at the femoral head-neck junction on magnetic resonance images, where superior is 12 o'clock and anterior 3 o'clock. Nine studies reported a maximum alpha angle in athletes in the anterosuperior quadrant, with 6 studies specifically mentioning the 1-o'clock position (Table 5).

Table 5
How the Location of Maximum AA Compares Among Sports a

In studies that compared hips subjected to different kinematic conditions, certain "at risk" movements conferred a risk for a higher prevalence of a cam deformity and affected the 3-dimensional morphology of the cam deformity. The location of the maximum alpha angle is different in positional players versus goalkeepers in ice hockey, 1:45 versus 1 o'clock, respectively(Table 5). This same study also found a significantly higher alpha angle on the anterior-posterior view in goaltenders versus positional players (Table 6). Two studies identified asymmetry in morphology among hips exposed to different kinematic parameters in sporting activity, with a lower alpha angle (P < .01), lower prevalence of cam (P = 0.026), but greater pain in golfers' lead versus trail hips.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 1-definitions, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcomes [^116rVco4]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary cam morphology is a mostly benign bony prominence that develops at the femoral head-neck junction of the hip, but it is highly prevalent in many athlete populations. In the small proportion of athletes for whom it is not benign, the resulting hip osteoarthritis can be debilitating. Clinicians, athletes, patients and researchers do not yet agree on important primary cam morphology elements. We aimed to ascertain and improve the level of agreement on primary cam morphology definitions, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcome measures.

Methods

To collect and aggregate informed opinions, an expert panel — the Young Athlete's Hip Research Collaborative — rated primary cam morphology definition, terminology, taxonomy and imaging outcome statements through an online Delphi exercise followed by an online meeting to explore areas of tension and dissent. Reporting followed Conducting and REporting DElphi Studies.

Results

A diverse and inclusive Delphi panel (n = 65 for rounds 1 and 2, representing 18 countries; 6 stakeholder groups; 40% women) agreed on 35 of 47 statements in 4 domains, while surfacing areas of tension and dissent. This Delphi panel agreed on four key issues essential to moving research and clinical care forward around primary cam morphology. They agreed on: (1) definition, confirming its conceptual attributes (tissue type, size, location, shape and ownership); (2) terminology — use 'morphology' and not terms with a negative connotation like 'lesion', 'abnormality' or 'deformity'; (3) taxonomy, distinguishing between primary and secondary cam morphology, and (4) imaging outcomes, a continuous bone/cartilage alpha angle on radial femoral head-neck MRI for primary cam morphology aetiology research.

Conclusion

This consensus provides athletes, patients, clinicians and researchers with a strong foundation to guide more precise communication, better clinical decision-making and higher value research about primary cam morphology and its natural history.

### Hip joint torsional loading before and after cam femoroacetabular impingement surgery [^115wDvLC]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Surgical intervention should continue to focus on cam resection for individuals in whom nonoperative treatments have failed or who have secondary pathoanatomic characteristics (eg, coxa vara, femoral anteversion, acetabular crossover, high spinopelvic incidence angles). Emphasis should be placed on proper patient selection in efforts to improve patient satisfaction and functional outcomes, as not all athletes have complete symptom resolution from surgery. Individuals who do not experience limited or painful internal rotation (ie, FADIR) but restricted external rotation (ie, FABER) could elect for nonsurgical management and further hip mobilization. Given that adverse loading to the chondrolabral junction and acetabular subchondral bone leads to hip joint degeneration, it would be crucial to elucidate the amount of capsular release, cam resection, and capsular repair needed without compromising hip mobility and function. The capsule played a predominant role in joint constraint; however, the cam deformity was responsible for a substantial amount of torsional resistance during hip flexion and internal rotation by pressing on the chondrolabral junction. It has long been suggested that surgical cam resection can restore hip motion and alleviate pain. This study demonstrated that, in flexion and internal rotation, the cam transmits 21% to 27% of the total load to the chondrolabral junction. Removing the cam removes this adverse loading.

### Editorial commentary: femoroacetabular impingement under-resection is the primary indication for revision arthroscopy [^117YDivP]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Complications indicating revision after hip arthroscopy generally manifest within 24 months. Femoroacetabular cam or pincher impingement deformity under-resection is the primary indication for revision arthroscopy. Revision results in decreased pain and improved function, and primary and revision hip femoroacetabular impingement arthroscopic surgeons must be mindful of femoral cam lesion over resection, which could result in iatrogenic femoral neck fracture.

### Hip joint torsional loading before and after cam femoroacetabular impingement surgery [^116rq2m9]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background:

Surgical management of cam femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) aims to preserve the native hip and restore joint function, although it is unclear how the capsulotomy, cam deformity, and capsular repair influence joint mechanics to balance functional mobility.

Purpose:

To examine the contributions of the capsule and cam deformity to hip joint mechanics. Using in vitro, cadaveric methods, we examined the individual effects of the surgical capsulotomy, cam resection, and capsular repair on passive range of motion and resistance of applied torque.

Study Design:

Descriptive laboratory study.

Methods:

Twelve cadaveric hips with cam deformities were skeletonized to the capsule and mounted onto a robotic testing platform. The robot positioned each intact hip in multiple testing positions: (1) extension, (2) neutral 0°, (3) flexion 30°, (4) flexion 90°, (5) flexion-adduction and internal rotation (FADIR), and (6) flexion-abduction and external rotation. Then the robot performed applicable internal and external rotations, recording the neutral path of motion until a 5-N·m of torque was reached in each rotational direction. Each hip then underwent a series of surgical stages (T-capsulotomy, cam resection, capsular repair) and was retested to reach 5 N·m of internal and external torque again after each stage. During the capsulotomy and cam resection stages, the initial intact hip's recorded path of motion was replayed to measure changes in resisted torque.

Results:

Regarding changes in motion, external rotation increased substantially after capsulotomies, but internal rotation only further increased at flexion 90° (change +32%, P = 0.001, d = 0.58) and FADIR (change +33%, P < .001, d = 0.51) after cam resections. Capsular repair provided marginal restraint for internal rotation but restrained the external rotation compared with the capsulotomy stage. Regarding changes in torque, both internal and external torque resistance decreased after capsulotomy. Compared with the capsulotomy stage, cam resection further reduced internal torque resistance during flexion 90° (change −45%, P < .001, d = 0.98) and FADIR (change −37%, P = 0.003, d = 1.0), where the cam deformity accounted for 21% of the intact hip's torsional resistance in flexion 90° and 27% in FADIR.

Conclusion:

Although the capsule played a predominant role in joint constraint, the cam deformity provided 21% to 27% of the intact hip's resistance to torsional load in flexion and internal rotation. Resecting the cam deformity would remove this loading on the chondrolabral junction.

Clinical Relevance:

These findings are the first to quantify the contribution of the cam deformity to resisting hip joint torsional loads and thus quantify the reduced loading on the chondrolabral complex that can be achieved after cam resection.

### The alpha angle [^11679iVx]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

What Is Normal?

An alpha angle of 55° is the commonly quoted diagnostic cutoff, based on the landmark article by Nötzli et al. The mean alpha angle in Nötzli's FAI syndrome group was 74°. This is notable considering reports that surgical restoration of the alpha angle of < 55° leads to improved outcomes in cam-type FAI syndrome. However, subsequent studies have quoted different cutoff values for a pathological alpha angle, confusing both diagnostic criteria and the ability to compare studies,-. Contributing to this are the conflation of FAI and FAI syndrome and differences between normative anatomic cutoffs for alpha angle and clinically important cutoffs for FAI syndrome.

In their retrospective study comparing 38 patients undergoing a surgical procedure for FAI syndrome with 101 controls, Barrientos et al. suggested a cutoff of ≥ 57°, arguing that this maximized sensitivity (92%) and specificity (95%). A more recent systematic review suggested a cutoff of ≥ 60° for defining a cam morphology, although the included studies were of generally low quality. Sutter et al. found that increasing the diagnostic threshold from 55° to 66° decreased the number of false-positives in an MRI study on asymptomatic volunteers. A study using an anatomic method (i.e. defining the femoral neck using multiple points, rather than 1 point as in the original method) found that this anatomic method resulted in a wider range of alpha angles, with a normal reference range of 30° to 66° in the general population. "Normal" alpha angles ranging from 52° to 62° have been reported, with some studies finding higher mean values in men -. In a study of 2,005 hips, Agricola et al. reported a bimodal distribution of the alpha angle, and they suggested the implementation of 2 thresholds: 60° for the presence of a cam deformity and 78° for a pathological cam deformity, with the pathological cutoff based on the development of end-stage osteoarthritis on follow-up. More recently, there has also been some consideration of the interplay between cam lesion location and femoral version, as well as between cam lesion location and acetabular morphology (e.g. smaller alpha angles may still be pathologic in the context of acetabular retroversion).

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 2-research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip [^113SY6fo]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Building a more rigorous, inclusive and evidence-based research ecosystem is essential, but it is also a deliberate, disruptive and daunting task. A diverse Delphi panel of 65 stakeholders representing six stakeholder groups agreed on the first ranked set of research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip, focusing on primary cam morphology and its natural history. Although the 18 research priorities identified signal possible gaps in the current evidence base, researchers, PPI partners and clinicians should spotlight these gaps through an evidence-based approach to future research. While informing more rigorous, inclusive and evidence-based research, this consensus is a roadmap for researchers, policy-makers and funders to implement research dedicated to reducing the cost and burden of conditions affecting the young person's hip, including hip disease related to primary cam morphology.

### Less hip range of motion is associated with a greater alpha angle in people with longstanding hip and groin pain [^1118xy62]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Longstanding hip and groin pain is a common problem in young to middle-aged adults, leading to reduced participation in sports and activities of daily living, and reduced quality of life. Societal costs, in lost productivity and medical treatment, are also substantial.

The hip joint is recognised as a source of groin pain, and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is a common source of hip-related pain in a younger and physically active population. Cam-type FAIS is currently understood to be the more severe of the morphological variations, with more associated labrum and cartilage damage, as well as an increased risk of development of secondary hip osteoarthritis (OA) with greater cam deformities. Cam morphology is commonly quantified by the alpha angle, defined as the angle between lines from the center of the head of the femur to the longitudinal axis and the neck of the femur and the deviation of the spherical nature of the femoral head. Although cam morphology is common in the general population, greater deformities are seen in athletes and symptomatic populations. Various cut-offs of the alpha angle have been used in the literature to define cam morphology, but a recent systematic review concluded that 60° is currently the most appropriate cut-off.

Cam morphology has been proposed to affect hip ROM, primarily in positions of hip flexion and internal rotation. Several studies have examined the effect of the alpha angle on hip ROM in asymptomatic people and found less ROM in participants with higher alpha angles as compared to those with lower alpha angles, primarily in internal rotation with 90° hip flexion. However, the relationship between alpha angle and ROM in symptomatic people is conflicting, with one systematic review concluding that people with FAIS did, and another concluding that these people did not have less ROM compared to asymptomatic controls. Despite the existing conflicting evidence, ROM restriction is commonly used as a diagnostic criterion for FAIS. Examining the association of cam morphology and ROM in symptomatic people can provide information on the value of ROM assessment in differential diagnosis of hip and groin pain.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 2-research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip [^113Zn9QB]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary cam morphology is mostly a benign bony prominence that develops at the femoral head–neck junction of the hip. It is, however, highly prevalent in many athlete populationsand causes debilitating hip osteoarthritis in some, thus placing existing and potential athlete-patients at risk of future hip disease.

Two aspects relevant to research focus and quality, highlighted in the introduction of a linked paper (Oxford consensus study, part 1) underpinned the work reported in this paper. First, clinicians and researchers cannot predict with accuracy who will develop primary cam morphology, whose primary cam morphology will be inconsequential and who will end up with a total hip replacement — research into risk factors for aetiology and poor outcomes of primary cam morphology is needed. Second, existing research is mired in confusion partly because clinicians, athletes, patients and researchers have not agreed on a conceptual or operational definition of primary cam morphology, key terminology or a taxonomy of subtypes.

We reported in a linked paper (Oxford consensus study, part 1) how an international group of clinicians, athletes, patients and researchers — representing the Y oung A thlete's Hi p R esearch (YAHiR) Collaborative — engaged with, challenged and improved four key areas on primary cam morphology and its natural history. The four key areas identified for further attention by a preliminary concept analysiswere the following: (1) a new conceptual definition for the morphology based on five defining attributes; (2) more consistent terminology commending the important (although from a small and select expert panel) Warwick Agreement; (3) taxonomy distinguishing between primary and secondary cam morphology and (4) challenges of operationalising the hip morphology. However, agreement on a prioritised research agenda for the field, the focus of this paper, is lacking.

### Unaddressed cam deformity is associated with elevated joint contact stress after periacetabular osteotomy [^113jEsQF]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Femoral cam deformity is frequently present in patients with acetabular dysplasia. Computational modeling can be used to identify how this deformity affects joint mechanics. Our purpose was to identify the relationship between cam deformity and joint contact stress after periacetabular osteotomy (PAO). We hypothesized that cam deformity is associated with an increase in peak joint contact stress after PAO.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of patients treated for hip dysplasia with PAO without femoral osteochondroplasty. Patient-specific hip models created from preoperative and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were evaluated using discrete element analysis to determine maximum joint contact stress after PAO. Twenty hips with a postoperative increase in maximum contact stress were compared with 20 that demonstrated decreased maximum contact stress. Hips were assessed for cam deformity on cross-sectional imaging. Radiographic measures of acetabular dysplasia before and after PAO were assessed and compared with the change in maximum contact stress after PAO.

Results

There was a moderate relationship between the change in maximum contact stress and the α angle (r = 0.31; p = 0.04), and the average α angle in the hips with increased maximum contact stress was significantly different from that in the hips with decreased joint contact stress (51° ± 11.4° versus 42° ± 5.1°; p = 0.04). All 6 hips with an α angle of > 60° demonstrated increased joint contact stress.

Conclusions

Cam deformity is common in patients with hip dysplasia. In our study, α angles of > 60° were associated with increased postoperative joint contact stress. The α angle should be assessed preoperatively, and deformity should be addressed for optimal joint mechanics after PAO.

Clinical Relevance

A reduction in joint contact stress is a proposed mechanism for the increased joint longevity following periacetabular osteotomy for hip dysplasia. Impingement from abnormal femoral offset negatively impacts clinical outcome, but this finding has not been evaluated from a biomechanical perspective previously and a threshold for performing femoral osteochondroplasty has not been established previously. This study provides biomechanical evidence supporting surgical management of femoral cam deformity for an α angle of > 60°.

### Femoral morphology in patients undergoing periacetabular osteotomy for classic or borderline acetabular dysplasia: are cam deformities common? [^111qmqE4]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The primary purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of Cam deformity in patients with symptomatic acetabular dysplasia (SAD) who underwent periacetabular osteotomy (PAO).

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 164 SAD PAO patients from 2 institutions. Preoperative anteroposterior and frog-lateral radiographs were analyzed for lateral center edge angle (LCEA), retroversion, alpha angles, and anterior femoral head-neck offset. Hips were classified as dysplastic (LCEA < 20°, group A, n = 142) and borderline dysplastic (LCEA 20°-25°, group B, n = 22). There were 128 females and 36 males with an average age of 29 years (range 13–56).

Results

The overall prevalence of Cam deformity was 10% (17 of 164) in SAD patients. There was no difference in the prevalence of Cam deformity between the groups (P > .99).

Conclusion

Prevalence of Cam deformities in our series of SAD patients having undergone PAO is less than prior reports. Careful radiographic measurement should be performed to avoid overtreating these hips with unnecessary osteochondroplasty procedures.

### What is the prevalence of cam deformity after prophylactic pinning of the contralateral asymptomatic hip in unilateral slipped capital femoral epiphysis? A 10-year minimum followup study [^116kwoe3]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Prophylactic pinning of the asymptomatic and normal-appearing contralateral hip in patients with unilateral slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) remains controversial. Understanding the minimal 10-year clinical, functional, and radiographic outcomes of the contralateral asymptomatic hip in unilateral SCFE may be helpful in the decision regarding whether the benefits associated with potentially preventing a SCFE are outweighed by the risk of additional surgery.

Questions/Purposes

Among patients with SCFE treated with prophylactic pinning of the asymptomatic and contralateral hip, we sought (1) to determine the complications and reoperations; (2) to evaluate the development of cam deformities and the frequency and severity of osteoarthritis progression; and (3) to characterize hip pain and function as measured by the Harris hip score (HHS) and the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) at minimal 10-year followup.

Methods

Between 1998 and 2005 all patients with SCFE seen at our institution were treated with the modified Dunn procedure and all were offered prophylactic pinning of the contralateral asymptomatic hip. Of the 41 patients who underwent the unilateral modified Dunn procedure and who had an asymptomatic contralateral hip, 37 patients (90%) underwent pinning of that contralateral hip. Of those, 33 patients (80%) were available for clinical and radiographic evaluation for this retrospective study at a minimum of 10 years (mean followup 12 ± 2 years) after surgery. Three patients of the 37 patients only had 10-year clinical followup, including questionnaires sent by mail and telephone, because they refused further radiographic followup and one patient was lost to followup. The group included 19 males and 17 females whose age at surgery was a mean of 13 ± 2 years. Medical charts were reviewed and patients were asked about complications and additional surgical procedures. Most recent postoperative radiographs were evaluated for measurement of the alpha angle, head-neck offset, epiphysis orientation, and osteoarthritis grading according to Tönnis classification and minimum joint space width. The presence of a cam deformity was defined by an alpha angle measurement > 60° on the AP radiograph and/or > 55° on the lateral radiograph. Hip function and pain were assessed by the HHS and HOOS outcome measures.

Results

No complications with prophylactic in situ pinning were recorded. Four of 36 (11%) patients underwent subsequent surgical treatment for cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), and hardware removal was performed in four hips (11%). The mean alpha angle was 53° ± 8° on the AP radiograph and 49° ± 8° on the lateral view at followup. In total, 10 of 33 hips (30%) had a cam morphology at the femoral head-neck junction and four (12%) were symptomatic and underwent FAI surgery. Six of 33 patients (18%) developed an asymptomatic cam morphology at the femoral head-neck junction; in three of 33 hips (9%), the cam deformity instead of lesion were visible only on the lateral projection, and 9% were visible on both the AP and lateral projections. The preoperative offset of the femoral head-neck junction was 10 ± 3 mm on the AP view and 11 ± 4 mm on the lateral view. At followup, the AP offset was 7 ± 3 mm and the lateral offset was 6 ± 3 mm, and on the lateral view, the offset was < 10 mm in eight hips (22%). No patient had radiographic signs of hip osteoarthritis (Tönnis Grade 0). The mean minimum joint space width was 4 ± 0.4 mm. The mean HHS for the 32 patients who did not undergo subsequent surgery was 97 ± 5 at latest followup. The mean postoperative HOOS was 94 ± 8 for the 32 patients at latest followup.

Conclusions

At a minimum followup of 10 years after prophylactic pinning of a contralateral asymptomatic hip, most patients achieve excellent hip scores; however, a substantial proportion will develop a symptomatic cam deformity despite prophylactic pinning. No patient had signs of osteoarthritis at a minimum of 10 years, but almost one-third of the patients who underwent prophylactic pinning developed a cam deformity.

Level Of Evidence

Level IV, therapeutic study.

### Risk factors for bilateral femoroacetabular impingement syndrome requiring surgery [^114CmGCQ]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Haviv and O'Donnellalso reported a case series of 82 patients who underwent staged hip arthroscopy to address bilateral FAIS, concluding that patients had improved modified Harris Hip Scores and Nonarthritic Hip Scores after these surgeries. In this series, the average time interval between the two surgeries was 5 months compared with 8.6 months in the present study.

It has been reported that among patients with bilateral hip abnormalities, considerable morphologic symmetry was noted. In addition, a quantitative MRI study of 19 patients with bilateral cam deformities found a loss of the typical regional variation in T1ρ values among the four quadrants of the hips regardless of the presence of symptoms, suggesting that a cam deformity may predispose to hip arthritis in the future. However, it has also been reported that bilateral FAIS does not necessarily result in bilateral symptoms. Although we were unable to detect a predictive value of alpha angles with regard to eventual bilateral surgery, the P value was 0.12, suggesting that with the inclusion of additional patients, statistical significance might be achieved. Future work on this topic could also focus on attempting to correlate intra-articular findings in the index hip with the risk of contralateral surgery. In addition, many other factors exist that could be considered in light of risk of contralateral FAIS surgery such as preoperative length of symptoms, severity of symptoms, and patient-rated functional outcomes.

### Oxford consensus on primary cam morphology and femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: part 2-research priorities on conditions affecting the young person's hip [^111tmm1h]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based research uses 'prior research in a systematic and transparent way to inform a new study so that it is answering questions that matter in a valid, efficient and accessible manner', minimising clinical health research that is unnecessary, irrelevant, unscientific, wasteful and unethical. However, Anjum et al (2020) appealed to the Evidence Based Medicine community to expand their notion of 'evidence'. First, as 'evidence is typically evidence of causation', evidence-based researchers 'need to tackle the problem of causation head on' to better understand 'what is meant by "evidence", what is the "best available evidence" and how to apply it in the context of medicine'. Second, researchers should appreciate that multiple methods are needed to establish causation — not only the statistical approaches of randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews of trials. Third, researchers should use different types of evidence (eg, case studies and case reports) to inform 'causal evidence'. Last, researchers should use patient narratives and phenomenological approaches as tools to look beyond evidence such as symptoms and outcomes. Researchers should also specify their causal intent, when relevant, and use language consistent with that intent when reporting their studies. Consensus on a prioritised research agenda on conditions affecting the young person's hip, underpinned by an evidence-based approach to research, applying a more inclusive lens to the notion of 'evidence' (and knowledge coproduction), is a strong foundation for higher research value and less research waste. However, an important step is effective dissemination and implementation of the prioritised research agenda.

The YAHiR Collaborative values transparent and reproducible research, central to the aim of this study to inform a more rigorous, inclusive and evidence-based approach to research on primary cam morphology and its natural history. We invite scrutiny and critique, foster equal opportunities and share study data as open access published manuscripts and supplementary files (Oxford consensus studies, parts 1 and 2) or documents associated with an Open Science Framework–registered study project. We invite readers to engage with the material, participate in the dissemination and collaborate to cocreate knowledge that matters. Open science aims to make scientific knowledge (in different languages) openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone. Our approach reinforces quality and integrity, collective benefit, equity and fairness, diversity and inclusiveness — the core values of open science.

### Osseous impingement occurs early in flexion in cam-type femoroacetabular impingement: a 4D CT model [^113ZPgTU]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of this study was to examine the real time in vivo kinematics of the hip in patients with cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI).

Patients and Methods

A total of 50 patients (83 hips) underwent 4D dynamic CT scanning of the hip, producing real time osseous models of the pelvis and femur being moved through flexion, adduction, and internal rotation. The location and size of the cam deformity and its relationship to the angle of flexion of the hip and pelvic tilt, and the position of impingement were recorded.

Results

In these patients with cam-type FAI, there was significant correlation between the alpha angle and flexion to the point of impingement (mean 41.36°; 14.32° to 57.95°) (R = -0.5815 and p = < 0.001). Patients with a large cam deformity (alpha angle > 78°) had significantly less flexion to the point of impingement (mean 36.30°; 14.32° to 55.18°) than patients with a small cam deformity (alpha angle 60° to 78°) (mean 45.34°; 27.25° to 57.95°) (p = < 0.001).

Conclusion

This study has shown that cam-type impingement can occur early in flexion (40°), particularly in patients with large anterior deformities. These patients risk chondrolabral damage during routine activities such as walking, and going up stairs. These findings offer important insights into the cause of the symptoms, the mechanisms of screening and the forms of treatment available for these patients.

### Computer-assisted arthroscopic cam resection [^112zTT65]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Determining the appropriate femoral cam resection during hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome is both critical for the patient and challenging for the surgeon. Incomplete bone resection is a leading cause of failed hip arthroscopy, whereas over-resection may increase the risk of femoral neck fracture. The alpha angle is a validated 2-dimensional radiographic measurement used to both diagnose femoroacetabular impingement syndrome preoperatively and to determine resection adequacy postoperatively. Computer-assisted intraoperative guidance systems enhance the accuracy of femoral cam resection, although a preoperative 3-dimensional computed tomography scan may be required. Other systems, such as the HipCheck software (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI), have been developed to provide intraoperative guidance with live feedback using simultaneous alpha angle measurements overlayed on fluoroscopic images without the requirement for routine preoperative computed tomography. Via intraoperative touchscreen navigation, the surgeon identifies the midpoint of the femoral neck and femoral head. A commercial software program provides real-time alpha angle measurements, as well as enhanced visualization of the femoral cam deformity with an adjustable resection curve. Before the surgeon performs the cam resection, the software provides a template for appropriate resection depth in 6 positions of the hip. Upon completion of the femoral cam resection, the hip is again assessed in the same 6 positions and the alpha angle is assessed to ensure a complete resection.

### Patient-specific anatomical and functional parameters provide new insights into the pathomechanism of cam FAI [^115MxLbo]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) represents a constellation of anatomical and clinical features, but definitive diagnosis is often difficult. The high prevalence of cam deformity of the femoral head in the asymptomatic population as well as clinical factors leading to the onset of symptoms raises questions as to what other factors increase the risk of cartilage damage and hip pain.

Questions/Purposes

The purpose was to identify any differences in anatomical parameters and squat kinematics among symptomatic, asymptomatic, and control individuals and if these parameters can determine individuals at risk of developing symptoms of cam FAI.

Methods

Forty-three participants (n = 43) were recruited and divided into three groups: symptomatic (12), asymptomatic (17), and control (14). Symptomatic participants presented a cam deformity (identified by an elevated alpha angle on CT images), pain symptoms, clinical signs, and were scheduled for surgery. The other recruited volunteers were blinded and unaware whether they had a cam deformity. After the CT data were assessed for an elevated alpha angle, participants with a cam deformity but who did not demonstrate any clinical signs or symptoms were considered asymptomatic, whereas participants without a cam deformity and without clinical signs or symptoms were considered healthy control subjects. For each participant, anatomical CT parameters (axial alpha angle, radial alpha angle, femoral head-neck offset, femoral neck-shaft angle, medial proximal femoral angle, femoral torsion, acetabular version) were evaluated. Functional squat parameters (maximal squat depth, pelvic range of motion) were determined using a motion capture system. A stepwise discriminant function analysis was used to determine which of the parameters were most suitable to classify each participant with their respective subgroup.

Results

The symptomatic group showed elevated alpha angles and lower femoral neck-shaft angles, whereas the asymptomatic group showed elevated alpha angles in comparison with the control group. The best discriminating parameters to determine symptoms were radial alpha angle, femoral neck-shaft angle, and pelvic range of motion (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In the presence of a cam deformity, indications of a decreased femoral neck-shaft angle and reduced pelvic range of motion can identify those at risk of symptomatic FAI.

### Favorable outcomes of revision hip arthroscopy irrespective of whether index surgery was performed by the same surgeon or a different surgeon [^112dJM4s]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

The literature repeatedly demonstrates that persistent or residual structural deformity in the form of cam-type and/or pincer-type impingement postoperatively is associated with revision surgery. In this study, we found a markedly increased amount of undertreated or unaddressed FAI in the DS group, which is consistent with previous studies. In addition, there were notable differences in the DS group, such as correction of FAI, labral tears requiring additional treatment, and capsular plication. Despite these differences, both patient populations were able to achieve similar improvement in outcomes after revision hip arthroscopy. The data demonstrate that the volume-outcome relationshipholds true in the revision hip arthroscopy setting, irrespective of where the index procedure is done.

In an earlier study by Philippon et al, a 95% incidence of residual FAI was reported in a cohort undergoing revision hip arthroscopy, indicating that persistent impingement was the most common indication for revision hip arthroscopy. A more modest benefit of revision hip arthroscopy, with a lower incidence of missed or incompletely treated FAI (32%), was reported by Aprato et al. Chondral lesion associated with labral reinjury was the most common finding at revision arthroscopy in a study by Aprato et al. In contrast to a study by Philippon et al, only 31% of patients underwent revision for persistent FAI according to this study. These authors commented that this observation may be because of differences in patient population or patient selection. However, the rates of untreated or incompletely addressed FAI in the present investigation, with 93.0% and 60.6% of DS patients presenting with cam impingement and pincer impingement, respectively, reinforce the existing literature findings.
