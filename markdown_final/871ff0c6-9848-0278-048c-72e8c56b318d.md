## Question

2. (5 points) At the World Meteorologists Conference, each participant in turn announced the average monthly temperature in their hometown. At this moment, all the others recorded the product of the temperatures in their and the speaker's cities. In total, 42 positive and 48 negative numbers were recorded. What is the smallest number of times a positive temperature could have been announced?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the smallest number of times a positive temperature could have been announced at a conference where each participant records the product of their own city's temperature with the speaker's temperature, given that 42 positive and 48 negative products were recorded in total. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how many participants there are and how many products are generated. Then, I should verify how the sign of each product depends on the signs of the two temperatures involved. Next, I will set up equations linking the counts of positive and negative products to the number of positive and negative temperatures. After that, I need to solve for the minimum number of positive announcements, checking for feasibility and edge cases. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and make sure the logic holds before stating the answer.

> Let me first confirm the basic setup. If there are n participants, then each time a speaker announces a temperature, the other n − 1 participants each record a product, so the total number of recorded products is n(n − 1). We are told there are 42 positive and 48 negative products, so the total is 42 + 48 = 90, which means n(n − 1) = 90. Solving n² − n − 90 = 0 gives n = 10, since 10 × 9 = 90, so there are 10 participants and 9 products recorded per speaker, totaling 90 products [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the sign logic before proceeding. The product of two temperatures is positive if both temperatures have the same sign (positive × positive or negative × negative), and negative if the signs differ (positive × negative or negative × positive). So, for any given speaker, the number of positive products equals the number of listeners whose temperature has the same sign as the speaker's, and the number of negative products equals the number of listeners whose temperature has the opposite sign [^notfound].

> I will now examine the case where the speaker has a positive temperature. If the speaker is positive, then positive products come from the other positive-temperature listeners, and negative products come from the negative-temperature listeners. Let p be the total number of positive-temperature participants and q be the total number of negative-temperature participants, so p + q = 10. When a positive speaker talks, the number of positive products is p − 1 (excluding the speaker) and the number of negative products is q [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the case where the speaker has a negative temperature. If the speaker is negative, then positive products come from the negative-temperature listeners (same sign as the speaker's negative), and negative products come from the positive-temperature listeners. So, when a negative speaker talks, the number of positive products is q − 1 (excluding the speaker) and the number of negative products is p [^notfound].

> Let me think about the total counts. Summing over all speakers, the total number of positive products is (number of positive speakers) × (p − 1) + (number of negative speakers) × (q − 1), and the total number of negative products is (number of positive speakers) × q + (number of negative speakers) × p. Let x be the number of times a positive temperature is announced; then 10 − x is the number of times a negative temperature is announced. So, the positive product total is x(p − 1) + (10 − x)(q − 1) and the negative product total is xq + (10 − x)p, and we know these equal 42 and 48 respectively [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the algebra. Substituting q = 10 − p, the positive product equation becomes x(p − 1) + (10 − x)(9 − p) = 42, and the negative product equation becomes x(10 − p) + (10 − x)p = 48. Let me simplify the negative equation first: 10x − xp + 10p − xp = 48, which reduces to 10x + 10p − 2xp = 48, or 5x + 5p − xp = 24. The positive equation simplifies to xp − x + 90 − 10p − 9x + xp = 42, which becomes 2xp − 10x − 10p + 90 = 42, or 2xp − 10x − 10p = −48, and dividing by 2 gives xp − 5x − 5p = −24. Wait, I should double-check that simplification; yes, that's correct [^notfound].

> I need to ensure consistency between the two equations. Notice that the negative-product equation is 5x + 5p − xp = 24, and the positive-product equation simplifies to xp − 5x − 5p = −24, which is exactly the negative of the first equation, so they are consistent and redundant. I can proceed with either; let me use the negative-product equation: 5x + 5p − xp = 24, and rearrange to xp − 5x − 5p + 24 = 0. Adding 25 to both sides lets me factor: (x − 5)(p − 5) = 1. Since x and p are integers between 0 and 10, the only integer solutions are x − 5 = 1 and p − 5 = 1, or x − 5 = −1 and p − 5 = −1, giving (x, p) = (6, 6) or (4, 4) respectively [^notfound].

> But wait, what if I made an error in the factoring step? Let me verify. (x − 5)(p − 5) = 1 implies the pairs (1, 1) or (−1, −1) for the factors, which indeed yields (x, p) = (6, 6) or (4, 4). Now, I should check which of these minimizes x, the number of positive announcements. Clearly, x = 4 is smaller than x = 6, so the candidate minimum is 4 positive announcements, with p = 4 positive-temperature participants and q = 6 negative-temperature participants [^notfound].

> I should confirm feasibility with the original counts. If x = 4 and p = 4, then positive products = 4(4 − 1) + 6(6 − 1) = 4 × 3 + 6 × 5 = 12 + 30 = 42, and negative products = 4 × 6 + 6 × 4 = 24 + 24 = 48, which matches the given totals. This checks out, and it also shows that the alternative solution x = 6, p = 6 would swap the 42 and 48, which is not what we want here [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the minimum might be 0 positive announcements, but that would imply all speakers are negative, which would make all products positive (negative × negative), contradicting the existence of 48 negative products. So 0 is impossible, and my earlier algebraic exploration confirms that the smallest feasible value is indeed 4 positive announcements [^notfound].

> Final answer: The smallest number of times a positive temperature could have been announced is 4 [^notfound].

---

The smallest number of times a positive temperature could have been announced is **4**. This occurs when 4 participants announce positive temperatures and 6 announce negative temperatures, yielding exactly 42 positive products and 48 negative products. This is the minimal configuration that satisfies the given counts, and fewer positive announcements would make it impossible to reach 42 positive products.

---

## Mathematical formulation

Let:

- n = total number of participants
- p = number of participants who announced positive temperatures
- q = number of participants who announced negative temperatures

Given:

- Total recorded products = 42 positive + 48 negative = 90
- Each participant records n - 1 products (one for each other participant)
- Thus, total products = n(n - 1) = 90

Solving n(n - 1) = 90 gives n = 10 (since 10 × 9 = 90).

---

## Product sign analysis

The sign of each recorded product depends on the signs of the two temperatures involved:

| **Speaker's temperature** | **Listener's temperature** | **Product sign** |
|-|-|-|
| Positive (+) | Positive (+) | Positive (+) |
| Positive (+) | Negative (-) | Negative (-) |
| Negative (-) | Positive (+) | Negative (-) |
| Negative (-) | Negative (-) | Positive (+) |

---

Thus, positive products arise from pairs with the same sign, and negative products from pairs with opposite signs.

---

## Counting positive and negative products

Let:

- P = total number of positive products
- N = total number of negative products

We have:

- P = 42
- N = 48

For each positive speaker:

- Positive products = p − 1 (other positives)
- Negative products = q (negatives)

For each negative speaker:

- Positive products = q − 1 (other negatives)
- Negative products = p (positives)

Total positive products:

P = p(p − 1) + q(q − 1) = 42

Total negative products:

N = pq + qp = 2pq = 48

From 2pq = 48, we get pq = 24.

---

## Solving the system of equations

We have:

- p + q = 10
- pq = 24

Substitute q = 10 − p into pq = 24:

p(10 − p) = 24
10p − p² = 24
p² − 10p + 24 = 0

Solving the quadratic equation:

p = [(10 ± √(100 − 96))/2] = [(10 ± 2)/2]

Thus, p = 6 or p = 4.

- If p = 6, then q = 4
- If p = 4, then q = 6

Both satisfy p + q = 10 and pq = 24.

---

## Verifying the solution

We need to check which pair yields exactly 42 positive products.

For (p = 4), (q = 6):

P = 4(4–1) + 6(6–1) = 4 × 3 + 6 × 5 = 12 + 30 = 42

This matches the given 42 positive products, and the negative products are:

N = 2pq = 2 × 4 × 6 = 48

Which also matches the given 48 negative products.

---

## Conclusion

The smallest number of times a positive temperature could have been announced is **4**. This corresponds to 4 positive and 6 negative announcements, producing exactly 42 positive and 48 negative recorded products.

### Clinical features of patients with COVID-19: is temperature screening useful? [^ca3bb69f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

As many businesses reopen after government-induced restrictions, many public agencies and private companies, such as banks, golf courses, and stores, are using temperature screening to assess for possible coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection both for patrons and for employees.

Objective

We assessed the frequency of a fever ≥ 100.4°F and other symptoms associated with COVID-19 among patients in the emergency department (ED) who were tested in the ED for the illness.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of data from patients who were tested for acute COVID-19 infection from March 10, 2020 through June 30, 2020 at two EDs within the same health care system. Data collected included temperature, the presence or recent history of COVID-19-related symptoms, and COVID-19 test results. Descriptive statistics are reported for presenting fever and other COVID-19-related symptoms alone and in combination with presenting fever.

Results

A total of 6894 patients were tested for COVID-19. Among these, 330 (4.8%) tested positive for active infection. Of these patients, 64 (19.4%) presented with a fever ≥ 100.4°F (≥ 38.0°C). Increasing the number of COVID-19-related symptoms in combination with a presenting fever ≥ 100.4°F increased the number of people who could be identified as having a COVID-19 infection.

Conclusions

About a quarter of patients who were tested positive for COVID-19 in our ED did not have a fever at presentation ≥ 100.4°F. Using only temperature to screen for COVID-19 in the community setting will likely miss the majority of patients with active disease.

### Stable or fluctuating temperatures in winter: which is worse for your lungs? [^73085c7b]. Thorax (2018). Low credibility.

The ratification of the Paris Agreement in 2015signifies a worldwide consensus on climate change has been reached. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned as global warming intensifies, extreme weather events (such as heat waves, droughts, floods) will become more frequent and more severe. Indeed in the UK, within the first few months of 2018, there has already been a cold wave between late February and early March (with maximum temperature 8°C–12°C below average for the time of year)and an unusually warm week in April (which saw a rise of almost 20°C from 6°C–7°C in the previous week). That heat waves or cold spells could lead to excess deaths has been documented in previous studiesand is probably unquestionable. However, even in the absence of extreme temperature episodes, exposure to so-called non-optimum ambient temperatures has shown to be associated with elevated risks of morbidity and mortality. A recent study of over 74 million deaths from 13 countries has found most of the temperature-related short-term (days to weeks after the exposure) mortality displacement could in fact be attributed to moderate hot and cold temperatures, rather than extreme heat (temperature higher than 97.5th percentile) or cold (lower than 2.5th percentile).

Reconstructed summer EU JSL impacts

To analyse the climatic conditions over Europe during reconstructed summer EU JSL extremes, we used the peak-over-threshold methodto select extremes in the summer EU JSL reconstruction. We defined extreme positive years as those with D90 EU JSL and extreme negative years as those with D10 EU JSL over the entire reconstruction (1300–2004; 71 positive and 71 negative extremes; Extended Data Table 4). We then conducted a composite analysis with the aforementioned reconstructed gridded climate data during the positive and negative summer EU JSL extremes (Fig. 3c–j).

To investigate EU JSL anomalies during past European climate extremes, we compared historical summer EU JSL positions during event years characterized by extreme climate, natural hazards and societal extremes with those of non-extreme years (Figs. 4 and 5 and Extended Data Table 5) using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for each included dataset. In all cases, we equalized the sizes of the groups (D90, D10 and non-extreme) by resampling the larger groups several times to get a representative downsized group matching the size of the smallest one. We extracted climate extreme event years for two sub-regions (BRIT: 11° W–3° E, 49° N–59° N and NEMED: 15° E–30° E, 40° N–45° N) from the reconstructed temperature and precipitation gridded fields(Fig. 4a, b). For each time series, we defined extreme years as higher than D90 and lower than D10 over the entire reconstruction period. We complemented these gridded-data-based climate extreme event series with four continuous summer temperature records and two continuous precipitation records that are based on instrumental and/or documentary datasets from BRIT and NEMED (Extended Data Table 5). Event years in the continuous series were defined based on the D90 and D10 values. For the summer temperature data in ref. we used the Category III cluster (warm summer; n = 75) as hot events and the Category I cluster (cool summer, n = 74) (from table 5 of ref.) as cold events, using only the most recent year of these multi-year extreme events in our analysis (Extended Data Table 5). We further compiled one independent, discrete temperature and two independent, discrete precipitation reconstructions (Extended Data Table 5). Hot extremes in ref.(NEMED) records were defined as years with the hottest summers in Northern–Central Italy, Southern Italy and/or Greece (from table 5 of ref.). Dry extremes in the discrete BRIT record were defined as years with the highest calculated aridity index in England and Wales (from fig. 2 of ref.).

### Comparison of 3 infrared thermal detection systems and self-report for mass fever screening [^92cd8afd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Although addition of a health declaration form would allow screening to also consider recent travel history, previous fever, and other symptoms or illness exposures, health declarations have variable compliance rates and depend on a person's ability to understand questions and accurately assess symptoms as well as willingness to report. In our study, in which patients had no disincentive to report, we found that one fourth of febrile patients did not report having fever, which suggests true unawareness of fever among some persons. Only one tenth of those who reported having a fever were actually found to be febrile. Our results, therefore, probably underestimated the benefit of ITDS over self-reports of fever. In other settings, ill persons may be less likely to report symptoms for fear of adverse consequences such as travel delays, involuntary isolation of ill persons, or quarantine of exposed contacts. In settings such as travel sites (e.g. airports) and the workplace, ITDS could provide an objective means for the mass detection of fever as part of a comprehensive public health screening strategy because ITDS had greater accuracy than self-reports.

Mass health screening during a pandemic will certainly be influenced by several other factors, including perceived and actual pandemic severity, as well as the potential consequences of illness detection, either negative or positive, which can affect the sensitivity of screening that uses self-report. If being detected as febrile is perceived as harmful, travelers may hide their symptoms. Alternatively, during a pandemic with high mortality rates, incentives for reporting symptoms might be present, such as access to scarce antiviral medications and medical care. In both situations, a comprehensive screening approach may be necessary, which uses ITDS for fever screening and a health questionnaire to detect other symptoms or exposures that would increase specificity of the screening process. Finally, the usefulness of any infectious disease screening must take into account temperature fluctuations, use of antipyretic medications, transmission risks, prevalence of infections, and asymptomatic infections.

IV. Blood cultures in critically ill patients with fever — For ICU patients with fever without an obvious source who have a central venous catheter, "we recommend simultaneous collection of central venous catheter and peripherally drawn blood cultures to allow calculation of differential time to positivity (best practice statement)". When central venous catheter cultures are indicated, "we recommend sampling at least two lumens (best-practice statement)". For a new fever of unclear origin in critically ill patients, "we suggest that if rapid molecular tests on blood are performed, they should only be used with concomitant blood cultures (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence)". In adult ICU patients, "we recommend sequentially collecting at least two sets of blood cultures (ideally 60 mL of blood total), from different anatomical sites, without a time interval between them (Best practice statement)".

Indicator 4.1.3: impact of heat on economic activity

Economic activity is adversely affected by warming temperatures, with cascading impacts on wellbeing from unemployment, mental stress, and overall economic pressures. This indicator tracks the impact of temperature anomalies (ie, a shift from the reference value or long-term average) from a long-term mean (1981–2010) on economic activity measured by real GDP per capita growth at the NUTS 2 in Europe. A time-varying coefficient regression combined with subnational economic data and high-resolution temperature and precipitation data from ERA5-Land was used to estimate this relationship. Because of the economic disparity between northern and southern Europe, the estimations were run separately for the two regions.

In 2019, GDP per capita growth in southern Europe was –0·90% (95% CI –0·87 to –0·91) lower due to positive temperature anomalies (a positive anomaly indicates that the observed temperature was warmer than the reference value) compared with 1981–2000 temperatures, and –0·106% (95% CI –0·100 to –0·111) lower in 2001. The findings show that positive temperature anomalies have not only been associated with reduced GDP per capita growth in southern Europe, but that they have also increased over time. Notably, this was not observed for northern Europe (appendix pp 120–21).

Disinfection and sterilization — risk assessment when items were used before retrieval: If patient-care items were used before retrieval, the infection control professional should assess the risk of infection with central processing, surgical services, and risk management staff, considering chemical indicator results, results of other biological indicators that followed the positive one, sterilizer parameters, the time-temperature chart or printout, and the microbial load; among decontaminated surgical instruments, 85% have less than 100 CFU. The margin of safety in steam sterilization is sufficiently large that there is minimal infection risk associated with items in a load that show spore growth when cleaning and temperature conditions were achieved, and there are no published studies that document disease transmission via a nonretrieved surgical instrument following a sterilization cycle with a positive biological indicator.

### Can we use temperature measurements to identify pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in nursing home residents? [^ddf812ab]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 has had a severe impact on morbidity and mortality among nursing home (NH) residents. Earlier detection of SARS-CoV-2 may position us to better mitigate the risk of spread. Both asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission are common in outbreaks, and threshold temperatures, such as 38C, for screening for infection could miss timely detection in the majority of residents. We hypothesized that in long-term care residents, temperature trends with SARS-CoV-2 infection could identify infection in pre-symptomatic individuals earlier than standard screening.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic health records in 6176 residents of the VA NHs who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing triggered by symptoms. We collected information about age and other demographics, baseline temperature, and specific comorbidities. We created standardized definitions, and a hypothetical model to test measures of temperature variation and compare outcomes to the VA standard of care.

Results

We showed that a change from baseline of 0.4C identified 47% of NH residents who became SARS-CoV-2 positive, earlier than standard testing by an average of 42.2h. Temperature variability of 0.5C over 3days when paired with a 37.2C temperature cutoff identified 55% of NH residents who became SARS-CoV-2 positive earlier than the standard of care testing by an average of 44.4h. A change from baseline temperature of 0.4C when combined with temperature variability of 0.7C over 3days identified 52% of NH residents who became SARS-CoV-2 positive, earlier than standard testing by an average of 40h, and by more than 3days in 22% of the residents. This earlier detection comes at the expense of triggering 57,793 tests, as compared to the number of trigger tests ordered in the VA system of 40,691.

Conclusions

Our model suggests that early temperature trends with SARS-CoV-2 infection may identify infection in pre-symptomatic long-term care residents.

### Effects of rapid detection of bloodstream infections on length of hospitalization and hospital charges [^2587f742]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

Current automated continuous-monitoring blood culture systems afford more rapid detection of bacteremia and fungemia than is possible with non-instrument-based manual methods. Use of these systems has not been studied objectively with respect to impact on patient outcomes, including hospital charges and length of hospitalization. We conducted a prospective, two-center study in which the time from the obtainment of the initial positive blood culture until the Gram stain was called was evaluated for 917 cases of bloodstream infection. Factors showing univariate associations with a shorter time to notification included higher body temperature and respiratory rate and higher percentage of immature neutrophils. Multiple linear regression models determined that the primary predictors of both increased microbiology laboratory and total hospital charges for patients with bloodstream infection were nonmicrobiologic and included length of stay and host factors such as the admitting service and underlying illness score. Significant microbiologic predictors of increased charges included the number of blood cultures obtained, nosocomial acquisition, and polymicrobial bloodstream infections. Accelerated failure time regression analysis demonstrated that microbiologic factors, including time until notification, organism group, and nosocomial acquisition, were independently associated with length of hospitalization after bacteremia, as were the factors of admitting service, gender, and age. Our data suggest that an increased time to notification of bloodstream infection is independently associated with increased length of stay. We conclude that the time to notification is an obvious target for efforts to shorten length of stay. The newest generation of automated continuous-monitoring blood culture systems, which shorten the time required to obtain a positive result, should impact length of hospitalization.

### The environment has effects on infrared temperature screening for COVID-19 infection [^f097e04c]. American Journal of Infection Control (2021). Medium credibility.

Infrared temperature measurement is a common form of mass screening for febrile illnesses such as COVID-19 infection. Efficacy of infrared monitoring is debated, and external factors can affect accuracy. We determine that outside temperature, wind, and humidity can affect infrared temperature measurements and partially account for inaccurate results.

### Impaired performance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests at elevated and low temperatures [^ff0bffb0]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Additionally, analytical specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs under recommended storage and operating conditions and under tropical storage and operating conditions at 37 °C (settings (i) and (v); Fig. 2 A) was examined by testing for cross-reactivity with the ubiquitous human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs showed no cross-reactivity with HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43 upon storage and testing at elevated temperatures (Table 3).

Analytical specificity of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests at recommended and tropical storage and test operation conditions.

As the national COVID-19 reference laboratory in Germany, we have been contacted by multiple outside testing facilities across Germany reporting an unusually high number of positive SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs. In order to validate the specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs when operated at low outside temperatures, we compared Ag-RDT performance after recommended storage and short-term exposure (30 min) to 2−4 °C prior to testing at 2−4 °C (setting (vii); Fig. 2B) as well as after storage at 2−4 °C followed by test operation at 2−4 °C (setting (viii); Fig. 2B) to Ag-RDT specificity when stored and operated under recommended conditions (setting (i); Fig. 2B). We hereto selected a subset of six Ag-RDTs for reasons of scarcity of tests and urgency to conduct the testing under the weather conditions that prevailed at the time of physicians' reports from external testing stations (Table 1). Two of the six SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs showed impaired specificity (Fig. 4 A) when stored at room temperature, but when exposed to 2−4 °C for 30 min prior to testing at 2−4 °C (condition vii; Fig. 4A) as cross-reactivity with common respiratory viruses, and false-positive results occurred in healthy volunteers in the form of weak, but clearly visible bands (Fig. 4 B). In one test (test I), unspecific reactivity was only observed upon short-term exposure to 2−4 °C followed by test operation at 2−4 °C (condition vii; Fig. 4A), but not after long-term storage at 2−4 °C (condition viii; Fig. 4A). In contrast, the other test which showed non-specific results (test II) yielded almost identically unspecific results after both, short- and long-term storage at 2−4 °C and test operation at 2−4 °C (conditions vii and viii; Fig. 4 A). On the one hand, those data highlight differences between test devices. On the other hand, our results may hint at effects of relatively rapid temperature changes on some tests for unknown reasons, potentially including environmental factors such as condensation. Results were reproducible and functionality of tests was confirmed by determining their LODs using serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (SARS-CoV-2-N) at recommended conditions as previously described.

### Comparison of 3 infrared thermal detection systems and self-report for mass fever screening [^ae449acd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The sensitivity and specificity of screening by using ITDS are determined by the selected fever temperature cutoff, which tends to be 2–3 degrees lower than the standard fever threshold because of differences between skin and core temperatures. Increasing or decreasing sensitivity causes a reciprocal change in specificity. For example, lowering OptoTherm's threshold from the optimal 95.7°F to 94.5°F would achieve almost 100% sensitivity but would reduce specificity to 63.6% and increase the false-positive rate to 36.4%; to reach near 100% specificity with the OptoTherm by using a cutoff of 100°F for ITDS, sensitivity decreases to 6.4%.

Maximizing accuracy by choosing the optimal cutoff with the highest sensitivity and specificity may not be practical in a real-world setting, considering the relative costs of false-positive and false-negative results. In settings where secondary evaluation is available or during a pandemic with high illness severity, ITDS temperature can be set at a lower cutoff to ensure fewer false negatives, each of which represents a potential public health threat. However, setting the cutoff to achieve very high sensitivity can result in many false positives, which could have adverse consequences to the population being screened (e.g. unnecessary travel delays, missed work) and increase the workload of staff who are conducting the screening. In settings where confirmatory testing may not be feasible or high costs may be associated with a false-positive result, a higher ITDS temperature cutoff may be preferable.

### Asymmetric relationship between ambient air temperature and incidence of COVID-19 in the human population [^37c42d33]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

On December 27, 2019, a local hospital in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, notified the Chinese Center for Disease Control and relevant health commissions of a mysterious pneumonic disease cluster. Thus, began the global COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), as declared by the WHO on March 11, 2020. As of September 2021, COVID-19 infection was reported in more than 200 countries and territories, with an average of 4.88 individuals infected each second and 4.7 deaths every minute. Although the etiological pathways of COVID-19 are still emerging, previous studies of coronavirus (notably SARS-CoV-1) human cases in various geographic locations from 2002 to 2004 reported that coronavirus viability and survival on surfaces depended on a combination of temperature and relative humidity. Recent publications – suggest a possible route of transmission of the virus occurring via aerosols. Wang and Dureported individuals becoming infected without contact with known confirmed human cases. Previous laboratory studies have determined that dry air conditions during low ambient air temperatures (with low dew point temperatures) were directly proportional to survival of aerosolized virus. – An interesting finding, shown in Supplemental, is that almost all the studies had suggested a positive association between cold ambient temperature and incidence of COVID-19 in the human population. Yet, observations based on actual COVID-19 occurring in humans at different locations (e.g. within the United States, India, China) indicate that warm temperature may have a similar impact on prevalence of the disease, thus creating a paradox. It raises a critical question concerning the role and relationship of ambient air and dew point temperatures and incidence of COVID-19, which comprise the motivation for this study. Although rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can be attributed to human-to-human interactions, the role of the ambient and built environment, as well as climate and weather processes, in enabling transmission conditions of the virus is not fully understood. Therefore, the objective of this study was to provide a data-driven adaptive assessment on: 1) association of ambient air and dew point temperature with respect to the incidence of COVID-19 in the human population and 2) development of a generalizable heuristic (across geographic boundaries) hypothesis using the information derived and validated from early epicenters of this disease. Resolution of these issues will be helpful in developing an experimental climate-informed hypothesis translatable to a predictive model for estimating the risk of infection in humans.

Data inclusion

For analyses, we only include participants' data who had at least two days of valid data within the seven days leading to a positive COVID-19 test and valid data the night before the participant reported a symptom. This is enforced to train and test the models on data that are close to the reported symptom/diagnosis label without gaps in evaluation windows. Negative, or healthy, windows are derived from periods before the first positive event for each participant, with a 2-week offset. These negative windows are from periods without any reported symptoms or positive COVID-19 results and are the same length as positive windows to ensure the proper calculation of metrics. We use these windows to evaluate the efficacy of our models and techniques which allow for prediction of COVID-19 prior to diagnosis and detection of symptoms related to COVID-19 (see Methods). No participant data were ever present in both training and testing simultaneously and no participant was ever selected for multiple testing folds. Out of the 358 COVID-19 positive cases, 141 positive cases follow the data inclusion criteria. Furthermore, user symptom reports are also evaluated, with 281 users reporting fever and 184 reporting shortness of breath. Of these reports, a subset of 140 and 86 users are selected for symptom detection analysis due to the same inclusion criteria. In total, 357 negative and 141 positive evaluation windows are included for COVID-19, 310 negative and 86 positive evaluation windows for shortness of breath, 442 negative and 96 positive evaluation windows for elevated temperature, and 236 negative and 44 positive evaluation windows for fever. All negative and positive evaluation windows were selected from participants that had at least one (1) positive evaluation window. This was to enforce that there existed both positive and negative evaluation windows for each participant, ensuring an evaluation of event detection at both the participant and population levels. It should be noted that because of this, positivity rates in the selected participants' data may not match those found in other works such as Natarajan et al. The supplementary analysis shown in Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Table 1 explores the false-positive rates (FPR) obtained when expanding the COVID-19 cohort to participants without a positive evaluation window.

### Extremes of summer climate trigger thousands of thermokarst landslides in a high arctic environment [^69246ce5]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Modelled RTS initiation rates for the 21 st Century, represented as the decadal means of 100 model runs, increase from 1616 (95% confidence 660–4370) in 2016–2025, to 11,580 (95% confidence 2693–63,821) in 2086–2095 (Fig. 9). These predictions indicate, therefore, that a further order of magnitude increase in RTS numbers could occur by the end of the 21 st century. This forecast requires examination because several factors could intervene to affect the empirical relationships on which it is based.

First, it is possible that the relationship in Fig. 2d could be affected downwards by geomorphic change associated with greater RTS activity. Sedimentation in river valleysmight raise the local base level and create negative feedback to prevent or slow down renewed initiation. Our observations, however, are that sedimentation of sufficient magnitude to be visible in Timelapse imagery, generally occurs well downstream of RTS sources where rivers debouch from narrow valleys and water velocities likely slow (Supplementary Video 9). Few RTS are present in these lower reaches of rivers. Furthermore, RTS initiated at coasts, on lakes or on slopes are not subject to this type of base level change. Consequently, while we cannot rule out this source of negative feedback, we believe that its impact on future activity will be minor.

Second, warm summers, occurring at a sub-decadal frequency in the future, might individually have less of an impact on RTS initiation. This hypothesis is based on the idea that deep thaw in antecedent years would reduce ice contents in the transient layer, diminishing the likelihood that repeated high rates of late-summer thaw would generate elevated porewater pressures. This possibility is supported by the number of new RTS appearing in the southern part of Banks Island in 1999 and 2012 (see Fig. 6). Nearly 1000 RTS were first observed in the earlier year when the weighted July–August air temperature index for Sachs Harbour was 8.1 °C, while half that number (487) appeared in 2012, even though the index was higher (9.1 °C). This suggests that the response to the 1 °C increase may have been dampened by the deep thaw 13 years earlier. On the other hand, hundreds of RTS were initiated in all parts of the island as a result of three successive warm summers (2010–2012) (Fig. 6b) demonstrating that even if dampened, numbers remained high.

Monitoring of sterilizers — use mechanical, chemical, and biologic monitors to ensure the effectiveness of the sterilization process. Category IB. Monitor each load with mechanical (e.g., time, temperature, pressure) and chemical (internal and external) indicators; if the internal chemical indicator is visible, an external indicator is not needed. Category II. Do not use processed items if the mechanical (e.g., time, temperature, pressure) or chemical (internal and/or external) indicators suggest inadequate processing. Category IB. Use biologic indicators to monitor the effectiveness of sterilizers at least weekly with an FDA-cleared commercial preparation of spores (e.g. Geobacillus stearothermophilus for steam) intended specifically for the type and cycle parameters of the sterilizer. Category IB. After a positive biologic indicator with steam sterilization, objects other than implantable objects do not need to be recalled because of a single positive spore test unless the sterilizer or the sterilization procedure is defective; if additional spore tests remain positive, consider the items nonsterile and recall and reprocess the items from the implicated load(s). Category II. Use biologic indicators for every load containing implantable items and quarantine items, whenever possible, until the biologic indicator is negative. Category IB.

We repeated this approach across all datasets using sliding windows with 200-year steps and centers spanning 12,000 to 600 yr BP. For each sliding window, the excursion detector was run with a parametric ensemble. The excursion and reference windows were drawn from normal distribution with a mean of 400 years and a standard deviation of 100 years. This choice was informed by the meta-analysis, which indicated a mean excursion duration of 325 ± 170 years, and we chose a window length on the longer side of this range to consistently capture events of this duration. For each parametric ensemble member, the data are linearly detrended over the period that spans both reference windows and the event window. The threshold for excursion detection, in standard deviation units, was also drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 2 and a standard deviation of 0.25. Excursions cannot be analyzed in every window for every dataset; to be considered for analysis, the event window and each reference window must include at least 4 data points, and the linearly detrended autocorrelation (AR1) of the full span (including both reference windows and the event window) for each window must be less than 0.98, a threshold chosen to exclude very highly autocorrelated timeseries which violate the assumptions of the methodology. In all of the cases we checked, the excluded timeseries were statistically interpolated data.

Many datasets in our analysis included multiple temperature- or hydroclimate-sensitive records at the same site, often reflecting multiple proxies or seasonal interpretations. To make the results comparable across sites, we restrict multi-site analyzes to only one result for each location, time period, and climate variable. Rather than choosing which timeseries to use a priori, and potentially missing excursions or mischaracterizing an event in a region, we took a conservative approach (likely to find more excursions) by calculating the likelihood of excursion for all timeseries, and using the most significant result for each site. This procedure overestimates the significance, but guards against false negative results.

To quantify the weighted fraction of excursions across the entire dataset (Fig. 3), we calculate the excursion fraction for each dataset, and then calculate a global weighted average to account for variable spatial density. The weights are calculated as 1/n, where n is the number of datasets within hexagonal equal area grid cells with 500 km spacing between adjacent grid centers. This procedure is repeated with the synthetic data to calculate 95% confidence intervals for global weighted mean probability.

Evolution and distribution of NBEs.

a Height and occurrence variations of NBEs. Blue and red triangles represent negative and positive NBEs, respectively. The identification of NBEs and error evaluation for the NBE height are given in Methods. b Histogram for the height of NBEs and the inferred charge region; blue for the negative charge region and red for the positive charge region based on the temperature profile obtained from the balloon sounding profile. c Time series of positive NBEs and negative NBEs, respectively; the time bin size is 5 min. d Histogram of the proportion of the dominant number of positive or negative polarity to the total number (PDP). The grid with the sum of NBEs larger than 5 and at least one negative NBE is counted. A total of 115 grids meet the criteria and are used to count the histogram of the proportion of PDP.

From Fig. 2a, we note that the dominant polarity of NBEs appears to alternate with time. Positive NBEs occur at the beginning of the storm, peaking just before 17:00 UTC where negative NBEs take over. Between 17:10 UTC and 17:40 UTC, positive NBEs occur sporadically whereas negative NBEs occur at a high rate. This alternating pattern continues throughout the sequence. This is further illustrated in Fig. 2c, which presents the number of NBEs, positive and negative in 5-min bins, with time.

We further quantify the relation between positive and negative NBEs by considering cells of 25 × 25 km² and 5-min consecutive time bins. In each space-time cell, we determine the proportion of the dominant number of positive or negative Polarity to the total number (PDP), which is defined as the number of NBEs of the dominant polarity to the total number of NBEs. A larger PDP indicates a larger difference in the proportion of positive and negative NBEs, suggesting greater competition between positive and negative NBEs during a given period (see "Methods", subsection definition of PDP). We require a minimum of five events and at least one negative polarity. In all, 115 values are determined. A histogram of PDP values is shown in Fig. 2d. More than 80% of the space-time cells have PDP -values greater than 0.75, suggesting that one polarity dominates and the strong competition relation of NBEs polarities.

### THOR-AABB working party recommendations for a prehospital blood product transfusion program [^3e105d1a]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2021). High credibility.

Prehospital blood product cooler validation and temperature monitoring — coolers are often validated for a period of 12 hours to permit flexibility and reduce wastage, and continuous internal ambient air temperature monitoring obviates the need to validate the cooler for a specified storage period. Coolers should be periodically revalidated for the desired internal ambient air temperature range if continuous monitoring is not performed, and blood products must be packed underneath the coolant material to avoid exceeding the maximum permitted temperature. A cooler validated for 12 hours for indoor hospital use might not maintain appropriate temperature outside the hospital, so validation at extremes of anticipated external temperature is recommended or continuous internal ambient air temperature monitoring should be used. If validation is not performed, the cooler's internal ambient air temperature can be monitored directly by an air temperature thermometer, and a surrogate method using a saline bag with a sticker-thermometer may be employed provided the bag is not infused and the indicator has not turned positive. The cooler's internal ambient air temperature should be verified before products are removed and transfused; if it is in excess of the maximum permitted temperature, blood products should not be used and the products in the cooler at the time limits were exceeded must be discarded. A root cause analysis should be performed if a cooler fails to maintain the required internal ambient air temperature within its validated time period.

### Compound mortality impacts from extreme temperatures and the COVID-19 pandemic [^912f8107]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Heatwaves and cold snaps before 2016

Throughout this study, we focused on heatwaves and cold snaps when extreme temperatures have the largest mortality impacts. The dates of these events were extracted from the UKHSA Heatwave Mortality Reports and historical Level 3 Cold Health Alerts, as mentioned in the main text. However, these reports and the alerts record available to us only started in 2016, so we found the dates of heatwaves and cold snaps based on the same criteria for the period 2010–2015 for Fig. 3. For heatwaves, we found days on which there was a UKHSA Level 3 Heat Health Alert, or days with a mean central England temperature greater than 20 °C, plus one day before and after the time period identified through the first two criteria. The 2010–2015 heatwaves defined this way were published in the literature. For cold snaps, we found periods during which any region in England and Wales had an average temperature below 2 °C for two consecutive days or more. This follows the temperature criterion for a Level 3 Cold Health Alert in 2016.

### Pitfalls in diagnosing temperature extremes [^ae5caa31]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Worsening temperature extremes are among the most severe impacts of human-induced climate change. These extremes are often defined as rare events that exceed a specific percentile threshold within the distribution of daily maximum temperature. The percentile-based approach is chosen to follow regional and seasonal temperature variations so that extremes can occur globally and in all seasons, and frequently uses a running seasonal window to increase the sample size for the threshold calculation. Here, we show that running seasonal windows as used in many studies in recent years introduce a time-, region-, and dataset-depended bias that can lead to a striking underestimation of the expected extreme frequency. We reveal that this bias arises from artificially mixing the mean seasonal cycle into the extreme threshold and propose a simple solution that essentially eliminates it. We then use the corrected extreme frequency as reference to show that the bias also leads to an overestimation of future heatwave changes by as much as 30% in some regions. Based on these results we stress that running seasonal windows should not be used without correction for estimating extremes and their impacts.

### Rapid increase in the risk of heat-related mortality [^38e5759f]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Heat-related mortality has been identified as one of the key climate extremes posing a risk to human health. Current research focuses largely on how heat mortality increases with mean global temperature rise, but it is unclear how much climate change will increase the frequency and severity of extreme summer seasons with high impact on human health. In this probabilistic analysis, we combined empirical heat-mortality relationships for 748 locations from 47 countries with climate model large ensemble data to identify probable past and future highly impactful summer seasons. Across most locations, heat mortality counts of a 1-in-100 year season in the climate of 2000 would be expected once every ten to twenty years in the climate of 2020. These return periods are projected to further shorten under warming levels of 1.5°C and 2°C, where heat-mortality extremes of the past climate will eventually become commonplace if no adaptation occurs. Our findings highlight the urgent need for strong mitigation and adaptation to reduce impacts on human lives.

### Weather variables and Japanese encephalitis in the metropolitan area of jinan city, China [^e4f67983]. The Journal of Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify weather-related risk factors and their roles in Japanese encephalitis transmission and to provide policy implications for local health authorities and communities.

Methods

Data on notified cases of Japanese encephalitis and weather variables over the period 1959–1979 were collected from Jinan city, a temperate city in China. Due to seasonality of the disease, the data analysis was restricted to five months from June to October each year. Spearman correlation analysis and time-series adjusted Poisson regression analysis were performed to quantify the relationship between weather and the number of cases. The Hockey Stick model was used to detect potential threshold temperatures.

Results

Monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures, monthly total rainfall and monthly mean relative humidity were positively correlated to monthly notification of Japanese encephalitis, while monthly mean air pressure was inversely correlated. Lag times varied from one to two months. All these weather variables were significant in the adjusted Poisson regression model. Thresholds of 25.2 degrees C for maximum temperature and 21.0 degrees C for minimum temperature were also detected.

Conclusions

Weather variables could have affected the transmission of Japanese encephalitis in this urban area of China. Public health interventions should be developed at this stage to reduce future risks related to climate change.

### Asymmetric relationship between ambient air temperature and incidence of COVID-19 in the human population [^65e45e73]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Four epicenters of COVID-19 (Daegu, South Korea; Munich, Germany; Tehran, Iran; and Wuhan, China) were selected to determine the ambient and dew point temperature relationship with temperature COVID-19 cases. On the basis of evidence from the literature, symptoms for COVID-19 begin to appear in humans within a median range of 4.1 days of exposure. Therefore, the analysis used an average of 4 days before known index cases being reported in a region to determine the association of air and dew point temperatures. The goal was to establish if it was possible to identify climatic and weather patterns occurring before time of the report, based on best available information, of human index case(s).

In December 2019, the first case of COVID-19 was reported (approximately December 1, 2019) in Wuhan, China, and an exponential rise in the number of human cases quickly followed. In late November and early December 2019, Wuhan experienced a negative 4-day average value in dew point temperature (Figure 1A), and cases began to increase thereafter (a reliable time series of human cases is not available; hence, the heuristic argument is presented here). Daegu is a city in North Gyeongsang province of South Korea and was the epicenter of COVID-19 in that country. The city faced an exponential increase in number of reported cases in February 2020 and experienced a 4-day average subzero dew point temperature (Figure 1B). The other two outbreak epicenters included in this study (Tehran, Iran, and Munich, Germany) revealed consistent climatic conditions (Figure 1) — namely, negative dew point temperature prior to the COVID-19 outbreak (Figure 1). Because COVID-19 prevalence time series were available in the United States, four major outbreak centers (New York City, NY; Jersey City, NJ; Detroit, MI; and Los Angeles, CA) were selected for analysis. Beginning January 17, 2020, New York City did not record a positive dewpoint temperature for several consecutive days (Figure 2A), instead it had negative dew point temperatures until the end of May 2020. For the first 3 months of 2020, these four U.S. cities experienced below 0°C dewpoint temperatures (Figure 2). Figure 2 shows an approximate best available date (indicated by the red line) when the first index cases were reported for these four cities, which was during the time period when dew point temperatures were below 0°C.

Modified Duke criteria — major and minor criteria for IE diagnosis include major criteria of blood culture positivity for typical microorganisms from 2 separate blood cultures, or microorganisms consistent with IE from persistently positive blood culture results defined as at least 2 positive culture results of blood samples drawn 12 h apart or all of 3 or most of ≥ 4 separate culture samples of blood with first and last samples drawn at least 1 h apart, or a single positive blood culture result for Coxiella burnetii or antiphase I IgG antibody titer ≥ 1:800; evidence of endocardial involvement includes echocardiogram positive for IE with oscillating intracardiac mass, abscess, new partial dehiscence of prosthetic valve, or new valvular regurgitation (worsening or changing of preexisting murmur not sufficient). Minor criteria include predisposition (predisposing heart condition or injection drug use), fever with temperature ≥ 38°C (100.4°F), vascular phenomena, immunological phenomena, and microbiological evidence that does not meet a major criterion; single positive cultures for coagulase-negative staphylococci and organisms that do not cause IE are excluded.

Antigen testing in asymptomatic exposed individuals — benefits and harms: The panel placed high value on minimizing the number of false-negative results, especially in higher-risk healthcare settings, and found no evidence that the use of Ag tests reduces transmission of SARS-CoV-2; furthermore, treatment is not recommended for asymptomatic persons. Users of rapid Ag tests may not understand the limits of a negative test; in 1 study, two-thirds of participants believed that they were noninfectious the day following a negative rapid Ag test. Sensitivity is linked to timing of exposure; a negative result may convert to positive within hours early in infection. At 1% prevalence, the number of true-positive Ag test results was small and approximated the number of false-negative results, quantified as 6 true positives and 4 false negatives per 1000 asymptomatic individuals tested.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^85cb2b64]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute Q fever — diagnosis in early illness relies on serology plus PCR; "serologic testing in combination with PCR is recommended". PCR of whole blood or serum can be positive very early but becomes negative as antibody titers rise or after antibiotics. Confirmation most commonly uses a fourfold rise in phase II IgG by IFA between acute and convalescent sera taken 3–6 weeks apart, and ideally the first sample is obtained during the first week of illness; if not, the acute specimen can be stored refrigerated at 4°C [32.9°F] or frozen at ≤ −20°C [−4°F] until the convalescent sample is drawn. Seroconversion typically occurs 7–15 days after symptom onset, and 90% of patients seroconvert by the third week; IgM to phase II develops in the second week with a near-simultaneous increase in phase II IgG. Antibodies might remain detectable for many months, years, or for life, and 3.1% of the general adult U.S. population had detectable antibodies to C. burnetii; in the absence of positive PCR and an acute sample, a single positive convalescent sample with IgG phase II titer ≥ 1:128 in a patient ill > 1 week indicates a probable acute infection. Treatment "should never be withheld pending receipt of diagnostic test results or discontinued because of negative acute serology or PCR result", and because antibodies can persist, "treatment should not be provided based solely on elevated titers… without clinical manifestation of acute illness".

### A cross-sectional analysis of meteorological factors and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 409 cities across 26 countries [^7d689184]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

There is conflicting evidence on the influence of weather on COVID-19 transmission. Our aim is to estimate weather-dependent signatures in the early phase of the pandemic, while controlling for socio-economic factors and non-pharmaceutical interventions. We identify a modest non-linear association between mean temperature and the effective reproduction number (Rₑ) in 409 cities in 26 countries, with a decrease of 0.087 (95% CI: 0.025; 0.148) for a 10°C increase. Early interventions have a greater effect on R e with a decrease of 0.285 (95% CI 0.223; 0.347) for a 5th - 95th percentile increase in the government response index. The variation in the effective reproduction number explained by government interventions is 6 times greater than for mean temperature. We find little evidence of meteorological conditions having influenced the early stages of local epidemics and conclude that population behaviour and government interventions are more important drivers of transmission.

### The projected timing of climate departure from recent variability [^7c9f3d67]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Ecological and societal disruptions by modern climate change are critically determined by the time frame over which climates shift beyond historical analogues. Here we present a new index of the year when the projected mean climate of a given location moves to a state continuously outside the bounds of historical variability under alternative greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Using 1860 to 2005 as the historical period, this index has a global mean of 2069 (± 18years s.d.) for near-surface air temperature under an emissions stabilization scenario and 2047 (± 14years s.d.) under a 'business-as-usual' scenario. Unprecedented climates will occur earliest in the tropics and among low-income countries, highlighting the vulnerability of global biodiversity and the limited governmental capacity to respond to the impacts of climate change. Our findings shed light on the urgency of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions if climates potentially harmful to biodiversity and society are to be prevented.

Heat stroke — Heat stroke is a medical emergency requiring aggressive cooling measures and hospitalization for support. A presumptive diagnosis of heat stroke is made in the field when people have body temperature ≥ 41°C (≥ 104°F) and marked alteration of mental status, including delirium, convulsions, or coma; if a thermometer is available, a rectal temperature is the most reliable way to check the temperature of someone with suspected heat stroke, and an axillary temperature might give a reasonable estimation. Onset can be acute (also known as exertional), characterized by collapse while exercising in the heat, usually with profuse sweating, or gradual or non-exertional (also referred to as classic or epidemic), occurring in chronically ill people experiencing passive exposure to heat over several days. Heat stroke is life-threatening, and many complications occur in the first 24–48 hours, including liver or kidney damage and abnormal bleeding; most victims have significant dehydration, and many require hospital intensive care management to replace fluid losses. If evacuation to a hospital is delayed, patients should be monitored closely for several hours for temperature swings.

### Life histories determine divergent population trends for fishes under climate warming [^b286e1f9]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

We have predicted population growth responses to a warming by 1 °C, a relatively modest degree of warming that is already exceeded in many places. Of course, a population that is able to move poleward or deeper might experience a lesser degree of warming than that observed for a fixed position. Nevertheless, our predictions are best interpreted as proxies of temperature sensitivities, rather than actual responses of specific populations. Similarly, these predictions are subject to uncertainties that reflect the many unknowns in the underlying population processes, yet they are arguably the best predictions that can be derived in the generally data-poor situations that apply to all but a few commercially important fishes.

Our study advances existing knowledge on climate effects on fish populations in several ways. First, our multi-species analysis of temperature effects on life-history traits generalizes previous studies of temperature-life-history patterns for single species (e.g. Atlantic cod Gadus morhua; little skate Leucoraja erinacea,) or for particular species groups (e.g. tunas, reef fish). Also, exploring temperature effects on multiple life-history traits broadens previous studies that primarily focused on the temperature-size relationship only(but see). More importantly, our model highlights the role of natural mortality and fecundity as suggested in previous work, in determining population growth rates. Lastly, the existing assessments of climate impacts on fisheries catch have assumed a constant warming effect on life histories for all fishes. Regarding such assessments, our study provides critical data to account for differential life-history responses under warming, increasing accuracy in the projection of warming impacts on fisheries production.

With rising human demand for seafood, it is important to understand and mitigate the effects of climate change on fish populations. Most present studies suggest that the negative effect of temperature on body size could lead to adverse size-related changes, such as disruption in trophic interactions or reduced reproductive capacity and productivity for fish populations. In contrast, our study demonstrates that rising temperature promotes faster life histories, with positive or negative influences on population growth rates, depending on populations' positions on the slow–fast continuum. Given that recent research has found a mix of positive, negative, and neutral effects of historical climate warming on population growth rate — differing from the forecast results of most existing models — more studies simultaneously evaluating the positive and negative temperature-related effects and incorporating life-history evolution to understand population resilience under changing climate are urgently needed.

### Effect of different storage conditions on COVID-19 RT-PCR results [^3a2be403]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Reliable and rapid detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in laboratory setting is critical to control the pandemic. We aimed to an evaluated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) efficiency of nasopharyngeal swabs stored in viral transport medium (VTM) in different temperatures. Ninety swabs taken into VTM were analyzed at the first hour, then divided into two groups with similar numbers of positive and negative samples. Positive samples of each group were also subgrouped according to Fam CT values as low CT (< 25), medium CT (25–32), and high CT (32–38) groups. One group was stored at 4°C, while the other was stored at room temperature, PCR analyses were repeated every 24h for 5 days and on Day 12. There was a total of 30 positive samples (12 low CT, 11 medium CT, and 7 high CT). The CT values of both groups remained unchanged in first 3 days while the CT values of the room temperature group increased after the third day. All of the positive samples remained positive in both groups for the first 5 days. On the 12th day, the total number of positives decreased to 8 in the room temperature group and 11 in the 4°C groups. All the low CT samples remained positive in both groups. In conclusion, it is safe to store positive samples in room temperature for up to 5 days. Only samples with high viral loads remain positive for 12 days, regardless of whether stored at room temperature or 4°C. Negative samples don't turn to invalid if stored in VTM.

### Efficiency fluctuations and noise induced refrigerator-to-heater transition in information engines [^a95f41ac]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The steady-state average heat supplied to the system 〈 βQ 〉 during the relaxation step is minus the average work performed on the system during the feedback, 〈 βQ 〉 = –(See Supplementary Note 3). This shows that for N < S the system is cooled immediately after the feedback control, and net heat flows from the reservoir to the system during the relaxation. The effective cooling decreases with increasing the error level until N = S at which 〈 βQ 〉 = 0. For N > S, the work performed on the system during the feedback is positive (heating), and net heat flows from the system to the reservoir during the relaxation. Note that our observation of cooling and heating of the system is protocol dependent. As an example, a previous theoretical workshows that for a system initially in thermal equilibrium, the average extracted workis always positive for an optimal protocol where the particle position is instantaneously shifted to y · S /(S + N).

Figure 3a shows the distribution of extracted work – βW in several regimes of engine accuracy. A quasistatic (τ > > τ R) and perfect engine (N = 0) always extracts positive work with an average = 0.498 ± 0.003, in agreement with the theoretical value 0.5 (Eq. 2). Imperfect engines (N > 0) sometimes make mistakes in their feedback and have non-zero probability for negative extracted work. Engines with relatively good accuracy (N < S) rarely make such mistakes and, on average, always extract positive work from the bath, > 0, performing as refrigerators. The distribution becomes symmetric for marginal engines (N = S) which extract no work on average, = 0. At the other extreme, the more erroneous engines (N > S), often shift the trap center too far from the particle, such that the average extracted work is negative, < 0, performing as heaters. Curves of the extracted workas a function of the noise level N /S (Fig. 3b) agree with the theoretical prediction in Eq. (2). The maximal work = 0.5 is extracted by perfect engines whose cycle is long enough to reach equilibrium. While the work extracted by ultrafast engines (τ → 0) vanishes,→ 0, these engines extract maximum average power, P ≡/ τ → (1 – N / S)/ τ R.

### Observed variations in U.S. frost timing linked to atmospheric circulation patterns [^49d60121]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Circulation and warming effects are of course intertwined in the observational record because atmospheric circulation modes both affect and are influenced by large-scale air and sea-surface temperature variability. The fall circulation patterns identified here are modes of variability (principal components) whose positive polarity signalled anomalous ridging in the respective analysis regions, and all four fall patterns had significant positive correlations with hemispheric-scale temperature suggesting they were amplified by warming. The spring circulation patterns were modes of variability whose positive polarity signalled anomalous troughing in the respective analysis regions, and these modes tended to exhibited weaker negative correlation with hemispheric-scale temperature.

Although frost timing is strongly associated with circulation by theory and case study, there is no a priori assurance that circulation patterns can be found that account for more variance than temperature, particularly regional seasonal temperature. The eight patterns identified here are clearly physically plausible drivers of frost timing based on the geographic positioning of their ridging and troughing anomalies, and the importance of these circulation patterns relative to warming speaks to the variance structure of the frost timing indices (that is, trends and low frequency fluctuations we might associate with warming account for less than half the variance of observed frost timing based on spectral decomposition). Based on the sensitivity analysis presented above, the principal finding that circulation consistently accounts for more frost timing variance than hemispheric annual mean or regional seasonal mean temperature does not depend on the number of clusters (k) chosen over the test range.

For future climate change, many studies have investigated how lengthening of the frost-free season could impact ecosystemsand agricultural productivity. Pan-continental teleconnections will likely remain important drivers of frost timing variability, even if large-scale warming shifts their effects toward different days of year. Reliable projection of future variations in growing season length thus depends on global climate model fidelity in representing the spatiotemporal properties of this class of teleconnectionsand how they will respond to large-scale warming.

Society of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Diseases Society of America adult ICU new fever biomarkers guidance states that in critically ill patients with a new fever and no clear focus of infection, when the probability of bacterial infection is low to intermediate, we suggest measuring procalcitonin (PCT) in addition to bedside clinical evaluation versus bedside clinical evaluation alone (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence) and we suggest measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) in addition to bedside clinical evaluation versus bedside clinical evaluation alone (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). When the probability is high, we suggest not measuring PCT to rule out bacterial infection (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence) and we suggest not measuring CRP to rule out bacterial infection (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For low to intermediate probability, we suggest measuring either serum PCT or CRP to rule out bacterial infection (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Biomarkers such as PCT and CRP deployed with rapid turnaround times, have been used as adjuncts in the early diagnosis of sepsis while awaiting microbiologic culture results, major guidelines recommend against routine use of biomarkers in the setting of sepsis and septic shock, out of respect for uncertain benefit and cost and availability issues, and in the setting of fever and lower likelihood of infection, however, there may be a role in obtaining a baseline value to assist in the discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy.

### Extended storage of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs does not negatively impact results of molecular-based testing across three clinical platforms [^10b38410]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Testing delays and laboratory backlogs have contributed to the worsening spread of COVID-19 infections. While the testing situation in the UK and USA is improving, the number of tests performed per 100 000 individuals still lags behind other developed countries such as Denmark and Italy. In an effort to broaden testing capabilities, the US FDA allows some manufacturers to market their assays under the less strenuous review process of EUA. It has been demonstrated for some platforms that manufacturers' claims provided through this more liberal review pathway may significantly overestimate performance characteristics in a true clinical environment.

For these reasons we sought to evaluate the performance of three separate EUA platforms over a lengthy period of time. Our data support others' findings that viral RNA may remain stable for molecular testing for some time. All of the tested platforms, each designed to amplify completely different PCR amplicons, performed extremely well, providing precise Ct values throughout the testing period. Most surprisingly, there was only a very minimal, and clinically insignificant, impact of storage condition on the Ct values for all assays. Storage of pooled material at ambient temperature over this extended time course did not alter the test results. This demonstrated stability may allow laboratories with limited cold storage capabilities to maintain specimens at ambient temperatures without an impact on clinical performance. There do exist some recent data from researchers in China who identified an impact on storage conditions. Their data demonstrated that approximately 20% of their throat swabs were impacted after storage at room temperature, under refrigeration for 1–2 days, 1–2 freeze/thaw cycles and 30 or 60 min of 56°C heat inactivation. It is important to note that several studies have noted that oropharyngeal collections generally yield less viral RNA than those from the nasopharynx. The data from these researchers also support these results as more than half of the samples used in that study had significantly elevated Ct values at the upper range of detection, between 35 and 40 cycles. Additionally, most of the samples whose results were listed as not consistent still demonstrated positivity of one out of two SARS-CoV-2 viral target genes and thus would still be reported as presumptive positive in most clinical laboratories. Finally, samples with such late Ct values may have virus present below the limit of detection for the assay, at which point the reproducibility of the original result can be called into question.

### Changes in semantic memory structure support successful problem-solving and analogical transfer [^5231072f]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In our daily life, we constantly deal with problems, ranging from the most mundane (e.g. what to cook for dinner given the ingredients at our disposal), to professional activities (e.g. how to reorganize our current plans to meet a new deadline), up to major societal challenges (e.g. how to find innovative solutions against global warming). How do we find new solutions to problems? While the ability to solve problems is a critical skill for adapting to new situations and innovating, the mechanisms underlying the problem-solving process remain largely unknown.

Among the new problems we face each day, some are well-defined (e.g. playing a jigsaw puzzle). The initial state (i.e. the number of independent pieces) and goal state (i.e. assembling the pieces so it looks like the picture model) are clear, and the solver can apply a set of operations (i.e. interlocking the pieces as a function of their shape) to reach the goal. However, for many of our problems (e.g. organizing work activities during the COVID-19 pandemic), the problem space is ambiguous. No heuristics or existing rules could be applied to transform the initial state into the goal state. Such "ill-defined" problemsthus require additional mental processes, which have been tightly linked to creative thinking –. Ill-defined problem-solving (or creative problem-solving) is often referred to as insight solving, where the solution comes to mind suddenly and effortlessly, with a "Eureka" phenomenon –. According to the Representational Change Theory, solving such problems involves restructuring the initial problem mental representational space, which presumably entails combining elements related to the problem in a new way. In theory, restructuring allows one to change perspective, reframe the problem, or escape its implicitly imposed constraints, leading to creative associations. For instance, consider the following problem: "A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender points a shotgun at the man. The man says, 'Thank you', and walks out". The problem is ill-defined because the path to finding the solution is to be discovered, and the goal state is vague. Solving this problem first requires asking the right question: in which context would a shotgun and a glass of water help somebody? Rather than relying on obvious associations (e.g. a glass of water is related to thirst), solvers must fill the missing link between the relevant elements of the problem (a shotgun induces fear, and fear can be a remedy for hiccups, as can drinking a glass of water). Hence, restructuring the initial representation of a given problem would allow one to see this link and find its solution.

### Compound mortality impacts from extreme temperatures and the COVID-19 pandemic [^b494f213]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 3
Maps of the total number of deaths per 100,000 population from non-optimal temperatures and COVID-19 during extreme temperature events, and the comparison of these number before and during the study period.

Panels (a) and (b) show regional sums of temperature-related and COVID-19 deaths on 70 heatwave days (in a total of 10 heatwaves; panel (a)) and 70 cold snap days (in a total of 8 cold snaps; panel (b)), during the study period of 30 January 2020 to 31 December 2022. Panels (c) and (d) show regional numbers of temperature-related deaths on the same number of heatwaves (panel (c)) and cold snap days (panel (d)) but from the period 2010–2019. The numbers in panels c and d are estimated from the average number of temperature-related deaths per heatwave or cold snap day in the period 2010–2019, multiplied by 70 days. Panels (e) and (f) show regional ratios of deaths during the study period to the 2010–2019 period for heatwaves (panel (e)) and cold snaps (panel (f)).

These compound mortality levels are put into context by comparing Fig. 3a with Fig. 3c, which shows the reference levels of heat-related mortality from 70 heatwave days, calculated from the average of all identified heatwaves in the ten years that preceded COVID-19 (i.e. 2010–2019; see "Methods"). Substantially fewer heat-related deaths occurred during 70 heatwave days in 2010–2019, with the regional number ranging from 6 deaths per 100,000 people (95% confidence interval: 3–8) in North West England, to 14 deaths per 100,000 people (95% confidence interval: 12–15) in London.

### Impaired performance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests at elevated and low temperatures [^41a426a1]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) can complement molecular diagnostics for COVID-19. The recommended temperature for storage of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs ranges between 2–30 °C. In the global South, mean temperatures can exceed 30 °C. In the global North, Ag-RDTs are often used in external testing facilities at low ambient temperatures. We assessed analytical sensitivity and specificity of eleven commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using different storage and operational temperatures, including short- or long-term storage and operation at recommended temperatures or at either 2–4 °C or at 37 °C. The limits of detection of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs under recommended conditions ranged from 1.0×10⁶–5.5×10⁷ genome copies/mL of infectious SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant. Despite long-term storage at recommended conditions, 10 min pre-incubation of Ag-RDTs and testing at 37 °C resulted in about ten-fold reduced sensitivity for five out of 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, including both Ag-RDTs currently listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization. After 3 weeks of storage at 37 °C, eight of the 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs exhibited about ten-fold reduced sensitivity. Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using cell culture supernatant from common respiratory viruses was not affected by storage and testing at 37 °C, whereas false-positive results occurred at outside temperatures of 2–4 °C for two out of six tested Ag-RDTs, again including an Ag-RDT recommended by the WHO. In summary, elevated temperatures impair sensitivity, whereas low temperatures impair specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs. Consequences may include false-negative test results at clinically relevant virus concentrations compatible with transmission and false-positive results entailing unwarranted quarantine assignments. Storage and operation of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs at recommended conditions is essential for successful usage during the pandemic.

### Effects of storage temperature and media / buffer for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection [^35b96ccf]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The increase in the number of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has delayed real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), requiring proper shipping and storage conditions, especially in hot weather. This study aims to assess how some conditions, such as storage period, temperature, media or buffer, and sample types, affect the results of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-qPCR.

Methods

SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens were collected from Boramae Medical Center for 2 months (from May to June 2020) and stored in different media or buffers at different temperatures.

Results

As a result of examining confirmed patient samples, RT-qPCR results were not significantly affected by 2°C to 8°C storage until after 7 days. When stored at 20°C to 22°C or above 35°C, the results were affected negatively even after 1 day. Higher storage temperatures resulted in a lower probability of detecting viral nucleic acids because of degradation. Samples stored in pH-controlled media or buffer were more stable than those stored in nonbuffer states.

Conclusions

These results emphasize the importance of storage temperature and media or buffer and performing RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection as soon as possible after sample collection.

### Impaired performance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests at elevated and low temperatures [^c87e68d6]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Advantages of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) include fast results and their applicability on site without dependence on laboratory settings. With a constantly growing number of commercially available Ag-RDTs on the global market, the number of studies validating Ag-RDTs from different manufacturers is increasing rapidly. However, none have interrogated the performance of Ag-RDTs under conditions that differ from supplier-recommended storage and operation conditions (2−30 °C), such as those observed in tropical settings where ambient temperatures routinely exceed 30 °C (Fig. 1 A). This is challenging because tropical regions are strongly affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as evident from total cases reported from India, Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia, four out of the ten most affected countries worldwide by November 2020 (Fig. 1 B).

Fig. 1

World map representing global temperature distribution based on maximum temperature of the warmest month (°C) freely available from WorldClim 2. B. Graph represents total COVID-19 cases in the ten most affected countries globally by 25 th of November 2020.

On the other hand, the global North was heavily affected by the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic during November 2020-February 2021. To manage testing demand, different actors have opened external testing stations such as diagnostic streets or drive-through facilities in urban settings. These facilities are often of provisional nature, for example in the form of unheated tents. In the winter months, temperatures in Europe or the U.S. can range from -10 °C to 10 °C, well below the recommended operating temperatures of most Ag-RDTs. Most manufacturers of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs specify storage conditions between 2−30 °C, but stipulate that tests be equilibrated to room temperature (15−30 °C) at the time of use to guarantee performance. With temperatures around freezing point during the winter months, unheated testing facilities cannot always comply with these conditions. Temperature tolerance of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tools or environmental stability requirements have been previously discussed as hurdles to be addressed according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

To validate the performance of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs in both, tropical and cold settings, we compared analytical sensitivity and specificity using recommended conditions and either elevated or low temperatures.

Results

Global trends in heatwave characteristics

A previous attempt to address global observed heatwave changesemployed the HadGHCNDdataset and computed trends for 1950−2011. Although a plethora of metrics exist, we define heatwaves using a consistent methodological framework. This is when at least 3 consecutive days are above a percentile-based extreme threshold over a 5-month warm season (see "Methods"). We assess changes in heatwave frequency, duration and intensity, and also trends in seasonal cumulative heat, briefly expressed as the sum of the temperature anomaly relative to the respective heatwave threshold, across all heatwave days within the season (see "Methods" for more detailed explanations of heatwave characteristics). The cumulative heat metric provides additional and relevant information for impactsthat is presented here at global and regional scales, alongside the more traditional heatwave metrics used in climate-based studies.

Background — SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics context: In late December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia cases of unclear etiology was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, and based on genetic similarities, the novel coronavirus was officially named SARS-CoV-2; by March 11th, 2020, the virus had spread to at least 114 countries and killed more than 4,000 people, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a global pandemic. Public availability of the SARS-CoV-2 genome enabled development of accurate molecular diagnostic assays; on February 4, 2020, the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services announced that circumstances existed justifying authorization of the emergency use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests, and commercial manufacturers and clinical laboratories were required to submit details about their assays to the U.S. FDA for review and Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).

### Climatic conditions are weak predictors of asylum migration [^22ed7a30]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Data structure and predictors

We construct an empirical dataset with yearly observations of 175 independent countries worldwide for all valid years (1999–2018). As the outcome variable, we measure the total number of first-time asylum applications submitted to any EU member state (EU-28) from each country of origin in each calendar year. The variable is adjusted for population size in country of origin. In Supplementary Information Section 3.9, we document results from a global analysis using stock data of asylum applications.

To evaluate the importance of climatic conditions in predicting asylum migration, relative to economic and violence-related factors, we classify three substantive components that represent complementary dimensions of theorized drivers. The emphasis here is on time-varying conditions in countries of origin that best predict the onset of forced migration. The climate component captures weather-related impacts on rural and urban economic activities, as theoretical models of climate-driven migration give prominence to economic mechanisms. Effects on agricultural productivity are proxied via positive and negative deviations in the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). We use the 3-month version (SPEI-3), measured exclusively for cropland areas during the local growing-season months, to ensure that the predictors reflect climatic conditions shortly prior to and including the current growing season, and ignore weather conditions during other parts of the year. Severe growing-season drought can cripple rural livelihood and income, especially in rain-fed agricultural systems, whereas above-average rainfall in these regions typically results in a generous harvest. To account for recurring anomalies, we also include positive and negative deviations in 3-year moving average SPEI-3 scores. Further, to capture weather-related impacts on non-agricultural economic activities, we include annual mean temperature. The temperature predictor is weighted by local population density before aggregation to the country level, to represent the sensitivity of urban economies (e.g. worker productivity). Anomalous temperatures and severe drought have been linked to a range of negative human security outcomesand the variables included here capture both short-term shocks and multi-year anomalies.

### Hourly step recommendations to achieve daily goals for working and older adults [^45deacdb]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Studies have shown that prompts are an effective intervention in changing step behaviour for most participants. As different demographic groups exercise at different timings (e.g. working versus older adults), personalised prompts may be more beneficial at specific times convenient for individuals. We provide the step counts that participants should achieve in the evenings to ensure they achieve the daily step goals (5000, 7500, or 10,000 steps) by the end of the day (Table 3 and Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). These recommendations could then be experimentally tested in future studies.

The results suggest that the daily step goals (5000, 7500, or 10,000 steps) influenced the steps behaviour of the participants. The number of participant days rose sharply from 1090 (2.08%) with 9500–9999 steps to 7507 (14.3%) with 10,000 to 10,499 steps (Fig. 1a). The increase in the HealthPoints earned (from 25 (7500–9999 steps) to 40 (10,000 steps and above) HealthPoints) would reduce the days required to complete the first tier from 30 to 19 days (Supplementary Table S1). By setting a 10,000 daily step goal, participants whose daily step counts were just below 10,000 could have been motivated by the incentives to put in extra effort to achieve the goal, leading to the observed spike. However, we also observed a decreasing number of participant days after each goal, which may indicate that participants lose motivation once the goal has been achieved.

### Environmental control on the productivity of a heavily fished ecosystem [^7e943490]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fig. 2
The Newfoundland and Labrador Climate Index (NLCI).

The NLCI (unitless) is the average of 10 environmental time series: the Winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, air temperature (Air Temp), sea ice season duration and maximum area, the number of icebergs drifting on the NL shelves, sea surface temperature (SST) of the NL shelves, vertically averaged temperature (T) and salinity (S) at Station 27 (S27), cold intermediate layer (CIL) core temperature at Station 27, summer CIL area on the hydrographic sections Seal Island, Bonavista Bay and Flemish Cap, and spring and fall bottom temperatures in NAFO Div. 3LNOPs and 2HJ3KLNO (See Cyr and Galbraith, 2021 for details). The relative contribution of each sub-index to the NLCI is proportional to the length of each bar in the stacked bar plot, while the averaged value is reported in a scorecard at the bottom of the figure. Different climate phases are identified with orange and blue shades for warm and cold, respectively. A new phase is identified when the NLCI is positive or negative for at least three successive years. Qualitative information on the fisheries during the different climate phases has been added with black arrows.

Eight climate phases, generally characterized by warmer or colder ocean conditions, were identified between 1951 and 2017 (orange and blue shades in Fig. 2). A ninth warm and potentially more productive climate phase has emerged since 2018. Although its effect on fish stocks has yet to be quantified, some signs of improvement in the finfish community have already been detected (see Discussion). These phases are driven by large-scale atmospheric conditions, shown here with mean sea level pressure (SLP) anomalies over the northern hemisphere (Fig. 3). Phases characterized by warmer climate (1951–1971, 1979–1981, 1999–2006, and 2010–2013) have mostly positive SLP anomalies above the pole and negative anomalies in the subtropics (except the 1999–2006 phase, where the patterns are unclear). In contrast, the phases characterized by a colder climate (1972–1978, 1982–1998, 2007–2009, and 2014–2017) all have negative SLP anomalies above the pole and positive anomalies in the subtropics.

### Randomised evaluation of active control of temperature versus ordinary temperature management (REACTOR) trial [^14a50a29]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

It is unknown whether protocols targeting systematic prevention and treatment of fever achieve lower mean body temperature than usual care in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The objective of the Randomised Evaluation of Active Control of temperature vs. ORdinary temperature management trial was to confirm the feasibility of such a protocol with a view to conducting a larger trial.

Methods

We randomly assigned 184 adults without acute brain pathologies who had a fever in the previous 12 h, and were expected to be ventilated beyond the calendar day after recruitment, to systematic prevention and treatment of fever or usual care. The primary outcome was mean body temperature in the ICU within 7 days of randomisation. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality, ICU-free days and survival time censored at hospital discharge.

Results

Compared with usual temperature management, active management significantly reduced mean temperature. In both groups, fever generally abated within 72 h. The mean temperature difference between groups was greatest in the first 48 h, when it was generally in the order of 0.5 °C. Overall, 23 of 89 patients assigned to active management (25.8%) and 23 of 89 patients assigned to usual management (25.8%) died in hospital (odds ratio 1.0, 95% CI 0.51–1.96, P = 1.0). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in ICU-free days or survival to day 90.

Conclusions

Active temperature management reduced body temperature compared with usual care; however, fever abated rapidly, even in patients assigned to usual care, and the magnitude of temperature separation was small.

### High temperature delays and low temperature accelerates evolution of a new protein phenotype [^c572e630]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Another possible explanation is that proteins expressed at a lower temperature are more stable than they need to be – they have excess folding stability – because the slower and less disruptive molecular motions at that temperature are less likely to disrupt a protein fold. This hypothesis creates several predictions. First, our stabilizing mutations should preferentially increase protein solubility at high temperature, but less so at medium or low temperature. This is indeed the case (Fig. 3a). They increase solubility on average 66.4-fold at high temperature, 3.0-fold at medium temperature, but do not significantly affect solubility at low temperature (Fig. 3a). We observed a similar solubility increase in a cell-free expression system that only contained the components necessary for in vitro transcription and translation. Specifically, in this cell-free system all three stabilizing mutations increase solubility on average 10.3-fold at high temperature, but only 2.4-fold at medium temperature and 1.9-fold at low temperature (Fig. S8). The difference in magnitude between the in vivo and in vitro solubility improvement might be due to the fact that the in vivo environment contains chaperones and proteases, which can affect the folding and degradation of different variants to a different extent. Even though the proteins we study are thermally highly stable (T m > 70 °C), a stabilizing mutation that increases the melting temperature by a few degrees can increase the amount of soluble fluorescent proteins at 44 °C more than 60-fold (Fig. 3a). The reason is that elevated temperature does not just cause inactivation of the mature protein (quantified by T m) but it can also interfere with the post-translational maturation of GFP.

### Specific patterns of postoperative temperature elevations predict blood infection in pediatric burn patients [^6ff949a1]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Using readily available temperature data, we seek to propose a scoring criteria that can facilitate accurate and immediate prediction of blood infection. The standard in diagnosing blood infection is a positive blood culture result that may take up to 3 days to process, requiring providers to make a prediction about which febrile patient is actually bacteremic. This prediction is difficult in burned children as systemic inflammation can cause fever in the absence of infection. An ability to make this prediction more accurate using readily available information would be useful. A retrospective chart review was performed for 28 pediatric patients, with a burn size 20% or greater, admitted to the burn unit between 2010 and 2014. All children had blood cultures drawn. They were divided into either infection (positive blood cultures) or control (negative blood cultures) groups. Median temperature and mean number of temperature elevations were compared between the two groups. We evaluated the predictive accuracy of using temperature elevation, pattern, and timing to predict blood infection. A significant difference was seen in the mean number of temperature elevations above 39°C. This was significant for each time stage, especially in the 0- to 24-hour post-surgery period. We found the most predictive accuracy in the 0- to 12-, 12- to 38-, and 12- to 48-hour time periods. We found a strong association between mean number of fever spikes above 39°C and blood infection, especially 12 to 24 hours after surgery. This readily available data can be useful to clinicians as they access children with burns.

### Interventions for treating inadvertent postoperative hypothermia [^7a25098f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Inadvertent postoperative hypothermia (a drop in core body temperature to below 36°C) occurs as an effect of surgery when anaesthetic drugs and exposure of the skin for long periods of time during surgery result in interference with normal temperature regulation. Once hypothermia has occurred, it is important that patients are rewarmed promptly to minimise potential complications. Several different interventions are available for rewarming patients.

Objectives

To estimate the effectiveness of treating inadvertent perioperative hypothermia through postoperative interventions to decrease heat loss and apply passive and active warming systems in adult patients who have undergone surgery.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 2), MEDLINE (Ovid SP) (1956 to 21 February 2014), EMBASE (Ovid SP) (1982 to 21 February 2014), the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (1950 to 21 February 2014) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EBSCO host (1980 to 21 February 2014), as well as reference lists of articles. We also searched www.controlled-trials.com and www.clincialtrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of postoperative warming interventions aiming to reverse hypothermia compared with control or with each other.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors identified studies for inclusion in this review. One review author extracted data and completed risk of bias assessments; two review authors checked the details. Meta-analysis was conducted when appropriate by using standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 11 trials with 699 participants. Ten trials provided data for analysis. Trials varied in the numbers and types of participants included and in the types of surgery performed. Most trials were at high or unclear risk of bias because of inappropriate or unclear randomization procedures, and because blinding of assessors and participants generally was not possible. This may have influenced results, but it is unclear how the results may have been influenced. Active warming was found to reduce the mean time taken to achieve normothermia by about 30 minutes in comparison with use of warmed cotton blankets (mean difference (MD) -32.13 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) -42.55 to -21.71; moderate-quality evidence), but no significant difference in shivering was noted. Active warming was found to reduce mean time taken to achieve normothermia by almost an hour and a half in comparison with use of unwarmed cotton blankets (MD -88.86 minutes, 95% CI -123.49 to -54.23; moderate-quality evidence), and people in the active warming group were less likely to shiver than those in the unwarmed cotton blanket group (Relative Risk = 0.61 95% CI = 0.42 to 0.86; low quality evidence). There was no effect on mean temperature difference in degrees celsius at 60 minutes (MD = 0.18°C, 95% CI = -0.10 to 0.46; moderate quality evidence), and no data were available in relation to major cardiovascular complications. Forced air warming was found to reduce time taken to achieve normothermia by about one hour in comparison to circulating hot water devices (MD = -54.21 minutes 95% CI = -94.95, -13.47). There was no statistically significant difference between thermal insulation and cotton blankets on mean time to achieve normothermia (MD = -0.29 minutes, 95% CI = -25.47 to 24.89; moderate quality evidence) or shivering (Relative Risk = 1.36 95% CI = 0.69 to 2.67; moderate quality evidence), and no data were available for mean temperature difference or major cardiovascular complications. Insufficient evidence was available about other comparisons, adverse effects or any other secondary outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Active warming, particularly forced air warming, appears to offer a clinically important reduction in mean time taken to achieve normothermia (normal body temperature between 36°C and 37.5°C) in patients with postoperative hypothermia. However, high-quality evidence on other important clinical outcomes is lacking; therefore it is unclear whether active warming offers other benefits and harms. High-quality evidence on other warming methods is also lacking; therefore it is unclear whether other rewarming methods are effective in reversing postoperative hypothermia.

Results

Temperature variability.

Mean monthly temperatures, with 95% confidence interval (CI), recorded in the refrigerator (4°C), in the incubators (35°C, 45°C, and 60°C), and hut are presented in Figure 4.

Figure 4.
Monthly mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) temperatures recorded in the incubator, refrigerator, and hut over the 2-year study period, from July 23, 2012 to July 23, 2014. Empty squares are the average of daily minimum temperatures and black solid squares are the average of daily maximum temperatures recorded in the hut. D0 = day 0 (July 23, 2012), M = month.

Refrigerator (4°C).

The mean (95% CI) temperature within was 4.06°C (4.04–4.07°C). Sporadic elevation of the temperature was observed due to monthly cleaning of the refrigerator but this was never > 18°C and lasted a maximum of 30 minutes. Temperature data were missing for 9 days, as a consequence of the data logger being accidentally removed from the refrigerator.

In the incubators (35°C, 45°C, and 60°C).

Within the 60°C incubator for 48 hours, the mean (95% CI) temperature was 64.1°C (63.9–64.3°C), higher than the preset temperature by approximately 4°C. The temperature loggers in the 45°C and 35°C incubators for 90 days and 730 days, respectively, recorded mean (95% CI) temperatures of 46.6°C (46.5–46.7°C) and 36.0°C (36.0–36.0°C), respectively.

Temperature in the hut.

The temperature recorded in the hut was unavailable for 11 days as the storage capacity of the temperature logger was exceeded. Minimum and maximum temperatures recorded were 15.7°C and 42.0°C, respectively. The numbers of recordings for the five temperature groups are shown in Table 1. The RDTs kept in the hut were exposed to temperatures higher than 30°C, which is the RDT manufacturer's recommended maximum temperature, for 28.7% of time points during the 2-year study period. Temperatures exceeded 35°C for 6.7% of time points and even 40°C for 0.6% of time points in March, April, May, and early June.

### Electric fans for reducing adverse health impacts in heatwaves [^e772bd80]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Heatwaves are hot weather events, which breach regional or national thresholds, that last for several days. They are likely to occur with increasing frequency in some parts of the world. The potential consequences were illustrated in Europe in August 2003 when there were an estimated 30,000 excess deaths due to a heatwave. Electric fans might be used with the intention of reducing the adverse health effects of a heatwave. Fans do not cool the ambient air but can be used to draw in cooler air from outside when placed at an open window. The aim of the fans would be to increase heat loss by increasing the efficiency of all normal methods of heat loss, but particularly by evaporation and convection methods. However, it should be noted that increased sweating can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if these fluids and electrolytes are not replaced quickly enough. Research has also identified important gaps in knowledge about the use of fans, which might lead to their inappropriate use.

Objectives

To determine whether the use of electric fans contributes to, or impedes, heat loss at high ambient temperatures during a heatwave, and to contribute to the evidence base for the public health impacts of heatwaves.

Search Methods

We sought unpublished and published studies that had been published in any language. The review team were able to assess studies reported in English, Chinese, Dutch, French and German; and reports in other languages would have been translated into English as necessary. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Indian biomedical literature (IndMED and MedIND) and databases of Chinese literature (Chinese Journal Net and Digital Periodical of WanFang Data). The most recent electronic searches were done in April 2012. We also checked the reference lists of relevant articles and the websites of relevant national and international organisations, and consulted with researchers and policy makers with experience in strategies to manage heatwaves to identify additional studies. The titles and abstracts from each search were checked independently by two review authors. The full text articles that we retrieved were checked independently by at least two authors for their relevance and for references to potentially eligible studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials and other experimental designs, such as interrupted time series and controlled before-and-after studies, comparing the use of electric fans with no fans during a heatwave were eligible for this review. The electric fans could be hand-held (battery operated), portable or mounted on the wall or ceiling, or in a window. We sought interventions delivered to anyone for whom a heatwave was likely to have serious adverse health impacts. This would include people of all ages but with a particular focus on some groups (for example older people). Populations from high-, middle- and low-income countries were eligible for the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

If we had identified eligible studies, they would have been assessed independently by at least two review authors and data would have been extracted on the characteristics of the study, its participants and interventions, as well as the effects on health outcomes. The primary outcomes were mortality, hospital admission and other contacts with healthcare services.

Main Results

We did not identify any eligible studies despite the extensive searching and correspondence with several experts in this topic area. We identified retrospective, observational studies, usually with a case-control design, that investigated the association between the use of electric fans and health outcomes, including death. The results of these studies were mixed. Some studies found that the use of fans was associated with better health outcomes, others found the reverse.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence we identified does not resolve uncertainties about the health effects of electric fans during heatwaves. Therefore, this review does not support or refute the use of electric fans during a heatwave. People making decisions about electric fans should consider the current state of the evidence base, and they might also wish to make themselves aware of local policy or guidelines when making a choice about whether or not to use or supply electric fans. The main implication of this review is that high quality research is needed to resolve the long standing and ongoing uncertainty about the benefits and harms of using electric fans during a heatwave, for example randomised trials comparing the health effects in people with electric fans to those in people without them.

Laboratory time for agglomerating particles

The composition of a granular gas of aggregating particles changes in time. That is, at a given time, the system consists of N (1) monomers, N (2) dimers, …, N (i) i -mers. The abundance of monomers can be considered as a subsystem of particles, the same for dimers and, in general, for i -mers. For the case of agglomerating particles, we use the fact that in dilute systems, subsystems of particles behave independent of one another. Obviously, since these subsystems coexist, there are many ways to determine the laboratory time from the number of collisions via Eq. (61), where we use the data from subsystem i: N (i), m (i), T (i). Consequently, from the simulation results we obtain many different laboratory times, which are, of course, theoretically identical, but not numerically due to the evolution of the system and the finite system size: near the beginning of the simulation, most of the particles are monomers, therefore, the statistics of the monomers delivers the most reliable results while the statistics based on 20-mers is unreliable since the abundance of 20-mers is yet small. For a given particle size, i, there is a certain interval of time when the abundance of i -mers is the largest subsystem from which we obtain the most reliable data. For earlier time, the statistics is poor since most of the particles are yet smaller than i, for later times, the statistics is poor as well since most of the i -mers vanished from the system by agglomeration. Consequently, in our simulation we determine the laboratory time from the most reliable species, I, consisting of the largest number of particles at the given time. Therefore, we compute

Main Outcomes and Measures

Substantial community transmission was defined as at least 10 reported deaths in a country as of March 10, 2020. For comparison, we studied cities with and without COVID-19 cases, representing all regions of the globe. For each country, at most 1 representative city was chosen. For countries with COVID-19 cases, we selected locations with community death or, if death rates were not available, community cases; for non–COVID-19 countries, we selected capitals or the largest cities. Community death was defined as community transmission of COVID-19 resulting in death. Temperature analysis was undertaken in a period 30 to 20 days before the first community death to capture a range of days when cases were likely transmitted, based on a reported incubation period of approximately 5 days and a reproduction number of approximately 2. For control cities, the date of the first community death was also used; if this was not available, the date of the first death was used. In countries where there were no deaths, the last date of data collection (ie, March 10, 2020) was used. We obtained COVID-19 country-wide data from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Enigeering. We based 2-m temperatures, relative humidity (RH), specific humidity (Q), and absolute humidity (AH) on data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-5 reanalysis. Two-meter temperature refers to temperature at the height of 2 m above the earth's surface (ie, the temperature near the earth's surface, where most human activity takes place); RH is the percentage of the maximum amount of water vapor that the atmosphere can hold at a given temperature (saturation); Q is defined as the mass of water vapor in a unit mass of moist air in grams per kilograms; and AH is defined as the total mass of water vapor present in a given volume or mass of air in grams per meters cubed. Climatologic (1979–2020 data) and persistence forecasting (2019 data) were used to analyze latitude and temperature trends globally and for affected areas using ERA-5.

Table 3.2.3 Cold injuries — non-freezing (trench foot, pernio) and freezing (frostbite) — management and key thresholds are outlined as follows: Non-freezing injuries occur in "wet settings 0°C–15°C (32°F–59°F)". Trench foot management includes "Dry passive rewarming, elevation, pain relief (ibuprofen if tolerated, narcotics if severe pain)" and "Avoid rapid active rewarming". Pernio presents with "Erythrocyanotic papules, pruritus, pain" and management is "Dry, protect, prevent more cold/wet exposure, pain relief as above". For frostbite, initiate "Rapid water rewarming for all stages 37°C–39°C (98.6°F–102.2°F) with pain relief as above" after addressing hypothermia ("Search for and treat any coexisting hypothermia first"). For first-degree frostbite, "Add ibuprofen 400 mg twice daily for anti-inflammatory effect if not already using for pain"; for second-degree, "may aspirate clear bullae"; for third-degree, provide "definitive care for thrombolytics or iloprost within 48 hours", "leave bullae intact", and note that "Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) scintigraphy or magnetic resonance imaging predicts tissue loss".
