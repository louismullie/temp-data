## Question

lithium high levels symptoms

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of high lithium levels, specifically how they present by severity and organ system, with attention to level thresholds, special populations, and monitoring nuances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the therapeutic window and how close it sits to toxicity. Then, I should verify the early, dose-related adverse effects that can herald toxicity. Next, I will categorize toxicity by severity and organ system, and I should double-check where the FDA labels and contemporary guidelines align or diverge. After that, I need to consider special populations and risk modifiers. Finally, I will integrate monitoring and management principles, including when to escalate to hemodialysis, and I will close with a concise synthesis that preserves the hierarchy of severity and organ systems.

> Let me first confirm the therapeutic index and thresholds, because everything hinges on this. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index with toxicity beginning around 1.5 mEq/L and severe toxicity at or above 2.0–3.0 mEq/L, while some patients exhibit toxic signs even within the therapeutic range due to individual sensitivity, so I should not anchor on a single number without clinical correlation [^113DsryV] [^115ekscC] [^113gg5wL]. Wait, I should verify the maintenance targets too; contemporary maintenance ranges are generally 0.6–0.8 mEq/L, with the option to extend to 0.8–1.0 mEq/L in selected cases, and levels above 1.0 mEq/L are discouraged due to diminishing returns and rising toxicity risk, which aligns with ISBD/IGSLI consensus and VA/DoD guidance [^111ZCwi5] [^1176Lmg5].

> Next, I should review early, dose-related adverse effects that often precede frank toxicity. Fine hand tremor, polyuria with polydipsia, and mild nausea are common at therapeutic levels and can persist, while diarrhea, vomiting, drowsiness, muscular weakness, and incoordination are early warning signs of rising toxicity and can occur even below 2.0 mEq/L, so I need to keep a low threshold to check a level when these emerge [^113gg5wL] [^1179eKbQ]. Hold on, I should verify that these early features are indeed dose-related and not solely idiosyncratic; the FDA labeling repeatedly emphasizes that adverse effects correlate with serum concentration and individual sensitivity, reinforcing the need to integrate symptoms with levels rather than relying on either alone [^113DsryV] [^114Uj57V].

> I will now examine mild to moderate toxicity manifestations. As levels rise, patients may develop coarse tremor, ataxia, blurred vision, tinnitus, slurred speech, hyperreflexia, and muscle twitching, with gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea becoming more prominent. Polyuria may reflect nephrogenic diabetes insipidus even at therapeutic levels, so I should confirm volume status and electrolytes when polyuria is marked [^113DsryV] [^113gg5wL]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "giddiness" was a typographical error, but the FDA labeling indeed lists giddiness as a moderate neurotoxic manifestation, so I should retain it while noting it overlaps with lightheadedness and dizziness in clinical practice [^113DsryV].

> Now, I need to ensure I capture severe toxicity accurately. At higher concentrations, particularly above 3.0 mEq/L, patients may progress to confusion, seizures, coma, and death. Persistent neurological sequelae, including cerebellar ataxia and cognitive impairment, can occur even after lithium is discontinued and may be associated with cerebellar atrophy, so I should not delay aggressive management when severe features are present [^113DsryV] [^114Uj57V]. Hold on, I should verify that these severe CNS features are consistently reported across labels. Yes, multiple FDA sources converge on seizures, coma, and death as the most severe neurological endpoints, underscoring the urgency of decontamination and extracorporeal removal in life-threatening cases [^113DsryV] [^114QdTBs].

> Let me consider cardiac manifestations next. ECG changes including prolonged QT, ST and T-wave abnormalities, and myocarditis have been described, and lithium can precipitate conduction disturbances such as AV block or Brugada syndrome, with rare reports of sinus node dysfunction even at therapeutic levels. I should obtain an ECG when arrhythmias or syncope are suspected and reassess medications that interact with lithium [^113DsryV] [^1175FsVf] [^112GTyfN]. I should double-check that these cardiac risks are emphasized in labeling and contemporary reviews; yes, both FDA warnings and recent summaries highlight arrhythmias and myocarditis as clinically relevant toxicities, particularly in the setting of drug interactions or electrolyte shifts [^113DsryV] [^1175FsVf].

> I will now examine renal and endocrine toxicity. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with polyuria and polydipsia is common and dose-related, and chronic exposure can lead to chronic kidney disease. Acute toxicity may precipitate acute kidney injury, sometimes compounded by volume depletion from NDI, so I need to monitor renal function closely and manage fluids carefully [^113DsryV] [^1139BZrf]. But wait, what if hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism are present; lithium can cause both, and hypercalcemia may necessitate lithium withdrawal or parathyroid surgery in refractory cases, so calcium and PTH should be part of routine monitoring during long-term therapy [^111RcFiw] [^1175FsVf].

> Next, I should review respiratory complications. Severe intoxication can lead to dyspnea, aspiration pneumonia, and respiratory failure, so airway protection and aspiration precautions are critical in obtunded patients, and I should anticipate a prolonged recovery given lithium's tissue distribution kinetics [^113DsryV] [^114Uj57V]. Hold on, I should verify that these respiratory endpoints are consistently cataloged; yes, multiple FDA sources list respiratory failure among severe systemic toxicities, reinforcing the need for supportive critical care in high-level exposures [^113DsryV] [^114QdTBs].

> I need to ensure I account for special populations and modifiers of risk. Elderly patients often require lower doses and may show toxicity at levels tolerated by younger adults, so I should target 0.4–0.6 mEq/L when possible and monitor more frequently; pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period require dose adjustments and neonatal monitoring due to maternal–fetal transfer and neonatal toxicity risk, and febrile illness, dehydration, NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, and thiazide diuretics can all elevate lithium levels and precipitate toxicity [^111ZCwi5] [^11692qx8] [^1139BZrf]. Wait, let me verify the postpartum guidance; yes, reducing or holding lithium 2–3 days before delivery and monitoring maternal and neonatal levels is recommended to mitigate neonatal toxicity, with individualized restart plans postpartum [^11692qx8].

> Next, I should review monitoring and management principles. Serum lithium should be measured as a 12-hour trough after steady state, typically every 3–6 months once stable, with more frequent checks after dose changes, intercurrent illness, or new interacting drugs; in suspected toxicity, I should repeat levels every 4–6 hours initially because of delayed distribution and potential rebound, and I must not rely on a single normal level if clinical toxicity is evident [^115Nb2JY] [^114QdTBs]. I should confirm when to escalate to hemodialysis; in severe toxicity, particularly with levels above 2.5–3.0 mEq/L or with significant neurologic compromise, hemodialysis is the treatment of choice to rapidly reduce body burden, with supportive care focused on correcting volume status and electrolytes and protecting the airway [^114QdTBs] [^114qgJBD].

> Hold on, I should verify the caveat about symptom–level discordance. Toxic symptoms may lag levels by up to 24 hours due to slow CNS distribution, and some patients manifest neurotoxicity at "therapeutic" levels, so clinical judgment must override a reassuring number when the phenotype is concerning. Conversely, mild symptoms do not exclude significant toxicity, especially in chronic exposure, so I should maintain a low threshold to recheck levels and adjust therapy [^113DsryV] [^113wJWAo]. Let me reconsider whether any guideline nuances change this. No, both FDA labeling and case-based literature reinforce the primacy of clinical assessment alongside, not instead of, laboratory monitoring [^113DsryV] [^113wJWAo].

> Finally, I will synthesize the symptom hierarchy by severity while preserving organ systems. Early dose-related adverse effects include fine tremor, polyuria, polydipsia, and mild nausea. Mild to moderate toxicity adds coarse tremor, ataxia, blurred vision, tinnitus, hyperreflexia, muscle twitching, slurred speech, and gastrointestinal upset. Severe toxicity encompasses confusion, seizures, coma, and death, with multi-organ involvement including ECG changes, myocarditis, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, acute kidney injury, dyspnea, aspiration pneumonia, and respiratory failure. Persistent neurocognitive deficits and cerebellar ataxia may persist after exposure, particularly with high or prolonged levels [^113DsryV] [^113gg5wL] [^114Uj57V]. I should double-check that this synthesis aligns with both labeling and contemporary reviews. Yes, it reflects the FDA's organ-system framework and the clinical emphasis on early recognition and aggressive management at higher levels, with individualized targets and vigilance for special populations and interacting drugs [^113DsryV] [^111ZCwi5] [^1176Lmg5].

Lithium toxicity presents with **neurologic symptoms** (tremor, ataxia, confusion, seizures, coma) [^113DsryV], **gastrointestinal symptoms** (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) [^113gg5wL], and **cardiovascular symptoms** (bradycardia, AV block, arrhythmias) [^1175FsVf]. These symptoms are dose-related and can occur even at therapeutic levels in sensitive patients [^1165GWqi]; risk rises with dehydration, renal impairment, or interacting drugs [^113DsryV]. Early recognition and prompt management are essential to prevent progression to severe toxicity and permanent neurologic injury [^114QdTBs].

---

## Neurological symptoms

Neurological symptoms are the **most prominent and earliest manifestations** of lithium toxicity [^notfound]:

- **Fine tremor**: Commonly observed even at therapeutic levels, but worsens with toxicity [^113gg5wL].

- **Ataxia and lack of coordination**: Early signs of moderate toxicity [^113gg5wL].

- **Confusion and disorientation**: Indicate moderate to severe toxicity [^114QapxV].

- **Seizures and coma**: Severe toxicity manifestations, potentially leading to permanent neurological damage [^114QdTBs].

- **Cerebellar dysfunction**: Persistent ataxia and cerebellar atrophy may occur following severe toxicity [^113DsryV].

---

## Gastrointestinal symptoms

Gastrointestinal symptoms often occur early and may include:

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Early signs of toxicity [^113DsryV].

- **Diarrhea**: Common in moderate toxicity [^notfound].

- **Abdominal discomfort and bloating**: Frequently reported [^notfound].

---

## Cardiovascular symptoms

Lithium toxicity can cause **significant cardiovascular complications**, including:

- **Bradycardia and AV block**: Commonly observed [^notfound].

- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Including ventricular arrhythmias and Brugada syndrome [^notfound].

- **Myocarditis**: Rare but serious complication [^113DsryV].

---

## Renal symptoms

Lithium is primarily excreted by the kidneys, and toxicity often presents with **renal manifestations**:

- **Polyuria and polydipsia**: Due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus [^112vi3Lg].

- **Acute kidney injury**: Particularly in chronic toxicity or with pre-existing renal impairment [^notfound].

- **Chronic kidney disease**: Risk increases with prolonged high lithium levels [^1112E86H].

---

## Endocrine symptoms

Lithium toxicity can disrupt endocrine function, causing **hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia** — commonly observed and often requiring monitoring [^1175FsVf] — and **hypothyroidism**, which is common with chronic lithium therapy and may be exacerbated during toxicity [^112kn4Ad].

---

## Clinical severity classification

Lithium toxicity is **classified by serum lithium concentration and clinical severity**:

| **Severity** | **Serum lithium level (mmol/l)** | **Clinical manifestations** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | 1.5–2.0 | - Tremor <br/> - Mild gastrointestinal symptoms <br/> - Slight confusion |
| Moderate | 2.0–2.5 | - Marked tremor <br/> - Ataxia <br/> - Confusion <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Diarrhea |
| Severe | ≥ 2.5 | - Seizures <br/> - Coma <br/> - Severe cardiovascular complications <br/> - Permanent neurological damage |

---

## Factors influencing symptom severity

Several factors influence the **severity and onset** of lithium toxicity symptoms:

- **Individual sensitivity**: Some patients exhibit toxicity at therapeutic levels [^113DsryV].

- **Age and renal function**: Elderly patients and those with impaired renal function are at higher risk [^notfound].

- **Drug interactions**: NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, and diuretics can increase lithium levels [^1139BZrf].

- **Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances**: Increase risk and severity of toxicity [^113DsryV].

---

## Management of lithium toxicity

Management involves **immediate cessation of lithium therapy** and supportive care, including fluid and electrolyte correction [^114QdTBs]. Hemodialysis is indicated for severe toxicity, particularly when lithium levels exceed 2.5 mmol/L or when there is significant renal impairment [^114QdTBs]. Close monitoring of serum lithium levels, renal function, and cardiac status is essential [^115Nb2JY].

---

Lithium toxicity manifests with neurological, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, and endocrine symptoms, with severity correlating to serum lithium levels and individual susceptibility. Early recognition, **prompt management**, and regular monitoring are critical to prevent severe complications and permanent neurological damage [^113DsryV].

### Differential effects of endogenous lithium on neurobehavioural functioning: a study on auditory evoked potentials [^112jxPkY]. Psychiatry Research (2010). Low credibility.

Lithium occurs naturally in food and water. Low environmental concentrations in drinking water are associated with mental illnesses and behavioural offences, and at therapeutic dosages it is used to treat psychiatric (especially affective) disorders, partly by facilitating serotonergic (5-HT) neurotransmission. As little is known about the psychophysiological role of nutritional lithium in the general population, endogenous lithium concentrations were hypothesised to be associated with measurable effects on emotional liability and the loudness dependence (LD) that is proposed as one of the most valid indicators of 5-HT neurotransmission. Auditory evoked potentials of healthy volunteers [N = 36] with high (> 2.5 microg/l) or low (< 1.5 microg/l) lithium serum concentrations were recorded. Emotional liability was assessed using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Low-lithium levels correlated with Somatisation while correlations between lithium and LD were not significant. Still, LD correlated positively with Paranoid Ideation, negatively with Anxiety and, in the high-lithium group, inversely with further aspects of emotional liability (Depression, Psychological Distress). In conclusion, the effects of low levels of endogenous lithium are associated with emotional liability, and high levels with some protective effects, although findings remain inconclusive regarding LD. Potential benefits of endogenous lithium on neurobehavioural functioning, especially in high-risk individuals, would have public health implications.

Discussion

Concerns about the risk of acute and chronic intoxication and the need of regular monitoring with lithium treatment have led to the perception that other mood stabilisers such as some anticonvulsants and SGAs are safer than lithium and hence preferable. In this work, we examined the toxicity profile in 91 episodes observed over a 17-year period in our county.

The epidemiology of lithium intoxication

The incidence of lithium intoxication was 1/100 patient-years. Based on this incidence, only 1/100 patients per year treated with lithium can be expected to experience moderate to severe lithium intoxication ⩾1.5 mmol/L. We reported an incidence of 7.2% patients with lithium intoxication over 17 years. This is in line with findings from a large population-based study from Canada in elderly patients treated with lithium. As in other studies, we saw that women were nearly twice as likely to experience an episode of lithium intoxication (Table 4). However, our study was not sufficiently powered to examine potential sex differences arising from differences in body mass, kidney function and overdose propensity.

Symptoms of lithium toxicity

In many cases, symptoms of lithium intoxication were relatively bland or non-existent. Most symptoms related to mental status changes, which were more frequent in cases of severe intoxication. The statement from a recent expert consensus panel that 'gastrointestinal symptoms tend to distinguish acute poisoning, where they are expected and prominent, from chronic toxicity, where they are almost invariably absent' could not be endorsed in our study. In our study, no patient having taken an overdose had gastrointestinal symptoms, and all cases with diarrhoea belonged to the group of chronic toxicity. As many patients present with unspecific or mild symptoms, it is important to have a low threshold to check lithium levels. It is important not to ascribe mental status changes to psychiatric symptoms automatically, since mental state changes are prominent in lithium intoxication. Equally, it is important not to discard falls in the elderly treated with lithium as age related and hence 'normal' and omit to check lithium levels. Ultimately, clinical symptoms may be poor indicators of actual lithium levels. Conversely, it has even been suggested that intoxication can occur even despite normal lithium levels. This could occur in the context of lithium-mediated serotonergic toxicity or in the context of acute overdoses, when levels are taken before lithium tablets have entered the bloodstream.

### Commentary on a recent review of lithium toxicity: what are its implications for clinical practice? [^114zpfHe]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Below, we discuss several specific issues that need to be considered critically.

1. Practicing clinicians are primarily interested in the potential AEs experienced by properly treated patients, that is, patients who are correctly selected for long-term lithium treatment, are maintained on a minimum effective dosage, and are regularly monitored and managed. In this context, lithium treatment generates AEs in a relatively small proportion of patients. However, the reports included in the meta-analysis unavoidably included numerous patients with bipolar spectrum disorders for whom lithium treatment was not the optimal treatment choice, and who were treated by physicians with insufficient experience in lithium treatment. Hence, an important aspect of future work would be to compare the rates of side-effects in specialized programs as opposed to general psychiatric practice.

2. Sufficient information about dosage and serum levels of lithium could not be taken into account although the authors made efforts to exclude patients with pre-existing lithium intoxication. Many side-effects, including endocrine and metabolic effects are dose-dependent, and therefore can often be controlled by proper dose titration. Details on patient compliance and the time intervals between lithium plasma levels and AEs would have been important background information, and their absence raises questions about the validity of the data and the statistical processing. This criticism was also raised by Malhi and Berk in the same issue of the journal. As clinicians, we often come across referred patients whose dosage has not been adjusted for many years, and they frequently experience side-effects because their lithium levels are frequently much higher than 1.0 mmol/l.

3. The potential confounding factors of age and sex on lithium treatment could not be considered adequately in the meta-analysis.

4. Another important piece of information for the correct interpretation of side-effects is the patient's clinical response to long-term lithium treatment. Non-responders develop side-effects distinctly more frequently than responders, even at comparable serum lithium levels.

5. There is also the problem of potentially harmful co-medication. McKnight et al. did not elaborate on whether co-prescription of potentially nephrotoxic drugs (for example, antibiotics, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors) or compounds that can change the pharmacokinetics of lithium was controlled for, as this can be a strong potential confounding factor particularly with regard to renal toxicity.

6. Finally, it remains unclear whether AEs such as impaired thyroid function occurred during lithium medication given alone or were seen during treatment with thyroxin supplementation.

### Delphi survey of maintenance lithium treatment in older adults with bipolar disorder: an ISBD task force report [^112kn4Ad]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, lithium, just like all of the other mood stabilizers including antipsychotic agents, represents a double‐edged sword for older adults. One concern has been its possible role in increasing the risk of chronic renal failure 15, 16 although there is also considerable recent epidemiological evidence that the risk is not as concerning as originally considered. 17 Other concerns include hypothyroidism, 18 hypercalcemia, 19 neurotoxicity, 20 and parkinsonism. 21 As the cohort of bipolar patients successfully maintained on lithium reaches their 70's and 80's, the age associated decrease in renal clearance may lead to higher lithium levels. This in turn leads to increased risk of side effects and outright toxicity if typical adult doses are not lowered. 20, 22 Several commonly used drugs in older adults, such as diuretics, ACE Inhibitors and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, can interact with lithium and cause higher serum levels, thereby increasing the risk of toxicity. 23 Furthermore, symptoms of toxicity (eg, tremor, gastrointestinal upset, and neurological disturbance) can be misinterpreted as other conditions commonly seen in later life, such as parkinsonism or dementia. 21 A "prescribing cascade" may ensue, 24 with additional medications introduced unnecessarily to assist in the management of the observed symptoms (eg, dopaminergic agents, cognitive enhancers, and gastrointestinal drugs). Clearly, more evidence and guidelines are needed that balance the risks and benefits of lithium use in OABD. 25, 26

8.2 Monitoring medication serum levels

Patients on lithium, divalproex, or carbamazepine need to have their serum medication levels monitored regularly. This is particularly important for those who may be non‐adherent to treatment. Measurement of serum levels should be repeated at the trough point, which is approximately 12 h after the last dose. It is recommended that two consecutive serum levels be established in the therapeutic range during the acute phase for lithium and divalproex, and then measurement be repeated every 3‐6 months or more frequently if clinically indicated. For carbamazepine, serum level monitoring is mainly done to ensure that the levels are not in the toxic range and to check for treatment adherence as there is no established relationship between efficacy and serum level; thus, monitoring for serum carbamazepine levels may be done at 6‐12 monthly intervals and as clinically indicated.

The target serum level for lithium in acute treatment is 0.8‐1.2 mEq/L (0.4‐0.8 mEq/L in older adults) while in maintenance treatment, serum levels of 0.6‐1 mEq/L may be sufficient 801, 802; serum levels should be obtained about 5 days after the most recent dose titration. Clinicians may wish to consult the "lithiumeter" schematic for further guidance. 803 It is important to avoid toxic levels as these are associated with an increased risk of kidney damage in the long term. 804 The target serum level for divalproex is 350‐700 mM/L (50‐100 ug/mL) in the acute phase and should be obtained 3‐5 days after the most recent dose titration. There is some evidence for a linear relationship between serum divalproex level and therapeutic efficacy in acute mania, with higher levels associated with greater efficacy. 805 It is currently unknown what levels of divalproex offer optimum efficacy in maintenance treatment as no study to date has systematically assessed the relationship between serum divalproex level and the maintenance efficacy. Therefore, clinician are advised to maintain serum divalproex levels within the accepted laboratory range values during maintenance treatment and carefully monitor patients for emerging mood symptoms and tolerability and adjust the dose of divalproex as needed in order to achieve optimum efficacy and tolerability.

Patients who are treated with concurrent carbamazepine or other hepatic enzyme‐inducing agents should have serum levels of all psychotropic medications monitored, particularly in cases of inadequate response or non‐response, to determine whether efficacy has been compromised because of reduced serum levels.

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD / IGSLI task force on treatment with lithium [^111ZCwi5]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

To systematically review the existing trials on optimal serum levels for lithium for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder and to develop clinical recommendations.

Methods

Systematic literature search. Discussion of major characteristics, limitations, methodological quality, and results of selected trials. Delphi survey consisting of clinical questions and corresponding statements. For statements endorsed by at least 80% of the members, consensus was considered as having been achieved.

Results

With strict inclusion criteria no studies could be selected, making it difficult to formulate evidence‐based recommendations. After loosening the inclusion criteria 7 trials were selected addressing our aims at least to some extent. Four of these studies suggest better efficacy being associated with lithium serum levels in a range above a lower threshold around 0.45/0.60 and up to 0.80/1.00 mmol/L. These findings support the outcome of the Delphi survey.

Conclusions

For adults with bipolar disorder there was consensus that the standard lithium serum level should be 0.60‐0.80 mmol/L with the option to reduce it to 0.40‐0.60 mmol/L in case of good response but poor tolerance or to increase it to 0.80‐1.00 mmol/L in case of insufficient response and good tolerance. For children and adolescents there was no consensus, but the majority of the members endorsed the same recommendation. For the elderly there was also no consensus, but the majority of the members endorsed a more conservative approach: usually 0.40‐0.60 mmol/L, with the option to go to maximally 0.70 or 0.80 mmol/L at ages 65‐79 years, and to maximally 0.70 mmol/L over age 80 years.

10 OVERDOSAGE

The toxic concentrations for lithium (≥ 1.5 mEq/L) are close to the therapeutic concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. At lithium concentrations greater than 3 mEq/L, patients may progress to seizures, coma, and irreversible brain damage.

Treatment:

For current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage, contact the National Poison Control Center at 1–800–222–1222 or www.poison.org.

No specific antidote for lithium poisoning is known. Mild symptoms of lithium toxicity can usually be treated by reduction in dose or cessation of the drug.

In severe cases of lithium poisoning, the goal of treatment is elimination of this ion from the patient. Administration of gastric lavage should be performed, but use of activated charcoal is not recommended as it does not significantly absorb lithium ions. Hemodialysis is the treatment of choice as it is an effective and rapid means of removing lithium in patients with severe toxicity. As an alternative option, urea, mannitol and aminophylline can induce a significant increase in lithium excretion. Appropriate supportive care for the patient should be undertaken. Patients with impaired consciousness should have their airway protected and it is critical to correct any volume depletion or electrolyte imbalance. Patients should be monitored to prevent hypernatremia while receiving normal saline and careful regulation of kidney function is of utmost importance.

Serum lithium concentrations should be closely monitored as there may be a rebound in serum lithium concentrations as a result of delayed diffusion from the body tissues. Likewise, during the late recovery phase, lithium should be re-administered with caution taking into account the possible release of significant lithium stores in body tissues.

3.4 Clinical outcomes of the included studies

Table 4 summarizes the most important clinical outcomes of the included studies. Significant differences between lithium serum level ranges are indicated by green (better outcomes) vs red (poorer outcomes), while outcomes which were not significantly different are indicated by blue.

Table 4
Summary of major clinical outcomes

The findings of the 7 studies are summarized in Table 4. Taken together, 4 studies (Waters, Maj, Gelenberg, and Nolen) indicate better long‐term efficacy in the prevention of any mood episode with mean lithium serum levels in a range above a lower threshold around 0.45/0.60 and up to 0.80/1.00 mmol/L. The other 3 studies (Jerram, Coppen, Vestergaard) did not find a significant difference between higher vs lower lithium levels.

In addition, 4 studies also looked at possible differences between the prevention of manic vs depressive recurrences. Only 1 study (Maj) suggested a lower threshold for the prevention of manic symptoms (around 0.45 mmol/L) than for depressive symptoms (around 0.60 mmol/L). Another study (Nolen) suggests the same threshold of 0.60 mmol/L for both the prevention of manic and depressive recurrences. The other 2 studies (Waters, Vestergaard) also found no difference in polarity of response and lithium levels.

Finally, 3 studies, addressed the association of lithium levels with adverse effects. Two studies, reported more side effects with levels 0.45‐0.60 and higher vs 0.30‐0‐45 (Maj) and with levels 0.80‐1.00 vs 0.40‐0.60 (Gelenberg), while the third study (Nolen) did not report different drop‐outs rates due to side effects between the 3 groups (lithium < 0.60 mmol/L, lithium 0.60‐1.20 mmol/L and placebo).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary:

Limited published data reports the presence of lithium carbonate in human milk with breast milk levels measured at 0.12 to 0.7 mEq or 40 to 45% of maternal plasma levels. Infants exposed to lithium during breastfeeding may have plasma levels that are 30 to 40% of maternal plasma levels. Signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity such as hypertonia, hypothermia, cyanosis, and ECG changes have been reported in some breastfed neonates and infants. Increased prolactin levels have been measured in lactating women, but the effects on milk production are not known. Breastfeeding is not recommended with maternal lithium use; however, if a woman chooses to breastfeed, the infant should be closely monitored for signs of lithium toxicity. Discontinue breastfeeding if a breastfed infant develops lithium toxicity.

Clinical Considerations:

Consider regular monitoring of lithium levels and thyroid function in a breastfed infant.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of lithium for monotherapy treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder and maintenance monotherapy of bipolar I disorder in pediatric patients ages 7 to 17 years of age have been established in an acute-phase clinical trial of 8 weeks in duration followed by a 28-week randomized withdrawal phase [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14)].

The safety and effectiveness of lithium has not been established in pediatric patients less than 7 years of age with bipolar I disorder.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of lithium carbonate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other treatment.

Lithium is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The occurrence and severity of adverse reactions are generally directly related to serum lithium concentrations as well as to individual patient sensitivity to lithium, and generally occur more frequently and with greater severity at higher concentrations.

Adverse reactions may be encountered at serum lithium levels below 1.5 mEq/L. Mild to moderate adverse reactions may occur at levels from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L, and moderate to severe reactions may be seen at levels of 2 mEq/L and above.

Fine hand tremor, polyuria and mild thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase, and may persist throughout treatment. Transient and mild nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration.

These side effects usually subside with continued treatment or a temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. If persistent, cessation of lithium therapy may be required.

Diarrhea, vomiting, drowsiness, muscular weakness and lack of coordination may be early signs of lithium intoxication, and can occur at lithium levels below 2 mEq/L. At higher levels, ataxia, giddiness, tinnitus, blurred vision and a large output of dilute urine may be seen. Serum lithium levels above 3 mEq/L may produce a complex clinical picture, involving multiple organs and organ systems. Serum lithium levels should not be permitted to exceed 2 mEq/L during the acute treatment phase.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions are seldom encountered at serum lithium levels below 1.5 mEq./l., except in the occasional patient sensitive to lithium. Mild to moderate toxic reactions may occur at levels from 1.5–2.5 mEq./l., and moderate to severe reactions may be seen at levels from 2.0–2.5 mEq./l., depending upon individual response to the drug.

Fine hand tremor, polyuria, and mild thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase, and may persist throughout treatment. Transient and mild nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration.

These side effects are an inconvenience rather than a disabling condition, and usually subside with continued treatment or a temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. If persistent, a cessation of dosage is indicated.

Diarrhea, vomiting, drowsiness, muscular weakness, and lack of coordination may be early signs of lithium intoxication, and can occur at lithium levels below 2.0 mEq./l. At higher levels, giddiness, ataxia, blurred vision, tinnitus, and a large output of dilute urine may be seen. Serum lithium levels above 3.0 mEq./l. may produce a complex clinical picture involving multiple organs and organ systems. Serum lithium levels should not be permitted to exceed 2.0 mEq./l. during the acute treatment phase.

### Lithium intoxication: incidence, clinical course and renal function-a population-based retrospective cohort study [^115sspZL]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

Renal function

Lithium is exclusively eliminated by the kidneys. Therefore, impaired renal function increases the risk for lithium retention and hence for lithium toxicity. This was confirmed by our study, since in the majority of cases, decline of renal function preceded lithium intoxication. Acute lithium exposure can lead to overt diabetes insipidus and consequently to dehydration. This may partly explain a transient increase of serum creatinine during the acute intoxication period. Possibly, lithium-induced water loss and reduced fluid ingestion add up to pre-renal AKI. Patients suffering from NDI due to chronic lithium treatment must drink large volumes or receive large parenteral quantities of hypo-osmolar fluids to compensate for NDI associated water loss. As any other AKI, lithium-associated AKI can lead to CKD in individual patients. In a few patients in our study, kidney function was decreased after the episode; in others, it increased. It cannot be ruled out that creatinine-based estimated GFR might have been inaccurately high due to decreased muscle mass caused by inactivity and malnutrition in some patients. For the whole group, kidney function at least one month after intoxication did not differ from baseline. Baseline kidney function or maximum creatinine did not predict changes in GFR after one month. Our study was not designed to look at long-term changes of GFR. Hence, the question remains whether lithium intoxication can contribute to a long-term decline in renal function, even if the kidneys have recovered in the short term. Some studies have suggested that this may be so. This would then suggest an increased renal vulnerability after lithium intoxication. In our study, higher lithium levels correlated with better kidney function. Lithium levels in acute overdoses were higher than those in chronic intoxication. Possibly, longer exposure to lower but still supra-therapeutic lithium levels is more toxic than short exposure to high levels. Yet, the very nature of chronicity implies that such cases of intoxication may go undetected for a long time.

2 Results

The Group 1 video (clinicians) was a 37‐min recording, and the Group 2 video was 33 min, Group 3 was 54 min, and Group 4 was 50 min. The codes commonly mentioned were concerned with the design of the novel device, including cost, features, and what information the device would display. Codes referencing toxicity, adverse events, and being outside of the therapeutic window were also commonly mentioned.

There was support for the development of a small portable device for the TDM of lithium from clinicians and people treated with lithium, who preferred a device that provided rapid results with an easy‐to‐read display and/or computer connectivity. Clinicians favored a point‐of‐care device that would provide a measure of blood lithium levels in a convenient time‐frame during a consultation. The ability to check treatment adherence and to be able to adjust doses based on real‐time data was supported as a significant advance in current practice. Clinicians expressed concerns that if patients had the device, they might try to titrate their own doses; however, mitigation strategies such as patient education might counter these concerns. People with lived experience of lithium treatment wanted to be able to own and use the device themselves and saw it as a tool that can give them greater autonomy. The stigma and inconvenience of having to attend a pathology laboratory to obtain blood lithium were discussed, with several participants recounting episodes of inconvenience. Being able to instantly monitor your own blood lithium if you had symptoms that may be due to lithium toxicity, or if you were dehydrated or had exercised, was mentioned as an additional advantage. People wanted a device that is low or no cost. Comments included

### Do not treat the numbers: lithium toxicity [^113wJWAo]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

We describe the case of a 62-year-old man with a history of bipolar disorder, previously stable on lithium for over 20 years, who presented with a manic relapse and signs of lithium toxicity in the form of a coarse tremor. Serum lithium levels were in the normal range, and the patient had stage 3 chronic kidney disease. He was admitted for treatment under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act, and after stopping lithium was started on olanzapine. Signs of lithium toxicity improved after withdrawal of lithium. This case highlights the need to treat normal serum lithium levels with caution in patients showing signs of clinical lithium toxicity.

### What is the optimal serum lithium level in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder – a review? [^1155pDBg]. Bipolar Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

There is substantial uncertainty about the most efficacious serum lithium level for the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder (BD). This review focuses on the available evidence taking into consideration the effects of previous lithium history, changes in lithium level and polarity of relapse or recurrence.

Methods

We conducted a MEDLINE search, using the MeSH Terms 'bipolar disorder' and 'lithium' together with 'randomized controlled trial' or 'controlled clinical trial' covering the time span from 1966 to March 2006. We only included studies reporting on the long-term treatment of mood disorders where patients with BD were examined as a separate group and were assigned to precisely specified target ranges of lithium level.

Results

The minimum efficacious serum lithium level in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder was 0.4 mmol/L with optimal response achieved at serum levels between 0.6–0.75 mmol/L. Lithium levels > 0.75 mmol/L may not confer additional protection against overall morbidity but may further improve control of inter-episode manic symptoms. Abrupt reduction of serum levels of more than 0.2 mmol/L was associated with increased risk of relapse.

Conclusions

In the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder clinicians should initially aim for serum lithium levels of 0.6–0.75 mmol/L, while higher levels may benefit patients with predominantly manic symptoms.

### The association between anti-inflammatory effects of long-term lithium treatment and illness course in bipolar disorder [^112PBNEQ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Altered levels of acute-phase proteins are often described in different conditions in BD. Nevertheless, data on the association between lithium treatment and inflammatory markers in the long-term course of BD are still missing. The aim of the study was to examine the long-term course of BD concerning long-term lithium treatment, chronic inflammatory processes and symptom progression. Furthermore, the association between duration of lithium treatment and levels of hsCRP was explored.

Methods

267 individuals (males = 139, females = 128) with BD were included. Duration of lithium treatment as well as symptom progression, defined as the increase in severity of symptoms, number of episodes a year and duration of episodes within a period of 1.5 years in the past and hsCRP were evaluated.

Results

Male individuals with symptom progression over time had significantly lower duration of lithium treatment compared to individuals without symptoms progression (U = 47.4, p = .037). There were significantly higher levels of hsCRP in male individuals with symptom progression compared to males without symptom progression (U = 47.5, p = .027). Further, there was a significant negative correlation between the duration of lithium treatment and hsCRP levels in the whole sample (r = -.276, p < .05).

Conclusion

Our results show that an altered inflammatory state may be associated with a more severe illness course in BD. Further, a longer duration of lithium treatment may be associated with lower symptom progression. The shown association between hsCRP-levels and lithium treatment duration suggests a potential anti-inflammatory effect of lithium as a mediator of its significant positive outcome effect in BD.

### Lithium: old drug, new tricks? [^1144Zc64]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lithium has long been regarded as the gold standard in the treatment of bipolar disorder, offering significant efficacy in both acute mood episodes and long-term relapse prevention. Its therapeutic benefits extend beyond bipolar disorder to include unipolar depression, suicidality prevention, and emerging evidence for its potential in neuroprotection and cognitive health. This broad therapeutic spectrum highlights lithium's importance in psychiatric care, making it an essential component of clinical guidelines worldwide.

However, the use of lithium is not without challenges. At high therapeutic doses, and particularly with long-term use, lithium is associated with significant risks, including renal impairment, thyroid dysfunction, and neurological side effects. These adverse effects necessitate close monitoring of renal and thyroid function, which can be burdensome for both patients and healthcare systems. Additionally, lithium's narrow therapeutic window raises concerns about toxicity, which can result in life-threatening complications if blood levels are not carefully managed.

Beyond the physiological concerns, treatment adherence is a critical determinant of lithium's effectiveness. Despite its benefits in stabilising mood and reducing suicidality, adherence rates to lithium therapy remain suboptimal, and are most often (up to 62%) due to perceived side effects. Barriers to optimal monitoring and adherence together not only compromise individual outcomes but also exacerbate the cost-benefit considerations of long-term lithium more broadly.

In light of these challenges, there is growing interest in optimising lithium therapy, not only in exploring potential additional indications but also through dose adjustment, more substantive management of its associated risks and innovative monitoring strategies. Emerging evidence suggests that lower doses of lithium can, in some circumstances, retain efficacy while reducing the risk of adverse effects, presenting a promising avenue for maximising therapeutic benefits.

I'd get my bloods done, not realising they're not checking my lithium, so then I'd have to go back.

In a country town it's like a 24‐hour day you have to plan to actually get [lithium levels] done.

I go hiking into the forest and stuff, and just to know before I leave, where are my levels sitting. Do I need to watch how much water, do I need to watch my sweating — all that kind of stuff. Same as even driving, because sometimes I'll shake so bad that driving is a bit difficult, and I know that's because my lithium levels are too high or something like that.

Routines, when they're messed up with the holidays or Christmas, I'd definitely use [a lithium TDM device].

More control in the day‐to‐day about your life and your changes, so you can continue with your lifestyle adjustments and trying new things.

We could just find out straight away — no wait lists, no barriers — it's really — yeah, it's exciting to know that could be a possibility.

I went toxic it was sort of out of the blue and I just started getting — I was very, very sick and my doctor said, hold on, you haven't done your lithium for a while, we'll go check that. It took a couple of days to get through and they then rang me and said, you need to come in now and you need to stop taking lithium.

It'd be amazing to be able to see your own results because I never really get to see my results. They'll just tell me, you're fine, you're in range.

I think you've got more power over it and power is control and you're not so reliant on other people if you've got that information in your hand. Maybe you could test yourself a bit more if you had a device and perhaps it would have prevented a toxic episode.

A dissenting option was expressed by one of the participants with lived experience, who felt that the current system worked well for her and change was not required. Several participants also mentioned that they would like the device to also measure liver and thyroid function.

### Saliva testing as a means to monitor therapeutic lithium levels in patients with psychiatric disorders: identification of clinical and environmental covariates, and their incorporation into a prediction model [^114jcJej]. Bipolar Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Serum lithium monitoring requires attendance at a clinical laboratory and the collection of a blood sample, which can be uncomfortable, expensive, and inconvenient for patients. In particular, during acute episodes of bipolar illness and hospitalization, clinicians may request frequent blood sampling in order to titrate lithium levels. On the other hand, and as outlined above, patients on stable lithium prophylaxis may only be prompted to provide a blood sample every 3–6 months. The results may vary across time due to a variety of factors including lifestyle and/or diet‐promoted changes in body composition and lithium clearance, and alterations in lithium levels may go undetected for months. Furthermore, the optimal plasma lithium level within the therapeutic range may vary depending on the presentation of symptoms. For example, and in accordance with the Lithiumeter clinical guide, patients experiencing mania should be titrated to 0.6–1.0 mmol/L plasma lithium, whereas those experiencing depression can be titrated to 0.4–0.8 mmol/L if necessary, until resolution of symptoms at which point lithium levels should be adjusted to maintenance levels (often 0.6–0.8 mmol/L however patient dependent). Lithium is stored in the adrenal glands, bone, lymph nodes, and pituitary gland and is eliminated predominantly via the kidneys. As such, factors affecting renal function, such as age, dehydration, caffeine and heavy or chronic alcohol intake, sodium balance and hemodynamics, serum creatinine levels, and body mass index (BMI) also have the potential to impact on serum lithium levels. Hence, providing an effective and more convenient means for testing would allow for more frequent lithium monitoring, optimal dosing, and improved patient outcomes with lithium medications.

### The use of lithium for the treatment of bipolar disorder: recommendations from clinical practice guidelines [^115Nj2Tv]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Lithium is an effective mood stabilizer that is used principally for the management of bipolar disorder (BD). Its administration is complex and often requires sophisticated management and assiduous monitoring. When considering the use of lithium therapy for bipolar disorder, clinicians are advised to refer to recommendations outlined in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs); but because of varying emphases placed by different international CPGs, recommendations addressing the practical use of lithium lack consistency.

Method

In order to inform clinicians of optimal lithium therapy for bipolar disorder, we compared and synthesized recommendations for the treatment of bipolar disorder made by recognized CPGs internationally. We conducted a search of the literature and extracted guidance across multiple clinical issues, including clinical indications, disorder subtypes, additional uses, special populations, practical aspects, and side effects.

Results

Collectively, CPGs consider lithium most robustly as a first-line intervention for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder and strongly for the treatment of mania, with relatively modest support for the management of acute bipolar depression. Additionally, there is consensus across the CPGs that lithium tangibly reduces the risk of suicide. Generally, CPGs provide guidance on the many facets of initiating and maintaining patients on lithium therapy, but individually the CPGs varied in terms of depth and practical guidance they provide across these areas. However, consensus was established across many key areas of practice such as the ideal lithium plasma concentration for maintenance and monitoring (0.6–0.8mmol/L), along with the need for regular monitoring of renal and endocrine function. However, with more complex aspects (e.g., atypical presentations) and in special populations (e.g., youth; pregnancy and post-partum; older adults), guidance varied considerably and clear consensus recommendations were more difficult to achieve. In younger adults desirable plasma lithium levels of 0.6–0.8mmol/L can perhaps be achieved with comparatively lower doses and in the very elderly it may be prudent to target lower plasma levels in the first instance. These are important practical points for consideration that, along with many others offered throughout the article, should assist clinicians in dissecting the more complex aspects of management with greater precision.

Limitations

This review was limited to CPGs written in English. CPGs are themselves limited by reliance on evidence that often has little resemblance to real-world presentations. An important area that is not sufficiently addressed in the CPGs is clear guidance on the cessation of lithium therapy.

Conclusions

Further research is needed on many aspects of lithium therapy and this alongside existing knowledge needs to be used more consistently to inform CPGs, which should also incorporate empirical evidence and clinical experience. The recommendations in this paper provide a useful synthesis of guidance available currently.

### Lithium and nephrotoxicity: a literature review of approaches to clinical management and risk stratification [^1112E86H]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Despite lithium being the most efficacious treatment for bipolar disorder, its use has been decreasing at least in part due to concerns about its potential to cause significant nephrotoxicity. Whilst the ability of lithium to cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is well established, its ability to cause chronic kidney disease is a much more vexing issue, with various studies suggesting both positive and negative causality. Despite these differences, the weight of evidence suggests that lithium has the potential to cause end stage kidney disease, albeit over a prolonged period.

Methods

A search strategy for this review was developed to identify appropriate studies, sourced from the electronic databases EMBASE, PubMed (NLM) and MEDLINE. Search terms included lithium with the AND operator to combine with nephrotoxicity or nephropathy or chronic kidney disease or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus or renal and pathophysiology.

Results

The risks for the development of lithium induced nephropathy are less well defined but appear to include the length of duration of therapy as well as increasing age, as well as episodes of over dosage/elevated lithium levels. Whilst guidelines exist for the routine monitoring of lithium levels and renal function, it remains unclear when nephrological evaluation should occur, as well as when cessation of lithium therapy is appropriate balancing the significant attendant mental health risks as well as the potential for progression to occur despite cessation of therapy against the risks and morbidity of bipolar disorder itself.

Conclusion

This paper will elucidate on the current evidence pertaining to the topic of the clinical management of lithium induced nephrotoxicity and provide a guide for clinicians who are faced with the long-term management of these patients.

5.1 Lithium Toxicity

The toxic concentrations for lithium (≥ 1.5 mEq/L) are close to the therapeutic range (0.8 to 1.2mEq/L). Some patients abnormally sensitive to lithium may exhibit toxic signs at serum concentrations that are considered within the therapeutic range [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Lithium may take up to 24 hours to distribute into brain tissue, so occurrence of acute toxicity symptoms may be delayed.

Neurological signs of lithium toxicity range from mild neurological adverse reactions such as fine tremor, lightheadedness, lack of coordination, and weakness; to moderate manifestations like giddiness, apathy, drowsiness, hyperreflexia, muscle twitching, ataxia, blurred vision, tinnitus, and slurred speech; and severe manifestations such as clonus, confusion, seizure, coma, and death. In rare cases, neurological sequelae may persist despite discontinuing lithium treatment and may be associated with cerebellar atrophy. Cardiac manifestations involve electrocardiographic changes, such as prolonged QT interval, ST and T-wave changes and myocarditis. Renal manifestations include urine concentrating defect, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and renal failure. Respiratory manifestations include dyspnea, aspiration pneumonia, and respiratory failure. Gastrointestinal manifestations include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bloating. No specific antidote for lithium poisoning is known [see Overdosage (10)].

The risk of lithium toxicity is increased by:

Recent onset of concurrent febrile illness
Concomitant administration of drugs which increase lithium serum concentrations by pharmacokinetic interactions or drugs affecting kidney function [see Drug Interactions (7)].
Acute ingestion
Impaired renal function
Volume depletion or dehydration
Significant cardiovascular disease
Changes in electrolyte concentrations (especially sodium and potassium)

Monitor for signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity. If symptoms occur, decrease dosage or discontinue lithium treatment.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary:

Lithium may cause harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Early voluntary reports to international birth registries suggested an increase in cardiovascular malformations, especially for Ebstein's anomaly, with first trimester use of lithium. Subsequent case-control and cohort studies indicate that the increased risk for cardiac malformations is likely to be small; however, the data are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk. There are concerns for maternal and/or neonatal lithium toxicity during late pregnancy and the postpartum period [see Clinical Considerations]. Published animal developmental and toxicity studies in mice and rats report an increased incidence of fetal mortality, decreased fetal weight, increased fetal skeletal abnormalities, and cleft palate (mouse fetuses only) with oral doses of lithium that produced serum concentrations similar to the human therapeutic range. Other published animal studies report adverse effects on embryonic implantation in rats after lithium administration. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations:

Dose Adjustments During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period: If the decision is made to continue lithium treatment during pregnancy, serum lithium concentrations should be monitored and the dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Two to three days prior to delivery, lithium dosage should be decreased or discontinued to reduce the risk of maternal and/or neonatal toxicity. Lithium may be restarted in the post-partum period at preconception doses in medically stable patients as long as serum lithium levels are closely monitored [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions: Lithium toxicity may occur in neonates who were exposed to lithium in late pregnancy. A floppy baby syndrome including neurological, cardiac, and hepatic abnormalities that are similar to those seen with lithium toxicity in adults have been observed. Symptoms include hypotonia, respiratory distress syndrome, cyanosis, lethargy, feeding difficulties, depressed neonatal reflexes, neonatal depression, apnea, and bradycardia. Monitor neonates and provide supportive care until lithium is excreted and toxic signs disappear, which may take up to 14 days.

Consider fetal echocardiography between 16 and 20 weeks gestation in a woman with first trimester lithium exposure because of the potential increased risk of cardiac malformations.

### Lithium: a potential therapeutic strategy in obsessive-compulsive disorder by targeting the canonical WNT / β pathway [^115M32u1]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, the links between neuro-anatomical and biochemical models have not yet been well-established definitively.

In recent years, oxidative stress and free radicals, inflammation, and the glutamatergic pathwayhave been shown to play key roles in the causes of OCD.

First-line therapies include cognitive-behavioral therapy. Augmentation strategies with antipsychotics could provide some benefits in at least a third of patients in the case of treatment resistance. Only 40–60% of the patients respond to first-line therapy and research for new treatment beyond current guidelines is mandatory.

This review focuses on the potential effects of lithium, as a potential therapeutic strategy, on OCD and some of the presumed mechanisms by which lithium provides its beneficial properties.

Lithium, which was introduced in 1949, is the main commonly used drug for the treatment of chronic mental illnesses, such as bipolar disorder, characterized by depressive and manic cycles. Lithium remains the first-line therapy for manic-depressive illness, bipolar disorder, traumatic brain injury, and numerous neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases. In the acute treatment of mania, the efficacy of lithium is well established. Several studies have shown that prophylactically lithium can reduce manic relapses, even if its efficacy is significantly lower in the reduction of depressive relapses. Moreover, other studies have presented that therapy by lithium could reduce suicides and suicide attempts in patients with mood disorders. Lithium therapeutic mechanisms remain complex, including several pathways and gene expression, such as neurotransmitters and receptors, circadian modulation, ion transport, and signal transduction processes.

Thus, recent advances seem to show that the benefits of lithium extend beyond just the treatment of mood. Neuroprotection against excitotoxicity or brain damage is another role of lithium. However, in contrast, several reports have presented that a high dose of lithium could induce irreversible neurotoxicity effects. Excessive intake or impaired excretion could result in lithium accumulation. Lithium is mainly susceptible to accumulation in bone, muscle, liver, thyroid, and kidney. Dehydration, febrile illness, or gastrointestinal loss can lead to elevated lithium levels in serum. Renal toxicity is more common in patients on chronic lithium therapy with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The neurologic effects are hyperreflexia, nystagmus, or ataxia and remain mostly reversible. Other troubles are reversible cardiovascular effects (QT prolongation, intraventricular conduction defects), gastrointestinal effects, and endocrine effects. But, low doses of lithium are correlated with lower side-effects.

### Evaluation of clarity of presentation and applicability of monitoring instructions for patients using lithium in clinical practice guidelines for treatment of bipolar disorder [^112UGe5U]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Lithium is used in the treatment and prevention of mood episodes in patients with bipolar disorder (BD), as well as in an augmenting strategy in patients with treatment‐resistant depression. 1, 2 Adequate monitoring of lithium treatment is essential in order to assess, at the level of the individual patient, the balance between efficacy and side effects, and to adjust the treatment if necessary. 3 Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index with high inter‐ and intra‐individual variability of the dose‐concentration relationship. High lithium levels increase the risk of side effects and intoxication, rendering patient monitoring even more important than for most other drugs. 4 Known long‐term side effects of lithium treatment include the development of renal impairment and hypothyroidism. 5 For the early identification of patients with an increased risk of these side effects, regular measurement of biomarkers is considered standard of care.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide guidance to health care professionals on patient monitoring. 6, 7 CPGs thus aim to bridge the gap between clinical research and clinical practice and to aid health care professionals in evidence‐based decision making. 7 A good‐quality guideline has been defined as providing: "the confidence that the potential biases inherent in guideline development have been addressed adequately and that the recommendations are both internally and externally valid (i.e. supported by evidence and applicable to target populations), and are feasible for practice". 8 In addition to the quality of the monitoring instructions in CPGs, it is important that monitoring instructions are easily identifiable and applicable for health care professionals. In a recent study from our research group, 74% of lithium prescribers stated that their monitoring policy was based on a guideline or institutional protocol. 9

To be applicable for health care professionals, it is important that guidelines address which and how clinical or biomarker parameters need to be monitored. Information is needed on when to start monitoring, when to stop monitoring, how frequently to monitor, what critical values are and how to respond to these values. 10, 11 CPGs should preferably include monitoring parameters that are specific, sensitive, accessible, affordable and applicable, and that provide early results to enable intervention. 12 Previous studies by our group revealed that instructions for monitoring in Summary of Product Characteristics of (psychotropic) drugs in general were often found to be too ambiguous to be applicable in clinical practice. 13, 14 The applicability of monitoring instructions for patients using lithium in CPGs for treatment of BD is still unknown.

The objective of this study was to assess the clarity of presentation and applicability of monitoring instructions for patients using lithium in CPGs for treatment of BD.

1 INTRODUCTION

Lithium has been licensed in Europe and North America for the long‐term maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder (BD) for more than 45 years and is justifiably considered one of the first line options in major global treatment guidelines, such as the WFSBP guideline, 1 the NICE guideline, 2 the RANZCP guideline, 3 the Dutch guideline, 4 the BAP guideline, 5 the CINP guideline 6 and the CANMAT/ISBD guideline. 7 However, lithium has a very low therapeutic index, that is, a low ratio between the dose (or serum level) that is associated with toxicity (mainly CNS and renal toxicity) and the dose associated with therapeutic effect. The therapeutic index for lithium is approximately 2. 8

For maintenance treatment of BD several reviews recommend differing minimum effective lithium serum levels ranging from 0.40 mmol/L 9, 10, 11 and 0.50 mmol/L, 12 or 0.60 mmol/L 13 to as high as 0.80 mmol/L. 14, 15 In addition, some major clinical practice guidelines recommend optimal ranges, but these also lack consistency. For instance, the NICE guideline, 2 the RANZCP guideline 3, 16 and the BAP guideline 5 recommend 0.60‐0.80 mmol, the CANMAT/ISBD guideline 7 0.60‐1.00 mmol/L, and the CINP guideline 6 0.60‐1.20 mmol/L, whereas other guidelines, for example, the WFSBP guideline, 1 do not provide specific recommendations. Finally, some reviews more specifically recommend targeting serum levels for individual patients " on the basis of efficacy and tolerability" without further specification 15 or " primarily at 0.60‐0.75/0.80 guided by clinical response and tolerability" 16 within a broad range of 0.40‐1.20 mmol/L, 10 which is also recommended in the Dutch guideline. 4 The major problem underlying these different recommendations is that large studies, well designed to assess the optimal serum level in maintenance treatment, specifically the serum level that best balances efficacy and tolerability for most patients, are lacking.

### Causes, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of high lithium levels and intoxications: retrospective analysis of patient records [^114GGAsA]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The mood stabilizer lithium has a narrow therapeutic index with a relevant risk of intoxication. We used real-world hospital data to identify causes, treatment courses, and outcomes of high lithium levels and intoxications.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of patients with a lithium concentration of ⩾1.1mmol/L, who were treated at Charité University Medical Center Berlin.

Results

We identified 136 patients (58% women; mean age: 54.7years) with high lithium levels or intoxication. 66.9% were chronic (stable lithium dose but changes in other variables such as co-medication). 40.4% took at least one risk medication with a relative contraindication for concurrent lithium treatment. 11.1% of the cases with a high therapeutic level showed moderate to severe intoxications. Feverish infections were significantly associated with severe intoxications. Overall, 97.1% (132/136) of patients fully recovered, two had residual but mild symptoms and two died during hospitalization (unlikely related to the intoxication). In 37.5% of patients, no psychiatrist was involved in the management of high lithium levels or intoxication. In these patients, lithium treatment was adjusted or discontinued in 37.3% of the cases compared to 64.7% when a psychiatrist was involved (χ²(1) = 9.683, p = 0.002).

Conclusions

Patients and medical doctors should be aware of the increased risk of lithium intoxication already within the high therapeutic range and should consider alternative medications without relative contraindications for concurrent lithium use. Involving psychiatrists during or after an intoxication event is associated with more frequent adjustment of the maintenance lithium dose and should be considered in most cases.

### Lithium levels in tap water and the mental health problems of adolescents: an individual-level cross-sectional survey [^113SBkrG]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

We investigated the association between lithium level in tap water and mental health problems, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, and aggressive and suicidal behaviors, in a general population of adolescents using a large individual-level dataset.

Methods

A school-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted in Kochi Prefecture in Japan between 2008 and 2009. Students in 24 public junior high schools were asked to anonymously complete a self-report questionnaire. The main outcome measures were mental health problems, including those on the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, interpersonal violence, bullying, destructive behavior, self-harm, and suicidal ideation. Samples were collected from sources that supplied drinking water to schools, and lithium levels were measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The associations of lithium levels with mental health problems were examined using a generalized linear mixed model with schools as the fixed effect. Potential confounding factors were also added into the model.

Results

A total of 3,040 students among 3,311 students responded to the self-report questionnaire (response rate, 91.8%). The mean lithium concentration in tap water was 0.48 μg/L (SD = 0.52; range, 0.01 to 2.10; skewness = 2.01; kurtosis = 4.04), and it was relatively low compared with previous studies. In multivariable regression analysis, lithium level in tap water had an inverse association with depressive symptoms (P = 0.02) and interpersonal violence (P = 0.02) but not with suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation, P = 0.82; self-harm, P = 0.46).

Conclusions

Lithium level in tap water was inversely associated with depressive symptoms and interpersonal violence among a general population of adolescents and may have antidepressive and antiaggressive effects.

Patient preferences and perceived burdens with lithium in bipolar disorder indicate that patient preferences vary largely, and lithium has a reputation that can be favorable or unfavorable because of stigmatizing side effects, including tremor, weight gain (which can be rapid from water retention), hair loss, and a requirement for periodic blood tests; it might also have an unfavorable reputation because of potential for more serious harms, including kidney and thyroid dysfunction, gastrointestinal symptoms, and toxicity associated with high blood levels.

Lithium Toxicity

The toxic concentrations for lithium (≥ 1.5 mEq/L) are close to the therapeutic range (0.8 to 1.2mEq/L). Some patients abnormally sensitive to lithium may exhibit toxic signs at serum concentrations that are considered within the therapeutic range [see Boxed Warning, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]. Lithium may take up to 24 hours to distribute into brain tissue, so occurrence of acute toxicity symptoms may be delayed.

Neurological signs of lithium toxicity range from mild neurological adverse reactions such as fine tremor, lightheadedness, lack of coordination, and weakness; to moderate manifestations like giddiness, apathy, drowsiness, hyperreflexia, muscle twitching, ataxia, blurred vision, tinnitus, and slurred speech; and severe manifestations such as clonus, confusion, seizure, coma, and death. In rare cases, neurological sequelae may persist despite discontinuing lithium treatment and may be associated with cerebellar atrophy. Cardiac manifestations involve electrocardiographic changes, such as prolonged QT interval, ST and T-wave changes and myocarditis. Renal manifestations include urine concentrating defect, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and renal failure. Respiratory manifestations include dyspnea, aspiration pneumonia, and respiratory failure. Gastrointestinal manifestations include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bloating. No specific antidote for lithium poisoning is known [see OVERDOSAGE].

The risk of lithium toxicity is increased by:

Recent onset of concurrent febrile illness
Concomitant administration of drugs which increase lithium serum concentrations by pharmacokinetic interactions or drugs affecting kidney function [see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions]
Acute ingestion
Impaired renal function
Volume depletion or dehydration
Significant cardiovascular disease
Changes in electrolyte concentrations (especially sodium and potassium)

Monitor for signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity. If symptoms occur, decrease dosage or discontinue lithium treatment.

Mania

A few studies have reported notable benefits to mania, one appearing comparable to standard dose lithium (both achieving a response rate of 21%) and another reporting benefits compared to placebo, although it must be highlighted that in many cases, higher doses will be required at least for a brief period.

Together, the evidence for low dose lithium across neuropsychiatric health has recently been systematically reviewed. Being that the most consistent finding from this related to low-dose lithium benefits to cognitive functioning, it is worth mentioning here other indications for low dose lithium. Even at low doses lithium appears to have biological effects that may be neuroprotective and it is worth mentioning other putative indications for low doses including relating to dementia, suicide and various physical outcomes.

Low-dose lithium can be combined with an additional mood stabiliser at just above its minimum therapeutic level to maintain effectiveness with increased tolerability of both medications.

Box 2 summarises one real-world clinical case using lower dose lithium with apparent benefits.

### Lithium carbonate (lithane) [^113cD9cb]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Acute Mania

Optimal patient response to lithium carbonate usually can be established and maintained with 600 mg t.i.d. Such doses will normally produce an effective serum lithium level ranging between 1.0 and 1.5 mEq./l. Dosage must be individualized according to serum levels and clinical response. Regular monitoring of the patient's clinical state and of serum lithium levels is necessary. Serum levels should be determined twice per week during the acute phase, and until the serum level and clinical condition of the patient have been stabilized.

Long term Control

The desirable lithium levels are 0.6 to 1.2 mEq./l. Dosage will vary from one individual to another, but usually 300 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d will maintain this level. Serum lithium levels in uncomplicated cases receiving maintenance therapy during remission should be monitored at least every two months.

Patients abnormally sensitive to lithium may exhibit toxic signs at serum levels of 1.0 to 1.5 mEq./l. Elderly patients often respond to reduced dosage, and may exhibit signs of toxicity at serum levels ordinarily tolerated by other patients.

N.B.

Blood samples for serum lithium determinations should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e., 8–12 hours after the previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum levels alone. Accurate patient evaluation requires both clinical and laboratory analysis.

### Lithium for acute mania [^1177hQ6v]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bipolar disorder is a common condition associated with high morbidity; developing efficacious, safe treatments is therefore essential. Lithium is an effective maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder. It acts as mood stabiliser and reduces the risk of suicide. However, evidence assessing the efficacy of lithium in the treatment of acute mania is less robust. Current evidence-based guidelines cite multiple anti-dopaminergic and mood-stabilising agents as initial treatments: more definite evidence is needed to decide if lithium should be the first-line therapy.

Objectives

1. To assess the effects of lithium in comparison with placebo or other active treatment in alleviating the acute symptoms of a manic or mixed episode in people with bipolar disorder.2. To review the acceptability and tolerability of treatment with lithium in comparison with placebo or other active treatments in alleviating the acute symptoms of a manic or mixed episode in people with bipolar disorder.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. We also searched the World Health Organization trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. We have incorporated studies from searches to 18 May 2018 into the current analyses.

Selection Criteria

Prospective randomised controlled studies comparing lithium with placebo or alternative drug treatment in treatment of acute mania. We included anyone with bipolar disorder, male and female, of any age.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. We used odds ratios (ORs) to analyse binary efficacy outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuously distributed outcomes. We used a fixed-effect model unless heterogeneity was moderate or substantial, in which case we used a random-effects model. We used Review Manager 5 to analyse data. We assessed the certainty of evidence for individual outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We found 36 randomised controlled studies comparing lithium with placebo, one of 12 drugs, or electroconvulsive therapy for treatment of acute mania. Studies included male and female participants (n = 4220), of all ages, who all fitted criteria for a manic episode within the context of a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Risk of bias was variable; 12 studies had a high risk of bias in one domain and 27 gave inadequate information on randomisation leading to an 'unclear' rating for selection bias. Lithium versus placeboHigh-certainty evidence found that lithium was an effective treatment for acute mania and was more effective than placebo at inducing a response (OR 2.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.73 to 2.63; participants = 1707; studies = 6; I² = 16%; high-certainty evidence), or remission (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.69; participants = 1597; studies = 5; I² = 21%; high-certainty evidence). Lithium was more likely than placebo to cause tremor (OR 3.25, 95% CI 2.10 to 5.04; participants = 1241; studies = 6; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence), and somnolence (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.46 to 3.58; participants = 1351; studies = 7; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of lithium for all-cause dropouts (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.25; participants = 1353; studies = 7; I² = 75%; moderate-certainty evidence), and weight gain (OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.56 to 3.92; participants = 735, studies = 3; I² = 51%; moderate-certainty evidence). Lithium versus antipsychotics or mood stabilisersFor the outcome of inducing a response, there was only very low-certainty evidence regarding lithium compared to haloperidol (MD -2.40, 95% CI -6.31 to 1.50; participants = 80; studies = 3; I² = 95%), quetiapine (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.55; participants = 335; studies = 2; I² = 71%), and carbamazepine (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.60; participants = 102; studies = 3; I² = 0%). Lithium was probably less likely to induce a response than olanzapine (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.94; participants = 180; studies = 2; I² = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence). Lithium may be less likely to induce a response than risperidone (MD 7.28, 95% CI 5.22 to 9.34; participants = 241; studies = 3; I² = 49%; low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between lithium and valproate (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.70; participants = 607; studies = 5; I² = 22%; moderate-certainty evidence). There was moderate-certainty evidence that lithium was more effective than topiramate at treating acute mania (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.63 to 3.20; participants = 660; studies = 1). Data on adverse events for these comparisons contained too few studies to provide high-certainty evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review indicates that lithium is more effective than placebo as a treatment for acute mania but increases the risk for somnolence and tremor. Limited evidence suggests little or no difference between lithium and other mood stabilisers (valproate, carbamazepine) or antipsychotics (risperidone, quetiapine, haloperidol). Olanzapine may be an exception, as it is probably slightly more effective than lithium. There is uncertain evidence that risperidone may also be more effective than lithium. Lithium is probably more effective at treating acute mania than topiramate. When compared to placebo, lithium was more likely to cause adverse events. However, when compared to other drugs, too few studies provided data on adverse effects to provide high-certainty evidence. More, rigorously designed, large-scale studies are needed to definitively conclude if lithium is superior to other interventions in treating acute mania.

### Saliva testing as a means to monitor therapeutic lithium levels in patients with psychiatric disorders: identification of clinical and environmental covariates, and their incorporation into a prediction model [^116YyuM7]. Bipolar Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Importantly, we found that lithium measurements were stable at 4℃ or room temperature for at least 24 h. This feature would further facilitate a home‐health care‐based program that could involve saliva sample collection at home, followed by samples sent to a centralized lab for lithium measurements. The results could then be monitored and discussed remotely via a telemedicine encounter. Such a process could avoid the costly office, and maybe even hospital, visits.

Our study is not without limitations. One limitation was that it included a limited number of samples from patients within the higher range of serum lithium levels (≥ 1.0 mmol/L), and it is within this range that the between‐subject prediction of serum lithium levels fell by greater than 0.2 mmol/L outside of the observed levels (see Figure 2B), and variability increased (see Figure S4). Given the upper limit of toxicity for serum lithium is 1.5 mmol/L, predicting serum levels from saliva levels in patients taking high doses of lithium could be problematic when using the intersubject model with regards to potential toxic side effects. However, when serum levels were predicted using the average intrasubject ratio from three appointments, the predicted serum level was less than 0.1 mmol/L from the observed level for 75% of the patients, with two patients having predicted levels > 0.2 mmol/L. This suggests accurate estimations of serum lithium using the average ratios, although future studies to better characterize saliva lithium levels at the upper boundaries of the therapeutic range and into the toxic range will be needed to more fully characterize the value of saliva testing of lithium before implementation into routine clinical practice. Additionally, the value of salivary measures would need to be calibrated to an individual, as there are currently no FDA standards for a stand‐alone saliva measure.

Dose Reduction during Periods of Stability

Dose modification clearly is not suitable for all patients and must be personalised, based on a patient's unique profile including the observed natural history of the condition, the degree of risk when unwell, their preferences, physical health status and experience of side effects. Indeed, variable dosing based on current wellness and risk of relapse is another strategy which is not empirically validated. However, we know that:

Many people with bipolar disorders are able to sustain long periods of time without affective symptoms, particularly while taking lithium.
Reduced dose and/or frequency of lithium is associated with reduced adverse renal effects.
Gradual down-titration appears to substantially reduce the time to symptom recurrence; even when ultimately discontinued, one study has reported a time to relapse of 2.5 months when lithium was rapidly discontinued, compared with 14 months when gradually discontinued.
Empowerment in managing one's own treatment is evidenced to improve acceptability and adherence.
There are other interventions, which could be employed concomitantly with lithium, that decrease relapse through enhanced recognition of episode risk e.g. early warning signs training.

Thus, for some patients, lithium dose could be maintained at a lower level when stably euthymic and increased when at risk of relapse or upon the emergence of subsyndromal symptoms. For these patients, dose modifications should be clinician-led and with agreement between both the patient and clinician as to the logistics and level of autonomy in dose management.

It is anticipated that this approach may not be suitable for people who experience high rates of relapse or ongoing inter-episode symptoms. These individuals may require maintenance of a lithium level within 0.6–0.6.8mmol/l (compared to 0.4–0.5 mmol/l). It is perhaps those (often with bipolar type I) who do not experience more than trivial symptoms when between episodes who could benefit from lithium levels between 0.4–0.4.5mmol/L when well.

Finally, the Nolen study also suggests no big additional benefit of levels 0.80 to < 1.0 mmol/L over 0.60 to < 0.85 mmol/L, which is in line with the Maj study which did not find a difference between levels 0.76‐0.90 mmol/L and 0.61‐0.75 mmol/L. Although we should recognize the possibility of a Type 2 error, for example, that with larger numbers a difference may have been found, these studies suggest an upper effective cutoff around 0.80 mmol/L. Nevertheless, again there may be some patients for whom higher levels up to 1.00 mmol/L are more effective and well tolerated. In addition, however, there are no data supporting the notion that going beyond 1.00 mmol/L is associated with any further benefit, possibly with exception of its use in the treatment of acute manic episodes (not further being discussed in this paper). In addition, the upper limit of 0.80 or 1.00 mmol/L is of course also defined by the increased risk of side effects and toxicity at higher lithium serum levels. 41

Taking all these above data into account, they do support the outcome of the Delphi survey: that for adults (18‐65 years) the standard therapeutic lithium serum level in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder should be 0.60‐0.80 mmol/L with the option to reduce the level to the low therapeutic level of 0.40‐0.60 mmol/L in case of sufficient response but poor tolerance or to increase the level to the high therapeutic level of 0.80‐1.00 mmol/L in case of insufficient response and good tolerance (Figure 2). The recommendation for the standard therapeutic level of 0.60‐0.80 mmol/L is in line with the NICE guideline, 2 the RANZCP guideline, 3 the BAP guideline 5 and the "Lithiumeter 2.0". 16

### Management of lithium dosing around delivery: an observational study [^114W2zkM]. Bipolar Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

A second argument for decreasing or discontinuing lithium treatment just before labor is the belief that a lower neonatal lithium blood level at time of delivery reduces the risks of lithium side‐effects in the neonate. This argument is based on the important study by Newport et al, 19 in which lithium concentrations and obstetrical outcomes were available for 10 neonates, plus for another 14 neonates identified from published reports. Infants were grouped into a low and high lithium exposure group (cut‐off of 0.64 meq/L). They found that the high lithium exposure group had a higher rate of complications compared to the low lithium group, including central nervous system and neuromuscular complications, longer duration of infant hospital stay, and lower 1‐minute Apgar scores. In our sample of 29 neonates, we did not find a significant association between neonatal lithium blood levels and neonatal outcomes. A potential explanation for these contrasting findings is that neonatal blood level range differed substantially between our sample and the sample of Newport et al. 19 The high lithium exposure group in Newport's study was predominantly composed of the neonates from previous case reports, who often had a lithium blood level higher than 0.7 and with some neonates classified as being within the toxic range (> 1.2 mmol/L). Their low lithium exposure group existed mainly of women who had suspended their lithium treatment before delivery, and lithium levels were mostly subtherapeutic (< 0.5 mmol/L). In our sample, most women were within the therapeutic window and no toxic levels were observed. Neonatal lithium levels might be associated with neonatal complication rate only if high (toxic) lithium dosages are used. Moreover, in the Newport paper, the overall complication rate of 100% in the high exposure group was driven by case reports on this topic for which publication bias is likely. Case studies are in origin a tool to disseminate information on unusual clinical syndromes, disease associations, or unusual side effects to therapy, 20 and therefore in this case more likely to be published if neonatal complications were present with high lithium levels.

### Quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide (Accuretic) [^114D1ur2]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Lithium:

Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with ACCURETIC, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. ACCURETIC and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.

Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS):

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on ACCURETIC and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with ACCURETIC in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with ACCURETIC in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2).

Tetracycline and Other Drugs That Interact with Magnesium:

Simultaneous administration of tetracycline with quinapril reduced the absorption of tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium content in quinapril tablets. This interaction should be considered if coprescribing quinapril and tetracycline or other drugs that interact with magnesium.

Gold:

Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy.

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors):

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including quinapril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including quinapril may be attenuated by NSAIDs.

1 INTRODUCTION

Lithium was identified as a treatment for bipolar disorder in 1949 and remains a first line of treatment for both mania and depression, with particular benefit in reducing suicidality. While highly effective, the use of lithium is limited by its narrow therapeutic range (0.4–1.2 mmol/L), and common occurrence of adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, tremors, drowsiness, disorientation, and renal and thyroid dysfunction. These side effects are commonly dose related but can occur even at therapeutic doses. At higher serum concentrations, the potential for side effects and risk of toxicity increases further. The presence of side effects may contribute to poor outcomes and medication non‐adherence. For these reasons, lithium requires frequent monitoring of blood serum levels. International guidelines recommend that patients on lithium medication undergo lithium level monitoring at least every 3–6 months, and even more frequently after dosage change, in case of relapse, or upon symptoms of intoxication.

4.8 Practical considerations regarding lithium level monitoring

Due to lithium's low therapeutic index, its serum levels should always be monitored during treatment, at least when treatment is initiated, after each dose increase and every 3‐6 months thereafter. The blood samples for measuring the lithium level must be drawn at steady state occurring after 5‐6 times the half‐life of lithium, which is approximately 24 hours in the nonelderly with normal renal function. Thus, the lithium level should be measured after 5‐6 days at constant daily dosing. In the elderly or in patients with impaired renal function, the time to steady state increases, implying that the lithium level should also be measured after 10‐12 days. In individual patients treated with a given schedule with a given lithium formulation, at steady state, the ratio of daily lithium dose, and the 12 hours lithium level is constant. An additional requirement for safe use of lithium is to monitor renal function at baseline and also every 3‐6 months.

Finally, it should be taken into account that subjects with a relatively high renal function, in particular young men, may have an unexpectedly low 12‐hours lithium level despite a relatively high daily lithium dose due to relative large variations in lithium levels over the day. If the dose is increased to obtain a lithium level within the recommended range, such patients may become intoxicated. 46

Coppen 23 included 88 BP and UP patients of whom 72 completed the 1 year study, including 23 BP patients. Prior to the trial all patients already were using lithium with a mean serum level of 0.86 ± 0.20 mmol/L, and an unreported number were also using antipsychotics or antidepressants. The patients were probably also not in remission as the report presents pre‐trial morbidity data which were compared with data during the trial, implying that it was not a pure recurrence prevention study. At baseline patients were randomized to continue lithium at the same dose or to receive a dose reduction in about 25% or 50% resulting in 3 different 12‐hour lithium level ranges of 0.45‐0.59, 0.60‐0.79, and ≥ 0.80 mmol/L. Outcome measure was not a relapse or recurrence but the change in score on the Affective Morbidity Index during the trial compared to pre‐trial ratings.

Thus, this study only fulfilled 2 of the original inclusion criteria (5 and 6). Further limitations are that only the number of BP patients who completed the study is presented, leaving unclear how many BP patients were included and how many dropped out and that the randomization procedure is unclear.

Maj 24 studied 80 BP patients (69 completers) with recurrent episodes (at least one episode during the 2 years " preceding the index episode and the commencement of lithium prophylaxis"), indicating that patients were not in remission (implying that it was not a pure recurrence prevention study), but also leaving unclear whether or not patients were already using lithium prior to the trial. At baseline, patients were divided (but not randomized, personal information to ES) to 4 different groups (n = 20) with 12‐hour lithium levels ranges of 0.30‐0.45, 0.46‐0.60, 0.61‐0.75, and 0.76‐0.90 mmol/L, while potential use of other psychotropic medication is not reported. Major endpoint was " mean number of episodes and mean total morbidity (expressed in months)" during the 2 years of the trial compared with the 2 years prior to the trial.

### Lithium carbonate (Lithobid) [^114qgJBD]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

The toxic concentrations for lithium (≥ 1.5 mEq/L) are close to the therapeutic concentrations. It is therefore important that patients and their families be cautioned to watch for early toxic symptoms and to discontinue the drug and inform the physician should they occur (see WARNINGS: Lithium Toxicity).

Treatment

No specific antidote for lithium poisoning is known. Treatment is supportive. Early symptoms of lithium toxicity can usually be treated by reduction or cessation of dosage of the drug and resumption of the treatment at a lower dose after 24 to 48 hours. In severe cases of lithium poisoning, the first and foremost goal of treatment consists of elimination of this ion from the patient.

Treatment is essentially the same as that used in barbiturate poisoning: 1) gastric lavage, 2) correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance and, 3) regulation of kidney functioning. Urea, mannitol, and aminophylline all produce significant increases in lithium excretion. Hemodialysis is an effective and rapid means of removing the ion from the severely toxic patient. However, patient recovery may be slow.

Infection prophylaxis, regular chest X-rays, and preservation of adequate respiration are essential.

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD / IGSLI task force on treatment with lithium [^113B2BUQ]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

3.5 Delphi survey

The Delphi survey was completed by 33 of the 50 (66.6%) Task Force members. Many statements received additional comments, most frequently that evidence regarding a statement or a specified response was lacking.

There was consensus on recommendations regarding timing of blood sampling to measure lithium serum levels during the day and on whether recommendations for optimal serum lithium levels should be the same with once daily dosing compared to twice daily dosing, as well as with different formulations of lithium medication (immediate release vs extended release).

There was a lack of consensus on the overall statement "The higher the lithium serum level, the higher the likelihood of a preventative response " (endorsed by only 54.5%) while several members commented that serum levels in the lower range (below 0.60 mmol/L) are associated with efficacy but in the higher range (above 1.00 mmol/L) with more adverse effects and toxicity. In addition, there was no consensus on the statement "There is a minimum serum cut‐off level below which essentially no patients are likely to experience a preventative effect" (endorsed by 72.7%) while there was a wide range of specified responses regarding for a specific cut‐off level (0.30, 0.40, 0.50, or 0.60 mmol/L, endorsed by 16.7, 41.7, 16.7, or 20.8%, respectively). In contrast, there was consensus on the statement "There is a maximum lithium serum level that should ideally never be exceeded because of the risk of severe intolerance and/or intoxication" (endorsed by 93.9%) but lack of agreement on a specific upper limit to recommend: most frequently supported limits being 1.00 and 1.20 mmol/L, endorsed by 35.5 and 38.7%, respectively.

### The lithiumeter: a measured approach [^116dy6dX]. Bipolar Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Lithium has long been recognised for its mood-stabilizing effects in the management of bipolar disorder (BD) but in practice its use has been limited because of real and 'imagined' concerns. This article addresses the need for lithium to be measured with respect to its clinical and functional effects. It introduces a visual scale, termed lithiumeter, which captures the optimal lithium plasma levels for the treatment of BD.

Methods

Key words pertaining to lithium's administration, dosing, and side effects as well as its efficacy in acute and long-term treatment of BD were used to conduct an electronic search of the literature. Relevant articles were identified by the authors and reviewed.

Results

This paper outlines the considerations necessary prior to initiating lithium therapy and provides a guide to monitoring lithium plasma levels. Current recommendations for optimal plasma lithium levels in the management of BD are then discussed with respect to indications for use in the acute phases of the illness and maintenance therapy. The risks associated with lithium treatment are also discussed.

Conclusions

The lithiumeter provides a practical guide of optimal lithium levels for the clinical management of BD.

### Differential acute impact of therapeutically effective and overdose concentrations of lithium on human neuronal single cell and network function [^111U438C]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lithium salts are used as mood-balancing medication prescribed to patients suffering from neuropsychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. After oral application of lithium, lithium is taken up by the gut system, becomes distributed within the blood system, crosses the blood-brain barrier, thereby, lithium is present within the brain parenchyma, and most likely influences human neuronal function within less than a few hours after oral application. Thus, the functional alterations related to acute exposure to lithium at individual human neuron as well as neuronal circuit level represents an interesting but unaddressed question.

In addition to the beneficial mood-balancing effects, lithium medication may also cause overdose symptoms, e.g. seizures (e.g. ref. in lithium-treated patients). Since the risk of lithium-induced seizures, among other severe symptoms, is substantial in patients treated with a high concentration of lithium (> 1.2 mM), co-medication of antiepileptic drugs might reduce the risk of lithium-induced seizures. Testing co-medication approaches of increased concentrations of lithium with antiepileptic drugs in humans is not feasible. Therefore, a preclinical human model system with lithium-induced abnormal neuronal activity, that is allowing the evaluation of the efficacy of drugs in counteracting pathophysiological neuronal discharges is an unmet medical research need.

### Bipolar depression and suicidal ideation: moderators and mediators of a complex relationship [^114Uoc4u]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Not all patients with bipolar depression have suicidal ideation (SI). This study examines some factors that link bipolar depression to SI.

Methods

482 individuals with bipolar I or II were randomized to either lithium or quetiapine plus adjunctive personalized therapy in a 24 week comparative effectiveness trial. Severity of depression and SI were assessed with the Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale (BISS). We examined potential moderators (age, gender, age of illness onset, bipolar type, comorbid anxiety, substance use, past suicide attempts, childhood abuse and treatment arm) and mediators (severity of anxiety, mania, irritability, impairment in functioning (LIFE-RIFT) and satisfaction and enjoyment of life (Q-LES-Q)) of the effect of depression on SI. Statistical analyses were conducted using generalized estimating equations with repeated measures.

Results

Bipolar type and past suicide attempts moderated the effect of depression on SI. Life satisfaction mediated the effect of depression and SI. The relationship between anxiety, depression and SI was complex due to the high level of correlation. Treatment with lithium or quetiapine did not moderate the effect of depression on SI.

Limitations

Suicide assessment was only done using an item on BISS. Patient population was not specifically chosen for high suicide risk.

Discussion

Individuals with Bipolar II experienced more SI with lower levels of depression severity. A history of suicide predisposed patients to higher levels of SI given the same severity of depression. Reduced life satisfaction mediates the effect of depression on SI and may be a target for therapeutic interventions.

### Lithium carbonate [^113yhvMv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Long-Term Control

The desirable serum lithium levels are 0.6 to 1.2 mEq/L. Dosage will vary from one individual to another, but usually 900 mg to 1200 mg per day in divided doses will maintain this level. Serum lithium levels in uncomplicated cases receiving maintenance therapy during remission should be monitored at least every two months.

Patients unusually sensitive to lithium may exhibit toxic signs at serum levels below 1 mEq/L.

Important Considerations

Blood samples for serum lithium determinations should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e., 8 to 12 hours after the previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum levels alone. Accurate patient evaluation requires both clinical and laboratory analysis.
Elderly patients often respond to reduced dosage, and may exhibit signs of toxicity at serum levels ordinarily tolerated by younger patients.
Lithium Carbonate Extended-Release Tablets must be swallowed whole and never chewed or crushed.

### Lithium in bipolar and other affective disorders: prescribing practice in the UK [^1112uZGf]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

The use of lithium for the treatment of mania, prophylaxis of bipolar disorder and augmentation of antidepressants in treatment-refractory unipolar depression is supported by British Association for Psychopharmacology and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines. We describe prescribing patterns with lithium in a large sample of patients with affective disorders. Data were collected during a baseline clinical audit of the quality of lithium monitoring, conducted by the Prescribing Observatory for Mental Health. Thirty-five National Health Service Trusts submitted data for 2776 patients with a diagnosis of affective illness (ICD10 F30–39), 1919 (69%) of whom had bipolar affective disorder. The last recorded lithium level was below the therapeutic range (< 0.4 mmol/L) in one in 10 patients. Co-prescribing was common; 57% of bipolar patients were prescribed an antipsychotic and 77% of those with other affective disorders, an antidepressant. We conclude that serum lithium levels within the therapeutic range are maintained in the majority of patients. A high proportion of patients are co-prescribed other psychotropic drugs; such prescribing is consistent with evidence-based treatment guidelines and may reflect difficulty managing the symptoms of affective disorders with lithium monotherapy. A significant minority of patients prescribed lithium had a sub-therapeutic blood level and so may be at high risk of relapse.

### Lithiumeter: version 2.0 [^112Mcn4F]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The Lithiumeter was developed as a visual and practical guide for determining lithium levels in the management of bipolar disorder (BD). It appears to have been well received, as evidenced by its increasing popularity amongst doctors as a deskside clinical aide, and adoption and reproduction of the schematic in clinical guidelines and texts. However, since its publication 5 years ago, key basic neuroscience and clinical research developments pertaining to lithium have significantly advanced our understanding, necessitating further refinement of guidance concerning the practicalities of lithium therapy.

Methods

Literature concerning the indications for, and therapeutic levels of, lithium and the associated acute and chronic risks of therapy was scrutinized as part of updating clinical practice guidelines. We have reviewed these updates and identified significant areas of change with respect to the previous Lithiumeter (version 1.0).

Results

Since 2011, updated clinical practice guidelines have narrowed the indicated plasma lithium concentration for maintenance therapy, suggesting that additional guidance is necessary for optimizing treatment. Relevant updated clinical guidance was integrated to constitute the Lithiumeter 2.0, which provides a more comprehensive overview of the practical aspects of lithium therapy while maintaining a focus on optimization of lithium levels, such as differential titration of lithium depending on the current mood state.

Conclusions

The Lithiumeter 2.0 is an update that clinicians will find useful for their practice. By addressing some of the issues faced in clinical practice, translational clinical research will continue to inform the Lithiumeter in future updates.

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD / IGSLI task force on treatment with lithium [^1147Vghf]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Based on our review and the responses obtained in our Delphi survey we recommend that the standard serum level in the maintenance treatment of adults with BD should be 0.60‐0.80 mmol/L with the option to reduce the level to 0.40‐0.60 mmol/L in case of sufficient response but poor tolerance, or to increase the level to 0.80‐1.00 mmol/L in case of insufficient response and good tolerance. For children and adolescents the majority of the Task Force members endorsed the same recommendation, while for the elderly the majority endorsed a more conservative approach: usually 0.40‐0.60 mmol/L, with the option to go to maximally 0.70 or 0.80 mmol/L at ages 65‐79 years, and to maximally 0.70 mmol/L over age 80 years. Sampling should be in the morning 12 ± 1 hours after intake of the evening dose. Tentative recommendations for optimal serum lithium levels should be the same with once and twice daily dosing, and with immediate release formulations compared to extended release formulations.

While the above recommendations reflect the available evidence, more high‐quality research is still needed to provide more refined advices.

### Lithium specificity in bipolar illness: a classic agent for the classic disorder [^114tLJcy]. Bipolar Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

For over half a century, lithium has been the gold standard amongst the pharmacological armamentarium used to treat bipolar disorder. Its ascendancy in this regard has been attributed partly to its primacy of discovery and clinical implementation; however, it is important to consider how it has achieved success and retained its prominence and whether this is because of its unique profile and specificity of actions. In this paper, we briefly discuss the clinical evidence in support of lithium specificity and argue for its continuing use in those patients most likely to benefit, namely, patients with 'classic' bipolar disorder. Further, we suggest that accurate characterization of 'lithium responders' through focused research is likely to yield novel treatments and assist in better understanding of the pathophysiology of the illness. In addition, the unique antisuicidal actions of lithium warrant further examination, as do its impressive properties as a prophylactic agent. This is particularly so given the high morbidity associated with bipolar disorder and its potential for suicide. Hence, in this paper, after describing the changing diagnostic backdrop against which much of the research to date has been conducted, we discuss the clinical therapeutic profile of lithium in both the acute and long-term management of bipolar disorder and its phenotypic specificity of action. We demonstrate that lithium possesses significant clinical and therapeutic efficacy that is very individual and thus remains the treatment of choice for bipolar disorder when used specifically in select patients.

### Lithium intoxication: incidence, clinical course and renal function-a population-based retrospective cohort study [^114QapxV]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

Case analysis

Of the eligible patients, 75% consented to the study. Including patients who had passed away, 1101 patients (82%) were analysed. Patients not consenting did not differ significantly in age, sex, maximal measured creatinine or maximum lithium level from the patients who were included.

Of the 1101 patients who were analysed, 77 had experienced 91 episodes of lithium intoxication with lithium levels ⩾1.5 mmol/L. Of these, 10 patients had two episodes and two patients had three episodes of intoxication, but there was no obvious pattern in these repeated episodes. Fourteen per cent had a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, 7% schizoaffective disorder, 71% BPAD and 8% depression.

Twenty-nine episodes occurred during the first two years of lithium treatment. The proportion of cases of acute intoxication was significantly higher in this subgroup (p < 0.01).

Seventy-two (79%) episodes concerned moderate plasma elevations in the range 1.50–2.5 mmol/L, and 19 (21%) episodes concerned severe plasma elevations > 2.5 mmol/L. The highest lithium level detected was 9.26 mmol/L in the context of an intentional overdose. In all groups, women accounted for about two-thirds of intoxication episodes (p < 0.01). The mean age for all these episodes was 54.3 years (SD = 17.9 years, range 22–86 years). Patients with severe intoxication were significantly younger (p < 0.05; Table 1).

Table 1.
Lithium intoxication episodes – basic characteristics.

Episodes of intoxication were significantly more frequent in summer and autumn, with a p -value of ≤ 0.01 for the whole sample and a p -value of 0.025 for episodes not concerning intentional overdoses. There was no seasonal variation for episodes of unknown cause.

Symptoms of lithium intoxication

Symptoms of lithium intoxication were only recorded for a minority of patients. Most commonly, patients presented with altered level of consciousness (confusion, disorientation or somnolence). This was significantly more likely to occur in patients with severe intoxication (p < 0.05). Less likely to occur in an acute overdose setting were tremor (p < 0.05), vomiting and diarrhoea (p < 0.05) and ataxia or falls (p < 0.001) (see Table 2).

### Commentary on a recent review of lithium toxicity: what are its implications for clinical practice? [^114zqmBg]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

In all treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder (BD), lithium has been recommended as a first-line maintenance treatment. Some directives have gone further; recent evidence-based and consensus-based German guidelines firmly endorse lithium salts as the only first-line maintenance treatment in BD, and some investigators qualify lithium as the only proven mood stabilizer. However, the potential side-effects and risks of lithium treatment may at times make the implementation of these recommendations in daily practice challenging.

The adverse effects (AEs) and all practical aspects of lithium treatment are detailed in a comprehensive textbook published in 2006. In six chapters, the book summarizes the toxicological aspects of lithium treatment, and provides practical recommendations for the safe use of lithium salts in acute and long-term treatment. However, the recent paper by McKnight et al. a research group from Oxford. has provided the first formal meta-analysis of the more common AEs to lithium. This contribution is new, important, and welcome. However, as a guide for practice, such statistical analysis, because of the limitations outlined below, needs to be complemented by other relevant observations and individual patient-focused perspectives. Taking this into account it seems, as we explain later, that the findings from this meta-analysis somewhat underestimate the renal side-effects and distort to some degree or exclude other AEs.

### Lithium levels in tap water and psychotic experiences in a general population of adolescents [^117QnBin]. Schizophrenia Research (2018). Low credibility.

Recently, several epidemiologic studies have reported that lithium in drinking water may be associated with lower rates of suicide mortality, lower incidence of dementia, and lower levels of adolescents' depression and aggression at the population level. However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated lithium level in tap water in relation to psychotic experiences in a general population of adolescents. This is the first study to investigate this using a large dataset. Information on psychotic experiences, distress associated with these experiences, and depressive symptoms were collected in 24 public junior high schools in Kochi Prefecture in Japan. Samples were collected from sources that supplied drinking water to schools, and lithium levels were measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The association of lithium levels with psychotic experiences, considering distress as a degree of severity, was examined using an ordinal logistic regression model with schools and depressive symptoms as random effects. In total, 3040 students responded to the self-reporting questionnaire (response rate: 91.8%). Lithium levels in tap water were inversely associated with psychotic experiences (p = 0.021). We concluded that lithium level in tap water was inversely associated with psychotic experiences among a general population of adolescents and may have a preventive effect for such experiences and distress.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for lithium toxicity, more specifically with respect to laboratory monitoring of patients taking lithium, BAP 2016 guidelines recommend to obtain serum lithium level monitoring in patients with bipolar disorder taking lithium to check whether it is within the therapeutic range (0.6–0.8 mEq/L; mmol/L), aiming for a higher serum levels within that range. Recognize that concentrations of 0.8–1.0 mEq/L (0.8–1.0 mmol/L) carry a greater risk of renal impairment, especially in female patients.

### Translational evidence for lithium-induced brain plasticity and neuroprotection in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders [^112r1M25]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lithium (Li +) remains the "gold standard" pharmacological agent for treating and preventing relapses in both type I and type II bipolar disorders (BDs). It is also effective in preventing suicidal behavior during major depression. Despite its strong efficacy, during the past years, Li + was less and less administered due to toxicity and the need of monitoring serum concentrations to strictly maintain safe therapeutic doses. However, alternative methods to administer low but effective therapeutic Li + doses have been developed. Besides its efficacy in treating and preventing symptoms of psychiatric disorders, Li + produces neuroprotective effects on a wide range of neuronal populations that are involved in both behavioral and motor-related circuitries.

In fact, increasing evidence is under debate, indicating Li + efficacy in neurodegenerative disorders, pointing to common intracellular mechanisms, which occur within distinct neuronal populations. This is the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD), and Parkinson's disease (PD).

Knowledge of these mechanisms may shed light on the pathogenesis and neuropathology of different psychiatric and neurological disorders. The molecular mechanisms of action of Li + involve classic pharmacologic targets, such as cell surface receptors or modulation of neurotransmitters, second messenger systems, enzyme cascades, and transcriptional factors.

Here an overview is provided concerning the therapeutic/neuroprotective effects of Li + in different neuropsychiatric disorders to highlight common molecular mechanisms through which Li + produces its mood-stabilizing effects and to what extent this overlaps with neuroprotection in various brain circuitries. In fact, similar cell alterations depending on which circuits take place may fall either in the psychiatric and/or neurological domains.

WARNINGS

Lithium Toxicity

The toxic concentrations for lithium (≥ 1.5 mEq/L) are close to the therapeutic range (0.8 to 1.2 mEq/L). Some patients abnormally sensitive to lithium may exhibit toxic signs at serum concentrations that are considered within the therapeutic range (see BOXED WARNING and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Lithium may take up to 24 hours to distribute into brain tissue, so occurrence of acute toxicity symptoms may be delayed.

Neurological signs of lithium toxicity range from mild neurological adverse reactions such as fine tremor, lightheadedness, lack of coordination, and weakness; to moderate manifestations like giddiness, apathy, drowsiness, hyperreflexia, muscle twitching, ataxia, blurred vision, tinnitus, and slurred speech; and severe manifestations such as clonus, confusion, seizure, coma, and death. In rare cases, neurological sequelae may persist despite discontinuing lithium treatment and may be associated with cerebellar atrophy. Cardiac manifestations involve electrocardiographic changes, such as prolonged QT interval, ST and T-wave changes and myocarditis. Renal manifestations include urine concentrating defect, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and renal failure. Respiratory manifestations include dyspnea, aspiration pneumonia, and respiratory failure. Gastrointestinal manifestations include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bloating. No specific antidote for lithium poisoning is known (see OVERDOSAGE).

### Lithium: clinical considerations in internal medicine [^114hGEwj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Bipolar Disorders affect up to 5% of the population. While the pharmacological options for the treatment of bipolar disorder have expanded over the past several years, lithium remains an inexpensive and efficacious treatment for bipolar disorder. Lithium has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for acute mania, bipolar depression, the prophylactic treatment of bipolar disorder, and as an augmentation agent in the treatment of unipolar major depression. Lithium also is the only mood stabilizer that has been demonstrated to lower the suicide rate in patients with bipolar disorder. Use in special populations, side effects and toxicity, and drug interactions are discussed. Important laboratory monitoring guidelines are included in this review. Lithium remains an important intervention for the treatment of mood disorders.

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD / IGSLI task force on treatment with lithium [^117EzSEE]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

There is also some additional information from some of the above studies. Hullin 40 performed a further second year follow‐up of Jerram study of the combined group patients (n = 68) with BP or UP. In this second year 5/28 patients (17.8%) with lithium levels of 0.60‐1.00 mmol/L and 4/27 patients (14.8%) of those with levels between 0.40 and 0.59 had a recurrence. In contrast, in the group maintained on lithium levels between 0.25 and 0.39 mmol/L, 8/13 patients (61.5%) had a recurrence. Despite that no separate results were presented for the BP sample, this finding suggests that the cutoff for an effective lithium level may be around 0.40 mmol/L. In contrast however, a further subdivision of the 2 lithium groups in the Nolen study revealed that the Hazard ratio's (HR) vs placebo were not significant for lithium < 0.40 mmol/L (HR 0.66; 95% CI: 0.42‐1.03) and 0.40 to < 0.60 mmol/L (HR 1.05; CI: 0.67‐1.63) while they were significant for lithium 0.60 to < 0.80 (HR 0.35; CI: O.23‐0.52) and 0.80 to < 1.00 (HR 0.24; CI: 0.14‐0.42), but not for lithium 1.00‐1.20 (HR 0.50; CI: 0.21‐1.22). These findings suggest that the cutoff is more likely to be around 0.60 mmol/L than around 0.40 mmol/L. In general, while lithium levels < 0.60 mmol/L appear not as effective as levels > 0.60 mmol/L, there may be some patients for whom levels between 0.40 and 0.60 mmol/L are effective. Therefore, this may be an option for those who do not tolerate levels > 0.60 mmol/L as well as for patients with impaired renal function or with increased risk of intoxication, for example, in the elderly (see below). In addition, levels < 0.40 mmol/L do not seem to work at all. Therefore, there is no rationale for prescribing lithium at levels below 0.40 mmol/L.

### Lithium: old drug, new tricks? [^114X9Hbw]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Adjunct Therapies to Manage Side Effects

It is firstly relevant (see subsequent sections) that there is a dose association between lithium and its adverse effects. For most, frequency/severity increases notably above serum lithium 0.7/0.8mmol/L. For some (e.g. diarrhoea, tremor, weight gain) complaints are most frequent in early treatment stages and do not tend to worsen with longer term treatment. Others (see below) can decline with longer durations of lithium use.

In a large examination of reasons for lithium discontinuation, the most common was adverse effects and the most common adverse effects noted as reasons for discontinuing were diarrhoea (13%), tremor (11%), polyuria and/or polydipsia (9%), increases in creatinine (9%) and weight gain (7%). Of these, management strategies for common side effects align with those recommended in general (not specifically for lithium) e.g. taking medication alongside a meal for gastrointestinal effects, recommendations for managing weight gain. This section does not comprehensively cover these or many other adverse effects including in cardiovascular, CNS, dermatological and endocrinological domains, though assessment and management guidance is available and recommended for consultation.

Before focusing more on three particular areas of adverse effect (tremor, renal, thyroid), we briefly mention that patients should be informed about the importance of water and salt intake: due to lithium's effects on their metabolism, changes in intake can lead to medical complications in those at risk e.g. in people with a history of normal pressure hydrocephalus, this may increase the risks of raised intracranial blood pressure or a complication leading to lithium toxicity. While this risk primarily applies to those who are prone to circulatory difficulties (e.g. heart failure), it can also affect others exposed to dehydration or sunstroke.

### Lithium carbonate [^115eJHyt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

The toxic levels for lithium (≥ 1.5 mEq/L) are close to the therapeutic levels (0.6 to 1.2 mEq/L). It is therefore important that patients and their families be cautioned to watch for early toxic symptoms and to discontinue the drug and inform the physician should they occur. Toxic symptoms are listed in detail under ADVERSE REACTIONS.

Treatment

No specific antidote for lithium poisoning is known. Early symptoms of lithium toxicity can usually be treated by reduction or cessation of dosage of the drug and resumption of the treatment at a lower dose after 24 to 48 hours. In severe cases of lithium poisoning, the first and foremost goal of treatment consists of elimination of this ion from the patient. Treatment is essentially the same as that used in barbiturate poisoning: 1) gastric lavage, 2) correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and 3) regulation of kidney function. Urea, mannitol and aminophylline all produce significant increases in lithium excretion. Hemodialysis is an effective and rapid means of removing the ion from the severely toxic patient.

Infection prophylaxis, regular chest X-rays and preservation of adequate respiration are essential.

### Lithium in the kidney: friend and foe? [^115u8Ntm]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Trace amounts of lithium are essential for our physical and mental health, and administration of lithium has improved the quality of life of millions of patients with bipolar disorder for > 60 years. However, in a substantial number of patients with bipolar disorder, long-term lithium therapy comes at the cost of severe renal side effects, including nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and rarely, ESRD. Although the mechanisms underlying the lithium-induced renal pathologies are becoming clearer, several recent animal studies revealed that short-term administration of lower amounts of lithium prevents different forms of experimental AKI. In this review, we discuss the knowledge of the pathologic and therapeutic effects of lithium in the kidney. Furthermore, we discuss the underlying mechanisms of these seemingly paradoxical effects of lithium, in which fine-tuned regulation of glycogen synthase kinase type 3, a prime target for lithium, seems to be key. The new discoveries regarding the protective effect of lithium against AKI in rodents call for follow-up studies in humans and suggest that long-term therapy with low lithium concentrations could be beneficial in CKD.

Preliminary evidence suggests that the polarity of relapse/recurrence (depressive vs. hypomanic/manic/mixed) in bipolar patients on lithium might be related to serum lithium levels.

Polarity of episodes in 64 bipolar-I patients on lithium monotherapy during a prospective 18-month maintenance trial was predicted from (a) intra-individual oscillations of lithium levels over time and from (b) absolute lithium levels preceding relapse/recurrence.

Results

On an individual basis, depressive (vs. hypomanic/manic/mixed) episodes were mostly preceded by lithium levels above the individual means (p < 0.001). Relapse/recurrence occurring at lithium levels above the overall mean serum level of 0.66 mmol/l was depressive (not hypomanic/manic/mixed) in most cases (odds-ratio = 3.86, p = 0.032). Lithium levels before depressive episodes were numerically higher than before hypomanic/manic/mixed episodes (0.769 ± 0.242 vs. 0.675 ± 0.262 mmol/l, p = 0.13). Cox-regression including current lithium levels as time-dependent predictor essentially confirmed these results.

Limitations

As patients were not randomized to specific lithium levels, potential confounders could not be completely ruled out. Furthermore, a closer than monthly assessment of both lithium levels and psychopathology would have been desirable to better understand the interplay between lithium levels and new mood episodes.

Conclusions

The results indicate that within the currently accepted therapeutic range (0.4–1.1 mmol/l), the relative risk for depressive vs. hypomanic/manic/mixed relapses/recurrences may be associated with higher lithium levels. Therefore, lithium levels at the lower range of the therapeutic spectrum may be sufficient for the optimal prevention of depressive episodes whereas higher lithium levels within this range may be needed for optimal protection against manic/mixed episodes.

### Lithium and nephrotoxicity: a literature review of approaches to clinical management and risk stratification [^1139BZrf]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

There are several medications which can interfere both with serum lithium levels and renal function whose use needs to be closely monitored. Amongst these include the use of NSAIDs, ACE-Is, and thiazide diuretics. Loop and potassium-sparing diuretics are generally considered to cause less disruption to serum lithium levels. Lithium may also promote its own retention given its ability to induce polyuria and subsequent volume depletion, highlighting the importance of ensuring adequate hydration and enquiring about the symptoms of decreased renal concentrating ability in lithium treated patients. Moreover, given that the proximal tubule handles lithium in a similar fashion to that of sodium, conditions which promote sodium retention such as the hypervolemic states of cirrhosis or congestive cardiac failure promote an increase in the fraction of lithium which is reabsorbed leading to elevated lithium levels.

The timing of nephrology referral is a difficult question to answer. Whilst the 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines would suggest referral when a patient's eGFR is < 30 ml/min/1.73m 2 there is some evidence which suggests that this level of decreased eGFR in lithium treated patients may suggest irreversible renal damage, and individuals with lithium induced nephropathy are at risk for progression to ESKD despite discontinuation. The exact point at which renal function may continue to deteriorate despite cessation of lithium is not known with certainty, but appears to lie around a creatinine clearance of up to 40 ml/min or a creatinine level of < 220 mmol/L, substantially higher than the recommended threshold for referral for nephrology evaluation (Fig. 1).

### Lithium: old drug, new tricks? [^111wfZ5Q]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lithium is considered to have substantial benefits and harms, which constitutes a complex clinical challenge. This article aims to cover five putative strategies to maximise the benefits of lithium therapy while concurrently minimising its harms.

Recent Findings

The strategies range in terms of their evidence base. Some are supported by long-standing evidence, namely the management of some common and/or severe adverse effects. For others, we are seeing emerging research focus, particularly in the use of lithium in 'sub-therapeutic' doses. In considering gradual titration and variable dosing, as well as innovation to enhance the monitoring of lithium, there is limited evidence which is reviewed. We conclude that optimising lithium therapy is not straightforward and clearly individual patient characteristics must be thoroughly prioritised. However, a general rule for optimising can be to maintain lithium at its lowest therapeutic level for an individual patient, with close monitoring of levels and adverse effects as well as careful titration where clinically indicated.

### Management of lithium dosing around delivery: an observational study [^111Zy46d]. Bipolar Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this retrospective observational cohort study, we found no maternal lithium blood level fluctuations surrounding delivery. Maternal and neonatal lithium blood levels were strongly correlated. We observed no association between neonatal lithium blood levels at delivery and neonatal outcomes.

Several guidelines recommend, out of caution, lowering or discontinuing lithium prior to labor to avoid high plasma lithium levels. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Blood levels are assumed to rise due to a decrease in lithium clearance and contraction of fluid volume following delivery, possibly reaching toxic levels. These recommendations are primarily based on reviews and case studies rather than on observational data of the target population, as cohort studies are sparse due to methodological difficulties. Our data indicates that lithium plasma levels do not increase during labor after correcting for the prescribed lithium dose.

### Lithium intoxication: incidence, clinical course and renal function-a population-based retrospective cohort study [^1163fJWA]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

Strengths

All patients treated with lithium were registered in one single central laboratory database in our county. Together with national prescription data, this allowed the incidence of lithium intoxication to be estimated. The vast majority of patients consenting to access to their medical chart resulted in us being able to include 82% of patients. The electronic medical records for both primary and secondary care have been electronically available since 1997. Thus, we had a long period of observation, including all laboratory parameters and prescription data across services. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting systematically on renal function before, during and after lithium intoxication.

Limitations

This study had some limitations. We limited our review to episodes with lithium levels of at least 1.5 mmol/L to avoid a bias towards mild and borderline intoxication. Also, we wished to avoid false positive results. Lithium levels to screen for toxicity tend to be taken at any time after the last lithium ingestion, in contrast to therapeutic plasma levels, which are taken as trough levels. Lithium intoxication may have been more frequent than shown but clinically not recognised. In such cases, the lithium levels may not have been taken.

The study depended on the quality of the information recorded in the medical records. Hence, we may have underestimated the prevalence of symptoms, since these were not always comprehensively recorded. This, coupled with a relatively small sample size, yielded insufficient power to explore further potential contributing factors to the renal outcome. Our relatively small sample size also made the detection of rare events such as deaths and SILENT unlikely.

In this study, we did not follow up on renal function longer than the next measurement of creatinine after at least one month; whether lithium intoxication leads to increased vulnerability and higher risk of risk of long-term decline of renal function was not addressed.

### Lithium poisoning: is determination of the red blood cell lithium concentration useful? [^115o5V3F]. Clinical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite a narrow therapeutic index, lithium remains a cornerstone for the treatment of bipolar disease. As lithium poisoning may result in life-threatening neurotoxicity, measurement of the lithium concentration is mandatory in drug monitoring as well as for the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of lithium poisoning. However, toxic symptoms do not always correlate with plasma concentrations. Therefore, more reliable indicators have been proposed, including measurement of the red blood cell (RBC) lithium concentration and the RBC-to-plasma lithium ratio.

Plasma and Rbc Lithium Concentrations

Few studies have reviewed the relative utility of these measurements both in monitoring therapy and in poisoning, and they have involved only small numbers of subjects. Moreover, factors influencing plasma and RBC lithium concentrations are numerous, including gender, age, dosage, treatment duration, co-medications, and underlying diseases. In treated patients, investigated using in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy, there is a significant correlation between plasma and brain lithium concentrations in steady-state conditions. In contrast, lithium transport across erythrocytes markedly differs from its transport into the central nervous system, questioning the relevance of measuring the RBC lithium concentration. In poisoned patients, plasma and RBC lithium concentrations follow a parallel decline irrespective of the type of poisoning.

Conclusions

Based on present evidence, measurement of the RBC lithium concentration and the calculation of the RBC-to-plasma lithium ratio offer no important clinical advantage over the measurement of the plasma lithium concentration, which remains the most important variable to monitor in lithium-treated or lithium-poisoned patients.

### Double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of imipramine and paroxetine in the treatment of bipolar depression [^117KXCDK]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy and safety of paroxetine and imipramine with that of placebo in the treatment of bipolar depression in adult outpatients stabilized on a regimen of lithium.

Method

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 117 outpatients with DSM-III-R bipolar disorder, depressive phase, were randomly assigned to treatment with paroxetine (N = 35), imipramine (N = 39), or placebo (N = 43) for 10 weeks. In addition to lithium monotherapy, patients may have received either carbamazepine or valproate in combination with lithium for control of manic symptoms. Patients were stratified on the basis of trough serum lithium levels determined at the screening visit (high: > 0.8 meq/liter; low: ≤ 0.8 meq/liter). Primary efficacy was assessed by change from baseline in scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Clinical Global Impression illness severity scale.

Results

Differences in overall efficacy among the three groups were not statistically significant. For patients with high serum lithium levels, antidepressant response at endpoint also did not significantly differ from placebo. However, both paroxetine and imipramine were superior to placebo for patients with low serum lithium levels. Compared to imipramine, paroxetine resulted in a lower incidence of adverse events, most notably emergence of manic symptoms.

Conclusions

Antidepressants may not be useful adjunctive therapy for bipolar depressed patients with high serum lithium levels. However, antidepressant therapy may be beneficial for patients who cannot tolerate high serum lithium levels or who have symptoms that are refractory to the antidepressant effects of lithium.

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD / IGSLI task force on treatment with lithium [^117EY49w]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

4.7 Should recommendations for children and adolescents or for elderly patients be different from the recommendations for (younger) adults?

Two of the selected studies (Coppen, Vestergaard) did not provide information on whether they had included patients below 18 years or above 65 years and 2 other studies did not include patients below 18 years or above 65 years (Waters, Maj). The remaining 3 studies did only include patients above 18 years including elderly patients, but did not provide separate information on the outcome of the elderly patients. Thus, we can conclude that evidence on optimal lithium serum levels in children, adolescents and the elderly (see also Ref. 38) is lacking.

This is also reflected by outcome of the Delphi survey regarding the endorsement of the statements on optimal lithium serum levels in the various age groups of which only the statement on adults (18‐65 years) was endorsed by at least 80% (in consensus) of the Task Force members. However, for all age groups there was consensus that the minimum effective lithium level for all age groups should be 0.40 mmol/L, while in adults the standard therapeutic level should be between 0.60 and 0.80 mmol/L within a broader range of 0.40‐1.00 (Figure 2). For children (< 12 years) and adolescents (12‐17 years) there was no consensus, but the majority of the Task Force members endorsed the same recommendation as for adults (see also Figure 2). For the elderly there was also no consensus. However, the majority of the members endorsed the recommendation that the standard therapeutic level should be 0.40‐0.60 mmol/L, with the option to go to maximally 0.70 of 0.80 mmol/L in elderly 65‐79 years and to maximally 0.7 mmol/L in elderly 80 years and older (Figure 3), which is in line with the recommendations on the use of lithium in the elderly from the ISBD Task Force on Older Adults with Bipolar Disorder: that although "the balance between lithium toxicity and efficacy has not been studied in older patients and the recommendations are mainly based on clinical judgement and fear of drug‐related adverse events", 38 the upper limit should be lower than in younger adults. 45

### Lithium: old drug, new tricks? [^1115jik7]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Start Low and Go Slow

Reverting back to lithium's primary indication of mood stabilisation, it is clear that higher doses are more effective (but more harmful) and vice versa. However, we also are aware that for some individuals with affective illness, a low dose is clinically effective. We do not possess strong evidence regarding for whom that is the case. In this case, we might consider the potential value of a lithium initiation strategy that may yield clinical benefits without adverse effects for some: start low and go slow.

There are no large-scale, head-to-head clinical trials that directly compare the ' start low and go slow' titration strategy to the more traditional or standard titration techniques in a systematic, controlled manner.

We are aware however, of some centres that have implemented this. In a primary care led Collaborative Care Program in Oregon, some patients with affective disorders (usually presumed bipolar type II or bipolar spectrum) are initiated on 150 mg lithium and titrated in 150 mg increments every 4–7 days until either a clinical response or side effects are observed (in the latter case, the dose is then lowered by one step), usually up to a maximum 450–600 mg. In a naturalistic sample of lithium-treated patients from this clinic, the mean lithium serum level was 0.43mmol/L and 84% were taking ≤ 600 mg/day. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were reduced in lithium (and a group taking lamotrigine) compared to those undergoing other treatments; clinically important differences were reported at a rate of 49% (depression) and 44% (anxiety) after three months. Although these benefits do not appear striking, it has also been reported that the regimen has been highly acceptable and widely adopted within the aforementioned centre. Furthermore, it appears to substantially minimise side effect burdens.

### Lithium and nephrotoxicity: a literature review of approaches to clinical management and risk stratification [^112vi3Lg]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Monitoring, nephrology referral and cessation of lithium therapy

General guidelines for the monitoring of renal function for those maintained on long term lithium therapy suggest measurement of the serum creatinine and eGFR at the initiation of lithium therapy and subsequently at three to six month intervals thereafter, although it should be noted there is substantial heterogeneity between various guidelines. Patients who are noted to have a rise in creatinine on three or more occasions, even if their eGFR is > 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 require further evaluation, including a urinalysis for haematuria, proteinuria, a review of their medical history with particular attention paid to cardiovascular, urological and medication history, and blood pressure control and management. Overt proteinuria should be further quantified with a urine protein to creatinine ratio. All patients as part of general care for both their bipolar disorder and potential renal disease, need baseline monitoring of their weight and height in order to calculate a body mass index, attention to lipid profile including both low and high density lipoproteins and triglycerides, fasting glucose, other baseline blood tests including complete blood count and measurement of liver function, calcium and thyroid function. Lithium levels are recommended to be monitored every 3 to 6 months or as otherwise clinically indicated by major international guidelines. The recommended serum lithium levels for the maintenance of bipolar disorder are between 0.5 to 0.8 mmol/L, with higher levels of 0.8–1.2 mmol/L generally only recommended during the acute manic phase of the illness. Symptoms suggestive of the development of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, such as polyuria or polydipsia, require further evaluation with a paired urine and serum sodium and osmolality and measurement of a 24-h urine collection for both volume to allow quantification of the amount of urine generated as well as creatinine to assess completeness.

### Commentary on a recent review of lithium toxicity: what are its implications for clinical practice? [^1162AGd1]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

More informative observations from other investigators are needed. The International Group for The Study of Lithium-Treated Patients (IGSLI) has been concerned about these issues, and at present is stimulating and supporting studies in lithium centers from which data are available for important clinical variables, longitudinal courses, and renal examinations of regularly monitored patients. The findings should allow formulation of practical recommendations for the rational management of individual patients. When to discontinue lithium because of serious renal problems is a particularly vexing problem. This decision cannot be made solely by the treating nephrologist, but also requires expert psychiatric evaluation of the benefits and true risks that the individual patient can expect from his/her lithium medication in future years.

Purpose of Review

Lithium is considered to have substantial benefits and harms, which constitutes a complex clinical challenge. This article aims to cover five putative strategies to maximise the benefits of lithium therapy while concurrently minimising its harms.

The strategies range in terms of their evidence base. Some are supported by long-standing evidence, namely the management of some common and/or severe adverse effects.

Summary

We conclude that optimising lithium therapy is not straightforward and clearly individual patient characteristics must be thoroughly prioritised. However, a general rule for optimising can be to maintain lithium at its lowest therapeutic level for an individual patient, with close monitoring of levels and adverse effects as well as careful titration where clinically indicated.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^1176Lmg5]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD bipolar disorder guideline — lithium dosing, renal guidance, and serum level monitoring: For acute mania, the initial dose is 600–900 mg in 2–3 divided doses, then switch to once daily at bedtime. In geriatrics, refer to adult dosing and usually require lower doses because of age-related reduction in GFR. Renal guidance states no adjustment for CrCl ≥ 60 ml/min, initiate lower dose for CrCl 30– < 60 ml/min, and avoid for CrCl < 30 ml/min. Clinically, lithium is beneficial in preventing recurrence of manic and depressed episodes; use serum levels to guide dosing with an optimal maintenance dose of 0.6–0.8 mEq/L, avoid levels over 1.0 mEq/L if possible due to higher risk of eventual kidney harm, and obtain serum levels 11–14 hours after the last dose.

### Lithium: old drug, new tricks? [^115drqKK]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Tremor

Tremor is a common side effect that can occur even in the presence of low-level lithium. It is suggested that tremor is most common in the early stages of lithium treatment and becomes less prevalent in those treated for longer. Tremor varies widely in severity (as well as type). To emphasise its clinical importance, tremor can be an indicator for lithium toxicity, though it can also be triggered by concomitant agents or comorbidities. Assessment, including for parkinsonism, is important. In addition to addressing other factors (e.g. thyroid, other medication use, anxiety disorders, substance use, essential tremor etc.), beta-blockers, primidone or other anticonvulsants can be beneficial if required. In fact, lamotrigine, valproate, carbamazepine and quetiapine are examples of these which clearly have mood stabilising effects themselves. A general recommendation (see more below) is to adjust doses so that mood stabilising medications are at a minimal therapeutic level can be helpful and this may be especially important for antipsychotics where a therapeutic level in bipolar disorders is lower than for pure psychotic illness.

Renal

Best known and most severe of lithium's adverse effects relates to renal health. Renal function appears negatively associated with both dose and duration of lithium treatment and is less readily manageable than those above. In instances of creatinine increase or more relevantly, decreasing estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), guidelines are available though management options are limited. Guidelines include advice in terms of seeking nephrology input and in the absence of other strategies, the subject of down-titrating or discontinuing lithium has been widely discussed. Polyuria is common and may be mild or more severe in cases of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). It has long been advised to treat polyuria/NDI with amiloride, however the evidence remains extremely scant despite clearly positive findings and understood mechanisms of action.

### Delphi survey of maintenance lithium treatment in older adults with bipolar disorder: an ISBD task force report [^113TvSC3]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

With regard to lithium administration, the experts did not reach consensus on the value of twice compared to once daily dosing. The uncertainty in the literature on this point was reflected by the fact that some experts gave the same reason (less stress on the kidneys) for both options. The majority favored once daily dosing but this did not reach the consensus threshold.

Guidelines for safe monitoring of lithium levels and related laboratory and clinical testing suggest that older adults with bipolar disorder should be seen routinely at least every three to six months with specific laboratory tests and clinical assessments administered as described in the results: renal functioning every 3‐6 months, metabolic and endocrine testing every 6 months, and hematology yearly. Routine clinical assessment of gait and tremor should take place every 3‐6 months and routine cognitive testing should be done annually using the MMSE 34 or MoCA. 35 By seeing OABD every 3‐6 months, clinicians will be able to monitor the clinical course and detect significant clinical or medical concerns at an early stage. In centers where the availability of psychiatrists is limited, family physicians or allied health professionals can supplement the necessary frequency of clinical monitoring. Special attention must be given to the signs of lithium toxicity in order to avoid the "prescribing cascade" that mistakes lithium side effects and signs of toxicity for another disorder such as parkinsonism, dementia, or gastrointestinal disorder. As most side effects of lithium are dose dependent, these guidelines offer room to lower the dose and serum level without loss of effectiveness.

### Lithium carbonate (Lithobid) [^1179eKbQ]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The occurrence and severity of adverse reactions are generally directly related to serum lithium concentrations and to individual patient sensitivity to lithium. They generally occur more frequently and with greater severity at higher concentrations.

Adverse reactions may be encountered at serum lithium concentrations below 1.5 mEq/L. Mild to moderate adverse reactions may occur at concentrations from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L, and moderate to severe reactions may be seen at concentrations from 2.0 mEq/L and above.

Fine hand tremor, polyuria, and mild thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase and may persist throughout treatment. Transient and mild nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration.

These side effects usually subside with continued treatment or with a temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. If persistent, a cessation of lithium therapy may be required. Diarrhea, vomiting, drowsiness, muscular weakness, and lack of coordination may be early signs of lithium intoxication, and can occur at lithium concentrations below 2.0 mEq/L. At higher concentrations, giddiness, ataxia, blurred vision, tinnitus, and a large output of dilute urine may be seen. Serum lithium concentrations above 3.0 mEq/L may produce a complex clinical picture involving multiple organs and organ systems. Serum lithium concentrations should not be permitted to exceed 2.0 mEq/L during the acute treatment phase.

### The effects of lithium on cognition in humans: a systematic review [^116hCsME]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings contribute to the ongoing debate regarding lithium's neuroprotective versus neurotoxic effects. While evidence suggests that higher lithium levels may increase cognitive risks, maintaining lower therapeutic concentrations (0.4–0.6 mmol/L) can, in some cases, reduce these effects without compromising efficacy. However, defining an optimal lithium dose remains clinically challenging, as cognitive impairment may also result from other lithium-induced (and dose related) side effects, such as tremor, fatigue and polyuria, which can indirectly affect cognitive function. Additionally, older adults and individuals with pre-existing cognitive impairments are more vulnerable due to higher serum lithium levels per administered dose. Despite these concerns, our study did not identify a clear dose–outcome relationship, likely due to minimal dosage variation across participants and the reliance on averaged data rather than detailed dose-cognition analyses. Indeed, generally, doses were higher in psychiatric populations than neurocognitive illness populations, but a lack of difference between these may be related to the mood effects (and mood-cognition correlations) in those with affective disorders. This underscores the need for more precise research on lithium's dose-dependent cognitive effects to optimise its therapeutic use while minimising risks.

Strengths and limitations

Definitive trends regarding lithium's cognitive impact remain inconclusive based on the studies reviewed, although several determinants potentially influencing this outcome were identified. The findings within affective disorders are still debated, particularly in delineating lithium's raw cognitive efficacy from illness-related indicators, such as mood improvement. This complexity is further compounded by the existence of responder subgroups and cognitive reserve clusters within affective illness populations, particularly BD, which adds variability to the observed outcomes. We were limited by the heterogeneity of the included populations, which may have obscured potential lithium-related cognitive effects specific to certain groups. It is also important to note that there was only a limited number of studies in most populations, including those where lithium is most commonly used, such as individuals with BD, where there is a known cognitive aspect to the disorder.

OVERDOSAGE

The toxic levels for lithium are close to the therapeutic levels. It is therefore important that patients and their families be cautioned to watch for early toxic symptoms and to discontinue the drug and inform the physician should they occur. Toxic symptoms are listed in detail under ADVERSE REACTIONS.

Treatment

No specific antidote for lithium poisoning is known. Early symptoms of lithium toxicity can usually be treated by reduction or cessation of dosage of the drug and resumption of the treatment at a lower dose after 24 to 48 hours. In severe cases of lithium poisoning, the first and foremost goal of treatment consists of elimination of this ion from the organism.

Treatment is essentially the same as that used in barbiturate poisoning: 1) lavage, 2) correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and 3) regulation of kidney functioning. Urea, mannitol, and aminophylline all produce significant increases in lithium excretion. Hemodialysis is an effective and rapid means of removing the ion from the severely toxic patient. Infection prophylaxis, regular chest X-rays, and preservation of adequate respiration are essential.

### Atorvastatin lowers serum calcium levels in lithium-users: results from a randomized controlled trial [^111RcFiw]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Bipolar disorder (BD) affects over 800,000 Canadians at least once in their life. Lithium is considered the gold standard treatment for BD and treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD), with 30–40% of patients responding better to lithium than any other treatments. However, lithium's use has declined in the last three decades due to the risk of chronic kidney disease and other adverse effects, with only 8% of BD patients currently receiving this drug in America. There are complementary and alternative therapies that can be used in conjunction with medications for BD, but lithium remains as the gold standard.

One of lithium's important endocrine and metabolic adverse effects is hypercalcemia. Health Canada and the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a black-box warning for lithium highlighting the risk of hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism. They have advised monitoring calcium levels throughout treatment and if hypercalcemia occurs, lithium withdrawal may be necessary as there are limited treatment options. Approximately 2.0% of non-geriatric and 5.1% of geriatric lithium users have hypercalcemia and 23% of users have elevated PTH levels. Lithium can alter calcium concentrations by increasing reabsorption of calcium within the loop of Henle and may also interfere with feedback mechanisms in the parathyroid, therefore preventing the suppression of parathyroid hormone (PTH) when calcium levels are high. Hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism, can lead to acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, nervous system defects, and decreased skeletal health. To date, surgery is the recommended treatment for hyperparathyroidism for patients with parathyroid adenomas and hyperplasia with symptoms caused by hypercalcemia. The other unpalatable option to treat lithium-associated hypercalcemia is lithium discontinuation, which is associated with very high (> 33–50%) rates of mood disorder relapse.

### Lithium: old drug, new tricks? [^111EfCDM]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Use of Low-level Lithium

Our understanding of lithium's narrow therapeutic index originates from the seminal 1954 study by Schou et al. where doses were increased after the point of manic resolution until toxicity (diarrhoea, nausea, tremor) was observed. Doses were then lowered, observing reversed toxicity and maintained clinical benefit. Since then, studies have largely supported the use of lithium at 0.6–0.6.8mmol/L (usually for treating depression or bipolar maintenance), and 0.8–1.8.0mmol/L (usually for treating mania) and studies have overwhelmingly employed these 'therapeutic' levels. Regardless, adverse effects at these levels are not negligible and lower levels appear associated with far reduced adverse effects. We briefly summarise below clinical evidence focused on low level (< 0.6mmol/L) lithium. We acknowledge that this is not comprehensive, and note that we do not include here studies using low dose lithium without reporting serum levels. When discussing levels, note that these are lithium levels 12 h after the most recent dose.

Depression

This evidence is observational and taken largely from bipolar populations although there is small-scale support for low-level lithium adjunctively in unipolar depression and people prescribed lithium for depression are at risk of developing bipolar. Despite a lack of controlled trial evidence, efficacy studies generally aim for a minimum lithium concentration of 0.5–0.6 mmol/L.

Suicidality

One clinical study (n = 283) found no significant improvement in suicidality (or affective symptoms) with the use of adjunctive low-level lithium (mean 0.47mmol/L) in symptomatic bipolar patients compared to usual care. Of note, the sample had high rates of comorbidities, ongoing episodes from baseline and those randomised to lithium (as opposed to 'optimised usual care') may have had a more severe mania burden. Distinct from low dosing, is trace dose lithium (< 5 mg ionic lithium), which has its own body of ecological evidence suggesting its benefits on the effects of suicidality though clearly, the quality of evidence behind lithium's benefits on suicidality from such studies is limited.

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD / IGSLI task force on treatment with lithium [^113ukjCz]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

To systematically review the existing trials on optimal serum levels for lithium for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder and to develop clinical recommendations.

Methods

Systematic literature search. Discussion of major characteristics, limitations, methodological quality, and results of selected trials. Delphi survey consisting of clinical questions and corresponding statements. For statements endorsed by at least 80% of the members, consensus was considered as having been achieved.

Results

With strict inclusion criteria no studies could be selected, making it difficult to formulate evidence-based recommendations. After loosening the inclusion criteria 7 trials were selected addressing our aims at least to some extent. Four of these studies suggest better efficacy being associated with lithium serum levels in a range above a lower threshold around 0.45/0.60 and up to 0.80/1.00 mmol/L. These findings support the outcome of the Delphi survey.

Conclusions

For adults with bipolar disorder there was consensus that the standard lithium serum level should be 0.60–0.80 mmol/L with the option to reduce it to 0.40–0.60 mmol/L in case of good response but poor tolerance or to increase it to 0.80–1.00 mmol/L in case of insufficient response and good tolerance. For children and adolescents there was no consensus, but the majority of the members endorsed the same recommendation. For the elderly there was also no consensus, but the majority of the members endorsed a more conservative approach: usually 0.40–0.60 mmol/L, with the option to go to maximally 0.70 or 0.80 mmol/L at ages 65–79 years, and to maximally 0.70 mmol/L over age 80 years.

A proposition is that, prior to any dose reduction, and duration a period of euthymia, a patient can be trained to recognise early warning signs of an impending relapse. Some common early warning signs include an increase in severity and/or duration of any usual inter-episode symptoms, however many individuals will have specific personal warning signs (e.g. an increase in substance use, impulsive spending). If agreed by clinician and patient following early warning signs training, a gradual down titration could be implemented (e.g. over four weeks) to the reduced level. Subsequently, upon the emergence of warning signs or risk of relapse recognition, an agreed strategy can then be implemented. This agreed strategy could include increased lithium dose resulting in a blood level 0.6–0.8 or even above this, maintained until remission or a number of weeks sustained remission. It may be that for mania, this is combined with a low dose of an antimanic such as 2.5 mg olanzapine, or a sedative. Here, it is worth noting that although lithium is widely considered to work more slowly than other mood stabilisation treatments, but it is also evidenced to have rapid efficacy against both mania and depression.

To summarise, evidence could suggest that – for some individuals – lithium treatment could be maintained with clinical stability at a lower dose until a time where an increased dose is warranted (e.g. risk of episode, subsyndromal symptoms) at which point the dose is increased until needed, and then gradually reduced once more. If so, this could maintain lithium's overall mood stabilisation effect while increasing acceptability reducing adverse effects.

Box 3 summarises one real-world clinical case using variable lithium dosing with apparent benefits.

Study design

Volunteers

We measured participants' mood and behaviour in a cognitive task longitudinally five times a week over ten weeks. Brain activity during the same task was measured during an MRI scan. The data here were part of a larger study (Supplementary Method [1B]).

Patients with BD

This study was a randomised, 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. See Supplementary Method [1B] for full information. All participants underwent a two-week pre-randomization phase ('baseline') during which they completed the cognitive task and mood ratings daily at home. Due to logistic challenges, for some participants this phase lasted longer than two weeks. For the next phase (6 weeks), participants were pseudo-randomly assigned to receive either lithium (starting dose of 400 mg and then titrated to plasma levels of 0.6–1 mmol/L) or placebo in a double-blind design. Only 22 participants were fMRI compatible. Participants were invited to complete online weekly assessments of depression symptoms with the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS,) and symptoms of Mania with the Altman Self Rating Mania Scale.

Throughout, we performed two types of group comparisons. First, we compared across risk of BD (i.e.g.roup as ordered factor in regressions, Low MDQ ≤ High MDQ ≤ patients with BD), subsequently referred to as 'bipolar disorder gradient'. Ordered factors in regression imply a relationship of order between the groups, this does not have to be a linear relationship (i.e. the difference low MDQ to high MDQ can be larger or smaller [but of same sign] than the difference high MDQ to patients with BD). MDQ was not measured in the patient group. As this involved data from the BD group before assignment to lithium or placebo, all participants were included. Significant results were post-hoc followed up comparisons of the individual groups (t-tests). Second, we tested for the effects of lithium treatment as drug (lithium/placebo) x time point (pre, i.e. baseline/post) interactions.
