## Question

Outpatient Alcohol withdrawal management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about outpatient alcohol withdrawal management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the clinical question and extract PICO elements. Then, I should appraise the evidence hierarchy and identify the highest-quality guidelines. Next, I will synthesize recommendations by severity, pharmacotherapy, and monitoring. After that, I need to check special populations and safety thresholds. Finally, I will translate this into a practical algorithm and highlight uncertainties and implementation details, making sure I verify each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical question and PICO. Population: adults with alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) being considered for outpatient care. Intervention: outpatient withdrawal management. Comparison: inpatient or residential care. Outcomes: safety, symptom control, prevention of seizures/delirium, completion, and linkage to AUD treatment. I should also consider prognostic factors like CIWA-Ar severity, prior complicated withdrawal, and social support that influence level-of-care decisions [^91157f5e] [^67f4e0b4].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy and identify the most authoritative sources. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check which guidelines carry the strongest consensus and methodology. ASAM 2020 is a high-credibility, multidisciplinary guideline using the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method and extensive literature review, and it explicitly addresses ambulatory care pathways and risk stratification, so it will anchor my recommendations [^91157f5e] [^09c333e5]. AAFP 2021 provides a concise, primary care–focused synthesis and aligns with ASAM on outpatient candidacy and pharmacotherapy choices, which I should cross-reference to ensure consistency [^57146a36]. The Italian Society on Alcohol (SIA 2019) offers complementary thresholds and outpatient protocols, particularly around CIWA-Ar triggers and monitoring, which I will integrate judiciously [^cbd01f5c] [^cdf7fb02].

> I will now examine level-of-care determination and outpatient candidacy. ASAM recommends that most AWS can be managed ambulatorily when risk is limited or mitigated, with approximately 10% requiring inpatient care; decisions should integrate current signs/symptoms, risk for severe/complicated withdrawal, recovery capital, and environment, using the ASAM Criteria Risk Matrix rather than CIWA-Ar alone [^91157f5e] [^67f4e0b4]. Wait, let me verify the CIWA-Ar thresholds: mild is generally < 10, moderate 10–18, and severe ≥ 19; severe uncomplicated withdrawal may be managed in Level 2-WM with experienced clinicians, whereas Level 1-WM is inappropriate for severe withdrawal or recent complicated withdrawal within 1 year [^9112dc0f] [^702a2716]. I should confirm that outpatient care is still appropriate for moderate AWS without contraindications, which both ASAM and SIA support, while emphasizing that severe or complicated cases belong in higher-acuity settings [^91157f5e] [^c6aec7ce].

> Now, I need to synthesize pharmacotherapy by severity, and I should double-check first-line choices. For moderate AWS (CIWA-Ar 10–18), benzodiazepines are first-line; carbamazepine or gabapentin are acceptable alternatives, and phenobarbital can be considered in Level 2-WM by experienced clinicians if benzodiazepines are contraindicated or as an adjunct in closely monitored settings [^6e3a4f06] [^6e3a4f06]. For mild AWS (CIWA-Ar < 10) at minimal risk, supportive care alone is reasonable; if medication is used, carbamazepine or gabapentin are preferred due to lower misuse potential, though benzodiazepines can be used selectively if risk of worsening withdrawal exists and monitoring is reliable [^d8995f27] [^48057c49]. For severe but uncomplicated withdrawal (CIWA-Ar ≥ 19), outpatient management is not appropriate in Level 1-WM; Level 2-WM may be considered with experienced clinicians and preventative pharmacotherapy, typically benzodiazepines, with phenobarbital as an alternative in expert hands [^a336f8e0] [^85220072]. Hold on, I should verify that front-loading strategies are reserved for high-risk patients and supervised settings; yes, ASAM supports front-loading in high-risk cases and supervised symptom-triggered dosing when feasible [^5f2c9a4a] [^3c8690c9].

> I need to ensure I address medication selection nuances and contraindications. Benzodiazepines remain first-line because they reduce withdrawal severity and prevent seizures and delirium; however, in patients with current or past benzodiazepine use disorder, I should minimize quantities dispensed, consider supervised dosing, and prefer alternatives like carbamazepine or gabapentin when appropriate [^9951192a] [^116835f1]. Let me reconsider hepatic impairment: if significant liver disease is suspected, I should prefer benzodiazepines with less hepatic metabolism (e.g., lorazepam) or use non-benzodiazepine options, and I should avoid phenobarbital given its narrow therapeutic window unless an expert is managing it in a monitored setting [^5c0f707d] [^17bc6733]. I should confirm that gabapentin has supportive evidence in outpatient AUD populations with withdrawal features; a randomized trial showed improved abstinence and fewer heavy drinking days in those with higher baseline withdrawal symptoms, supporting its role in selected outpatients [^a6c469a8].

> Next, I should review monitoring protocols and safety nets. ASAM recommends daily evaluations for up to 5 days after cessation or reduction, with reassessment of vitals, hydration, orientation, sleep, mood, suicidality, and substance use; breath alcohol testing can detect recent use and guide risk [^86be09cf] [^13d93ead]. Wait, I initially thought CIWA-Ar must be used daily in all outpatients; hold on, I should verify that validated scales should be used, but CIWA-Ar requires training and may be impractical in Level 1-WM, so SAWS or other self-administered tools can be reasonable alternatives when patients or caregivers can reliably use them [^6197ca1f] [^adb40167]. I need to ensure escalation triggers are explicit: persistent vomiting, marked agitation, hallucinations, confusion, seizure, oversedation, unstable vitals, or return to alcohol use warrant transfer to a more intensive level of care, and this should be communicated clearly to patients and caregivers [^a2e53317].

> I should confirm special populations and exceptions. Pregnancy warrants strong consideration of inpatient management given fetal risks and the potential for rapid deterioration; if managed outpatient, it should be in Level 2-WM with close coordination with obstetrics and enhanced monitoring [^0ad1b1c7] [^c1788476]. Patients with active suicide risk should be managed in a psychiatric inpatient setting that can provide withdrawal management, not in ambulatory care [^9112dc0f]. Cognitive impairment is not an absolute exclusion, but moderate impairment precludes Level 1-WM and severe impairment requires inpatient care; inability to tolerate oral medications also precludes ambulatory management [^9ac5b7cd] [^4f7481bc]. I should double-check that recent complicated withdrawal (seizures or delirium within 1 year) is incompatible with Level 1-WM, which ASAM explicitly states, guiding toward Level 2-WM or inpatient care depending on current risk and supports [^702a2716].

> Let me translate this into a practical outpatient algorithm, and I will sanity-check each branch. If CIWA-Ar is < 10 and risk is minimal, supportive care with education and daily check-ins is appropriate; if medication is desired or risk of worsening exists, use carbamazepine or gabapentin, reserving benzodiazepines for select cases with reliable monitoring and careful dispensing [^d8995f27] [^48057c49]. If CIWA-Ar is 10–18, initiate pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as first-line, consider carbamazepine or gabapentin as alternatives, and ensure daily in-person or video visits for up to 5 days with clear return precautions; if benzodiazepines are contraindicated, pivot to carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital in Level 2-WM with expert oversight [^6e3a4f06] [^a81fa44a]. If CIWA-Ar is ≥ 19, do not attempt Level 1-WM; refer to Level 2-WM if available with experienced clinicians, otherwise to ED or inpatient care for stabilization and preventative therapy, given seizure and delirium risk [^a336f8e0] [^85220072]. Throughout, I should confirm that concurrent AUD treatment is offered when feasible, including naltrexone, acamprosate, or gabapentin for relapse prevention, and that recovery supports are engaged [^ab628fe6] [^a6c469a8].

> But wait, what about dosing strategies and take-home benzodiazepines in Level 1-WM? I should verify that symptom-triggered regimens can be adapted for reliable patients or caregivers using SAWS, while fixed-dose tapers are reasonable when monitoring is limited; in all cases, dispense the smallest practical quantity and reassess within 24 hours to adjust dose and mitigate misuse risk [^adb40167] [^116835f1]. I need to ensure thiamine is not overlooked; yes, thiamine should be provided to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy in patients with AWS, even in the outpatient setting [^98a45842].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence and acknowledge uncertainties. While ASAM represents a high-quality consensus process, there are no RCTs directly comparing outpatient versus inpatient management across matched risk strata, so level-of-care decisions remain largely evidence-informed rather than RCT-proven; this is why careful risk stratification, monitoring, and shared decision-making are essential [^2b6bbce2]. Telemedicine-delivered symptom-triggered care is promising for expanding access, but I should note it remains investigational and should be implemented with protocols and safeguards pending broader validation [^73a88d4b].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and communication are explicit. I should record CIWA-Ar or SAWS scores, risk factors, medication plan with quantities and supervision, monitoring schedule, and clear return precautions; I should also counsel on a low-stimulation environment, hydration, and signs of deterioration, and I should coordinate with addiction specialists or higher levels of care if risk escalates at any point [^13d93ead] [^da8478da]. Hold on, I should verify that patients with unreliable supports or unsafe environments are steered toward Level 2-WM rather than Level 1-WM, which ASAM supports to mitigate risk while preserving ambulatory care when appropriate [^91157f5e] [^da8d1991].

Outpatient alcohol withdrawal management is appropriate for **mild-to-moderate cases** [^57146a36] with reliable patients, stable comorbidities, and strong social support [^91157f5e]. Benzodiazepines are **first-line** [^9951192a] for moderate symptoms (CIWA-Ar 10–18) [^6e3a4f06]; carbamazepine or gabapentin are alternatives or adjuncts, especially when benzodiazepine risk is high [^e64a5869] [^a6c469a8]. Daily monitoring for up to 5 days [^86be09cf] with validated scales (CIWA-Ar or SAWS) [^6197ca1f] is essential, and patients should have clear return precautions [^a2e53317]. Severe withdrawal (CIWA-Ar ≥ 19), prior seizures or delirium tremens, active suicidality, or unstable comorbidities require inpatient care [^a336f8e0] [^2b6bbce2]. Concurrent initiation of alcohol use disorder treatment [^ab628fe6] and thiamine supplementation [^98a45842] are recommended to reduce relapse and complications.

---

## Indications for outpatient management

Outpatient management is appropriate for patients with **mild-to-moderate AWS** who meet the following criteria:

- **Severity**: CIWA-Ar score < 19 (mild: < 10; moderate: 10–18) [^a336f8e0] [^57146a36].
- **History**: No prior severe or complicated withdrawal (e.g. seizures, delirium tremens) [^702a2716].
- **Comorbidities**: Stable medical and psychiatric conditions [^f530027a].
- **Support**: Reliable, committed patient with strong social support and safe environment [^91157f5e] [^da8d1991].
- **Access**: Ability to attend daily follow-up for 3–5 days [^86be09cf].

---

## Contraindications to outpatient management

Outpatient management is **not appropriate** for patients with any of the following:

- **Severe withdrawal**: CIWA-Ar ≥ 19 or signs of delirium tremens [^a336f8e0].
- **Complicated withdrawal**: History of seizures or delirium tremens [^702a2716].
- **Unstable comorbidities**: Significant medical or psychiatric instability [^f530027a].
- **Lack of support**: Unreliable patient, poor social support, or unsafe environment [^29f75e10].
- **Pregnancy**: Generally requires inpatient management due to fetal risk [^0ad1b1c7].

---

## Pharmacological management

### First-line medications

Benzodiazepines are **first-line** [^9951192a] for moderate AWS (CIWA-Ar 10–18) because they effectively reduce withdrawal severity and prevent seizures and delirium tremens [^6e3a4f06]. Commonly used agents include chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, lorazepam, and oxazepam; lorazepam or oxazepam are preferred in patients with liver disease or older adults due to safer pharmacokinetics [^5c0f707d].

---

### Alternative medications

Carbamazepine and gabapentin are **appropriate alternatives** [^e64a5869] for mild-to-moderate AWS, particularly when benzodiazepines are contraindicated or misuse is a concern [^f2a09d16]. Gabapentin may also reduce heavy drinking and improve withdrawal symptoms in patients with AUD [^a6c469a8] [^46c7b0d4].

---

### Medications to avoid

- **Barbiturates**: Phenobarbital is not recommended for outpatient use due to narrow therapeutic index and risk of respiratory depression [^17bc6733].
- **Antipsychotics**: Haloperidol and other antipsychotics are not recommended due to risk of lowering seizure threshold [^notfound].
- **Alcohol**: Oral or intravenous alcohol should not be used for withdrawal management [^51196739].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Daily monitoring**: Patients should be evaluated daily for up to 5 days after cessation or reduction of alcohol use [^86be09cf].
- **Validated scales**: Use CIWA-Ar or SAWS to assess withdrawal severity and guide treatment [^6197ca1f].
- **Vital signs**: Monitor blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and hydration status at each visit [^13d93ead].
- **Patient education**: Educate patients and caregivers about warning signs of severe withdrawal and when to seek immediate medical attention [^da8478da].

---

## Safety considerations and red flags

Patients and caregivers should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if any of the following occur:

- **Seizures**: New-onset seizures or status epilepticus [^a2e53317].
- **Delirium**: Confusion, disorientation, or hallucinations [^a2e53317].
- **Severe symptoms**: Persistent vomiting, marked agitation, or severe tremor despite medication [^a2e53317].
- **Unstable vitals**: Significant hypertension, tachycardia, or hypotension [^a2e53317].
- **Return to alcohol use**: Relapse during withdrawal management [^a2e53317].

---

## Adjunctive supportive care

Supportive care is **essential** and includes:

- **Hydration**: Encourage fluid intake; provide IV fluids if dehydrated [^672daf39].
- **Nutrition**: Thiamine supplementation to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy [^98a45842].
- **Environment**: Quiet, low-stimulation environment with supportive caregivers [^da8478da].
- **Sleep**: Address insomnia with non-pharmacological measures and consider short-term melatonin if needed.

---

## Integration with long-term treatment

Concurrent initiation of **AUD treatment** — including pharmacotherapy (naltrexone, acamprosate, or gabapentin) and behavioral therapy — is recommended to reduce relapse risk [^ab628fe6] [^a6c469a8]. Referral to mutual support groups (e.g. Alcoholics Anonymous) and linkage to ongoing care are critical components of successful recovery [^ab628fe6].

---

## Summary of outpatient management protocol

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Assess severity (CIWA-Ar), history, comorbidities, and support |
| 2 | Determine appropriateness for outpatient care |
| 3 | Initiate pharmacotherapy (benzodiazepines or carbamazepine/gabapentin) |
| 4 | Provide supportive care and thiamine |
| 5 | Monitor daily for 3–5 days |
| 6 | Educate patient and caregivers |
| 7 | Initiate AUD treatment and arrange follow-up |

---

Outpatient alcohol withdrawal management is effective and safe for carefully selected patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, stable comorbidities, and strong social support. Benzodiazepines remain **first-line** for moderate symptoms, with carbamazepine or gabapentin as alternatives. Daily monitoring, patient education, and integration with long-term AUD treatment are essential for successful outcomes.

### Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: outpatient management [^57146a36]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Approximately one-half of patients with alcohol use disorder who abruptly stop or reduce their alcohol use will develop signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The syndrome is due to overactivity of the central and autonomic nervous systems, leading to tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, anxiety, and agitation. If untreated or inadequately treated, withdrawal can progress to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, delirium tremens, and death. The three-question Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption and the Single Alcohol Screening Question instrument have the best accuracy for assessing unhealthy alcohol use in adults 18 years and older. Two commonly used tools to assess withdrawal symptoms are the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale, Revised, and the Short Alcohol Withdrawal Scale. Patients with mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms without additional risk factors for developing severe or complicated withdrawal should be treated as outpatients when possible. Ambulatory withdrawal treatment should include supportive care and pharmacotherapy as appropriate. Mild symptoms can be treated with carbamazepine or gabapentin. Benzodiazepines are first-line therapy for moderate to severe symptoms, with carbamazepine and gabapentin as potential adjunctive or alternative therapies. Physicians should monitor outpatients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome daily for up to five days after their last drink to verify symptom improvement and to evaluate the need for additional treatment. Primary care physicians should offer to initiate long-term treatment for alcohol use disorder, including pharmacotherapy, in addition to withdrawal management.

The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Clinical Practice Guideline on Alcohol Withdrawal Management provides guidance on the identification and management of alcohol withdrawal in adults with varying degrees of syndrome severity. The guideline addresses both ambulatory and inpatient care and considers special patient populations. The Guideline was primarily developed following the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method (RAM), a process to determine the appropriateness of a set of clinical procedures. This process included a review of gray and empirical literature published between January 2012 and October 2017. Nineteen existing guidelines, 112 reviews, and 150 research studies were used to develop draft guideline statements that were assessed by a panel of physicians experienced in withdrawal management and representing a diverse range of settings and patient populations. Recommendations were included in the Guideline where consensus on appropriate clinical practice was identified by the panel. Areas where additional research would provide valuable information for determining best practices were highlighted.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^91157f5e]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — level of care determination (general approach): Level of care determination should be based on current signs and symptoms, risk for severe or complicated withdrawal or complications, and other dimensions such as recovery capital and environment; alcohol withdrawal can typically be safely managed in an ambulatory setting for patients with limited or mitigated risk factors, while patients with low psychosocial support or an unsafe environment may benefit from a more intensive level of care. Patients with active risk of suicide should be treated in a setting equipped to manage patients at risk of suicide, which often necessitates admission to an inpatient psychiatric setting that also provides withdrawal management services. In the absence of indications for inpatient treatment, most patients with alcohol withdrawal can be safely and effectively managed in ambulatory settings, and approximately 10% of patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome require inpatient treatment; ambulatory withdrawal management should be preferred in the absence of any indications for inpatient treatment. One randomized controlled trial found that patients with mild-to-moderate alcohol withdrawal assigned to outpatient treatment had faster resolution of withdrawal compared to inpatient treatment. Although inpatient management is indicated for some patients, ambulatory treatment is most appropriate for those with a low risk of developing severe or complicated withdrawal, which may include mild or moderate withdrawal symptoms; some low-risk patients may benefit from inpatient care, for example when there is an absence of or unreliable support network.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^29f75e10]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Ambulatory alcohol withdrawal — risk of harm and concurrent substance use are addressed: Patients being treated in ambulatory settings have greater access to and are at greater risk for using alcohol and other drugs during alcohol withdrawal management compared to patients in an inpatient withdrawal treatment setting, and where alcohol is combined with medications such as benzodiazepines it can be particularly dangerous to patients. Ambulatory withdrawal management is not appropriate for uncooperative or unwilling patients or patients who are at imminent risk of harm. Patients with an uncertain level of cooperation or reliability, with a low level of commitment to the withdrawal process, or who are at significant risk of imminent return to alcohol use should not be managed in Level 1-WM settings. Such patients are not excluded from management in Level 2-WM settings, but their risk should be carefully considered, and Level 2-WM settings can provide a structured, monitored environment for such patients.

### Outpatient management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^84eb7371]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Approximately 2% to 9% of patients seen in a family physician's office have alcohol dependence. These patients are at risk of developing alcohol withdrawal syndrome if they abruptly abstain from alcohol use. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome begins six to 24 hours after the last intake of alcohol, and the signs and symptoms include tremors, agitation, nausea, sweating, vomiting, hallucinations, insomnia, tachycardia, hypertension, delirium, and seizures. Treatment aims to minimize symptoms, prevent complications, and facilitate continued abstinence from alcohol. Patients with mild or moderate alcohol withdrawal syndrome can be treated as outpatients, which minimizes expense and allows for less interruption of work and family life. Patients with severe symptoms or who are at high risk of complications should receive inpatient treatment. In addition to supportive therapy, benzodiazepines, either in a fixed-dose or symptom-triggered schedule, are recommended. Medication should be given at the onset of symptoms and continued until symptoms subside. Other medications, including carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, valproic acid, and gabapentin, have less abuse potential but do not prevent seizures. Typically, physicians should see these patients daily until symptoms subside. Although effective treatment is an initial step in recovery, long-term success depends on facilitating the patient's entry into ongoing treatment.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^09c333e5]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management guideline — methods for evidence review and statement rating describe that two independent reviewers screened article abstracts and full texts, with comparative trials, systematic reviews, and qualitative articles evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, AMSTAR-2, and the AACODS Checklist for Grey Literature; draft statements were developed and a list of definitions for terms used in the statements was also developed. Panel ratings followed RAM with multiple rounds and a face-to-face meeting, and members rated each statement on a 1–9 scale using the literature review and clinical judgment; ratings were aggregated and analyzed by IRETA staff, and a two-day in-person Guideline Committee meeting took place in the D.C. area. Classification rules specified that a statement is deemed appropriate if the median rating is in the 7–9 range and no more than one-third of the experts rate outside that range; a statement is deemed inappropriate if the median rating is in the 1–3 range and no more than one-third of the committee rate outside this range; all other statements (those with a median rating of 4–6 or with at least one-third of the experts rating outside the median range) are labeled uncertain. After the meeting, one Guideline Committee member dropped out of participating and the Interpercentile Range Adjusted for Symmetry (IPRAS) method was used for the remainder of the project; the project expanded to ambulatory settings with an additional two Clinical Champions recruited, two rounds of ratings, a second meeting held remotely via webinar, and the project expansion started in August 2018 and returned to the original (although modified) timeline by May 2019. Within this framework, appropriateness refers to procedures where the health benefits sufficiently outweigh potential harms such that the procedure is worth doing.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^32de632e]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal levels of care — definitions and placement — enumerate five levels for withdrawal management and map them to ambulatory versus inpatient settings. The levels are: Level 1-WM: Ambulatory withdrawal management without extended on-site monitoring; Level 2-WM: Ambulatory withdrawal management with extended on-site monitoring; Level 3.2-WM: Clinically managed residential withdrawal management; Level 3.7-WM: Medically monitored inpatient withdrawal management; and Level 4-WM: Medically managed intensive inpatient withdrawal management. Ambulatory care includes Level 1-WM and Level 2-WM, whereas inpatient care includes Level 3.2-WM, Level 3.7-WM, and Level 4-WM. More intensive levels of care are appropriate for patients at increased risk of harm; if Level 2-WM is not appropriate, then Level 1-WM is also not appropriate and this patient should then receive care in an inpatient setting. It should be noted that a patient's refusal or inability to attend a recommended level of care should not delay or preclude treatment at a level of care they are able to attend.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^f530027a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Emergency departments — alcohol withdrawal management recommendations: If patients are experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal (e.g. CIWA–Ar ≥ 19) or are at risk of complicated withdrawal, administer medication immediately to treat withdrawal and reduce the risk of seizures and delirium. Patients presenting with alcohol withdrawal syndrome in the Emergency Department should be evaluated for delirium as well as other conditions that mimic and/or accompany withdrawal, and patients presenting with delirium should be assessed for all potential etiologies including alcohol withdrawal. Patients in the Emergency Department should receive a complete blood count and complete metabolic panel including liver enzyme and magnesium tests; alcohol withdrawal treatment should not be delayed while waiting for results. For discharge to an ambulatory alcohol withdrawal management setting from the Emergency Department, indicators that should be present include mild alcohol withdrawal (e.g. CIWA–Ar score < 10) or moderate alcohol withdrawal (e.g. CIWA–Ar score 10–18) with no other complicating factors, not currently intoxicated (includes alcohol or other drugs), no history of complicated alcohol withdrawal (seizures, delirium), no significant medical or psychiatric comorbidities that would complicate withdrawal management, and ability to comply with ambulatory visits and therapy. Patients with controlled withdrawal syndrome being discharged from the Emergency Department may be offered a short-term (e.g., 1–2 day) prescription for appropriate alcohol withdrawal medication to last until follow-up with their healthcare provider.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^8edb29a5]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal special terms defines key concepts used in the guideline. Alcohol hallucinosis/alcohol-induced psychosis is described as a form of alcohol withdrawal that is distinct from delirium and other clinically prominent withdrawal syndromes and symptoms, characterized primarily by auditory hallucinations, paranoid symptoms and fear, with hallucinations that are generally third person and often derogatory and that may include secondary delusions or perseveration; it is unclear whether alcohol hallucinosis is part of alcohol withdrawal or a complication of chronic alcohol use unrelated to withdrawal, and currently it is diagnosed as alcohol-induced psychotic disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 (DSM-5). Ambulatory withdrawal management is defined as withdrawal management that occurs in outpatient settings, including primary care and intensive outpatient/day hospital settings, with level of clinical expertise and frequency of monitoring varying widely within ambulatory withdrawal management settings. The terms delirium and seizure in this document refer to alcohol withdrawal-related seizure or alcohol withdrawal delirium, and alcohol withdrawal delirium has replaced the formerly used "delirium tremens". The document also describes dosing regimens used in alcohol withdrawal management and focuses on regimen types, including symptom-triggered dosing, which is described as an approach whereby patients are monitored through the use of a structured assessment scale.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^5f2c9a4a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — pharmacotherapy prophylaxis (Recommendations IV.13 and IV.14) notes that patients at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or concomitant alcohol withdrawal may be treated in ambulatory settings at the discretion of providers with extensive experience in management of alcohol withdrawal, and such patients should be provided with preventative pharmacotherapy. Benzodiazepines are first-line treatment because of their well-documented effectiveness in reducing the signs and symptoms of withdrawal including the incidence of seizure and delirium. Phenobarbital is an appropriate alternative in Level 2-WM settings for providers experienced with its use; for patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use, phenobarbital (in Level 2-WM settings by providers experienced with its use) or transfer to a more intensive level of care are appropriate options. A front loading regimen is recommended for patients at high risk of severe withdrawal syndrome. Providing at least a single dose of preventative medication is appropriate for patients at lower levels of risk who have: a history of severe or complicated withdrawal; an acute medical, psychiatric, or surgical illness; severe coronary artery disease; displaying signs or symptoms of withdrawal concurrent with a positive blood alcohol content.

ASAM CPG — recent high alcohol consumption and ambulatory eligibility: Recent high levels of alcohol consumption has been cited as a consideration for level of care determination; the NICE guideline suggested that inpatient management be considered for patients who consume more than 30 U.K. standard units of alcohol per day, which is equivalent to 17 U.S. standard drinks per day, and inpatient treatment was recommended for patients consuming over 7 U.S. standard drinks per day. The Guideline Committee considers a cutoff of 8 U.S. standard drinks per day, yet consumption of more than 8 U.S. standard drinks per day is not an exclusionary factor for either ambulatory withdrawal management setting.

### The management of substance use disorders: synopsis of the 2021 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^2b6bbce2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — monitoring, setting, and risk stratification emphasizes that severe alcohol withdrawal can be a life-threatening condition, with dangerous manifestations including alcohol withdrawal delirium and withdrawal seizures that can progress to status epilepticus, and that prior episodes of delirium or withdrawal seizures are robust predictors of alcohol withdrawal delirium; approximately 1–4% of hospitalized patients who have withdrawal delirium die. Because there has not been a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test whether individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) who have a history of alcohol withdrawal delirium or seizures would fare as well in outpatient management as in inpatient management, determinations about adequate monitoring and the setting must be a clinical decision, and most experienced providers would elect to manage a patient with a history of delirium tremens or withdrawal seizures undergoing a new episode of alcohol withdrawal in an inpatient setting with continuous monitoring. There are relatively few harms associated with inpatient withdrawal management compared to outpatient management, though there may be a higher likelihood of nosocomial infection in an inpatient setting and a cost burden; for patients not at high risk of life-threatening complications, medically supervised outpatient withdrawal is reasonable and for Service Members seeking voluntary care it may be highly preferable, while many providers would not feel comfortable managing high-risk withdrawal in the outpatient setting and inpatient management requires far more expenditures of resources than outpatient management.

For mild withdrawal, "If withdrawal is mild (e.g. CIWA-Ar < 10), patients presenting to primary care can be prescribed a few doses of benzodiazepine", and "Whenever possible, medication dispensing can be supervised by a caregiver at home or staff at a nonmedical withdrawal management center", with the caution, "Do not prescribe medication to patients for ambulatory management of alcohol withdrawal without performing an adequate assessment". Additionally, "If withdrawal does not resolve (e.g., fall below a CIWA-Ar score of 10) after an adequate dose of medication (e.g., 80 mg diazepam), or patients appear to be sedated, transfer to an Emergency Department or other inpatient withdrawal management setting". The page also lists "Recommendation VII.4: For patients treated in primary care settings, regular follow-up visits, at least monthly".

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^adb40167]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — dosing strategy considerations across settings: Symptom‑triggered treatment is generally the preferred dosing method but its appropriateness for ambulatory settings is debated; in this regimen, medication is given only when significant withdrawal symptoms are present by a severity scale, allowing individualized dosing and potentially rapid larger doses that are reduced as symptoms resolve, and it has been shown to reduce duration of treatment and inpatient length of stay compared with fixed‑dose schedules. In inpatient Level 2‑WM settings, symptom‑triggered dosing is generally appropriate, while concerns in ambulatory care include that CIWA‑Ar requires training; alternative self‑administered tools such as the Short Alcohol Withdrawal Scale (SAWS) exist, and a symptom‑triggered regimen using SAWS has been shown as safe and effective as a fixed‑dose schedule in an open‑label outpatient RCT. Some sources, including the Guideline Committee, argue CIWA‑Ar can be patient‑ or caregiver‑administered with sufficient instruction; for Level 1‑WM patients who can reliably assess and follow guidance, symptom‑triggered treatment is an appropriate option. Fixed dosing is also appropriate in ambulatory settings, uses set amounts at regular intervals with gradual taper, but risks over‑ or under‑dosing; additional take‑home doses may be needed, frequent monitoring and dose adjustment remain necessary, patients should be reassessed the next day to modify dose if needed, and front loading by trained staff is also appropriate in ambulatory settings.

Ambulatory alcohol withdrawal — recovery/living environment and transportation considerations are specified as follows: A patient's recovery and living environment is a consideration when determining level of care, including the presence of social support, access to safe housing and transportation, and ability to visit the clinic frequently during withdrawal management. The absence of a reliable social support network is not a reason to exclude patients from ambulatory management. Patients with family or friends who are not supportive of or oppose the withdrawal management process should not be managed in a Level 1-WM setting, whereas having family or friends who are not supportive of or oppose the withdrawal management process is not a reason to exclude patients from Level 2-WM settings. It is also not appropriate to manage alcohol withdrawal in an ambulatory setting if patients are unable to access or arrange for transportation to the treatment setting; the inability to come to the treatment setting daily is not a reason to exclude patients, and an alternative may involve alternating in-person clinic visits with consultations with a qualified clinician every other day via phone or video conference.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — pregnancy level of care and monitoring: Inpatient treatment should be considered for all pregnant patients with alcohol use disorder who require withdrawal management, and inpatient treatment should be offered to pregnant patients with at least moderate alcohol withdrawal (i.e. CIWA-Ar scores ≥ 10). The CIWA-Ar is an appropriate symptom assessment scale to use with pregnant patients, pregnancy is not expected to bias scores on symptom assessment scales, and clinicians should consider signs and symptoms such as nausea, headache, anxiety, and insomnia to be connected to alcohol withdrawal rather than pregnancy and presume they will abate once the alcohol withdrawal has been effectively treated. During withdrawal management, patients who are pregnant should be monitored appropriately. The guideline notes that inpatient treatment should be considered given the risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder including fetal alcohol syndrome and the risk of abortion, preterm delivery, and fetal distress or demise due to continued alcohol use during pregnancy, and while inpatient management is not more effective than ambulatory management for patients who are appropriately matched to level of care, it does limit exposure to alcohol. The Guideline Committee recommends consulting with an obstetrician when managing alcohol withdrawal in a pregnant patient, and fetal monitoring appropriate to the stage of pregnancy may be warranted due to risk of abortion, preterm delivery, and fetal distress or demise.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy (inpatient), ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as first-line therapy in patients with severe alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score ≥ 19). Administer phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use) if benzodiazepines are contraindicated. Consider administering phenobarbital as an adjunct to benzodiazepines in a setting with close monitoring. Consider administering other adjunct medications after ensuring that an adequate dose of benzodiazepines has been administered.

### A rational approach to the treatment of alcohol withdrawal in the ED [^ac7d3e1c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Approximately 7% of the US population abuses or is dependent on alcohol. Patients with alcohol disorders often seek medical attention in Emergency Departments (EDs) for complications directly related to alcohol use or due to other medical issues associated with alcohol use. Because of increasing lengths of stay in EDs, alcohol-dependent patients are at high risk of developing alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) during their ED visit. This article reviews the physiology of alcohol withdrawal as well as the symptoms of this potentially deadly illness for the practicing emergency physician (EP). We provide evidence-based guidelines for the appropriate ED treatment of moderate to severe AWS, including pharmacologic interventions, adjunctive therapies, and disposition of these patients.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — ambulatory benzodiazepine prescribing cautions: In ambulatory management, some situations exist where the risks of benzodiazepines outweigh benefits; in these cases, patients can be offered an alternative medication, and individuals with a history of even mild adverse events with benzodiazepine use should not be prescribed benzodiazepines because continuous monitoring is lacking. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed with extra caution by dispensing or prescribing a very small number of doses and using more frequent monitoring; even patients at high risk for misuse or diversion, or with current or past benzodiazepine use disorder, can be prescribed benzodiazepines if managed cautiously, and the potential for misuse is limited during the short period of supervised withdrawal.

### Efficacy of gabapentin for the treatment of alcohol use disorder in patients with alcohol withdrawal symptoms: a randomized clinical trial [^a6c469a8]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Although an estimated 30 million people meet criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD), few receive appropriate pharmacotherapy. A more personalized, symptom-specific, approach might improve efficacy and acceptance.

Objective

To examine whether gabapentin would be useful in the treatment of AUD, especially in those with the most alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind randomized clinical trial conducted between November 2014 and June 2018 evaluated gabapentin vs placebo in community-recruited participants screened and treated in an academic outpatient setting over a 16-week treatment period. A total of 145 treatment-seeking individuals who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria for AUD and were not receiving other AUD intervention were screened, and 96 who also met recent alcohol withdrawal criteria were randomized to treatment after 3 abstinent days. Daily drinking was recorded, and percentage of disialo carbohydrate-deficient transferrin in the blood, a heavy drinking marker, was collected at baseline and monthly during treatment.

Interventions

Gabapentin up to 1200 mg/d, orally, vs placebo along with 9 medical management visits (20 minutes each).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The percentage of individuals with no heavy drinking days and those with total abstinence were compared between treatment groups and further evaluated based on prestudy alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

Results

Of 96 randomized individuals, 90 were evaluable (44 in the gabapentin arm and 46 in the placebo arm), with a mean (SD) age of 49.6 (10.1) years; 69 were men (77%) and 85 were white (94%). The evaluable participants had 83% baseline heavy drinking days (4 or more drinks/day for women, 5 or more for men) and met 4.5 alcohol withdrawal criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition). More gabapentin-treated individuals had no heavy drinking days (12 of 44 participants [27%]) compared with placebo (4 of 46 participants [9%]), a difference of 18.6% (95% CI, 3.1–34.1; P = 0.02; number needed to treat [NNT], 5.4), and more total abstinence (8 of 44 [18%]) compared with placebo (2 of 46 [4%]), a difference of 13.8% (95% CI, 1.0–26.7; P = 0.04; NNT, 6.2). The prestudy high-alcohol withdrawal group had positive gabapentin effects on no heavy drinking days (P < .02; NNT, 3.1) and total abstinence (P = 0.003; NNT, 2.7) compared with placebo, while within the low-alcohol withdrawal group, there were no significant differences. These findings were similar for other drinking variables, where gabapentin was more efficacious than placebo in the high-alcohol withdrawal group only. Gabapentin caused more dizziness, but this did not affect efficacy.

Conclusions and Relevance

These data, combined with others, suggest gabapentin might be most efficacious in people with AUD and a history of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Future studies should evaluate sleep changes and mood during early recovery as mediators of gabapentin efficacy.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^ee1ed115]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — evidence on symptom-triggered care and risk: Previous guidelines and reviews indicate that patients experiencing mild alcohol withdrawal (e.g. CIWA-Ar score < 10) who are at minimal risk of worsening symptoms can be safely treated with monitored supportive care alone, and research has demonstrated that patients who never reach a CIWA-Ar score ≥ 10 and thus do not receive medication in accordance with a symptom-triggered protocol are not at higher risk of adverse events than patients who received medication through a fixed-dose protocol; in addition, patients receiving medications through a symptom triggered protocol require less medication overall and experience a shorter duration of treatment. Patients experiencing moderate or severe withdrawal (e.g. CIWA-Ar scores ≥ 10) should receive pharmacotherapy, and moderate to severe withdrawal at treatment baseline has been identified as a risk factor for developing more severe withdrawal during the course of treatment.

### The alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^c7e91ccd]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a common management problem in hospital practice for neurologists, psychiatrists and general physicians alike. Although some patients have mild symptoms and may even be managed in the outpatient setting, others have more severe symptoms or a history of adverse outcomes that requires close inpatient supervision and benzodiazepine therapy. Many patients with AWS have multiple management issues (withdrawal symptoms, delirium tremens, the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, seizures, depression, polysubstance abuse, electrolyte disturbances and liver disease), which requires a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach. Although AWS may be complex, careful evaluation and available treatments should ensure safe detoxification for most patients.

### The emergency medicine management of severe alcohol withdrawal [^c5c5045f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol use is widespread, and withdrawal symptoms are common after decreased alcohol intake. Severe alcohol withdrawal may manifest with delirium tremens, and new therapies may assist in management of this life-threatening condition.

Objective

To provide an evidence-based review of the emergency medicine management of alcohol withdrawal and delirium tremens.

Discussion

The underlying pathophysiology of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is central nervous system hyperexcitation. Stages of withdrawal include initial withdrawal symptoms, hallucinations, seizures, and delirium tremens. Management focuses on early diagnosis, resuscitation, and providing medications with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor activity. Benzodiazepines with symptom-triggered therapy have been the predominant medication class utilized and should remain the first treatment option with rapid escalation of dosing. Treatment resistant withdrawal warrants the use of phenobarbital or propofol, both demonstrating efficacy in management. Propofol can be used as an induction agent to decrease the effects of withdrawal. Dexmedetomidine does not address the underlying pathophysiology but may reduce the need for intubation. Ketamine requires further study. Overall, benzodiazepines remain the cornerstone of treatment. Outpatient management of patients with minimal symptoms is possible.

Conclusions

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Physicians must rapidly diagnose these conditions while evaluating for other diseases. Benzodiazepines are the predominant medication class utilized, with adjunctive treatments including propofol or phenobarbital in patients with withdrawal resistant to benzodiazepines. Dexmedetomidine and ketamine require further study.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — moderate withdrawal management (CIWA-Ar 10–18): Patients experiencing moderate alcohol withdrawal should receive pharmacotherapy, with benzodiazepines as first-line treatment; carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate alternatives. For patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use, carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (in Level 2‑WM settings for providers experienced with its use) are appropriate. Carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (if no liver disease or childbearing potential) may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepines.

Alcohol withdrawal — ambulatory misuse/diversion risk and dispensing — notes that "Clinicians can manage benzodiazepine misuse or diversion risk in ambulatory settings by dispensing or prescribing the minimum amount necessary given the patient's level of stability and timing of their next in-person clinic visit. Alternative medications can also be considered such as carbamazepine or gabapentin". In higher-risk patients, "Benzodiazepines can be used with caution in patients with a high risk of benzodiazepine diversion including patients with a current or past benzodiazepine use disorder for the short period of acute alcohol withdrawal. Risk can be managed by dispensing or prescribing a small number of doses", with "some suggesting providing only enough medication for one day".

ASAM benzodiazepine dosing regimens — at short-term observational settings with continuous monitoring (e.g. Level 2–WM), symptom-triggered treatment conducted by trained staff is the preferred benzodiazepine dosing method, with front loading under clinical supervision or fixed dosing with additional as-needed medication also appropriate. At settings without extended on-site monitoring (Level 1–WM), symptom-triggered dosing is appropriate if patients or a caregiver can reliably monitor signs and symptoms with a withdrawal severity scale and follow dosing guidance.

Alcohol withdrawal — initial pharmacotherapy selection: Carbamazepine and gabapentin are appropriate for managing mild and moderate alcohol withdrawal in patients who are at minimal risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal. Benzodiazepines are first-line agents for treating moderate or severe alcohol withdrawal due to their known effectiveness in preventing seizures and delirium, and are also appropriate for mild withdrawal in inpatient settings. When benzodiazepines are contraindicated, carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital can be used for mild or moderate withdrawal. Phenobarbital is the preferred alternative for severe withdrawal but, given its narrow therapeutic window, should only be used by clinicians experienced with its use.

### Symptom-triggered alcohol withdrawal management delivered over telemedicine [^73a88d4b]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Evidence from this study suggests that telemedicine-delivered symptom-triggered alcohol withdrawal management is feasible and acceptable to patients. If our results are confirmed in future studies, telemedicine-based withdrawal management could be used to deliver specialized addiction treatment to patients in rural, remote, and underserved communities. Some patients may prefer to receive symptom-triggered medical withdrawal management treatment in the comfort of their own homes, and this treatment provides patients with that option. Given the low rates of uptake of medical treatment for AUD, interventions that expand access and reduce barriers to care such as this one are urgently needed.
