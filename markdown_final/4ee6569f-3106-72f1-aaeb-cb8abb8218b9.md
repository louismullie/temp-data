## Question

Bennett sells window screens. He sold twice as many window screens in February as he sold last month. In February, Bennett sold a fourth of what he sold in March. If Bennet sold 8800 window screens in March, how many screens did Bennett sell from January to March?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many window screens Bennett sold from January to March, given that March sales were 8,800 screens and the relationships between February, March, and January sales. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "last month" means in the context of February. Then, I should verify the relationship between February and March sales. Next, I will calculate February sales from March sales. After that, I need to determine January sales from February sales. Finally, I will sum January, February, and March to get the total for the quarter and double-check my arithmetic.

> Let me first confirm the timeline and definitions. "Last month" relative to February must be January, so the statement "twice as many in February as last month" means February sales equal 2 times January sales. I should also confirm that "February sales are a fourth of March sales", which directly links February to March. Given March sales are 8,800 screens, I can use that anchor to work backward and forward.

> Now, I will calculate February sales from March sales. If February sales are one fourth of March sales, then February equals 8,800 divided by 4, which is 2,200 screens. Wait, let me verify that division: 8,800 ÷ 4 = 2,200, so February sales are indeed 2,200 screens.

> Next, I should determine January sales from February sales. Since February sales are twice January sales, January equals February divided by 2, so 2,200 ÷ 2 = 1,100 screens. Hold on, I should verify the inverse: 1,100 × 2 = 2,200, which matches February, so January sales are 1,100 screens.

> Finally, I will sum the quarterly total. January 1,100 plus February 2,200 plus March 8,800 equals 12,100 screens. Let me double-check the addition: 1,100 + 2,200 = 3,300, and 3,300 + 8,800 = 12,100, so the total from January to March is 12,100 window screens.

---

Bennett sold **12,100 window screens** from January to March. Here's how: March sales were 8,800, so February sales were 1/4 of that, or 2,200 screens. Since February sales were twice January's, January sales were 1,100 screens. Adding January, February, and March gives 1,100 + 2,200 + 8,800 = 12,100 screens.

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Step 1: Determine February sales

February sales were **1/4 of March sales**:

February sales = [1/4] × 8,800 = 2,200 screens

---

### Step 2: Determine January sales

February sales were **twice January sales**, so:

January sales = [2,200/2] = 1,100 screens

---

### Step 3: Calculate total sales from January to March

Add January, February, and March sales:

Total sales = 1,100 + 2,200 + 8,800 = 12,100 screens

---

## Final answer

Bennett sold a total of **12,100 window screens** from January to March.

Leishmaniasis — prevention for travelers: No vaccines or drugs to prevent infection are available, and travelers can reduce the risk of CL by using personal protective measures to avoid sand fly bites. Advise travelers to avoid outdoor activities, especially from dusk to dawn when sand flies are the most active; wear protective clothing and apply insect repellent to exposed skin and under the edges of clothing according to the manufacturer's instructions; and sleep in air-conditioned or well-screened areas. Spraying sleeping quarters with insecticide might provide some protection, and fans or ventilators might inhibit the movement of sand flies, which are weak fliers. Sand flies are small (approximately 2–3 mm, < 1/8 inch) and can pass through the holes in ordinary mosquito nets; the effectiveness of mosquito nets can be enhanced by treating with a pyrethroid-containing (i.e., permethrin) insecticide, and the same treatment can be applied to bed sheets and clothing, curtains, and window screens.

### Trends in utilization of FDA expedited drug development and approval programs, 1987–2014: cohort study [^2564087d]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Before a new prescription drug can be sold widely in the United States, it must be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA must determine, based on the data it receives, that the drug seems safe enough and that there is substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it is represented to have, based on adequate and well controlled investigations such as randomized controlled trials assessing validated clinical outcomes. The FDA makes these determinations by reviewing results from experimental clinical trials conducted by or on behalf of the drug's manufacturer, usually divided into three phases: phase 1 trials in a small number (generally 20–80) of often healthy participants to identify the drug's pharmacokinetics; phase 2 studies in somewhat larger numbers of patients (no more than several hundred) with the disease or condition under study; and phase 3 trials in hundreds or thousands of patients to generate safety and efficacy data sufficient to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relation of the drug. The FDA must then review the data, and currently has a 10 month window in which to make its approval decision. While this multistage drug development and regulatory review process screens out many unsafe or ineffective experimental drugs, it also delays widespread access to those drugs ultimately shown to be safe and effective, which may be problematic for patients with serious or life threatening conditions who have no other treatment options.

### Cryptic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the first COVID-19 wave [^7ce1ed16]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Considerable uncertainty surrounds the timeline of introductions and onsets of local transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) globally –. Although a limited number of SARS-CoV-2 introductions were reported in January and February 2020 (refs.), the narrowness of the initial testing criteria, combined with a slow growth in testing capacity and porous travel screening, left many countries vulnerable to unmitigated, cryptic transmission. Here we use a global metapopulation epidemic model to provide a mechanistic understanding of the early dispersal of infections and the temporal windows of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 and onset of local transmission in Europe and the USA. We find that community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was likely to have been present in several areas of Europe and the USA by January 2020, and estimate that by early March, only 1 to 4 in 100 SARS-CoV-2 infections were detected by surveillance systems. The modelling results highlight international travel as the key driver of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2, with possible introductions and transmission events as early as December 2019 to January 2020. We find a heterogeneous geographic distribution of cumulative infection attack rates by 4 July 2020, ranging from 0.78% to 15.2% across US states and 0.19% to 13.2% in European countries. Our approach complements phylogenetic analyses and other surveillance approaches and provides insights that can be used to design innovative, model-driven surveillance systems that guide enhanced testing and response strategies.

### New prototype screened doors and windows for excluding mosquitoes from houses: a pilot study in rural Gambia [^722c8466]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Despite compelling evidence that modern housing protects against malaria, houses in endemic areas are still commonly porous to mosquitoes. The protective efficacy of four prototype screened doors and two windows designs against mosquito house entry, their impact on indoor climate, as well as their use, durability and acceptability was assessed in a Gambian village. A baseline survey collected data on all the houses and discrete household units, each consisting of a front and back room, were selected and randomly allocated to the study arms. Each prototype self-closing screened door and window was installed in six and 12 units, respectively, with six unaltered units serving as controls. All prototype doors reduced the number of house-entering mosquitoes by 59–77% in comparison with the control houses. The indoor climate of houses with screened doors was similar to control houses. Seventy-nine percentage of door openings at night occurred from dusk to midnight, when malaria vectors begin entering houses. Ten weeks after installation the doors and windows were in good condition, although 38% of doors did not fully self-close and latch (snap shut). The new doors and windows were popular with residents. The prototype door with perforated concertinaed screening was the best performing door because it reduced mosquito entry, remained fully functional, and was preferred by the villagers. Screened doors and windows may be useful tools for reducing vector exposure and keeping areas malaria-free after elimination, when investment in routine vector control becomes difficult to maintain.

### Pilot case-control study of paediatric falls from windows [^7f3ba187]. Injury Prevention (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Unintentional falls from windows are an important cause of paediatric morbidity. There have been no controlled studies to identify modifiable environmental risk factors for window falls in young children. The authors have piloted a case-control study to test procedures for case identification, subject enrolment, and environmental data collection.

Methods

Case windows were identified when a child 0–9 years old presented for care after a fall from that window. Control windows were identified (1) from the child's home and (2) from the home of an age- and gender-matched child seeking care for an injury diagnosis not related to a window fall. Study staff visited enrolled homes to collect window measurements and conduct window screen performance tests.

Results

The authors enrolled and collected data on 18 case windows, 18 in-home controls, and 14 matched community controls. Six potential community controls were contacted for every one enrolled. Families who completed the home visit viewed study procedures positively. Case windows were more likely than community controls to be horizontal sliders (100% vs 50%), to have deeper sills (6.28 vs 4.31 inches), to be higher above the exterior surface (183 vs 82 inches), and to have screens that failed below a threshold derived from the static pressure of a 3-year-old leaning against the mesh (60.0% vs 16.7%). Case windows varied very little from in-home controls.

Discussion

Case-control methodology can be used to study risk factors for paediatric falls from windows. Recruitment of community controls is challenging but essential, because in-home controls tend to be over-matched on important variables. A home visit allows direct measurement of window type, height, sill depth, and screen performance. These variables should all be investigated in subsequent, larger studies covering major housing markets.

House dust sampling for lead hazards — methods and intended uses describe where and why testing is performed. Sampling involves "using a special wipe to sample a specified area, such as the floor, which is readily accessible to a child, or a window sill or window trough", and "Window sills often are more heavily contaminated than floors". This testing "is used to screen older housing units that may contain lead hazards at the time of purchase or rent and before occupancy; to conduct a full risk assessment that involves extensive sampling of settled dust in housing units that failed a lead hazard screen or where there is a high probability of a lead hazard".

### Cryptic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the first COVID-19 wave [^70f3d37c]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Considerable uncertainty surrounds the timeline of introductions and onsets of local transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) globally 1–7. Although a limited number of SARS-CoV-2 introductions were reported in January and February 2020 (refs. 8,9), the narrowness of the initial testing criteria, combined with a slow growth in testing capacity and porous travel screening 10, left many countries vulnerable to unmitigated, cryptic transmission. Here we use a global metapopulation epidemic model to provide a mechanistic understanding of the early dispersal of infections and the temporal windows of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 and onset of local transmission in Europe and the USA.

### The 2020 US cancer screening deficit and the timing of adults' most recent screen: a population-based cross-sectional study [^aa013a17]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Rather than attempt to create different groups based on exposure to the pandemic during the pandemic year, we take a different approach by leveraging how BRFSS implements each of its cross-sectional surveys over the course of 15 months (ie, 1 January 2020–31 March 2021). Selection into the BRFSS sample is random, but so is the timing of the interview. Each respondent selected into the BRFSS sample is then randomly allocated to an interview date. Therefore, there is no reason to expect any systematic differences in cancer screening behaviour between adults queried early in a single year BRFSS survey wave and adults queried later in that same BRFSS survey wave; except however, during the COVID-19 pandemic year.

Our design begins by creating two distinct quasi-groups of adult BRFSS respondents. The first group only includes adults surveyed between 1 January and 31 March of the first year in each survey wave. We consider this 'early' group the control group. Our second group only includes adults surveyed between 1 January and 31 March of the second year in each survey wave. We consider this 'late' group the treatment group. Online supplemental table 2 reports the cancer screening rates for both quasi-treatment and control groups for years 2010–2018. We test for significant differences in proportions between both groups and report the t-statistic and respective p value to assess the comparability of these groups prior to 2020. We also conduct similar proportion tests for the sample composition of our control variables.

Prior to 2020, we hypothesise that screening behaviour is not significantly different between our control and treatment groups. We also hypothesise that, prior to 2020, the trends in screening behaviour do not differentially vary by group (see statistical analysis section below for details on these identification tests). Evidence that levels and trends did not vary between groups prior to 2020 supports our identification assumption: that any difference in screening rates observed in 2020 should be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Window-of-opportunity trials to screen effective agents and optimize dose in breast cancer prevention [^33718388]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Window-of-opportunity trials are a path to screen effective agents and optimize dose in breast cancer risk reduction. We review the scientific evidence regarding the utility of window-of-opportunity trials to screen effective agents and optimize dose for successful risk reduction/interception of breast cancer. Low-dose tamoxifen was evaluated in a window-of-opportunity trial and then validated in a phase-III trial. We are now studying similar activity with low-dose exemestane.

### Seizing the window of opportunity within 1 year postpartum: early cardiovascular screening [^c1b0052c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

We conducted a prospective cohort study of both multiparous and nulliparous participants with singleton gestations and no known preexisting medical conditions who were diagnosed with HDP compared with normotensive healthy women with no pregnancy complications (non‐HDP) at Yale New Haven Health from December 2017 to March 2020 (prepandemic). Participants were recruited from multiple practice groups across the hospital system including private practice groups and university‐based groups. Women with cHTN, defined by the ACOG as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg, before 20 weeks of gestation, were excluded.

HDP was defined as 1 or more of the following diagnoses: gestational hypertension, preeclampsia without severe features, preeclampsia with severe features, or eclampsia. Diagnoses were made by the clinical care team according to ACOG criteria(Table S1). These participants in the HDP group were recruited during contact with the health care system from delivery until 6 months postpartum in a sequential fashion. The electronic health record was reviewed by authors H.S.L. and C.M. A‐B. to determine that the participants did not have cHTN diagnosed prepregnancy or within the first 20 weeks of gestation (as per the ACOG definition).

The non‐HDP group included participants without hypertension as defined by the ACOG, or any other antenatal obstetrical complication, who delivered at 37 weeks gestation or later. These participants in the non‐HDP group were recruited in a similar fashion to the HDP group. The electronic health record of the non‐HDP group was also reviewed before inclusion to confirm that they did not develop HDP during the 6 weeks postpartum and did not have cHTN diagnosed prepregnancy or within the first 20 weeks of gestation. At Yale New Haven Health, there are private obstetrics/gynecology practices and university‐based practices that include both low‐risk and high‐risk patients. Recruitment methods were the same for all practice models, and patients in both the HDP and non‐HDP cohorts were recruited from both practice models.

### Use of insecticide-treated house screens to reduce infestations of dengue virus vectors, Mexico [^45f42a13]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The Study

During 2011–2013, in the city of Acapulco in Guerrero state, Mexico (Figure 1), an area of consistently high dengue transmission, we investigated the effect on vector infestations of permanently mounted, insecticide-treated screens fitted to doors and windows of residential houses. The screens (Duranet, Clarke Mosquito Control, Roselle, IL, USA) were made of 0.55% wt/wt α-cypermethrin–treated nonflammable polyethylene netting (145 denier; mesh = 132 holes/in 2); the design is approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) Pesticide Evaluation Scheme.

A) Locations of clusters in the neighborhoods of Ciudad Renacimiento and Zapata, showing areas with (red) and without (blue) screens. Insets show location of study area (black box) in Acapulco and Guerrero state (black shading) in Mexico. B) Photographs of screens mounted on aluminum frames and fixed to windows and external doors of treated houses in 2012. The insects visible in the right photograph are dead house flies.

We used a cluster-randomized sampling design constructed on the basis of earlier studies (–,) to select 20 clusters (10 treatment, 10 control; 100 households/cluster) from a possible 30 clusters by using digital maps (Google Earth software; Google Inc. Mountain View, CA, USA) (Figure 1). Sample size was determined by using a 2-level hierarchical model to achieve 80% power at a 5% level of significance. Thus, for a negative binomial distribution with a dispersion coefficient of 0.02 and intracluster coefficient of 0.05, a minimum of 8.9 clusters/arm were required. Written informed consent was obtained from participating households; the WHO Ethical Review Committee (WHO reference no. 2010/82951–0, unit reference no. A90297) and Guerrero State Ministry of Health granted ethical permission for the study.

### ACOG clinical consensus no. 10: cannabis use during pregnancy and lactation [^d0f4acb5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Cannabis toxicology testing — types, detection window, consent, and reporting considerations: presumptive testing has lower sensitivity or specificity and establishes preliminary evidence of drug metabolites, whereas definitive testing has higher sensitivity and specificity to identify drugs and their metabolites. A positive presumptive or definitive test result does not diagnose a substance use disorder or detect the severity of use, and all positive presumptive test results should be validated by definitive gas or liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry, as indicated. Toxicology testing with biological materials may have significant social and legal consequences and should always be conducted with the patient's informed consent. The detection window for cannabis is long — urine: 1–30 days, hair: up to 90 days, oral fluid: up to 24 hours, sweat: 7–14 days — and clearance time in pregnancy has not been studied extensively. Reporting of positive presumptive or definitive drug test results during pregnancy and postpartum is variably enforced and biased; Black patients screen positive at the same rate as White patients yet are 4–10 times more likely to have a positive drug screen result reported to child protective services.

### Biomarker testing for lysosomal diseases: a technical standard of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^d584c7c3]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Krabbe disease — clinical description, treatment window, newborn screening, and biomarker: Krabbe disease is an autosomal recessive LD caused by a deficiency in galactocerebrosidase activity and has an estimated frequency of 1 in 400,000. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only treatment available and is shown to have the potential to be effective when performed several weeks before symptoms, which, in the infantile form, translates to intervention in the last 4 to 6 weeks of life. Several states, corresponding to 1/3 of the US newborn population, have incorporated Krabbe disease into their newborn screening program, and it was added to the RUSP in July 2024. Galactosylsphingosine is neurotoxic at elevated concentrations, is elevated in Krabbe disease and saposin A deficiency, may be useful to monitor disease progression before and after treatment, and its quantification can be used for confirmation of primary screening results based on lack of enzyme activity.

### Molecular evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in New York before the first pandemic wave [^cce93158]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Numerous reports document the spread of SARS-CoV-2, but there is limited information on its introduction before the identification of a local case. This may lead to incorrect assumptions when modeling viral origins and transmission. Here, we utilize a sample pooling strategy to screen for previously undetected SARS-CoV-2 in de-identified, respiratory pathogen-negative nasopharyngeal specimens from 3,040 patients across the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. The patients had been previously evaluated for respiratory symptoms or influenza-like illness during the first 10 weeks of 2020. We identify SARS-CoV-2 RNA from specimens collected as early as 25 January 2020, and complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from multiple pools of samples collected between late February and early March, documenting an increase prior to the later surge. Our results provide evidence of sporadic SARS-CoV-2 infections a full month before both the first officially documented case and emergence of New York as a COVID-19 epicenter in March 2020.

### The 2020 US cancer screening deficit and the timing of adults' most recent screen: a population-based cross-sectional study [^4da973d6]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

In 2020, cancer screenings declined, resulting in a cancer screening deficit. The significance of this deficit, however, has yet to be quantified from a population health perspective. Our study addresses this evidence gap by examining how the pandemic changed the timing of American adults' most recent cancer screen.

Methodology

We obtained population-based, cancer screening data from the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) (2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020). Mammograms, pap smears and colonoscopies were each specified as a variable of mutually exclusive categories to indicate the timing since the most recent screening (never, 0–1 years, 1–2 years, 3+ years). Our cross-sectional, quasi-experimental design restricts the sample to adults surveyed in January, February or March. We then leverage a quirk in the BRFSS implementation and consider adults surveyed in the second year of the 2020 survey wave as exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents surveyed in January 2020-March 2020 were considered unexposed. To estimate the impact of exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic on the timing of recent cancer screenings, we constructed linear and logistic regression models which control for sociodemographic characteristics associated with screening patterns, and state fixed effects and temporal trend fixed effects to control for confounding.

Results

In 2020, the cancer screening deficit was largely due to a 1year delay among adults who receive annual screening, as the proportion of adults reporting a cancer screen in the past year declined by a nearly identical proportion of adults reporting their most recent cancer screen 1–2 years ago (3%-4% points). However, the relative change was higher for mammograms and pap smears (17%) than colonoscopies (4%). We also found some evidence that the proportion of women reporting never having completed a mammogram declined in 2020, but the mechanisms for this finding should be further explored with the release of future data.

Conclusion

Our estimates for the pandemic's effect on cancer screening rates are smaller than prior studies. Because we account for temporal trends, we believe prior studies overestimated the effect of the pandemic and underestimated the overall downward trend in cancer screenings across the country leading up to 2020.

### A state-wide population-based evaluation of cervical cancers arising during opportunistic screening in the United States [^271e235f]. Gynecologic Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Over the study period the vast majority of screening was by cytology alone, although co-testing was increasingly used from 2013 to 2016; because the recommendation in late 2012 was for 5-year co-testing, only positive co-tests within 40 months of diagnosis are considered and the screening history of some cancers with an antecedent negative co-test may not have been included in our analysis. As only (laboratory) test results must be reported to NMHPVPR under state regulation, confirmation of colposcopy was only possible when a biopsy was performed and therefore we could not differentiate between failure to attend colposcopy and attendance where no biopsy was taken.

To better understand the separate roles of screening (per se) and colposcopy and treatment in the resultant cancers, we considered events in the 5–40 month window prior to cancer diagnosis separately from what happened in the peri-diagnostic period (1–4 months prior to diagnosis). Essentially there are three possibilities in the screening window: no screening, only negative screening, or positive screening. If the woman was referred to colposcopy as a result of screening, she might: not attend colposcopy, have cancer diagnosed via colposcopy, or have cancer diagnosed despite having attended colposcopy. Among women not referred to colposcopy in the screening window, we can further classify them by whether in the peri-diagnostic interval they had: no screening; negative screening; or screening resulting in referral to colposcopy.

To ensure a full 40 months of screening history, we restrict our analyses to women diagnosed between 1 May 2009 and 31 December 2016 (i.e. 40 months from 1 January 2006).

### In-flight transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [^dd32b7cd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The Study

We examined public records for 1,110 persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong, China, recorded from January 23 through June 13, 2020; we used Centre for Health Protection (CHP) public records and the Vote4HK COVID-19 in HK database for case-patients who had traveled before diagnosis. At the time, the Hong Kong government had yet to introduce mandatory quarantine and airport screening. We identified a cluster of 4 persons with COVID-19 (henceforth referred to as patients A–D) associated with a commercial flight that departed from Boston, Massachusetts, USA, on March 9 and arrived in Hong Kong on March 10, 2020. The airplane, a Boeing 777-300ER, flew for »15 hours and carried a maximum of 294 passengers. The cluster comprised 2 passengers and 2 cabin crew members. Although these persons did not fulfill the criteria for SARS-CoV-2 testing at the time of arrival, results of reverse transcription PCR conducted in local healthcare settings within 5–11 days of arrival were positive. All 4 case-patients subsequently recovered (Appendix Figure 1).

Patients A and B were a married couple. Patient A was a 58-year-old man with underlying disease who sat in a window seat in business class on the airplane (Appendix Figure 2). On March 10, fever and productive cough developed; on March 13, he had mild abdominal discomfort, followed by diarrhea 2 days later. His 61-year-old wife, patient B, also had underlying illness. She sat directly in front of him in a business class window seat. On March 10, she had a sore throat. One day later, fever and cough developed. As their symptoms evolved, they sought healthcare and were hospitalized on March 14. On March 15, respiratory samples (collected March 14 for patient A and March 15 for patient B) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. No public record indicates what their underlying diseases were or whether these 2 passengers were symptomatic during the flight. Before the flight and within the 14-day incubation period, they visited Toronto, Ontario, Canada (February 15–March 2); New York, New York, USA (March 2–5); and Boston (March 5–9). CHP classified the couple as imported cases into Hong Kong.

Talaromycosis antigen screen-and-treat strategy — In hyperendemic areas, emerging data suggest that T. marneffei antigen can be detected weeks to months before culture detection in people with advanced HIV disease, providing a window for screening preclinical or asymptomatic disease and pre-emptive treatment to prevent disease development; point-of-care antigen detection assays in development may allow for research to determine the benefit of a screen-and-treat approach as more cost-effective strategy for disease prevention.

### March madness 2011: for whom the Bell tolls? [^19e6e3dc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association has developed 12 recommendations for preparticipation screening of high school and college athletes, but the application of these recommendations across the US is inconsistent. A recent clinical study suggests that the incidence and prevalence of sudden athletic death (SAD) is greater than previously believed. Currently, diagnostic screening is considered too expensive and is delivered sporadically. Logic dictates that the medical community must become more involved in reducing the incidence and prevalence of SAD through an improved preparticipation screening process. An effective screening process must be able to reproducibly predict and prevent potential risk using the most effective resources and keeping the cost-benefit ratio at a minimum. The most effective use of our resources will limit the potential of liability for institutions and physicians and, hopefully, eliminate episodes of SAD.

### The health impact of identifying a person with tuberculosis through systematic screening [^c6866b64]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Therefore, to estimate the potential benefits of early detection, we first estimate the proportion of TB-associated health effects that accrue during the "screen-detectable window" described above; this excludes any effects that accrue while the person would be classified as TB-negative by a given screening algorithm, or after diagnosis through routine care (e.g. due to loss to follow-up or ineffective treatment) (Figure 4). We then estimate the proportion of "screening-avertable" effects that early detection would actually avert, by considering the timing of health consequence accrual relative to the timing of potential detection through screening (assumed to occur at a random time during the screen-detectable window). Because TB severity tends to increase over time, health effects are more likely to accrue during later portions of the screen-detectable window. In particular, the symptoms and pathology that cause TB morbidity, mortality, and sequelae are also those that prompt care-seeking (or lead to death), such that increasing disease severity often shortens the screen-detectable window. We have represented this an exponential increase in the DALY accrual rate over time (Supplement page 2). Since health effects accrue more rapidly near the end of the screen-detectable window, whereas the timing of screening is independent of an individual's disease course, early detection tends to avert more than half of the negative health effects of TB that would have accrued during the screen-detectable window (Figure 4). The proportion avertable through screening may be different for personal versus transmission-related health consequences, as mechanisms of transmission may be less correlated with care-seeking and the timing of routine diagnosis; saturation of close contacts with infection over time, and behavioral changes that reduce the number of casual contacts as a person with TB becomes ill, may also limit the transmission late in the disease course despite an increase bacterial burden and intrinsic infectiousness.

Combining to estimate DALYs averted

By combining these three considerations – the average total health consequences associated with TB, differences in those consequences based on duration of disease course, and the proportion of those consequences likely to be averted if detected early through screening – we can estimate health impact per TB case detected (and treated) early through screening.

We use DALYs to quantify TB-related health consequences, with temporal discounting where relevant. because despite their limitations, DALYs facilitates summation across different mechanisms of benefit, comparison to other health interventions that have been evaluated similarly, and benchmarking against willingness-to-pay thresholds.

### Breast and lung cancer screening among Medicare enrollees during the COVID-19 pandemic [^c742a701]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, rates for all cancer screening tests were severely depressed, including mammography, colonoscopy and low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). The decrease in screening resulted in decreases in the rates of cancer diagnoses; specifically, a lower rate of diagnoses of early-stage cancer. This early decrease in screening was followed by a period of recovery, with rates returning to normal or near-normal in the summer of 2020.,

There are several limitations to the current information on cancer screening during the pandemic. First, screening rates have not been well studied beyond early 2020. One study using national claims data from March 2020 to February 2021 found a return to near-normal mammography rates during July through October 2020, but then another decline in January and February 2021. Second, many existing reports are from single institutions or from hospital systems, and have produced somewhat conflicting results. Third, the studies on cancer screening rates have not considered the temporal trends in use in the years before the pandemic. Whereas mammography rates were mostly flat, LDCT rates steadily increased over that time.,

Our objective was to use national Medicare data to assess rates of mammography and LDCT screening from January 2017 through July 2022, to determine if screening rates remained depressed later in the pandemic. We graphed unadjusted monthly rates from January 2017 through July 2022. We also calculated expected rates for March 2020 to February 2021 and March 2021 to February 2022, based on rates from January 2017 to February 2020, and compared those with the actual rates of screening.

### Combating the COVID-19 pandemic in a resource-constrained setting: insights from initial response in India [^93d5ee9f]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Combating risk of importation of the virus

'Nobody can be fully prepared to a pandemic'. India also could have benefited from even further pandemic response planning and preparedness. The country had its first case on 30 January. Between January and early March, India focused almost exclusively on minimising the risk of importation. In hindsight, it seems that aggressive surge preparedness could also have been undertaken in the meanwhile (especially in February) given that the virus had originated from an immediate neighbouring country and that WHO had already declared it as a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' on 30 January. The graded border control approach using selective screening and travel restrictions in January to February, leading to universal screening, visa suspensions and mandatory quarantine in March, could not adequately counter the risk of importation. Moreover, relying on thermal scanning was not infallible as several cases were afebrile/asymptomatic. Cases started increasing rapidly in early March. Containment and surge efforts followed subsequently (around mid-March). Meanwhile, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO. Worsening situations internationally, such as in Italy, UK and Iran, added to India's anxiety.

Since mid-March, India has acted swiftly to stem the rising cases of COVID-19. Existing legislative provisions (prominently the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and the Disaster Management Act, 2005) and semifederal governance structure provided due leverage. India thus mobilised resources and provided administrative flexibility to state governments to utilize the disaster funds, enabling contextual action. As a consequence, states could implement mass movement restrictions, access funds, mandate citizens into institutional quarantine and isolation, and regulate industries (implement work-from-home advisories). Alongside, GoI suspended visas and declared a nationwide lockdown.

### Screening and risk algorithms for detecting pediatric suicide risk in the emergency department [^653c7337]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Results

A total of 19 653 patients visited the ED between September 2019 and August 2021, of whom 495 (2.5%) were treated for a suicide attempt through March 2022. The study population included 10 007 (50.9%) female and 9646 (49.1%) male patients; the median age was 14.3 (IQR, 12.1–16.2) years. In terms of race and ethnicity, 3111 (15.8%) were Black, 6655 (33.9%) were Hispanic or Latino, 7839 (39.9%) were White, and 2048 (10.4%) were of other race or ethnicity. Table 1 contrasts the characteristics of the study population by those subsequently attempting suicide. Compared with those who did not attempt suicide, suicide attempts were more likely among female (351 [70.9%] vs 9656 [50.4%]) (P < .001), White (236 [47.7%] vs 7603 [39.7%]) (P = 0.005), and publicly insured (307 [62.0%] vs 10 172 [53.1%]) (P < .001) patients. A total of 2321 patients (11.8%) were not screened due to staff deviation from the screening protocol, medical instability, or developmental inappropriateness, yielding 17 332 patients screened (88.2%). Noncompletion rates were substantially lower among those who attempted suicide (12 [2.4%] vs 2309 [12.1%]; P < .001). Overall, 1587 patients (8.1%) had a positive screen result for moderate or high risk of suicide, of whom 181 (36.6%) had a subsequent suicide attempt, in contrast to 1406 (7.3%) of those who did not attempt suicide (P < .001). The median observation windows prior to and following screening (ie, the duration of the period from patients' most distant patient encounter to screening, and from screening to the end of data collection) were longer among those with suicide attempts (eg, those who attempted suicide had a median observation window of 423 [IQR, 0–664] days prior to screening vs 59 [IQR, 0–669] days in those who did not attempt suicide; P < .001).

### Cancer screening disparities before and after the COVID-19 pandemic [^bcc6bdbc]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Defining Screening-Eligible Populations

At each of the 2 time points, we defined the screening-eligible population for each cancer type. We started with all residents of Ontario who had at least 5 years' history of Ontario Health Insurance Plan coverage on the index dates (March 31, 2019, and March 31, 2022). Women eligible for breast screening were defined as those aged 52 to 69 years, excluding those with a history of breast cancer or mastectomy. Women eligible for cervical screening were defined as those aged 23 to 69 years, excluding those with a history of cervical cancer or hysterectomy. People eligible for colorectal screening were defined as those aged 52 to 74 years, excluding those who had a history of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel diseases. The lower age thresholds were chosen to allow for individuals to be eligible for screening for the full look-back window.

Study Variables

We described each study cohort based on age category, sex, neighborhood income quintile, immigrant status (immigrant or not), primary care model, rurality of residence based on postal code using the RIO classification, and health care use over the prior 2 years using resource utilization bands (RUBs) (ranges from 0 to 5, with higher values indicating a very high user of health care services) from the case-mix Johns Hopkins ACG System, version 10.0 (Johns Hopkins Medicine), which uses outpatient billing and inpatient hospital records. For immigrants, we also determined their world region of origin based on country of birth and a previously published modification of the World Bank classification system, as screening status has been shown to vary by region of origin.

### Molecules for the millennium: how will they look? New drug discovery year 2000 [^feddbff3]. British Journal of Cancer (2000). Low credibility.

A new approach to cancer drug discovery targets molecules important in cancer pathogenesis. This approach is thought to be of greater promise than the antiproliferative screens which discovered cytotoxic agents and dominated cancer drug discovery for 60 years. However, one cannot lose sight of the fact that these targets exist in the cellular environment consisting of many additional influences on target function, and that effective drug treatment will take into account drug uptake, metabolism and elimination at the level of the cell as well as the organism. A key goal is to define for the new millennium a path to cancer drug discovery and development which accounts for the cancer cell phenotype in its totality rather than as arising solely from single molecular targets. The US National Cancer Institute maintains a cell-based drug discovery screen which can define a context for drug action in the milieu of more than 300 molecular targets and thousands of gene expression patterns which have been measured in the 60 human tumour cell lines which comprise the screening panel. The challenge of the millennium will be addressed by molecules active against defined targets but with selectivity of action occurring in the milieu of deregulated cancer cell biology in all its aspects.

### Designing screens: how to make your hits a hit [^68fdee95]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2003). Medium credibility.

The basic goal of small-molecule screening is the identification of chemically 'interesting' starting points for elaboration towards a drug. A number of innovative approaches for pursuing this goal have evolved, and the right approach is dictated by the target class being pursued and the capabilities of the organization involved. A recent trend in high-throughput screening has been to place less emphasis on the number of data points that can be produced, and to focus instead on the quality of the data obtained. Several computational and technological advances have aided in the selection of compounds for screening and widened the variety of assay formats available for screening. The effect on the efficiency of the screening process is discussed.

### Trends in breast cancer screening in a safety-net hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic [^080b19f3]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Results

A total of 9291 screening mammograms were performed from January 1, 2019, to January 31, 2021: 5662 during 2019, with a mean of 472 mammograms per month (95% CI, 430–514 mammograms), and 3385 in 2020 (60% of the 2019 volume) (Figure 1 A). During the first stay-at-home order (February 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020), the number of screening mammograms decreased to 194 in March (41% of baseline [mean of 472 mammograms per month during 2019]) and to 0 in April (Figure 1 B). The number of missed appointments increased during 2020, with 127 of 321 (40%) missed in March, compared with 585 of 2764 (21%) from September 2019 to January 2020 (pre–COVID-19) (Figure 1 C). During the reopening phase (June 1, 2020, to November 30, 2020), the number of screening mammograms increased but remained below baseline, except in October, when 496 mammograms were completed. The number of screening mammograms declined during the second stay-at-home order. The mobile mammography unit volume decreased from 831 during 2019 to 248 in 2020, with 0 mammograms between April and June 2020.

### Optimising faecal occult blood screening: retrospective analysis of NHS bowel cancer screening data to improve the screening algorithm [^b2d7931b]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Background:

Colorectal neoplasia causes bleeding, enabling detection using Faecal Occult Blood tests (FOBt). The National Health Service (NHS) Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP) guaiac-based FOBt (gFOBt) kits contain six sample windows (or 'spots') and each kit returns either a positive, unclear or negative result. Test kits with five or six positive windows are termed 'abnormal' and the subject is referred for further investigation, usually colonoscopy. If 1–4 windows are positive, the result is initially 'unclear' and up to two further kits are submitted, further positivity leads to colonoscopy ('weak positive'). If no further blood is detected, the test is deemed 'normal' and subjects are tested again in 2 years' time. We studied the association between spot positivity % (SP%) and neoplasia.

Methods:

Subjects in the Southern Hub completing the first of two consecutive episodes between April 2009 and March 2011 were studied. Each episode included up to three kits and a maximum of 18 windows (spots). For each positivity combination, the percentage of positive spots out of the total number of spots completed by an individual in a single-screening episode was derived and named 'SP%'. Fifty-five combinations of SP can occur if the position of positive/negative spots on the same test card is ignored.

The proportion of individuals for whom neoplasia was identified in Episode 2 was derived for each of the 55 spot combinations. In addition, the Episode 1 spot pattern was analysed for subjects with cancer detected in Episode 2.

Results:

During Episode 2, 284 261 subjects completed gFOBT screening and colonoscopies were performed on 3891 (1.4%) subjects. At colonoscopy, cancer was detected in 7.4% (n = 286) and a further 39.8% (n = 1550) had adenomas. Cancer was detected in 21.3% of subjects with an abnormal first kit (five or six positive spots) and in 5.9% of those with a weak positive test result.

The proportion of cancers detected was positively correlated with SP%, with an R² correlation (linear) of 0.89. As the SP% increased from 11 to 100%, so the colorectal cancer (CRC) detection rate increased from 4 to 25%. At the lower SP%s, from 11to 25%, the CRC risk was relatively static at ∼4%. Above an SP% of 25%, every 10-percentage points increase in the SP%, was associated with an increase in cancer detection of 2.5%.

Conclusions:

This study demonstrated a strong correlation between SP% and cancer detection within the NHS BCSP. At the population level, subjects' cancer risk ranged from 4 to 25% and correlated with the gFOBt spot pattern.

Some subjects with an SP% of 11% proceed to colonoscopy, whereas others with an SP% of 22% do not. Colonoscopy on patients with four positive spots in kit 1 (SP% 22%) would, we estimate, detect cancer in ∼4% of cases and increase overall colonoscopy volume by 6%. This study also demonstrated how screening programme data could be used to guide its ongoing implementation and inform other programmes.

### Screening for gestational diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^7d112a15]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF response to public comment — screening tests, timing, and scope: A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 16 through March 15, 2021. The USPSTF found that several screening tests (OGCT, OGTT, fasting plasma glucose) and strategies (1- vs 2-step approach) can accurately detect gestational diabetes and does not recommend any single specific test, and based on newer evidence, the USPSTF found no difference between a 1-step and 2-step screening strategy for many maternal or infant outcomes. The USPSTF found limited data on risk-based screening and limited data on the benefits and harms of screening before 24 weeks of gestation, and clarifies that the recommendations do not preclude later screening. The USPSTF notes that detection and management of preexisting diabetes during pregnancy is beyond the scope of this recommendation, and clinicians should continue to use their clinical judgment to determine if screening is appropriate for individual patients.

### Descriptive assessment of COVID-19 responses and lessons learnt in Cambodia, January 2020 to June 2022 [^a0d78bc7]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Phase 1 (27 January 2020 to 19 February 2021): containment with non-pharmaceutical interventions

After detecting the first case, on 30 January 2020, mandatory temperature screenings for all travellers entering Cambodia at all points of entry (airports and international borders) were immediately implemented. However, in March and April 2020, Cambodia detected several clusters of imported cases that were not identified through the temperature screening system, but rather through notifications from WHO's IHR channel and event-based surveillance (screening local and international news). The virus spread locally from these primary cases.

To respond to these clusters, intensive contact tracing was undertaken to trace, test and quarantine the contacts. This strategy was an essential component of ' Measure 1: detect, isolate/quarantine '. Contact tracing commenced within 24 hours after a case was detected. All contacts were quarantined at quarantine centres or in their homes for 14 days from the last date of exposure and monitored every day for the development of COVID-19 symptoms. Due to the labour-intensive nature of contact tracing, the CamEWARN hotline 115 system that was launched in 2016 and the police forces deployed nationwide were used to support the RRTs. The CamEWARN hotline 115 system was updated to take calls from the public during the COVID-19 pandemic to augment the contact tracing team to identify contacts and screen for tests. Contact tracing teams first called contacts to review their symptoms, inform them of the automated calls that they will be receiving thereafter and instruct them to press 0 for none symptom and press 1 for any symptoms. An average of 2654 automated calls were sent per day between April 2020 and March 2022. Thousands of police officers were trained in contact tracing to support the Ministry of Health (MoH) in this activity.

### Four principles to consider before advising women on screening mammography [^d7ec7dd6]. Journal of Women's Health (2015). Low credibility.

Tumor biology has implications for the success or failure of screening mammography (Fig. 4). Breast cancer is not uniformly progressive, but is a collection of heterogeneous diseases. Women with breast cancer do not die from the primary tumor, but from metastatic disease. Only tumors that metastasize during the part of the tumor's lifetime when it can be detected by mammography but is not yet symptomatic may have their prognosis improved. We know that some very small tumors send out micrometastases below the mammogram threshold, while some large symptomatic tumors have late occurring or no metastases. Both cases occur outside the window where screening can benefit. The window narrows even more because in order to be successful, the screen-detection must occur before the tumor metastasizes. For every 5 mm of tumor growth, node-positivity increases by about 5%. Based on the mean 16-mm screened group tumor size from the trials, 35% of tumors would have already metastasized before being detectable. Given the mean size in the control group of 21mm, which is also the median size of U.S. symptomatic tumors today, 40% of tumors would have metastasized. Therefore, 5% would metastasize during the screening window, yielding a plausible RRR of breast cancer mortality of 12% due to screening. In summary, a 1- to 2-year window is too narrow for screening mammography to have a large effect.

FIG. 4.
"Early" detection is late. On the left, each concentric circle depicts one volume doubling of an invasive breast tumor (time scale). The right graph shows the tumor size correlating to each volume doubling. Each shade codes for a specific step in tumor development important to screening mammography. The difference in median tumor size between screen-detected and clinically detected tumors (5–7 mm) is one to two of 32 tumor-doubling times. The tumor size difference is overestimated due to overdiagnosis.

For each positivity combination, the percentage of positive spots out of the total number of spots completed by an individual in a single-screening episode was derived and named 'SP%'. Fifty-five combinations of SP can occur if the position of positive/negative spots on the same test card is ignored. The proportion of individuals for whom neoplasia was identified in Episode 2 was derived for each of the 55 spot combinations. In addition, the Episode 1 spot pattern was analysed for subjects with cancer detected in Episode 2.

Results

During Episode 2, 284,261 subjects completed gFOBT screening and colonoscopies were performed on 3891 (1.4%) subjects. At colonoscopy, cancer was detected in 7.4% (n = 286) and a further 39.8% (n = 1550) had adenomas. Cancer was detected in 21.3% of subjects with an abnormal first kit (five or six positive spots) and in 5.9% of those with a weak positive test result. The proportion of cancers detected was positively correlated with SP%, with an R² correlation (linear) of 0.89. As the SP% increased from 11 to 100%, so the colorectal cancer (CRC) detection rate increased from 4 to 25%. At the lower SP%s, from 11to 25%, the CRC risk was relatively static at ~4%. Above an SP% of 25%, every 10-percentage points increase in the SP%, was associated with an increase in cancer detection of 2.5%.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated a strong correlation between SP% and cancer detection within the NHS BCSP. At the population level, subjects' cancer risk ranged from 4 to 25% and correlated with the gFOBt spot pattern. Some subjects with an SP% of 11% proceed to colonoscopy, whereas others with an SP% of 22% do not. Colonoscopy on patients with four positive spots in kit 1 (SP% 22%) would, we estimate, detect cancer in ~4% of cases and increase overall colonoscopy volume by 6%. This study also demonstrated how screening programme data could be used to guide its ongoing implementation and inform other programmes.

### Impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures on the incidence of preterm birth: a national quasi-experimental study [^9b955ddf]. The Lancet: Public Health (2020). High credibility.

Background

Preterm birth is the leading cause of child mortality globally, with many survivors experiencing long-term adverse consequences. Preliminary evidence suggests that numbers of preterm births greatly reduced following implementation of policy measures aimed at mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to study the impact of the COVID-19 mitigation measures implemented in the Netherlands in a stepwise fashion on March 9, March 15, and March 23, 2020, on the incidence of preterm birth.

Methods

We used a national quasi-experimental difference-in-regression-discontinuity approach. We used data from the neonatal dried blood spot screening programme (2010–20) cross-validated against national perinatal registry data. Stratified analyses were done according to gestational age subgroups, and sensitivity analyses were done to assess robustness of the findings. We explored potential effect modification by neighbourhood socioeconomic status, sex, and small-for-gestational-age status.

Findings

Data on 1599547 singleton neonates were available, including 56720 births that occurred after implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures on March 9, 2020. Consistent reductions in the incidence of preterm birth were seen across various time windows surrounding March 9 (± 2 months [n = 531823] odds ratio [OR] 0·77, 95% CI 0·66–0·91, p = 0·0026; ± 3 months [n = 796531] OR 0·85, 0·73–0·98, p = 0·028; ± 4 months [n = 1066872] OR 0·84, 0·73–0·97, p = 0·023). Decreases in incidence observed following the March 15 measures were of smaller magnitude, but not statistically significant. No changes were observed after March 23. Reductions in the incidence of preterm births after March 9 were consistent across gestational age strata and robust in sensitivity analyses. They appeared confined to neighbourhoods of high socioeconomic status, but effect modification was not statistically significant.

Interpretation

In this national quasi-experimental study, initial implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures was associated with a substantial reduction in the incidence of preterm births in the following months, in agreement with preliminary observations elsewhere. Integration of comparable data from across the globe is needed to further substantiate these findings and start exploring underlying mechanisms.

### Has national colorectal cancer awareness month increased endoscopy screening rates and public interest in colorectal cancer? [^95e089d0]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month occurs each March to promote awareness and screening for colorectal cancer. The effectiveness of this public health campaign is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month on rates of screening endoscopies and on public interest in colorectal cancer.

Methods

To examine the impact of National Colon Cancer Awareness Month on screening endoscopy rates, the National Endoscopy Database was retrospectively reviewed from 2002 through 2014. A time series of monthly number of colorectal cancer screening endoscopies per endoscopist in the data set was evaluated. To examine public interest in colorectal cancer, Google Trends data were collected on the monthly rates of terms related to colorectal cancer from January 2004 to July 2019. Impact of the month on screening endoscopies and public interest was assessed through an analysis of variance. Seasonality was tested for by how well a sinusoidal model fit the time series as opposed to a linear model utilizing a sum-of-squares F test.

Results

Review of National Endoscopy Database yielded 1,398,996 endoscopies, 94% were colonoscopies and 6% sigmoidoscopies, with 47% for colorectal cancer screening. Colorectal cancer screening endoscopy rates were not impacted by the month of the year, and these rates had no seasonality. However, Google searches related to colorectal cancer were significantly impacted by month of the year, specifically March, with significant seasonality observed in the data.

Conclusions

National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month is associated with an increased public interest in colorectal cancer based on user Google search trends. Yet, this has not translated into a demonstrable increase in the rates of screening. This presents an opportunity to capitalize on this increased public interest and harness this enthusiasm into increased screening.

### Filling in the blind spot: integrating charles bonnet syndrome screening in ophthalmology [^2902877b]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Exclusion criteria included studies focusing on hallucinations primarily related to psychiatric or neurological etiologies, studies where CBS was only mentioned incidentally, studies that focused on non-visual hallucinations, studies that focused mainly on treatment, studies that did not have a full text or abstract, studies that were not peer-reviewed articles, or case reports and case series that included less than 5 patients. The decision to remove non-English language studies was made on the basis of feasibility, given that accurate translation of full-text articles in multiple languages was beyond the scope of our resources.

Databases that were searched included PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus using the following search terms that can be found in Box 1:

BOX 1
Search Terms

A total of 1,582 records were found on initial search (PubMed N = 276, Scopus N = 368, Web of Science N = 218, and Embase N = 720) and added to a Zotero database. These databases were selected given their exhaustiveness and the ability to download search results in a format compatible with Zotero. Duplicate studies were then removed manually (N = 749), and subsequently English language studies were also removed (N = 115). A total of 718 papers remained for title and abstract screening.

Title and abstract review were conducted in two rounds. Two reviewers examined the titles and abstract for each study and made a determination of whether the study fit inclusion or exclusion criteria. Reviewers were blinded to the decision of the other reviewer, and any discordance was resolved by a third reviewer during the second, tie-breaker round. Studies that passed text and abstract review were included in the full-text review (N = 114).

Full-text review was conducted by extraction of the following details from each study: study title, DOI, authors, publication year, study type, sample size, patient population, CBS screening tools used (if any), risk factors identified, study design, methods, main findings, and limitations. Data was extracted and compiled on a single excel sheet, along with the vote from the research member who reviewed the study. Decision regarding inclusion was made based upon discussion between research team members. A total of 25 studies were removed, 4 of which did not contain useful information about CBS based on the discretion of our reviewers, 12 of which were editorial articles or case reports, 1 of which was a foreign language article, and 8 of which were duplicates that were discovered on review of the full text.

### The impact of population-based faecal occult blood test screening on colorectal cancer mortality: a matched cohort study [^9e3b00d9]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Design of study

The design of the Scottish arm of the UK pilot of FOBT screening provided the opportunity to compare individuals resident in the three National Health Service (NHS) boards selected to be involved in the screening pilot with a matched group drawn from the remaining NHS boards.

The pilot in Scotland has been described elsewhere but in brief individuals aged 50–69 years and living in one of the three NHS board areas were sent a FOBT kit (hema-screen, Immunostics, Ocean, NJ, USA) by post to complete at home and then return to the central laboratory for analysis. This was a traditional style test consisting of six windows of filter paper impregnated with guaiac gum. Participants with 5 or 6 positive windows were offered colonoscopy. Those with 1–4 windows positive were asked to complete a further guaiac test and colonoscopy was offered to those with any one window positive. There were no dietary restrictions on the initial test. The pilot consisted of three rounds of biennial screening carried out between 2000 and 2007 (29 March 2000–31 December 2002, 2 December 2002–30 April 2005, and 6 May 2005–20 July 2007).

### Addendum guidelines for the prevention of peanut allergy in the United States: report of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases-sponsored expert panel [^fef19373]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Age of peanut introduction for severe eczema or egg allergy — For children with severe eczema, egg allergy, or both, the EP recommends that introduction of solid foods begins at 4 to 6 months of age, starting with solid food other than peanut; infants in the LEAP trial were enrolled between 4 and 11 months of age and benefited regardless of age at entry, so if the 4- to 6-month window is missed infants may still benefit, though older age at screening is associated with larger SPT wheals and a higher likelihood of established peanut allergy; a practical consideration is that at 4 to 6 months of age infants routinely visit for well-child evaluations and immunizations, offering an opportunity for evaluation and referral before dietary peanut introduction.

### Prevention of group B streptococcal early-onset disease in newborns: ACOG committee opinion, number 797 [^11b869a9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Prenatal culture-based screening timing and rationale state that studies suggest cultures predict colonization when collected within 5 weeks of birth and that predictive ability decreases significantly (P < .01) when the culture-to-birth interval is longer than 5 weeks; the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends performing universal GBS screening between 36 0/7 and 37 6/7 weeks of gestation because the use of antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended as a default for women with unknown GBS screening test results who give birth before 37 0/7 weeks of gestation and because this timing provides a 5-week window for valid culture results that include births that occur up to the gestational age of at least 41 0/7 weeks; in the United States, 1.9% of women give birth between 35 0/7 and 35 6/7 weeks of gestation versus 6.7% who give birth at 41 0/7 weeks of gestation or more; in clinical situations in which a pregnant woman at term does not give birth within this 5-week screening accuracy window, and whose original GBS screening culture was negative, repeat GBS screening is reasonable and may help guide management beyond 41 0/7 weeks of gestation.

### The effect of window rooms on critically ill patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage admitted to intensive care [^00f56366]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Analysis

We analyzed data on all patients with SAH and then two specific subgroups defined a priori: (1) patients admitted in the summer, with analysis of patients admitted during the days or months with more than 12 hours of daylight (March 17 through September 25, based on the 2000 calendar), as we hypothesized that this subgroup would allow for the greatest difference in exposure to light between the window and nonwindow groups; and (2) patients who had a worst Hunt-Hess score between grades I and III during their ICU stay, since these patients would be awake and therefore perhaps most likely to benefit from light exposure. We examined the baseline characteristics of the cohort, split by window status, including Hunt-Hess grade, modified Fisher scale grade, SAH sum score (defined as the amount of SAH in 10 individual cisterns or fissures on the admission CT scan, as well as and after an episode of rebleeding, quantified using previously described methodology), IVH severity score, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score. We also recorded events during the ICU stay, such as vasospasm (any angiographic evidence of vasospasm or specifically delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), defined as otherwise unexplained (1) clinical deterioration or (2) new infarct visualized on head CT that was not visible on the admission or immediate postoperative scan, or both). For the definition of vasospasm, other potential causes of clinical deterioration, such as hydrocephalus, rebleeding or seizures, were rigorously excluded. DCI was diagnosed by the treating study neurologist and confirmed in a retrospective review of each patient's clinical course by two additional study physicians. Evidence of arterial spasm based on transcranial Doppler sonography or angiography was generally used to support the diagnosis but was not mandatory. Other therapeutic interventions recorded included the need for aneurysm clipping or coiling, the use of vasopressors and the need for mechanical ventilation. We report the percentages, means with standard deviations (± SD) and medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs). Differences between groups were tested using a t -test, χ 2 test and/or Kruskal-Wallis test as appropriate. The primary outcomes were global functional status (mRS score), grouped as 0 to 3 (no to moderate disability) and 4 to 6 (severe disability or death) at hospital discharge, 3 months and 1 year. The previous mRS score was carried forward if the patient was still alive at the next follow-up time point but the mRS score was not available. The differences in primary outcomes were assessed using t -tests and then logistic regression analysis, adjusted for measured patient characteristics. The final model included only those variables with a difference of P < 0.25 between groups.

### Fulminant transfusion-associated hepatitis E virus infection despite screening, england, 2016–2020 [^7c5783ec]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Residual Risk for HEV Nondetection

The annual HEV incidence and estimated risk for nondetection fluctuated each year for apheresis and whole-blood donors (Table 2). For apheresis donors, estimates were highest in 2020 (incidence 2,052.7 and risk for nondetection 39.34 per 1 million donations tested), whereas estimates for whole-blood donors were highest when screening was first introduced in 2016 (incidence 2,401.9 and risk for nondetection 46.03 per 1 million donations tested). Risk for both groups of donors increased 2-fold if a window period of 14 days instead of 7 days was used. During the study period, the estimated risk, with a 7-day window period, predicted that 12 apheresis and up to 177 whole-blood donations positive for HEV RNA were not detected (Table 3); that prediction increased to 24 apheresis and 354 whole-blood donations positive when a 14-day window period was assumed.

### Suicide ideation and attempts in a pediatric emergency department before and during COVID-19 [^bfe337d1]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Elevated rates of mental health concerns have been identified during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In this study, we sought to evaluate whether youth reported a greater frequency of suicide-related behaviors during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic as compared with 2019. We hypothesized that rates of suicide-related behaviors would be elevated between the months of March and July 2020 as compared with 2019, corresponding to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods

Routine suicide-risk screening was completed with youth aged 11 to 21 in a pediatric emergency department. Electronic health records data for suicide-risk screens completed between January and July 2019 and January and July 2020 were evaluated. A total of 9092 completed screens were examined (mean age 14.72 years, 47.7% Hispanic and/or Latinx, 26.7% non-Hispanic white, 18.7% non-Hispanic Black).

Results

Rates of positive suicide-risk screen results from January to July 2020 were compared with corresponding rates from January to July 2019. Results indicated a significantly higher rate of suicide ideation in March and July 2020 and higher rates of suicide attempts in February, March, April, and July 2020 as compared with the same months in 2019.

Conclusions

Rates of suicide ideation and attempts were higher during some months of 2020 as compared with 2019 but were not universally higher across this period. Months with significantly higher rates of suicide-related behaviors appear to correspond to times when COVID-19-related stressors and community responses were heightened, indicating that youth experienced elevated distress during these periods.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^42deaf4e]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Identification and diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal — A. Identification: Recommendation I.1 states to "Incorporate universal screening for unhealthy alcohol use into medical settings using a validated scale to help identify patients with or at risk for alcohol use disorder and alcohol withdrawal". Recommendation I.2 instructs that for patients known to be using alcohol regularly, "assess their risk of developing alcohol withdrawal even in the absence of signs and symptoms". For patients with suggestive signs or symptoms, Recommendation I.3 directs to "assess the quantity, frequency, and time of day when alcohol was last consumed" and notes that "For this assessment, it may be helpful to" use "a scale that screens for unhealthy alcohol use", use "information from collateral sources (i.e., family and friends)", and "conduct a laboratory test that provides some measure of hepatic function". Recommendation I.4 adds that "A biological test (blood, breath, or urine) for alcohol use may be helpful for identifying recent alcohol use, particularly in patients unable to communicate or otherwise give an alcohol use history", to "consider the range of time (window of detection)", and "Do not rule out the risk of developing alcohol withdrawal if the result of a test is negative". Standard assessments cited "to identify patients at risk of alcohol withdrawal include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), CAGE, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Piccinelli Consumption (AUDIT-PC)", and in a retrospective case-control study "an initial AUDIT-PC score ≥ 4" identified patients who developed alcohol withdrawal "with 91% sensitivity and 90% specificity". The guideline notes universal screening "has been endorsed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)" and that "only 1 out of 6 patients have ever discussed their alcohol use with a health professional".

### Comparison of sales from vending machines with 4 different food and beverage messages: a randomized trial [^06a4e345]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Point-of-sale food messaging can encourage healthier purchases, but no studies have directly compared multiple interventions in the field.

Objective

To examine which of 4 food and beverage messages would increase healthier vending machine purchases.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized trial assessed 13 months (February 1, 2019, to February 29, 2020) of vending sales data from 267 machines and 1065 customer purchase assessments from vending machines on government property in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Data analysis was performed from March 5, 2020, to November 8, 2022.

Interventions

Study interventions were 4 food and beverage messaging systems: (1) beverage tax posters encouraging healthy choices because of the Philadelphia tax on sweetened drinks; (2) green labels for healthy products; (3) traffic light labels: green (healthy), yellow (moderately healthy), or red (unhealthy); or (4) physical activity equivalent labels (minutes of activity to metabolize product calories).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sales data were analyzed separately for beverages and snacks. The main outcomes analyzed at the transaction level were calories sold and the health status (using traffic light criteria) of each item sold. Additional outcomes were analyzed at the monthly machine level: total units sold, calories sold, and units of each health status sold. The customer purchase assessment outcome was calories purchased per vending trip.

Results

Monthly sales data came from 150 beverage and 117 snack vending machines, whereas 1065 customers (558 [52%] male) contributed purchase assessment data. Traffic light labels led to a 30% decrease in the mean monthly number of unhealthy beverages sold (mean ratio [MR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55–0.88) compared with beverage tax posters. Physical activity labels led to a 34% (MR, 0.66; 95% CI,0.51–0.87) reduction in the number of unhealthy beverages sold at the machine level and 35% (MR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50–0.86) reduction in mean calories sold. Traffic light labels also led to a 30-calorie reduction (b = −30.46; 95% CI, −49.36 to −11.56) per customer trip in the customer purchase analyses compared to physical activity labels. There were very few significant differences for snack machines.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this 13-month randomized trial of 267 vending machines, the traffic light and physical activity labels encouraged healthier beverage purchases, but no change in snack sales, compared with a beverage tax poster. Corporations and governments should consider such labeling approaches to promote healthier beverage choices.

### Safety and immunogenicity of the VI-DT typhoid conjugate vaccine in healthy volunteers in Nepal: an observer-blind, active-controlled, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial [^8af7e25a]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Results

Between Nov 20, 2019, and March 10, 2020, 1854 individuals aged 6 months to 45 years were screened, and 1800 were enrolled and randomly assigned to groups A, B, C, or D (450 participants to each group); all screening failures were due to pre-existing medical conditions (figure). The full analysis set included all 1800 participants, and the immunogenicity analysis set included 1786 participants (443 in group A, 450 in group B, 447 in group C, and 446 in group D). A total of 33 participants were excluded from the per-protocol analysis set; five were lost to follow-up, four withdrew consent, and 24 had major protocol deviations, mainly due to missing the follow-up visit at 4 weeks or attending this follow-up visit outside the predefined visit window (appendix 2 p 31). Most visits that occurred outside the predefined visit window were due to travel restrictions introduced by local government because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Defining an optimal time window to screen for hepatoblastoma in children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome [^7f1fbb63]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann spectrum (BWSp) undergo quarterly alpha-fetoprotein measurement for hepatoblastoma (HB) screening up to 4 years of age, paralleling the epidemiology of nonsyndromic HB. However, specific data on the timing of HB development in BWSp are lacking. Here we compare the timing of presentation of HBs in BWSp with a control cohort of consecutive HB cases, demonstrating that halving screening duration of screening procedures in BWSp likely will not impact its effectiveness.

### HTS384 NCI60: the next phase of the NCI60 screen [^4c2164e1]. Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

In April 1990, the fully operational NCI60 screen was rolled out. Initially, approximately 20,000 samples/year including pure small molecules, pure natural products, and partial isolate fractions of natural products were tested in concentration response. The mean graph display visualizing differential cell line response was developed as was the COMPARE pattern recognition methodology that could identify common response patterns across the cell lines, independent of the absolute potencies of the tested compounds. The mean graph patterns of cell line responses and COMPARE correlations were highly reproducible and enhanced understanding of potential cellular processes targeted by new agents. These advances facilitated studies of structure–activity relationships to direct chemical analog synthesis. For each of the last 5 years, approximately 6,000 compounds were tested in the NCI60 screen in a single concentration prescreen, of which, ∼20% met the criteria for further testing in the five-concentration screen (internal statistics from the Screening and Drug Prep Labs). In that same timeframe, more than 500 peer-reviewed publications have used NCI60 screen data and NCI60 cell line characteristics as a critical component of the study.

The NCI60 screen is moving into a new era. The cell lines remain the same; however, the format has been updated to a fully automated 384-well assay with a 3-day test agent exposure period and a luminescent endpoint for cell viability. This report enumerates some of the similarities and differences between the classic NCI60 screen and the new HTS384 NCI60 screen using a library of 1,003 FDA-approved anticancer drugs and investigational agents tested in both assays. In addition to generating a core set or baseline of data for the HTS384 screen, the patterns of cell line response from the HTS384 screen are compared with the cell line response data from the NCI60 classic screen. The library of 1,003 FDA-approved anticancer drugs and investigational agents were tested at the standard five concentrations used in the classic NCI60 screen to allow comparison of concentration response between the screens and so that targeted compound groups with well-established response patterns in both screens could be analyzed by COMPARE.

For the purpose of this study, the first screening round after the implementation of the screening program in both radiology units (RU1 and RU2) (prevalent round, all performed with SFM) was excluded from the analyses. We excluded the first round of the screening program because of its particular characteristics, such as the prevalence peak of cancer detection and the higher proportion of larger tumours, which could bias our results. Thus, we excluded all screening mammograms performed from November 1995 to December 1997 for RU1 and from January 1999 to December 2000 in RU2 (n = 20,010). Overall, 9 years were covered by SFM (from January 1998 to March 2007 — 9 years — in RU1, and from January 2001 to September 2004 — 3 years — in RU2). Similarly, the digital period covered 6 years (from March 2007 to December 2010 — 3 years — in RU1, and from September 2004 to December 2010 in RU2 — 6 years). Both radiology units cover two closed neighbourhoods in Barcelona and use the same screening protocol. The mammograms were read by the same radiologists.

Study variables

Information from screening (initial or successive screening, date of screening mammogram, further assessments, the use of SFM or FFDM, and the final outcome of screening) was obtained from the screening program database.

Age at diagnosis was obtained from the date of birth and date of the screening mammogram.

Tumour-related information (invasiveness, pathological tumour–node–metastasis [TNM] status and histological grade) was drawn from the hospital-based cancer registry.

### Fecal immunochemical test screening and risk of colorectal cancer death [^0272c6e5]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

The primary analysis examined the association of completing FIT screening during the 5-year period prior (beginning from January 2007 through January 2013) to the reference date with the risk of CRC death during 2011 to 2017. In all analyses, people who did not receive any recommended CRC screening tests or received a CRC test for an indication other than screening during the relevant observation window served as the reference category. We also considered both shorter and longer intervals prior to the reference date during which FIT plausibly could identify preclinical cancer or precancer (ie, detectable preclinical period [DPP]). Because of the relatively high sensitivity of FIT for identifying advanced adenomas, and because there is a greater threat to validity from underestimating than from overestimating the DPP duration, our analyses used a 5-year window as the primary approach.

Analyses were performed overall (primary analysis) and by colon and rectum location. Secondary analyses were performed by race and ethnicity because protection from FIT depends on receiving follow-up colonoscopy for abnormal test result and social factors influence follow-up colonoscopy completion.

In sensitivity analyses, we excluded people who had completed FIT screening before the relevant window due to the potential that people with prior negative FIT tests may represent a lower-risk population. Thus, in these additional analyses using the 5-year ascertainment window, we excluded people who completed FIT more than 5 years prior to the reference date. We also examined restrictions to people aged 55 years and older to maximize the available lookback period.

We evaluated both conditional and unconditional logistic regression analyses; given these yielded similar estimates, unconditional models were used to retain control persons for whom matched case persons were ineligible. The models were adjusted for matching variables (ie, age, sex, health plan membership duration, and geographic region), race and ethnicity, SES, comorbidity score, and wellness visits. All analyses were performed using the Stata statistical software version 18.0 (StataCorp). The threshold for significance was a 2-sided P < .05. Data analysis occurred from January 2002 to December 2017.

Yellow fever virus transmission seasonality — YF virus transmission in Africa is seasonal; in West Africa it increases during the middle of the rainy season (around August) and peaks during the early dry season (October), while in East Africa transmission is generally less predictable and, when it occurs, seasonality is similar to West Africa. In South America, the risk of infection by sylvatic vectors is greatest during the rainy season (January–May, with a peak incidence during February and March), and Ae. aegypti can transmit YF virus episodically in both rural and densely settled urban areas, even during the dry season.

### Temperature screening of healthcare personnel is ineffective in controlling COVID-19 [^51d0f2d7]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Our aim was to describe the effectiveness of employee temperature screening at a public hospital in San Francisco during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods

An estimated 6000 health care personnel (HCP) underwent daily screening before entry to campus. Logs of failed employee entrance temperature screenings from March 2020 through March 2021 were reviewed.

Results

From March 2020 through March 2021, only one employee, who reported no symptom that could bar their entry to work, had an elevated temperature on screening. On re-check with an oral thermometer, that individual's temperature was normal.

Conclusions

While the rationale to continue temperature screening may be rooted in beliefs it will increase employee reporting of symptoms or exposures, our results indicates that such screening of HCP at large US hospitals has no utility in detecting COVID-19 or controlling its transmission.

### Acute HIV infection in a patient with repeat HIV antibody / antigen negative results presenting at an urban emergency department: a Case report [^563973ed]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

It is not uncommon for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections to visit the emergency department (ED) during seroconversion. However, patients with newly acquired HIV may not have a reactive screening result. We report a case of a patient who initially screened reactive on a fourth generation HIV test and subsequently nonreactive twice, but ultimately had positive viral load tests.

Case Report

A 41-year-old woman experiencing symptoms of a sore throat, odynophagia, and back and flank pain for 5 days presented to the ED. The patient had a reactive HIV screen but negative confirmatory antibody test. The ED provider ordered a HIV viral load, informed the patient, and discharged with oral antibacterial agent. The patient returned the next day and after review of Visit 1 results, the ED provider ordered a second HIV screen, which had a nonreactive result. Another HIV viral load order was placed. The patient was discharged and returned a third time, 4 days after initial presentation. On this visit she was admitted, and the initial HIV viral load result returned positive. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? We report a case of a patient who initially screened reactive on a fourth generation HIV screening and then twice nonreactive on the same screening test, ultimately having positive viral loads. The most probable explanation for her series of atypical HIV results is that the patient presented during the p24 seroconversion window, which is graphically conveyed in Figure 1. If her first screening had been performed during the window, no further test would have been performed to rule out HIV, contributing to misdiagnosis. ED providers need to be aware that, at some time points during seroconversion from "negative" to "positive", patients recently infected with HIV and manifesting prodromal symptoms may nonetheless have a negative screening result.

Jet lag disorder — pharmacologic options and cautions: zolpidem and eszopiclone are options for treatment of jet lag disorder, but the half-lives of these drugs and their possible adverse effects should be considered before use. Antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and long-acting benzodiazepine receptor agonists should be avoided as they can worsen cognitive impairment, increase risk of falls, impair physical performance, and have gastrointestinal side effects. A figure of medications used to help sustain alertness or treat insomnia-related symptoms (not specific to the treatment of jet lag disorder) lists representative half-lives including melatonin 30–50 m, zaleplon ~1 h, zolpidem ~2.5 h, modafinil 15 h, and mirtazapine 20–40 h.

### Prepregnancy counseling: committee opinion no. 762 [^bd3e9689]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). High credibility.

Prepregnancy counseling — infertility evaluation and ovulation timing — states that an ovulatory woman younger than 35 years without a clearly identifiable risk factor for infertility should be expeditiously evaluated if not pregnant after 12 months of unprotected intercourse, whereas a woman who is 35 years and older should be evaluated after 6 months, with strong consideration for evaluation and treatment upon presentation for anovulatory women or those with a clearly identifiable risk factor. Referral to a fertility specialist for males and females may be considered at any point if the infertility etiology, indicated treatment, or attempted treatment failures exceeds the expertise of the obstetrician–gynecologist. Monthly ovulation is likely with regular and predictable menses with no greater than 2–3-day variance within a range of 25–35 days; cycles every 26–28 days are likely ovulatory, whereas cycles of 25, 34, 26, then 35 days are likely not ovulatory. Patients desiring pregnancy should be counseled that the fertile window is intercourse in the 3–4 days before ovulation and that intercourse every 1–2 days yields the highest pregnancy rates, and although patients may inquire about ovulation predictor kits or electronic apps, these tools vary in quality and data on usefulness are limited.

### The clinical and molecular landscape of breast cancer in women of African and south Asian ancestry [^11a1bad8]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We stratified each gAncestry cohort within Genomics England based on the central 60% of the age distribution, to improve equity between the cohorts in breast screening. Current guidelines apply at the 20th percentile in the EUR age distribution, so we placed the lower bound on the intervals at that percentile in the other gAncestries. We also increased the upper bound to the upper 20th percentile of the age distribution. This resulted in gAncestry-specific intervals: 50–75 years (EUR), 47–69 years (AFR) and 45–68 years (SAS) (Fig. 3c). With gAncestry not readily available in the clinic, we isolated patients with concordant SRE and gAncestry assignments and confirmed the applicability of these modified windows (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Applying the screening windows to BCN Biobank patients not dually-consented with Genomics England, gives better coverage for all three major ethnic groups: 67.4% (793/1176) within White patients, 64.8% (190/293) within Black patients and 70.5% (148/210) within Asian patients, and applying the suggested Asian age window to the G&H cohort would improve coverage from 26.4% (96/363) for the standard 50–70 window to 59.2% (215/363) within this group.

### Prevalence and predictors of surgical-site infection after caesarean section at a rural district hospital in Rwanda [^2151cf5e]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Study population and data collection

All women 18 years and older who underwent LSCS at KDH between 22 March and 18 October 2017 were eligible for the study. Patients from Mahama Refugee Camp were excluded because guidelines regulating refugees' movements hinder their ability to be followed after discharge. After LSCS and during hospitalization, study team members consented and enrolled eligible women to participate in the study. At the time of enrolment, a trained study data collector interviewed patients, collecting basic information on demographics and clinical history. After discharge, data collectors extracted clinical details from patients' files.

Patients were screened on POD 10 (± 3 days) by a GP for the presence of an SSI. This window was selected because the majority of SSIs develop between POD 5 and 10. Furthermore, timely identification of SSI is crucial for minimizing morbidity and mortality. Two study clinics were held each week. Patients were assigned to the first study clinic that fell within the POD-7–13 screening window. Patients still in hospital on the scheduled clinic date were assessed for SSI at the bedside. A woman discharged before her scheduled clinic date was given a transport voucher to be redeemed when she returned for screening. She was called a day before her clinic day as a reminder. If she missed her scheduled clinic day, a study team member attempted to call her and reschedule an appointment for the next study clinic, also within the POD-7–13 screening window. Women who missed two appointments were considered lost to follow-up, and excluded from the analysis.

The GP first administered a ten-question screening protocol assessing: increased pain since discharge, fever since discharge, erythema, oedema, induration, dehiscence, drainage from the wound, drainage with discolouration, drainage with a foul odour and drainage of pus (purulent discharge). The GP then conducted a physical examination. The diagnosis of SSI was based on the physical examination.

### Retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 among children in fulton county, Georgia, March 2020-June 2021 [^aefc73b7]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Similar to previous studies, we found when broader community incidence increases, incidence among all age groups increases suggesting community spread impacts children as well as adults; however, it is important to recognise increases in testing are commensurate with increases in community prevalence, a phenomenon that suggests testing volume may be a marker for increased COVID-19 community spread, exposure or risk-taking behaviour at the population level. Understanding the potential role children play in the COVID-19 pandemic and carefully monitoring case rates, testing rates and test positivity trends in children and the factors that drive transmissibility among children is critical.

Events over 2020 and the first half of 2021 can help explain points in time when we saw higher and lower rates of COVID-19 among children. All Fulton County schools closed on 10 March 2020 and did not reopen for the remainder of the academic year. The first large spike in paediatric cases, observed in late June to early July 2020, may be partially attributed to summer travel or children attending summer camps, particularly among children aged 14–18 years. During 17–20 June 2020, one overnight camp in Georgia resulted in 260 known cases of COVID-19; 51% of those aged 6–10 years and 44% of those aged 11–17 years were infected. Test results were only available for 58% of attendees, so the true impact of this outbreak was likely underestimated, but this outbreak was highly publicised and may have resulted in an acute precamp and postcamp testing surge. Additionally, on 8 July 2020, the mayor of Atlanta signed an executive order mandating the use of face masks in public spaces and also prohibited gatherings of more than ten people, factors known to reduce transmission of viruses. The potential impact of this order, together with other changes in travel patterns, may explain the downward trends observed from the end of July to September 2020. In September 2020, Fulton County schools began phasing-in in-person instruction in a hybrid format (ie, both in-person and virtual instruction options) and by 14 October 2020 full-time in-person instruction was offered but remained optional. Paediatric cases increased again substantially from early November 2020 to mid-January 2021, mirroring the trends observed in the larger community. Factors contributing to this winter surge may have included the return of in-person schooling, holiday travel and mixing of households' indoors and potentially unrecognised transmission of novel variants such as B.1.1.7, which was first identified in the USA in December 2020. Since the 2021 winter surge, paediatric cases declined through the start of June 2021 (the latest date for which this paper contains data). Availability and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines, which were available to all individuals in Georgia over the age of 16 years beginning 25 March 2021 and over the age of 12 years beginning 11 May 2021 may help explain some of the downward trend in COVID-19 incidence the county experienced.

### The association between suicide screening practices and attempts requiring emergency care in juvenile justice facilities [^e68c538b]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a national description of suicide screening practices in juvenile residential facilities and to examine their association with whether facilities experience a suicide attempt.

Method

Multivariate modeling with data from the 2000 Juvenile Residential Facility Census (n = 3690 facilities).

Results

Controlling for facility characteristics, screening the entire facility population within the first 24 hours after arrival is significantly linked to lower odds of serious suicide attempts (odds ratio 0.23–0.65). Facilities screening just some of their population in a 2- to 7-day window after arrival exhibited significantly higher odds of serious suicide attempts (odds ratio 1.30–4.73).

Conclusions

Results suggest that facility-level risks of serious suicide attempts may be reduced by screening every child and adolescent entering a juvenile justice facility within the 24-hour window directly following arrival, regardless of the facility size and whether the youths came directly from another facility within the system.

### Breast and lung cancer screening among Medicare enrollees during the COVID-19 pandemic [^30c7953d]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Several studies reported sharp decreases in screening mammography for breast cancer and low-dose computed tomographic screening for lung cancer in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a return to normal or near-normal levels in the summer of 2020.

Objective

To determine the observed vs expected mammography and low-dose computed tomographic scan rates from the beginning of the pandemic through April 2022.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this retrospective cohort study assessing mammography and low-dose computed tomography rates from January 2017 through April 2022, data for January 2016 to February 2020 were used to generate expected rates for the period March 2020 to April 2022. The study included a 20% national sample of Medicare fee-for-service enrollees among women aged 50 to 74 years for mammography, and men and women aged 55 to 79 years for low-dose computed tomographic scan.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Receipt of screening mammography or low-dose computed tomographic scan.

Results

The yearly cohorts for the mammography rates included more than 1 600 000 women aged 50 to 74 years, and the cohorts for the low-dose computed tomographic scan rates included more than 3 700 000 men and women aged 55 to 79 years. From January 2017 through February 2020, monthly mammography rates were flat, whereas there was a monotonic increase in low-dose computed tomographic scan rates, from approximately 500 per million per month in early 2017 to 1100 per million per month by January 2020. Over the period from March 2020 to April 2022, there were episodic drops in both mammography and low-dose computed tomographic scan rates, coincident with increases in national COVID-19 infection rates. For the periods from March 2020 to February 2020 and March 2021 to February 2022, the observed low-dose computed tomographic scan rates were 24% (95% CI, 23%-24%) and 14% (95% CI, 13%-15%) below expected rates, whereas mammography rates were 17% (95% CI, 17%-18%) and 4% (95% CI, 4%-3%) below expected.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, the decreases in cancer screening during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic did not resolve after the initial pandemic surges. Successful interventions to improve screening rates should address pandemic-specific reasons for low screening participation.

### Breast and lung cancer screening among Medicare enrollees during the COVID-19 pandemic [^600d5d66]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Figure 2.
Monthly Rates of Low-Dose Computed Tomographic (LDCT) Lung Cancer Screening Among Medicare Fee-for-Service Beneficiaries Aged 55 to 79 Years, From January 2017 to July 2022

We adjusted the monthly LDCT rates to 30 days/mo. The dotted prediction line was generated from the 38 months from January 2017 through February 2020. There were no significant changes in slope over that same period by joinpoint analyses. National COVID-19 infection rates are given starting in 2020. The slope of the regression line was an increase in 17.81 (95% CI 15.65–19.96) LDCTs per million enrollees per month. As with the mammography rates, there were periodic decreases in LDCT screening rates corresponding to increases in national COVID-19 care rates.

We calculated the observed and expected rates for mammography and LDCT for March 2020 to February 2021 and for March 2021 to February 2022, based on linear probability models generated from the 2017, 2018, and 2019 cohorts. As shown in Table 1, the observed mammography rate was 17% lower than expected (O/E ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.82–0.83) for the period March 2020 to February 2021. For March 2021 to February 2022, the rate for mammography was 4% lower (O/E ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.96–0.97).

### The clinical and molecular landscape of breast cancer in women of African and south Asian ancestry [^cbd44145]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our findings support the premise that current screening guidelines detect imbalanced proportions of BC between the gAncestry groups and that ethnicity–adapted screening windows would allow for greater equity in the screening process. This includes adjusting the screening range for non-EUR cohorts to start at a younger age. In the Genomics England cohort, these revised windows would be EUR 50–75 years (to detect 59.47% of BCs), AFR 47–69 years (to detect 61.31% of BCs) and SAS 45–68 years (to detect 59.35% of BCs). Applying these screening windows to BCN Biobank patients not dually-consented with Genomics England gives increased coverage — White 67.4% (793/1176), Black 64.8% (190/293) and Asian 70.5% (148/210) — as does applying these new windows to the G&H data improving from 26.4% (96/363) to 59.2% (215/363) within this group. The extra coverage in BCN Biobank patients could be explained by the potential effect of the socioeconomic factors (as represented by estimated IMD) for these groups compared to Genomics England.

The appropriate designation of a bespoke screening model, which would provide an indicative screening window and guide the modality to be used during the screen, requires the interplay of multiple complex factors, such as demographics, family history of inheritable cancers, mammographic density, previous benign breast conditions and the results of genetic testing for gAncestry-based susceptibility genes. Input from patient advocates and representation from social groups with low current uptake are also necessary to increase the penetrance of earlier intervention, working to reduce reluctance in seeking medical assistance or taking part in screening.

Literature associating TMB with gAncestry or ethnicity reports that AFR patients tend to have a higher TMB relative to EUR. The corresponding trend in Asian patients is equivocal, with reports of TMB being both higher and lower in this group relative to EUR –. This is likely due to the combination of the presence of EAS and SAS gAncestry within Asian study groups, with no distinction made between the two.

### Prevalence and trajectories of perinatal anxiety and depression in a large urban medical center [^bb6befed]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Results

The overall sample included 27 393 women who gave birth in our hospital system. We excluded 22 544 with no mental health screening, 508 with incomplete data, and 1290 with screening outside of the perinatal window (Figure 1). Our analyses focused on a sample of 3051 women (mean [SD] age, 34.3 [5.2] years; age range, 14–54 years) who completed mental health assessments within 1 year before or after delivery, with 850 assessments before March 2023 and 2415 assessments after March 2023; 214 women completed assessments both before and after March 2023. Twelve women (0.4%) were American Indian or Alaska Native, 497 (17.0%) were Asian, 321 (11.0%) were Black or African American, 482 (16.0%) were Hispanic or Latina, 1506 (51.0%) were White, 399 (13.0%) were other race, and 222 (7.5%) declined to answer. Most individuals were married (2329 patients [79.0%]), 2528 (83.0%) had no mental health visits, 403 (13.2%) had 1 to 10 mental health visits, 105 (3.4%) had 11 to 30 visits, and 15 (0.5%) had more than 30 visits. Most women delivered vaginally (1845 patients [60.6%]) or by cesarean delivery (1145 patients [38.0%]) (Table 1).

### Fulminant transfusion-associated hepatitis E virus infection despite screening, england, 2016–2020 [^05ef205b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Transfusion-Transmitted Infections

The NHSBT/UKHSA Epidemiology Unit collated data on all suspected transfusion-transmitted HEV infections reported to, and investigated by, NHSBT during the 5-year study period and reported them to SHOT. The outcomes of the investigations were determined to be confirmed, probable, or not transfusion-transmitted infection. We did not consider transmissions that had occurred before the introduction of HEV screening.

Residual Risk Calculations

To estimate residual risk of not detecting HEV RNA in apheresis and whole-blood donations, we applied the traditional window period method to HEV testing data. We assume that nondetection resulted from proximity to initial infection in a window period of HEV NAT screening. The number of apheresis and whole-blood donations tested and found positive for HEV RNA were available from NHSBT/UKHSA epidemiology surveillance for March 2016 through December 2020.

We assumed incidence to be equal to the rate of HEV RNA positivity among donors. To estimate risk, we multiplied incidence by the duration of the window period in years for HEV NAT by using 0.019 years (corresponding to 7 days) and 0.038 years (corresponding to 14 days). These parameters were based on expert opinion in the absence of any published values. We calculated risk for apheresis and whole-blood donations by year per million donations tested. To derive an approximate number of undetected HEV RNA-positive donations, we extrapolated risks to the estimated number of apheresis and whole-blood donations each year.

FIGURE 1
Changes in alcohol consumption outcomes: February to November 2020. Asterisks denote significant differences relative to February: ✱ p < 0.05; ✱✱ p < 0.01; ✱✱ p < 0.001.

Table 2 presents adjusted predicted values by month of analysis for key respondent groups for each of the 3 outcomes. For sex stratification, for example, the first row in Table 2 indicates that the average female respondent drank 12.0 drinks in February and increased to 17.4 in April. The bold text in that cell indicates that the April value is significantly larger than the February value. In addition, significant differences between groups in changes in outcomes from before to after the start of the pandemic are shaded. For example, the change in percentage exceeding drinking guidelines from February to April was significantly larger for females (30.0%−20.3% = 9.7%) compared with males (26.0%−23.1% = 2.9%). Overall, both females and males significantly increased drinks per month from February to April; this increase was sustained throughout November, and males kept consuming more drinks per month than females. Females showed sustained increases in exceeding drinking guidelines. The percentage of females who exceeded recommended guidelines significantly increased by 48%, 38%, and 54% from February to April, July, and November, respectively, with females surpassing males on this measure for all pandemic months, but not at baseline.

2.1 Study design and data sources

This study used nationwide data from all 57 diabetic eye screening programmes (DESPs) in England who must submit data quarterly according to a pre‐specified data set according to national guidance. The data were extracted directly using a Visual Basics for Application code from two approved DES management software suppliers in England, NEC OptoMizeand InHealth Intelligence Spectrato calculate programme performance levels against national standards.

Any programme‐identifiable data were removed before any analysis for this study. The data set contained aggregate data for all grading outcomes for the years 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020 and 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022, respectively, across all centres. NHS year quarters are defined as April–June, July–September, October–December and January–March for quarters 1 to 4 (Q1–Q4), respectively.

The 2019–2020 NHS year and its respective grading outcomes were the final year not impacted by the COVID‐19 pandemic and the 2021–2022 NHS year was the first year post‐COVID‐19 onset that risk‐stratified service changes implemented as part of the COVID‐19 response did not apply for the entire cohort of patients. Routine screening was stopped with the national lockdown on 16 March 2020 when there was an instruction to avoid all non‐essential contact. Data from the 2020–2021 NHS year were not included in the analysis of diabetic retinopathy levels because of risk stratification but were included in the analysis of referrals.

To identify whether the characteristics of those screened were different between the two time periods, data from the National Diabetes Audit(NDA) for 2019/2020 and 2021/2022 were analysed. This provides data on the people who have received eye screening using data recorded in primary care health records and from lists received by eye screening programmes. The standard annual NDA data collection time period is 1 January in year 1 to 31 March in year 2.

### Short-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a population-based screening program for colorectal cancer in catalonia (Spain) [^edb6bcba]. Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused the suspension at all levels of the Catalan FIT-based CRC screening program on March 12, 2020. Screening invitations to FIT were resumed on September 1, 2020. We aimed to assess the short-term impact of the pandemic and describe strategies implemented to minimize harm by the disruption of the FIT-based CRC screening in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona. We analyzed participation rate, colonoscopy adherence, time intervals to colonoscopy, detection rates, and advanced-stage cancers in 2019 and 2020. To identify perceived distress levels during the suspension of the screening we conducted a phone interview. As a result of the suspension, 43% of the individuals due for screening did not receive their invitation by December 31, 2020. A percent decrease of 5.1% in participation and of 8.9% in colonoscopy adherence among invitees between January-March was observed, with a recovery to 2019 levels when the screening activities were restarted. The time interval between a positive test to colonoscopy was longer in 2020 than in 2019. A decrease in advanced neoplasia rate and an increase in later stages of CRC were also observed. Individuals with a positive test did not report higher levels of perceived distress compared to those with a negative test. Although the disruption of screening had a temporary impact on participation and colonoscopy adherence, timing delay continues and a large backlog in the invitation of the target population remains. Thus, it is critical to implement strategies to minimize the long-term effects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Ethics approval and consent to participate.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nanchang Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute did not issue a number or ID card for the animal study because the poultry studied was not an endangered or protected species. Biological samples were collected directly from the oropharynx and cloaca of healthy chickens and ducks with the oral consent of poultry breeders.

Fieldwork.

Generally, the period from January to March 2020 is considered the outbreak period of China's COVID-19 epidemic. During this period, many provinces and cities in China experienced the control and deregulation of roads and communities. At the beginning of the outbreak in January 2020, many prefectures and cities began to close LPMs. Nanchang also closed the LPM at this time then opened various LPMs one at a time at the end of March. In this study, before the outbreak of the COVID-19 in 2019 and after the outbreak in 2020, we use a stratified random sampling method to select four counties and districts including Donghu, Xihu, and Qingshanhu districts and Xinjian county. We then choose an LPM in each county district as the site for annual monitoring, and all four selected markets were sampled every 2 months from February 2019 to December 2020. Because of the impact of the epidemic, we did not conduct sampling in February 2020. There are fewer live poultry stalls in retail markets than wholesale markets, and therefore we chose three retail markets and one wholesale market. In the live poultry retail market, the poultry sold at each stall is more complicated and includes many kinds of live poultry, such as chickens, ducks, and geese; live poultry slaughtered on-site are also sold, and there are more customers. However, in the wholesale market, only live poultry is sold, not slaughtered poultry; the live poultry sold in each stall is generally of one type; and there are fewer customers than in the retail market. For each sampling, multiple poultry sales stalls were selected in each LPM, seeking to include, if possible, all the stalls selling poultry in the market. We used sterile cotton swabs provided with commercial virus tubes to collect environmental and live poultry samples.

### The association of suicidal ideation with firearm purchasing during a firearm purchasing surge [^9e6cf3a2]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Throughout 2020 and 2021, the US experienced multiple tumultuous events, including a pandemic, contentious presidential and state elections, and a racial justice movement that arose in response to police brutality toward Black, Indigenous, and other racial and ethnic minority communities. During and perhaps in response to these events, the US also experienced a surge in firearm sales.

Although it is difficult to determine national firearm sales figures accurately, various groups have provided estimates. For instance, based on background check data, an estimated 2 million firearms were purchased in March 2020, and more than 2.5 million Americans became first-time gun owners during the early months of 2020. The surge in firearm sales continued throughout 2020, with an estimated 23 million firearms sold, an increase from 2019 (13.9 million firearms sold) and 2018 (13.8 million firearms sold). This surge is not only notable because of its scale but also because firearm access is associated with gun violence–related outcomes, including suicide.

Background check data provide a measurement of many legal firearm purchasing efforts; however, they do not necessarily equate to sales, thereby highlighting the need for data that more directly assesses purchasing behavior. Along these lines, a 2021 nationally representative studyfound that 6% of US residents purchased a firearm between March and mid-July 2020 (individuals purchasing firearms during the surge period), and of these, 34% were first-time purchasers, a rate higher than what is typical. Additionally, research to date examining individuals who purchased firearms for the first time during the surge period has found that nearly 40% of these individuals store at least 1 firearm unlocked, a concerning finding given the risk that accompanies unsafe storage (eg, suicide, unintentional shootings, theft).

### The implementation and public health impacts of cannabis legalization in Canada: a systematic review [^c9b8adde]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Paediatric cannabis‐related ED attendances

Myran et al. investigated changes in the rate of accidental cannabis poisonings in Ontario among 2.35 million children aged 0–9 years between 1 January 2016 and 31 March 2021. The study included three periods: before legalization (January 2016 to September 2018); the period after only flower products were legalized (October 2018 to January 2020); and the period after which commercial edibles were sold (February 2020 to March 2021). There were 522 ED visits attributable to cannabis in children during the study: 81 before legalization, 124 visits in the first period of legalization and 317 visits in the second phase. The proportion of cannabis‐related ED visits that required hospitalization significantly increased after edibles could be legally sold (122 versus 29 in the first period and 20 before legalization). Nineteen ED visits (3.6%) required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), but there were no deaths. Cannabis‐related ED visits increased from January 2016 to March 2021 in both the first (IRR = 3.13) and second (IRR = 9.12) periods. There was an increase in visits during the period when edibles could be sold compared to the preceding period when only flower could be sold (IRR = 2.23). This period coincided with the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic, which was more likely to have reduced than increased ED visits.
