## Question

Patient female with food poisoning and went to hospital with
troponin high NSTMI what is the management
A- aspirin 81 mg + ticagrelor
B- Aspirin 325 mg + ticagrelor
C- Aspirin 81 mg +Prasugrel
D- Aspirin 325 mg + prasugrel

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antiplatelet regimen is correct for a female patient with food poisoning who presented to the hospital with high troponin indicating non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and to choose among aspirin 81 mg plus ticagrelor, aspirin 325 mg plus ticagrelor, aspirin 81 mg plus prasugrel, or aspirin 325 mg plus prasugrel. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and immediate management priorities in NSTEMI. Then, I should verify the guideline-directed aspirin loading and maintenance doses. Next, I will review the choice of P2Y12 inhibitor and its loading dose. After that, I need to check for sex-specific considerations that might alter drug selection. Finally, I will synthesize the correct regimen and double-check for any contraindications or special cautions before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and the standard of care. Elevated troponin in the right clinical context establishes an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and if there is no new ST-segment elevation, this fits NSTEMI, for which dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor is foundational to reduce death and major adverse cardiovascular events, initiated as early as possible unless contraindicated [^111RpJCM] [^1146pKZu].

> Now, I need to verify the aspirin strategy. Guidelines consistently recommend an initial oral loading dose of aspirin 150–325 mg as soon as possible in ACS, followed by daily low-dose aspirin 75–100 mg for maintenance; higher maintenance doses are not superior and increase bleeding, so maintenance should be low-dose after the loading dose [^112mApaS] [^111uTUwG] [^112mApaS].

> Wait, let me verify the P2Y12 options and dosing. For NSTEMI, ticagrelor 180 mg loading dose then 90 mg twice daily is a preferred option, and prasugrel 60 mg loading dose then 10 mg daily is also acceptable in appropriate candidates; both are supported by contemporary ACS guidelines, with ticagrelor often favored for its faster, more potent and reversible inhibition, though prasugrel is reasonable when ticagrelor is not suitable or unavailable [^111RpJCM] [^116xLPsx].

> Hold on, I should verify sex-specific considerations. Prasugrel carries a higher bleeding risk and is generally avoided in patients with prior stroke/TIA and used with caution in older adults; importantly, there is no guideline-based sex-specific contraindication to prasugrel in women with ACS, so female sex alone does not preclude its use, though individualized bleeding risk assessment is prudent [^1146pKZu].

> Let me consider the provided choices carefully. Options proposing aspirin 81 mg as the initial dose omit the required loading dose in ACS, so those are incomplete for the acute phase; options pairing high-dose aspirin maintenance with ticagrelor conflict with evidence that low-dose aspirin maintenance is preferred due to similar efficacy and less bleeding, and with the concern that higher aspirin doses may blunt ticagrelor's benefits in some populations, reinforcing the preference for low-dose maintenance after a standard loading dose [^111uTUwG] [^1146pKZu].

> I should double-check the correct synthesis. The guideline-concordant regimen is aspirin 162–325 mg loading dose immediately, followed by aspirin 75–100 mg daily maintenance, plus a P2Y12 inhibitor such as ticagrelor 180 mg loading dose then 90 mg twice daily, or prasugrel 60 mg loading dose then 10 mg daily if appropriate; among the listed choices, the closest correct option is aspirin 325 mg plus ticagrelor, recognizing that the aspirin dose here functions as the loading dose and should be followed by low-dose aspirin maintenance thereafter [^112GXxZp] [^111uTUwG] [^112mApaS].

> But wait, what if the question intends to reflect maintenance dosing only? Even then, maintenance aspirin should be 75–100 mg, not 325 mg, and pairing low-dose aspirin with ticagrelor is preferred over high-dose aspirin because of bleeding considerations and potential interactions; thus, if forced to pick a maintenance-only representation, aspirin 81 mg plus ticagrelor would be more appropriate than aspirin 325 mg plus ticagrelor, though strictly speaking the question should include the loading dose for completeness in ACS [^111uTUwG] [^1146pKZu].

> Final answer: Option B, aspirin 325 mg plus ticagrelor, is the best choice among the listed alternatives because it captures the required aspirin loading dose and pairs it with ticagrelor, which is guideline-endorsed for NSTEMI; clinically, this should be followed by aspirin 75–100 mg daily for maintenance after the loading dose to minimize bleeding risk while preserving efficacy [^112GXxZp] [^111uTUwG] [^112mApaS].

---

The correct answer is **B. Aspirin 325 mg + ticagrelor**. For NSTEMI, give **aspirin 162–325 mg loading dose** [^112GXxZp] [^111uTUwG] followed by 75–100 mg daily [^112mApaS], and add a P2Y12 inhibitor (ticagrelor 180 mg load, then 90 mg twice daily) [^111RpJCM]. Prasugrel is not preferred initially due to higher bleeding risk and is contraindicated in patients with prior stroke/TIA or high bleeding risk; low-dose aspirin alone is inadequate in the acute setting [^1146pKZu].

---

## Rationale for antiplatelet therapy in NSTEMI

Antiplatelet therapy is essential in NSTEMI to reduce platelet aggregation, thrombus formation, and recurrent ischemic events [^112GXxZp]. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor is **standard of care** [^111RpJCM].

---

## Aspirin dosing in NSTEMI

- **Loading dose**: 162–325 mg orally as soon as possible on presentation [^112mApaS] [^111uTUwG] [^116BDFA4].
- **Maintenance dose**: 75–100 mg daily thereafter [^112GXxZp] [^111uTUwG] [^112mApaS].
- **Rationale**: Higher loading doses ensure rapid platelet inhibition; maintenance at 75–100 mg balances efficacy and bleeding risk [^113nhQre] [^111zWgQn].

---

## Choice of P2Y12 inhibitor

Ticagrelor and prasugrel are both effective P2Y12 inhibitors, but they have **distinct pharmacologic profiles and clinical considerations**:

| **Attribute** | **Ticagrelor** | **Prasugrel** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Reversible, non-competitive inhibition of P2Y12 receptor | Irreversible, active metabolite inhibits P2Y12 receptor |
| Loading dose | 180 mg | 60 mg |
| Maintenance dose | 90 mg twice daily | 10 mg daily |
| Bleeding risk | Moderate | Higher |
| Contraindications | None specific | Prior stroke/TIA, high bleeding risk |
| Clinical outcomes | Reduced cardiovascular events, but increased dyspnea and minor bleeding | Greater platelet inhibition, but higher bleeding risk |

---

Given this profile, **ticagrelor is preferred** for initial therapy in NSTEMI due to its favorable balance of efficacy and safety, especially in patients without contraindications to DAPT [^112GXxZp] [^111uTUwG].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The 2023 ESC guidelines recommend initiating **aspirin with a loading dose of 150–300 mg**, followed by a maintenance dose of 75–100 mg daily, and adding a P2Y12 inhibitor (ticagrelor or prasugrel) for DAPT [^112GXxZp]. The 2025 ACC/AHA guidelines similarly recommend an initial aspirin loading dose of 162–325 mg, followed by daily low-dose aspirin, with ticagrelor as the preferred P2Y12 inhibitor [^111uTUwG] [^112mApaS].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

Female sex alone **does not alter the standard antiplatelet regimen** for NSTEMI. However, individualized assessment of bleeding risk, comorbidities, and medication interactions is essential [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Aspirin loading dose**: 162–325 mg orally as soon as possible [^112mApaS] [^111uTUwG] [^116BDFA4].
- **Aspirin maintenance dose**: 75–100 mg daily [^112GXxZp] [^111uTUwG] [^112mApaS].
- **P2Y12 inhibitor**: Ticagrelor 180 mg loading dose, followed by 90 mg twice daily [^116xLPsx] [^111RpJCM].
- **Prasugrel**: Not preferred initially due to higher bleeding risk; consider only if ticagrelor is contraindicated or unavailable [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and final answer

The correct answer is **B. Aspirin 325 mg + ticagrelor**. This regimen aligns with current clinical guidelines, providing rapid, effective platelet inhibition while balancing bleeding risk. Prasugrel is not preferred initially due to higher bleeding risk, and low-dose aspirin alone is inadequate in the acute setting [^111RpJCM] [^111uTUwG] [^112mApaS].

USPSTF aspirin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) states: For adults aged 40 to 59 years with an estimated 10% or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in this group should be an individual one (Grade: C). For adults 60 years or older, do not initiate aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD (Grade: D). This applies to adults 40 years or older without signs or symptoms of CVD or known CVD and who are not at increased risk for bleeding.

Recommendations of others — The ACC/AHA recommends that low-dose aspirin use (75 to 100 mg/d) might be considered for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD among select adults aged 40 to 70 years at higher CVD risk but not at increased risk of bleeding. Low-dose aspirin use is not recommended on a routine basis for primary prevention of CVD in adults older than 70 years or among adults of any age who are at increased risk of bleeding.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — aspirin prophylaxis recommendations and dosing — In recent trials, the estimated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk has exceeded observed risk during follow-up, supporting a lower class of recommendation with removal of a specific PCE threshold; accordingly, a Class IIb recommendation remains more suitable than a Class III recommendation for adults 40 to 70 years of age. Given the narrow balance of benefits and harms, there is limited justification to use aspirin at doses > 100 mg daily for primary prevention; meta-analyses suggest the ASCVD risk benefit for low-dose aspirin is equivalent to that for high-dose aspirin, but the bleeding risk is higher with high-dose aspirin, and low-dose prophylactic aspirin may be best justified among persons at high ASCVD risk who cannot achieve optimal control of other ASCVD risk factors.

Importance

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the US, accounting for more than 1 in 4 deaths. Each year, an estimated 605 000 people in the US have a first myocardial infarction and an estimated 610 000 experience a first stroke.

Objective

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on the effectiveness of aspirin to reduce the risk of CVD events (myocardial infarction and stroke), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in persons without a history of CVD. The systematic review also investigated the effect of aspirin use on colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality in primary CVD prevention populations, as well as the harms (particularly bleeding) associated with aspirin use. The USPSTF also commissioned a microsimulation modeling study to assess the net balance of benefits and harms from aspirin use for primary prevention of CVD and CRC, stratified by age, sex, and CVD risk level.

Population

Adults 40 years or older without signs or symptoms of CVD or known CVD (including history of myocardial infarction or stroke) who are not at increased risk for bleeding (eg, no history of gastrointestinal ulcers, recent bleeding, other medical conditions, or use of medications that increase bleeding risk).

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk has a small net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 60 years or older has no net benefit.

Recommendation

The decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual one. Evidence indicates that the net benefit of aspirin use in this group is small. Persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily are more likely to benefit. (C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults 60 years or older. (D recommendation).

Aspirin — efficacy and dose context in high-risk patients is summarized as follows: On the basis of > 100 randomized trials in high-risk patients, aspirin reduces vascular death by ∼15% and nonfatal vascular events by ∼30%. Complete or near-complete inhibition of platelet COX-1 can be achieved with low doses of aspirin (75–150 mg) given once daily, whereas 10- to 100-fold higher daily doses are required when the drug is used as an antiinflammatory agent rather than as an antiplatelet agent, and the benefit/risk profile of aspirin depends on dose because its GI toxicity is dose dependent.

### Aspirin: latest evidence and developments [^1174qCkh]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is a foundation drug of the pharmaceutical industry originally derived as an analgesic/anti-inflammatory agent but serendipitously discovered to have use as a prophylactic drug for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Its modern-day utility in this latter role relies on its efficacy/safety balance in a contemporary population where, at least in high-income countries, age-standardised incident rates for MACE are falling, and where there are now competing therapeutic agents. Its future may be determined by its potential role as a chemoprophylactic or adjunct agent for cancer or other disease states. It therefore will continue to be the subject of further clinical research.

For those already taking aspirin, 'Persons who are currently taking aspirin and have questions about whether they should continue or discontinue aspirin use, should discuss these questions with their clinician. Persons who are taking aspirin should not discontinue using it without consulting their clinician'. The USPSTF also notes it 'did not review the emerging evidence on the effect of aspirin on COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2'.

Antiplatelet Therapy

Primary Prevention

Aspirin

Unlike secondary prevention, data regarding the use of aspirin in the primary prevention of ASCVD is equivocal. Most early data came from the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration, which evaluated 95 456 patients from 6 clinical trials. Treatment with aspirin was associated with a small reduction in serious vascular events but carried a small increase in the rates of major gastrointestinal and extracranial bleeding. More recently, other studies have called into question the value of aspirin in primary prevention. – Finding an appropriate balance between preventing vascular events and exposing individuals to an increased bleeding risk with aspirin therapy remains an area of active research.

Current ACC/AHA guidelines recommend the use of low‐dose aspirin for primary prevention, as listed in Table 3. Because guideline recommendations and data vary, –, treatment with aspirin should be individualized based on the patient's risk–benefit profile.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117FjWeB]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF aspirin use for primary prevention — Implementation specifies to consider the patient's age. For adults aged 40 to 59 years, estimate CVD risk using a CVD risk estimator and, in patients whose estimated CVD risk is 10% or greater, use shared decision-making to inform the decision about initiating aspirin. For patients initiating aspirin use, it would be reasonable to use a dose of 81 mg/d. For adults 60 years or older, do not initiate aspirin for primary prevention of CVD. For potential discontinuation, for patients who are eligible and choose to start taking aspirin, the benefits become smaller with advancing age, and data suggest that clinicians and patients should consider stopping aspirin use around age 75 years.

### Chemoprevention of lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1162jNyE]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Aspirin — individuals at risk for lung cancer or with a history of lung cancer: the use of aspirin is not recommended for primary, secondary, or tertiary prevention of lung cancer (outside of the setting of a well-designed clinical trial) (Grade 1B). Evidence includes a study in which the relative risk (RR) of lung cancer in the aspirin group was 0.78 and did not reach statistical significance, and a meta-analysis that found a 20% to 30% reduction in lung-cancer mortality in people taking daily aspirin for 5 or more years; however, these data do not adequately address the balance of risks and benefits of aspirin in view of well-documented GI and bleeding side effects.

### Aspirin, 110 years later [^117LwW86]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Although conceived at the end of the 19th century as a synthetic analgesic agent with improved gastric tolerability vs. naturally occurring salicylates, acetylsalicylic acid (marketed as aspirin in 1899) turned out to be an ideal antiplatelet agent about 90 years later, following the understanding of its mechanism of action, the development of a mechanism-based biomarker for dose-finding studies, and the initiation of a series of appropriately sized, randomized clinical trials to test its efficacy and safety at low doses given once daily. At the turn of its 110th anniversary, aspirin continues to attract heated debates on a number of issues including (i) the optimal dose to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity; (ii) the possibility that some patients may be 'resistant' to its antiplatelet effects; and (iii) the balance of benefits and risks in primary vs. secondary prevention.

### Aspirin therapy in primary cardiovascular disease prevention: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology working group on thrombosis [^112wYM4j]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Although the use of oral anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists) has been abandoned in primary cardiovascular prevention due to lack of a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio, the indications for aspirin use in this setting continue to be a source of major debate, with major international guidelines providing conflicting recommendations. Here, we review the evidence in favor and against aspirin therapy in primary prevention based on the evidence accumulated so far, including recent data linking aspirin with cancer protection. While awaiting the results of several ongoing studies, we argue for a pragmatic approach to using low-dose aspirin in primary cardiovascular prevention and suggest its use in patients at high cardiovascular risk, defined as ≥ 2 major cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) projected per 100 person-years, who are not at increased risk of bleeding.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116PX8t1]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Biological understanding of aspirin's effects — mechanistic benefits and risks are summarized: 'At lower doses, aspirin is an irreversible cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme inhibitor. At higher doses, aspirin also inhibits COX-2'. Aspirin 'reduces the risk for atherothrombosis through the inhibition of platelet function (through COX-1 inhibition) and has been used widely for the prevention of CVD events, particularly for secondary prevention'. However, 'The COX-1 enzyme is also responsible for producing a variety of prostaglandins that protect the gastrointestinal mucosa. By inhibiting this enzyme, aspirin use can promote gastrointestinal bleeding'. The page also notes that 'The mechanism for the possible antineoplastic effects of aspirin is not as well understood'.

### 2018 guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113M56Gx]. Stroke (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke — aspirin timing after onset and after IV alteplase: Administration of aspirin is recommended in patients with AIS within 24 to 48 hours after onset. For those treated with IV alteplase, aspirin administration is generally delayed until 24 hours later but might be considered in the presence of concomitant conditions for which such treatment given in the absence of IV alteplase is known to provide substantial benefit or withholding such treatment is known to cause substantial risk. The recommendation was modified from the previous guideline to remove the specific dosing recommendation, "initial dose is 325 mg", because previous clinical trials supporting its use for AIS included doses of 160 to 300 mg.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2023). High credibility.

Aspirin around CABG — guideline-based recommendations and dosing note that 'In patients undergoing CABG who are already taking daily aspirin preoperatively, it is recommended that they continue taking aspirin until the time of surgery to reduce ischemic events' (Class 1, Level of Evidence: B-R), and 'In patients undergoing CABG, aspirin (100–325 mg daily) should be initiated within 6 hours postoperatively and then continued indefinitely to reduce the occurrence of SVG closure and adverse cardiovascular events' (Class 1, Level of Evidence: A). The page states the guideline 'specifies an aspirin dose of 100–325 mg', that 'Aspirin (81 mg) is widely used by many clinicians after CABG and PCI because this dose is associated with less bleeding', and that 'a dose of aspirin 81 mg daily meets the requirements for this performance measure'. For elective cases not already on aspirin, 'the initiation of daily aspirin in the immediate preoperative period (< 24 h before surgery) is not recommended'.

### Aspirin and cancer [^117Ev6Rb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The place of aspirin in primary prevention remains controversial, with North American and European organizations issuing contradictory treatment guidelines. More recently, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended "initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years". This recommendation reflects increasing evidence for a chemopreventive effect of low-dose aspirin against colorectal (and other) cancer. The intent of this paper is to review the evidence supporting a chemopreventive effect of aspirin, discuss its potential mechanism(s) of action, and provide a conceptual framework for assessing current guidelines in the light of ongoing studies.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 743 summary: low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy [^115NaN1U]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin has been used during pregnancy, most commonly to prevent or delay the onset of preeclampsia. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued the Hypertension in Pregnancy Task Force Report recommending daily low-dose aspirin beginning in the late first trimester for women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia and preterm delivery at less than 34 0/7 weeks of gestation, or for women with more than one prior pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force published a similar guideline, although the list of indications for low-dose aspirin use was more expansive. Daily low-dose aspirin use in pregnancy is considered safe and is associated with a low likelihood of serious maternal, or fetal complications, or both, related to use. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine support the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guideline criteria for prevention of preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) prophylaxis is recommended in women at high risk of preeclampsia and should be initiated between 12 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation (optimally before 16 weeks) and continued daily until delivery. Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis should be considered for women with more than one of several moderate risk factors for preeclampsia. Women at risk of preeclampsia are defined based on the presence of one or more high-risk factors (history of preeclampsia, multifetal gestation, renal disease, autoimmune disease, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and chronic hypertension) or more than one of several moderate-risk factors (first pregnancy, maternal age of 35 years or older, a body mass index greater than 30, family history of preeclampsia, sociodemographic characteristics, and personal history factors). In the absence of high risk factors for preeclampsia, current evidence does not support the use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin for the prevention of early pregnancy loss, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, or preterm birth.

### Aspirin resistance: moving forward with multiple definitions, different assays, and a clinical imperative [^114EyQfm]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients are treated with aspirin to prevent a serious vascular event, most notably myocardial infarction and stroke. A growing number of studies have been appearing in the literature that indicate a significant fraction of aspirin-treated patients may be resistant to the antiplatelet effects of the drug. Resistance to aspirin may be related to the concomitant ingestion of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which impairs the aspirin effect, or to more complex situations, such as metabolic defects that diminish the therapeutic effect of aspirin. The incidence of aspirin resistance is unknown, but it may approach 20% to 30%. The diagnosis of aspirin resistance has been evaluated using multiple assays, and because there are multiple assays, this has resulted in multiple definitions for aspirin resistance. This review considers aspirin resistance at a time when there is confusion about the definition, and the clinical assay to best assess it, because there is a clinical imperative to know now which patients taking aspirin are not receiving a therapeutic effect.

### Individual and population benefits of daily aspirin therapy: a proposal for personalizing national guidelines [^116WnXHV]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines that help clinicians and patients to understand the magnitude of expected individual risks and benefits would help with patient-centered decision-making and prioritization of care. We assessed the net benefit from taking daily aspirin to estimate the individual and public health implications of a more individualized decision-making approach.

Methods and Results

We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey representing all US persons aged 30 to 85 years with no history of myocardial infarction and applied a Markov model based on randomized evidence and published literature to estimate lifetime effects of aspirin treatment in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We found that treatment benefit varies greatly by an individual's cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Almost all adults have fewer major clinical events on aspirin, but for most, events prevented would be so rare that even a very small distaste for aspirin use would make treatment inappropriate. With minimal dislike of aspirin use (disutility, 0.005 QALY per year), only those with a 10-year cardiac event risk > 6.1% would have a net benefit. A disutility of 0.01 QALY moves this benefit cut point to 10.6%. Multiple factors altered the absolute benefit of aspirin, but the strong relationship between CVD risk and magnitude of benefit was robust.

Conclusions

The benefits of aspirin therapy depend substantially on an individual's risk of CVD and adverse treatment effects. Understanding who benefits from aspirin use and how much can help clinicians and patients to develop a more patient-centered approach to preventive therapy.

### Overview of aspirin and platelet biology [^112Qn4i5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aspirin (ASA) has historically been one of the most important drugs in cardiology and has long been the cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy. Although its role in acute coronary syndrome remains undisputed, emerging data suggest that reappraisal of the efficacy of long-term ASA in some primary and secondary prevention may be warranted. The aim of this review is to place these new results in the context of previous evidence on aspirin by appraising the current body of evidence on its use of for cardiovascular diseases. This overview first summarizes the history of the discovery of aspirin, as well as its pharmacology and the concept of ASA resistance. We subsequently recapitulate the evidence of ASA on primary prevention and secondary prevention starting from the classical studies in order to serve as an introductory background to the examination of the most recent clinical trials that will be performed in the rest of the articles of this Supplement. Although the benefit of ASA in acute coronary syndrome remains incontrovertible, emerging evidence challenge the universal need for primary prevention, or for lifelong treatment in secondary prevention or all adults with stable coronary disease who are at highest risk for ASA-induced bleeding. The role of aspirin is quickly changing in recent times and this review provides a review for the clinician about the current role of this drug in cardiovascular care.

### Aspirin resistance: current status and role of tailored therapy [^112C9Ryz]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Aspirin is integral in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndrome. Given the high clinical importance of aspirin in the management of coronary artery disease, much attention has been directed towards the concept of "aspirin resistance". Unfortunately, the term aspirin resistance is ill-defined in the literature, leading to a large variance in the reported prevalence of this phenomenon. In this review, the current understanding of aspirin resistance is discussed. Commonly used functional and diagnostic tests of platelet function, including their strengths and weakness, are reviewed. We next discuss several proposed mechanisms of aspirin resistance and special high-risk groups at risk for aspirin treatment failure. We then discuss optimal dosing and diagnostic strategies for those populations at risk for aspirin resistance with a focus on tailored aspirin therapy for high-risk groups. Finally, future topics of interest in the field of aspirin resistance are considered.

### Low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: use patterns and impact across race and ethnicity in the Southern community cohort study [^115PYzAp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, the role of low‐dose aspirin in the general population without CVD remains controversial. The USPSTF 2016 guidelines narrowed the recommendations to high‐risk individuals aged 50 to 69 years, removed the previous distinction by sex, and downgraded the recommendation from grade A to grade B for the group aged 50 to 59 years and to grade C for the group aged 60 to 69 years. Along the same lines, an overview of systematic reviews concluded that high‐quality evidence supports aspirin for primary CVD prevention. 3 In contrast, and as supported by several meta‐analyses and clinical trials suggesting no benefit of low‐dose aspirin and/or a potential increase in severe bleeding risk, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 the "2016 European Guidelines on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Clinical Practice" stated that antiplatelet therapy is not recommended in individuals without CVD. 44 Based on recent trials showing no net benefit, 45, 46, 47 the 2019 American College of Cardiology and AHA "Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease" recommends that low‐dose aspirin should be used infrequently in the routine primary prevention of CVD. 48 Our study suggests that the effect of low‐dose aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD may differ by race/ethnicity, raising the possibility of no benefit among black patients. There are no plausible reasons to think that low‐dose aspirin might be harmful to black patients. Therefore, the trend toward increased risk of ischemic cardiac death shown in particular subgroups of black low‐dose aspirin users in this observational study might be due to residual confounding (ie, black participants on low‐dose aspirin might have been identified as having higher CVD risk in a manner somehow not fully accounted for in the models).

### Primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^111zWgQn]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Aspirin dosing and bleeding risk in established coronary artery disease (CAD) indicate no added efficacy with higher doses and increased bleeding with very high doses. Across different daily doses of aspirin (50–1,500 mg vs 160–325 mg vs 75–150 mg vs < 75 mg), direct comparisons of high- vs low-dose aspirin found no significant differences, and uncertainty remains for aspirin < 75 mg versus ≥ 75 mg; indirect comparisons found no evidence that high doses (eg, ≥ 160 mg/d) are more effective than 75 to 160 mg. A 2007 systematic review identified eight prospective trials including nearly 10,000 patients taking aspirin 30 to 1,300 mg/d, in which a significant benefit of higher doses was not identified and, in most, the lowest event rates were seen in lower-dose groups. Regarding bleeding, a review including > 190,000 patients in 31 randomized controlled trials found aspirin > 200 mg associated with an ~30% increase in major bleeding compared with doses < 200 mg (P = 0.05), and nonmajor bleeding increased in patients receiving 100 to 200 mg of aspirin per day compared with < 100 mg/d; the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration found no difference in major extracranial bleed across < 75, 75–150, and 160–325 mg compared with placebo, and did not comment on > 325 mg. Taken together, these findings provide moderate-quality evidence to support the use of aspirin 75 to 100 mg/d for patients with established CAD.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease? [^115oPnCm]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality.1 For example, in 2000, it accounted directly for around 2 million deaths in the European Union. Worldwide, many people take aspirin daily in the belief that doing so helps to prevent CVD. This approach is established for the secondary prevention of recurrent vascular events. However, there has been some uncertainty about the place of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.6 In particular, there have been doubts about whether any benefits of aspirin in people with no history of CVD outweigh the risks (e.g. the fact that long-term low-dose aspirin therapy almost doubles the likelihood of gastrointestinal haemorrhage). Here we consider the place of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention of CVD.

### Questions regarding future research on aspirin and the gastrointestinal tract [^114pjVus]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Despite great proven and potential benefits, aspirin also has adverse side effects on all parts of the gastrointestinal tract including ulceration, bleeding, perforation, and stenosis. Because of widespread and growing use, there is a need to understand and, if possible, prevent the adverse effects of aspirin while maintaining its benefits. This article is part of a report from a consensus meeting in 1999 on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and examines possible mechanisms of each of the risks of normal and low-dose aspirin use including areas of uncertainty. Based on these issues, we recommend studies that would further clarify the actions of aspirin. We also examine various strategies that might be used to prevent or mitigate adverse effects. Finally, we propose future research prospects in the search for a safer aspirin.

### Clinician's guide to the updated ABCs of cardiovascular disease prevention [^111MesTc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Aspirin

Clear support exists for the use of aspirin in the secondary prevention of CVD. The most convincing results come from the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration, in which ≈17 000 high‐risk patients randomized to low‐dose aspirin versus placebo were found to have a significant reduction in major vascular events (6.7% versus 8.2% per year), stroke (2.1% versus 2.5%), and coronary events (4.3% versus 5.3%). A subsequent meta‐analysis involving ≈135 000 patients at high risk for occlusive vascular events demonstrated risk reduction of ≈25% in serious vascular events with aspirin or other oral antiplatelet therapy.

For patients who undergo coronary revascularization, lifelong aspirin therapy is strongly recommended. Traditionally, higher doses of aspirin have been used for at least 1 month after percutaneous revascularization. Recently, 2 large clinical trials (CURRENT‐OASIS 7 [Clopidogrel Optimal Loading Dose Usage to Reduce Recurrent EveNTs/Optimal Antiplatelet Strategy For Interventions] and TRITON‐TIMI 38 [Trial To Assess Improvement In Therapeutic Outcomes By Optimizing Platelet Inhibition With Prasugrel]) did not show greater efficacy with high‐dose (325 mg/d) versus low‐dose (75 to 100 mg/d) aspirin therapy. – Moreover, there is a US Food and Drug Administration black box warning against the concurrent use of high‐dose aspirin with ticagrelor. This warning is based on a significant geographic‐treatment interaction in the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes trial (PLATO), with less efficacy with ticagrelor among patients enrolled in North America potentially due to more frequent use of high‐dose aspirin. Consequently, most secondary prevention patients are more appropriately treated with low‐dose aspirin therapy (< 100 mg/d).

The term aspirin resistance has been used increasingly in clinical studies. The aim of this Review is to analyze the origin of this term, to discuss the biochemical, functional and clinical correlates of the phenomenon and to offer a conceptual framework to redefine the major determinants of variability between individuals in response to aspirin. Awareness needs to be increased of factors that might interfere with the desired antiplatelet effect of aspirin, particularly in terms of patients' adherence to treatment and avoidable drug interactions with some traditional NSAIDs. Gaining such knowledge could result in improved care of patients and might avoid the requesting of unnecessary platelet function tests of unproven clinical significance.

### Cost-effectiveness of a statewide campaign to promote aspirin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^117DJzLT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Aspirin use

We derived population‐based aspirin use data from the primary prevention, self‐reported, and biochemically validated aspirin use survey administered as part of a contemporary Minnesota regional aspirin use study. 26, 42 At baseline, 36% of primary prevention candidates reported regular use of aspirin, defined as taking aspirin daily or every other day. At 4 months after initiation of the campaign, regular aspirin use increased to 54%. This increase was sustained at 18 months and was greater than nonintervention temporal trends. In the current study, the campaign's main impact was through increased aspirin use. We used a conservative assumption that aspirin use would increase annually by 5 percentage points for 3 years from 36% to 51% in both the male and female cohorts. In the sensitivity analysis, we further examined the contribution from the length of campaign impact by assuming the campaign effect would continue for 8 years and would increase the total aspirin use population from 36% to 81%. We assumed the adherence to aspirin is 100% 31, 32 and varied it (50%–100%) in the sensitivity analysis.

Several factors have been linked to these recurrent vascular events in patients prescribed aspirin, including smoking, drug interactions, nonadherence, comorbid conditions, and aspirin resistance. The term aspirin resistance has been used to describe not only an absence of the expected pharmacologic effects of aspirin on platelets but also poor clinical outcomes, such as recurrent vascular events, in patients treated with aspirin. Aspirin resistance is perhaps more precisely understood as the phenomenon of measurable, persisting platelet activation that occurs in patients prescribed a therapeutic dose of aspirin and may underlie an unknown proportion of aspirin treatment failures. Key challenges for future research are to standardize a definition of aspirin resistance and to compare whether different measures of platelet activation, either alone or in combination, independently predict cardiovascular events. These challenges must be met before researchers conduct studies to assess the clinical utility of testing on patient outcomes and cost-effective prescribing.

### Benefit-harm analysis and charts for individualized and preference-sensitive prevention: example of low dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer [^1168RdVB]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines provide separate recommendations for different diseases that may be prevented or treated by the same intervention. Also, they commonly provide recommendations for entire populations but not for individuals. To address these two limitations, our aim was to conduct benefit-harm analyses for a wide range of individuals using the example of low dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer and to develop Benefit-Harm Charts that show the overall benefit-harm balance for individuals.

Methods

We used quantitative benefit-harm modeling that included 16 outcomes to estimate the probability that low dose aspirin provides more benefits than harms for a wide range of men and women between 45 and 84 years of age and without a previous myocardial infarction, severe ischemic stroke, or cancer. We repeated the quantitative benefit-harm modeling for different combinations of age, sex, and outcome risks for severe ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, cancers, and severe gastrointestinal bleeds. The analyses considered weights for the outcomes, statistical uncertainty of the effects of aspirin, and death as a competing risk. We constructed Benefit-Harm Charts that show the benefit-harm balance for different combinations of outcome risks.

Results

The Benefit-Harm Charts (http://www.benefit-harm-balance.com) we have created show that the benefit-harm balance differs largely across a primary prevention population. Low dose aspirin is likely to provide more benefits than harms in men, elderly people, and in those at low risk for severe gastrointestinal bleeds. Individual preferences have a major impact on the benefit-harm balance. If, for example, it is a high priority for individuals to prevent stroke and severe cancers while severe gastrointestinal bleeds are deemed to be of little importance, the benefit-harm balance is likely to favor low dose aspirin for most individuals. Instead, if severe gastrointestinal bleeds are judged to be similarly important compared to the benefit outcomes, low dose aspirin is unlikely to provide more benefits than harms.

Conclusions

Benefit-Harm Charts support individualized benefit-harm assessments and decision making. Similarly, individualized benefit-harm assessments may allow guideline developers to issue more finely granulated recommendations that reduce the risk of over- and underuse of interventions. The example of low dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer shows that it may be time for guideline developers to provide combined recommendations for different diseases that may be prevented or treated by the same intervention.

### Primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116xLPsx]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This guideline focuses on long-term administration of antithrombotic drugs designed for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, including two new antiplatelet therapies.

Methods

The methods of this guideline follow those described in Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement.

Results

We present 23 recommendations for pertinent clinical questions. For primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, we suggest low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/d) in patients aged > 50 years over no aspirin therapy (Grade 2B). For patients with established coronary artery disease, defined as patients 1-year post-acute coronary syndrome, with prior revascularization, coronary stenoses > 50% by coronary angiogram, and/or evidence for cardiac ischemia on diagnostic testing, we recommend long-term low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel (75 mg/d) (Grade 1A). For patients with acute coronary syndromes who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement, we recommend for the first year dual antiplatelet therapy with low-dose aspirin in combination with ticagrelor 90 mg bid, clopidogrel 75 mg/d, or prasugrel 10 mg/d over single antiplatelet therapy (Grade 1B). For patients undergoing elective PCI with stent placement, we recommend aspirin (75–325 mg/d) and clopidogrel for a minimum duration of 1 month (bare-metal stents) or 3 to 6 months (drug-eluting stents) (Grade 1A). We suggest continuing low-dose aspirin plus clopidogrel for 12 months for all stents (Grade 2C). Thereafter, we recommend single antiplatelet therapy over continuation of dual antiplatelet therapy (Grade 1B).

Conclusions

Recommendations continue to favor single antiplatelet therapy for patients with established coronary artery disease. For patients with acute coronary syndromes or undergoing elective PCI with stent placement, dual antiplatelet therapy for up to 1 year is warranted.

### Aspirin dosage for preeclampsia prophylaxis: an argument for 162-mg dosing [^116KqQjT]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2025). Medium credibility.

The optimal aspirin dose for preeclampsia prevention remains controversial, with international guidelines lacking consensus on the most effective regimen. Aspirin is a proven intervention for reducing the risk of preeclampsia, particularly when initiated early in pregnancy. Its benefits stem from the selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), reducing thromboxane A2 synthesis while preserving prostacyclin production, thereby restoring the vascular balance essential for placental health. A dose-response relationship has been established, with doses ≥ 100 mg showing significantly greater efficacy than lower doses. Furthermore, aspirin's pharmacological effects remain highly specific to COX-1 at the 162 mg dose, minimizing concerns about broader prostaglandin inhibition. Emerging evidence suggests that certain patient factors, such as altered pharmacokinetics during pregnancy or obesity, may reduce aspirin's effectiveness at lower doses (e.g., 81 mg). In these studies, aspirin resistance was successfully overcome with a 162 mg dose. While concerns regarding safety at this dose have been raised, contemporary randomized controlled trials utilizing a 150 mg dose have shown no increase in adverse effects compared to placebo. As such, current evidence increasingly supports 162 mg as the optimal dose for preeclampsia prevention, offering greater effectiveness than the commonly used 81 mg dose, without significant evidence of increased risk.

### Aspirin, cardiovascular events, and major bleeding in older adults: extended follow-up of the ASPREE trial [^116ap7L9]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Of the 19 114 participants randomized (9525 to aspirin, 9589 to placebo), baseline characteristics were well balanced between the randomized groups, as previously reported. In participants previously randomized to aspirin, who were not censored for MACE, actual use of aspirin (based on the 15% aspirin exposure threshold) gradually declined during the trial, and there was a sharp decrease when the trial ended, due to the cessation of study medication (Figure 1). Conversely, in those previously randomized to placebo who were not censored for MACE, aspirin use gradually increased during the trial and rose further when the trial ended (Figure 1).

- Treatment with ACE inhibitors is recommended in persons with a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0. 40, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or stable chronic kidney disease.
- Chewable aspirin without an enteric coating, at a dose of 162 to 325 mg, should be administered as soon as possible.
- Dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor or clopidogrel in combination with aspirin should be given for up to one year in the invasive and ischemia-guided treatment approaches. From the AFP Editors Acute coronary syndrome, a term that encompasses a range of conditions, is caused when blood flow to the heart is suddenly reduced. The American College of Cardiology, with the American Heart Association, has provided recommendations for managing non–ST elevation ACS. NITRATES Nitroglycerin, at a sublingual dosage of 0. 3 to
0. 4 mg every five minutes for, at most, three doses should be given to patients with persistent ischemic pain.

Following administration of sublingual nitroglycerin, patients should be evaluated to determine if the intravenous formulation, which is used to manage persistent ischemia, heart failure, and hypertension, might be necessary. ANTIPLATELETS AND ANTICOAGULANTS Persons with likely or definite non–ST elevation ACS should be provided with chewable aspirin without an enteric coating, at a dose of 162 to 325 mg, as soon as possible; aspirin should be continued in these patients at a dosage of 81 to 325 mg per day. Clopidogrel should be used instead in those in whom aspirin cannot be administered. 12 inhibitor, or clopidogrel in combination with aspirin for up to one year, assuming there are no contraindications to this treatment strategy. Dosing for ticagrelor is a 180-mg initial loading dose followed by 90 mg twice per day. Clopidogrel is given at a 300- or 600-mg initial loading dose followed by 75 mg per day.

A glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, preferably eptifibatide or tirofiban, can be administered in persons with intermediate or high risk factors who are being treated using an early invasive strategy and dual antiplatelet therapy.
