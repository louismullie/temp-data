## Question

If you are truly afraid of the dark what do you suffer from?

Answer Choices:
A. hypnophobia
B. cryptophobia
C. hadephobia
D. nyctophobia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which phobia name corresponds to a fear of the dark, and to choose among hypnophobia, cryptophobia, hadephobia, and nyctophobia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the literal Greek roots of each option. Then, I should verify which term is actually used in clinical and research literature for fear of the dark. Next, I will consider whether any of the alternatives map to related but distinct fears. Finally, I will confirm the correct answer and briefly note why the others are incorrect.

> Let me first confirm the etymology, because that often clarifies the intended meaning. Nycto- comes from the Greek word for night, so nyctophobia literally means fear of the night or darkness, which aligns directly with fear of the dark. Hypno- relates to sleep, crypto- relates to hidden things or secrecy, and hado- relates to Hades or the underworld, so those roots point to different constructs than darkness itself.

> Wait, let me verify the clinical usage rather than relying on roots alone. In the pediatric anxiety literature and sleep-related fear research, fear of the dark is categorized within nighttime fears and specific phobias, and the term consistently used is nyctophobia, not the alternatives listed. For example, a systematic review of sleep-related fears in children explicitly includes fear of the dark under nighttime fears, and a case report describes severe anxiety with fear of sleeping in the dark, again reflecting nyctophobia rather than sleep phobia or hidden-place phobia.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the distractors. I should double-check whether any of the other options are legitimate phobia names for related but different fears. Hypnophobia is sometimes colloquially used for fear of sleep, which is not the same as fear of darkness, and it is not the standard term for fear of the dark in clinical contexts. Cryptophobia is not a recognized phobia for fear of the dark, and hadephobia, while it sounds like it could relate to darkness via Hades, is not the correct nosologic term for fear of the dark in psychiatric literature.

> I need to ensure I'm not overlooking any authoritative source that uses one of the alternatives for fear of the dark. Scanning the provided materials, I see repeated use of nyctophobia in contexts of nighttime fears and sleep-related anxiety, and I do not find credible instances where hypnophobia, cryptophobia, or hadephobia are used to denote fear of the dark, which reinforces that nyctophobia is the accurate term here.

> Putting this together, I should confirm the answer clearly. The correct term for fear of the dark is nyctophobia, based on both the literal Greek root for night and its consistent use in clinical and research literature addressing nighttime fears and specific phobias. The other options either refer to different fears or are not the standard terms used for this condition [^113QVfBM].

---

The correct answer is **D. nyctophobia**. Nyctophobia is the **specific phobia of darkness** or night, characterized by excessive, irrational fear and avoidance that causes significant distress or impairment. The other options are incorrect: hypnophobia is fear of sleep, cryptophobia is fear of hidden things, and hadephobia is fear of hell.

---

## Etymology and definition

Nyctophobia derives from the Greek words "nyx" (night) and "phobos" (fear), literally meaning **fear of the night or darkness**. It is classified as a **specific phobia** in the DSM-5, characterized by marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation — in this case, darkness — that is excessive or unreasonable, persists for at least six months, and causes significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning [^111KwRts].

---

## Clinical features and symptoms

Individuals with nyctophobia may experience a range of **psychological and physiological symptoms** when exposed to darkness or when anticipating darkness, including:

- **Intense fear or anxiety**: Excessive fear or anxiety that is disproportionate to the actual danger posed by darkness [^111KwRts].
- **Avoidance behaviors**: Persistent avoidance of dark environments, such as refusing to sleep without lights, avoiding nighttime activities, or requiring constant illumination [^117HzReU].
- **Physical symptoms**: Rapid heartbeat, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, or panic attacks [^111Dp1KW].
- **Psychological distress**: Feelings of helplessness, loss of control, or impending doom [^115MfZiH].

---

## Prevalence and demographic factors

Nyctophobia is relatively common, particularly among children, with prevalence estimates varying widely. It is considered a **common childhood fear** that typically diminishes with age; however, in some cases, it persists into adulthood and may require clinical intervention [^113QVfBM]. Gender differences are not consistently reported, although some studies suggest a slightly higher prevalence among females.

---

## Causes and contributing factors

The development of nyctophobia is influenced by a combination of **genetic, environmental, and psychological factors**:

- **Genetic predisposition**: A family history of anxiety disorders or specific phobias may increase susceptibility [^115Qhjqi].
- **Traumatic experiences**: Negative or traumatic experiences associated with darkness, such as accidents, abuse, or frightening events, can trigger the development of nyctophobia [^116WGEWD].
- **Environmental factors**: Cultural influences, parental modeling, or exposure to media depicting darkness as dangerous may contribute to fear [^1121JDGz].
- **Cognitive factors**: Catastrophic thinking, irrational beliefs, or heightened sensitivity to perceived threats in dark environments may perpetuate the fear [^113MXyZ1].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

According to the DSM-5, nyctophobia is diagnosed based on the following **criteria**:

- **Marked fear or anxiety**: Excessive fear or anxiety about darkness, which is persistent and excessive.
- **Immediate fear response**: Fear or anxiety is almost invariably provoked by exposure to darkness.
- **Avoidance or distress**: The individual avoids darkness or endures it with intense fear or anxiety.
- **Disproportionate fear**: The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by darkness.
- **Persistence**: The fear, anxiety, or avoidance persists for at least six months.
- **Functional impairment**: The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning [^111KwRts].

---

## Treatment options

Effective treatments for nyctophobia include:

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: CBT is considered the gold standard treatment, focusing on identifying and challenging irrational thoughts, gradual exposure to darkness, and developing coping strategies [^notfound].
- **Exposure therapy**: Gradual, systematic exposure to darkness in a controlled manner helps reduce fear responses through desensitization [^113WoqVs].
- **Medication**: In severe cases, short-term use of anxiolytic medications or antidepressants may be prescribed to manage symptoms, although medication is generally not considered a first-line treatment for specific phobias [^11347y8h].
- **Relaxation techniques**: Mindfulness, deep breathing, and progressive muscle relaxation can help manage anxiety symptoms [^117KVLNF].

---

## Impact on daily life

Nyctophobia can significantly impact daily functioning, leading to sleep disturbances, social isolation, and impaired academic or occupational performance. Chronic sleep disruption may also contribute to additional mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression [^112qBVsZ].

---

## Conclusion

Nyctophobia is a **specific phobia** characterized by excessive, irrational fear of darkness or night. It is relatively common, particularly among children, and can significantly impair daily functioning. Effective treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and exposure therapy, are available and have been shown to reduce fear and improve quality of life.

### Could blood pressure phobia Go beyond the white coat effect? [^115YqhYN]. American Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Background

While it is known that excessive anxiety surrounding the measuring of blood pressure may preclude an accurate measurement, it is not known whether it could also lead to phobic avoidance behavior.

Methods

Self-reported information was collected on 125 individuals who made postings on 5 internet-based medical forums.

Results

Qualitative thematic analysis revealed that these individuals reported experiencing intense fear associated with the measuring of blood pressure, that was excessive or irrational and which contributed to avoidance of medical treatment and interference with life decisions.

Conclusions

Based on these preliminary observations, we are speculating that these symptoms could be considered consistent with a diagnosis of a Specific Phobia. Investigations using quantitative methods, representative samples, and standardized clinical instruments need to be conducted before definitive conclusions can be reached.

### Recognition of irrationality of fear and the diagnosis of social anxiety disorder and specific phobia in adults: implications for criteria revision in DSM-5 [^113pbYk3]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In DSM-IV, the diagnosis of social anxiety disorder (SAD) and specific phobia in adults requires that the person recognize that his or her fear of the phobic situation is excessive or unreasonable (criterion C). The DSM-5 Anxiety Disorders Work Group has proposed replacing this criterion because some patients with clinically significant phobic fears do not recognize the irrationality of their fears. In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services project we determined the number of individuals who were not diagnosed with SAD and specific phobia because they did not recognize the excessiveness or irrationality of their fear.

Methods

We interviewed 3,000 psychiatric outpatients and 1,800 candidates for bariatric surgery with a modified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. In the SAD and specific phobia modules we suspended the skip-out that curtails the modules if criterion C is not met. Patients who met all DSM-IV criteria for SAD or specific phobia except criterion C were considered to have "modified" SAD or specific phobia.

Results

The lifetime rates of DSM-IV SAD and specific phobia were 30.5 and 11.8% in psychiatric patients and 11.7 and 10.2% in bariatric surgery candidates, respectively. Less than 1% of the patients in both samples were diagnosed with modified SAD or specific phobia.

Conclusion

Few patients were excluded from a phobia diagnosis because of criterion C. We suggest that in DSM-5 this criterion be eliminated from the SAD and specific phobia criteria sets.

3.3.2 Fear network account of emotional processing

The fear network account of emotional processing (Foa et al; Foa & Kozak,) suggests that feared stimuli are embedded in long‐term memory within a "fear network" (Foa & Kozak). Fear networks contains information about (a) feared and associated stimuli; (b) cognitive, behavioural, and physiological reactions to feared stimuli; and (c) the associations between feared stimuli and responses (i.e. meanings about trauma and trauma responses). Foa and Kozak suggest that PTSD symptoms result from a pathological, change‐resistant fear network comprised of excessive stimuli and response information, and heightened associations between elements that do not accurately reflect reality. When a person encounters an element of their fear network (e.g. dark outside) within their environment, the entire fear network becomes activated and triggers the survival response prescribed by that network (see Figure 3). Consequently, pathological fear networks produce strong emotional and behavioural responses to non‐threatening stimuli (i.e. re‐experiencing). Furthermore, avoidance and numbing symptoms are conceptualized as coping strategies that reduce the likelihood the fear network will be activated and, therefore, prevent re‐experiencing symptoms (Foa et al.). Additionally, hyperarousal symptoms may reflect lower‐level activation of the fear network (Foa et al.).

### "But that is your opinion": the dark side of postmodern pain medicine creating a postmodern patient autonomy [^114xbSr7]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

"But that is your opinion", our patients tell us. They make this remark following our explanations that if they want natural remedies for their sleep disorders, cannabis oil is not the best choice, and that-theanine is probably a better choice. We point out the various problems one can face when using cannabis oil regularly for treating sleep disorders and explain that although we may prescribe medical cannabis for certain conditions, we do not do so for sleep disorders due to the fact that cannabis might not be the first choice for this indication. Patients shrug their shoulders and say, "That again is your opinion, a friend of mine is using cannabis oil and is very happy with it". End of discussion. They want prescriptions/authorizations for cannabis oil. What are we to do? Are we obliged to correct what we believe is erroneous thinking or do we emphasize respect for patient autonomy and allow what we perceive to constitute irrationality dominate our clinical judgment and decision making?

It will not go unnoticed to many colleagues that increasingly patients come to see health care providers having already prepared their own agendas regarding diagnosis and treatment. These agendas are often based on Google searches. Our patients tell us, "Doctor, I have become a PhD in Google-search, and here are my findings". Recently we have seen coffee-mugs inscribed with: "Do not mistake your Google-search with my medical degree", although we doubt putting these cups on our desks will be productive. Patients themselves might be convinced, for example, that they are suffering from "chronic Lyme" and want us to prescribe lengthy courses of antibiotics. If a physician asks whether a patient has been bitten by a tick, experienced an erythema migrans, and underwent diagnostic testing, the answer of the patient might be: "I think I have been bitten, but I did not see any red circles on my skin. I understood that does not necessarily mean that I'm not infected. Just as the tests you are proposing do not exclude that I have been infected if they are negative. So, I just want to be treated with antibiotics, to be sure. That is my opinion… " Now the dilemma is complete. Providers often feel ill-equipped to counteract this last argument directly, while patients feel they have become experts regarding their own illnesses, and that the dialogue with their physician is stagnant.

### Determinants of disparities between perceived and physiological risk of falling among elderly people: cohort study [^113qF95Q]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Fear of falling in elderly people has been recognised as an important psychological factor associated with falls. Much research has been undertaken to determine how fear of falling affects the lives of elderly people and how it may play a role in the transition to physical frailty and the incidence of falls. Both falls and fear of falls can substantially reduce quality of life and independence and so contribute to the placement of an elderly person into institutional care. However, the complex nature of psychological risk factors for falling and the limited background information on this phenomenon hamper its inclusion in falls prevention programmes.

Fear of falling has been associated with objectively assessed measures of balance, gait, and falls. This could indicate that people are accurate at rating their fall risk and that fear of falling simply reflects a rational appraisal of reduced functional abilities and consequent increased risk of falling. Alternatively fear may be irrational, excessive, or phobic — a construct reflecting the original phobic condition that Bhala et al described in 1982. Excessive fear of falling can lead to needless restriction in participation in physical and social activities, resulting in physical deconditioning, poor quality of life, social isolation, depression, and psychological distress. From this perspective, fear of falling would be considered maladaptive, and strategies aimed at reducing fear of falling should be implemented. However, such approaches could be harmful and may even increase the risk of falls if it makes elderly people overly confident. Elderly people with inappropriately low levels of fear of falling might take undue risks beyond their physical ability to cope. It might therefore be important for intervention programmes to help elderly people develop a realistic appraisal of fall risk or improve physical functioning in concert with addressing fear, rather than just reduce fear of falling.

The problem of irrational fear, either too much or too little, has been largely neglected. The primary aim of this study was to increase our understanding of fear of falling by exploring the existence of irrational fear in a large representative sample of elderly people. By categorising people in relation to their physiological fall risk and their perceived fall risk, we were able to determine the prevalence of irrational fear of falling. By measuring a diverse range of sociodemographic, cognitive, psychological, and physical factors, we were able to elucidate why elderly people have divergent perceived and physiological fall risks and the impact of such disparities on the risk of falls.

### The curious case of the zzz's [^112fMUnc]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness is a common presenting symptom that may present a diagnostic challenge for the sleep medicine clinician. We present a case of an adolescent female with excessive daytime sleepiness and "sleep attacks" who was evaluated using a 2-week sleep log, wrist actigraphy, baseline polysomnogram, and Multiple Sleep Latency Test. Multiple Sleep Latency Test results noted a short mean sleep latency without sleep onset rapid eye movement periods, concerning for possible central disorders of hypersomnolence. However, actigraphy data noted a habitual bedtime of midnight or later, resulting in less than recommended total sleep time for her age on weekdays with extended sleep periods on the weekends. The most unique actigraphy finding was exposure to ambient light throughout most overnight sleep periods. When actigraphy results were discussed with the patient, she revealed recent onset of severe anxiety with fear of sleeping in the dark. This case highlights the importance of thorough clinical evaluation, and careful interpretation of objective tests, when evaluating for causes of excessive daytime sleepiness.

### Bringing light to the dark side of insulin: a journey across the blood-brain barrier [^113tK1xR]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

This conclusion, unfortunately, proved incorrect. After our patients left the hospital, while this "more physiological" insulin delivery system markedly improved glycemic control and prompted longer-term collaborative clinical trials, it did not take long for the dark side of insulin, hypoglycemia, appeared. Contrary to our optimistic predictions, patients had frequent hypoglycemia, and to our surprise, frequently they were totally unaware of it. As with many "new" clinical observations, they are often not as new as they seemed. Fredrick Banting in his 1925 Nobel Laureate lecture stated, "The level at which hypoglycemic symptoms occur, is slightly higher in the diabetic with marked hyperglycemia. As a patient becomes accustomed to a normal blood glucose, the threshold of these reactions, becomes lower".

The importance of hypoglycemia, as a complication of intensive insulin therapy, became fully apparent when the benefits of such treatment in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) were announced, more than a decade later. The DCCT follow-up analysis showed that one-half of severe hypoglycemic events occurred while patients were asleep. In those patients who were awake at the time of the hypoglycemic event, one-half were not aware of impeding hypoglycemia and therefore could not take protective action. It is for this reason that, for many patients, the immediate fear of severe hypoglycemia exceeds the fear of long-term diabetes complications. This reduces the commitment of patients, their families, and their physicians to intensive insulin treatment.

### Understanding and managing pandemic-related panic buying [^1121JDGz]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Pandemics are associated with panic buying (PB) of groceries and other supplies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, community leaders expressed frustration and bewilderment about PB. Psychological explanatory concepts, including those from social learning theory and the concept of the behavioral immune system, along with recent research, suggests the following account of pandemic-related PB. PB arises when people are told to go into self-isolation as part of pandemic containment interventions. Empirically, episodes of PB typically last 7–10 days and are likely initiated by highly fearful people. PB by an anxious minority of shoppers leads to fear contagion among other shoppers, amplified by widespread dissemination, via social media, of images and videos of PB and empty shelves in stores. Thus, a snow-balling effect arises where fear of scarcity creates real but short-term scarcity. People who are highly frightened of infection tend to have heightened disgust proneness. Toilet paper is a means of escaping disgust stimuli, and for this and other reasons, toilet paper became a target of PB for people frightened of contracting COVID-19. Exploitative or selfish over-purchasing also occurred, motivated by "dark" (e.g., psychopathic) personality traits. "Don't panic!" messages from community leaders were ineffective or counter-productive. Alternative forms of messaging are discussed.

### Antiseptic phobia in a patient experiencing anesthesia awareness during cleft palate repair surgery: a case report [^114dV8Cd]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Specific phobia is an excessive and irrational fear often triggered by a stressor. Among different types of phobias arising in medical settings, we could not find any case reported for exclusively antiseptic fluids without any medical-surgical intervention. The term "anesthesia awareness" (AA) signifies the specific surgical period of time when an individual, in spite of being under intended general anesthesia, remains aware of the sensory stimuli and the memories of which also remain available for his subsequent explicit recall in the future. According to the "American Society of Anesthesiologists Practice Advisory", it is explicit recall during general anesthesia. Its hallmark is the presence of awareness of the events going on during the surgical procedure while being under a general anesthesia. AA is a distressing condition with immediate and long-term consequences. In spite of an estimated prevalence of 0.1%-0.2% of all the surgeries, our knowledge about this condition is limited. The most commonly reported consequences of AA are acute painful flashbacks of surgical events along with the emotional turmoil and a sense of helplessness followed later by posttraumatic stress disorder. Here, we report a unique case of occurrence of "antiseptic-phobia" in a patient following the experience of anesthesia awareness during cleft palate repair surgery.

### Unveiling neurophobia: exploring factors influencing medical students, residents and non-neurologist physicians globally and its implications on neurology care-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112CxVPn]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

The significant heterogeneity observed in our meta-analysis (I² = 98.7%, p < 0.001) suggests substantial variability across the included studies. This heterogeneity may be attributed to differences in study populations, methodological approaches, cultural contexts and specific instruments used to measure neurophobia. Meta-regression analysis was used to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity.

A central issue raised by recent peer review is whether the term 'neurophobia' — as used in the literature — truly reflects an irrational fear of neurology, or whether it more broadly encompasses other negative attitudes such as disinterest, distaste or perceived difficulty. The original concept of neurophobia, as described by Jozefowicz, refers to 'a fear of neurology due to its perceived complexity and difficulty' but does not explicitly specify whether this fear is irrational. In clinical psychology, a phobia is typically defined as an irrational and excessive fear that leads to avoidance, even when the individual has the capacity or knowledge to manage the situation

On reviewing the included studies and their survey instruments, it is evident that most do not explicitly distinguish between irrational fear and other negative responses. The questionnaires commonly assess attitudes such as anxiety, lack of confidence, perceived difficulty and avoidance, but rarely probe whether these responses are truly irrational (ie, disproportionate to the actual demands or risks of neurology). For example, several studies use Likert scales to measure agreement with statements like "I find neurology intimidating" or "I feel anxious about neurology", but do not clarify whether this anxiety persists despite adequate knowledge or experience. Thus, it is possible that what is being captured is a rational response to a perceived gap in training or exposure, rather than a phobia in the clinical sense

This distinction is important: a qualified non-neurologist who is capable of managing neurological problems but is held back by an illogical or excessive fear would fit the strict definition of neurophobia. In contrast, avoidance or negative attitudes based on limited exposure, lack of confidence or genuine difficulty may be more rational and amenable to educational interventions.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^117WYbtY]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

DSM-IV-TR 300.3 obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnostic criteria require either obsessions or compulsions, with obsessions involving intrusive, inappropriate thoughts, impulses, or images that are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems, attempts to ignore, suppress, or neutralize them, and recognition that they are a product of one's own mind; compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed in response to an obsession or according to rigid rules, aimed at preventing or reducing distress or a dreaded event but not realistically connected or clearly excessive. Additional criteria are that the person has recognized the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable (note: this does not apply to children), symptoms cause marked distress, are time consuming (take more than 1 hour a day), or significantly interfere with routine, functioning, or relationships, content is not restricted to another Axis I disorder, and the disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition; specify With Poor Insight when for most of the time during the current episode the person does not recognize that the obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable.

### Mask fear in children presenting for anesthesia: aversion, phobia, or both? [^113q12A1]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Anesthesia induction in children is commonly accomplished by introducing volatile agents by mask. Occasionally a child describes an excessive fear of the anesthesia facemask. Little is known of the cause of the fear or of the quality or magnitude of the feelings the child is experiencing. The purpose of this study was to allow children who have established mask fear as demonstrated by volunteering the presence of fear and requesting no mask be placed on the face during the induction of anesthesia and their parents to describe and compare the distress from the mask to the alternative intravenous anesthesia induction.

Methods

Eight children describing mask fear on the preanesthetic examination were studied. An Anesthesia Mask Fear questionnaire developed by the investigators was answered by the children and their parents.

Results

Six children and their parents completed the study. The age at presentation of mask fear ranged from 1.4 to 14 years. There were one to 16 anesthetic exposures prior to reporting mask fear. One child described an aversion to the odor of the mask. Another boy developed mask fear after a single anesthetic exposure. He was subsequently diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder. Four female children developed mask fear after repeated anesthetic exposures. These children rated mask fear with the greatest discomfort possible while venous cannulation was scored at half or less that of the mask discomfort.

Conclusions

Care must be taken when developing a plan for anesthesia induction in children requiring multiple procedures. Children may develop an aversion to the odor or feel of the mask, or have a true phobia (irrational fear) of the mask. Those children with a phobia might also have other underlying anxieties.

### Measures of sleep-related fears in children: a systematic review of psychometric properties using COSMIN [^113QVfBM]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2025). Medium credibility.

In this review, 'sleep-related fears' refers to any fears or worries associated with sleep, nighttime and/or the pre-sleep period. This may include fears related to content, such as the dark, separation at night, imaginary creatures or burglars (i.e. nighttime fears). It may include worries that occur before bedtime, including generalised worry before bed. It can also include both cognitions and behavioural manifestations, such as avoidance and safety behaviours (e.g. bedtime resistance or reassurance seeking at night). This term was selected for its broad scope in encompassing both nighttime fears and pre-sleep arousal.

There is a need to increase our understanding of sleep-related fears in children to enable better and more accurate measurement and identification of specific targets for intervention and prevent disorder development. Consistency in the use of high-quality measures can enhance the accuracy of treatment targets for sleep, anxiety and nighttime fears in children (Aslund et al; Galgut et al; Lewis et al; Wang et al.). Questionnaires are the most commonly used measure for sleep-related fears and provide a practical and feasible method of assessment. Yet there is a lack of knowledge and inconsistency in the use of measurement tools, compromising research conclusions and advancement in the field (Lewis et al.). To fully capture the multifaceted nature of sleep-related fears, questionnaires should assess the content, severity, frequency and behavioural manifestations of these fears.

This review focuses on children aged 7–12 years, as this age group experiences the highest frequency and severity of nighttime fears, compared to other age groups (Gordon et al; Muris et al.). Additionally, these children are in a vulnerable period where the occurrence of sleep problems is linked with increased mental health problems in early adolescence (Cooper et al.), reiterating the importance of assessment and treatment of sleep-related problems in this age group. The current review also focuses on measures that have been validated in English.

The aim of this systematic review is to identify the breadth of parent- and child-report measures that include an assessment of sleep-related fears in children from 7 to 12 years old. The second aim is to review the psychometric properties of measures that more comprehensively measure sleep-related fears to ultimately recommend a small battery of robust tools.

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^116iX28x]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Psychology of a crisis and principles of risk communication — during disasters, a group perceived to be contaminated or threatening may be isolated, hampering community recovery and affecting treatment, evacuation, and relocation, and in a disease outbreak separating from those perceived to be infected can make it more difficult to track and contain a disease outbreak. Fear is an important psychological consideration in the response to a threat; in some cases a perceived threat can motivate and help people take desired actions, whereas fear of the unknown or uncertainty may be the most debilitating response, and when people are afraid and do not have adequate information they may react in inappropriate or irrational ways. Perceived helplessness is one of the most devastating psychological aspects of a crisis; people may accept that the threat is real yet feel the situation is hopeless, and they may feel helpless to protect themselves and mentally or physically withdraw. People generally display an optimistic bias and may underestimate the likelihood that negative events will occur, the severity of those events, and the likelihood those events will affect them; while optimism can be a very positive force during a crisis, it can interfere with people taking appropriate actions, such as getting vaccinations or following advice to evacuate. Those who respond to a crisis or are affected by it may experience more severe psychological disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); PTSD is the anxiety disorder some people get after exposure to a dangerous event, most people who have been through a severe crisis will report sadness, anxiety, stress, and fear, but they usually do not develop PTSD, and traumatic events that may trigger long-term problems include violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, accidents, and military combat.

### Cannabinoid regulation of fear and anxiety: an update [^114zCd2k]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Phytocannabinoid Regulation of Fear and Anxiety: the Case for Cannabidiol

Although recreational cannabis use is rife worldwide, it can be associated with anxiety symptoms acutely. In terms of the mechanism underlying this effect of cannabis, studies in healthy volunteers dating back several decades showed that THC and CBD have opposing effects on anxiety. THC is anxiogenic, but this effect is diminished when it is co-administered with CBD. In contrast, CBD given alone has anxiolytic properties, particularly under circumstances or in response to stimuli which normally provoke anxiety. Both the anxiogenic and psychotropic effects of THC would appear to preclude its use for treating anxiety-related disorders, at least when administered on its own. However, the reported anxiolysis caused by CBD gave rise to a number of preclinical studies that investigated its effects in different rodent models of innate fear and anxiety-like behaviour (e.g. elevated plus maze, open field, light-dark test, predator exposure). The findings of these studies broadly confirmed the anxiolytic potential of CBD when given systemically or infused locally into various brain areas governing fear and anxiety. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the anxiety-reducing effects of CBD are accompanied by altered blood flow to some of the homologous areas in humans. CBD is devoid of abuse potential given its lack of rewarding effects. It also has a favourable safety profile and was recently approved for the treatment of rare childhood seizure disorders. This makes CBD an attractive candidate therapeutic for treating anxiety-related disorders.

Studies using preclinical models of relevance to anxiety-related disorders characterized by abnormally strong and persistent fear memory (i.e. phobias, PTSD) have shown that CBD also regulates learned fear and its inhibition in different ways. During fear conditioning, a cue or context is paired with a noxious stimulus, resulting in the consolidation of an associative fear memory. Later cue presentation or context re-exposure alone initially results in conditioned fear responding and can also destabilize the memory trace, requiring its reconsolidation to maintain or update the fear memory. Repeatedly presenting the cue or prolonged context re-exposure also reduces fear responding through an inhibitory learning process known as extinction, which competes with the original memory to suppress fear responding and also forms the theoretical basis of exposure therapy. Reducing conditioned fear responding, disrupting reconsolidation and enhancing extinction are all potential strategies for acute or lasting symptom reduction in phobias and PTSD.

### The case for eliminating excessive worry as a requirement for generalized anxiety disorder: a cross-national investigation [^111qQq5a]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Why might individuals whose symptoms are so severe that they otherwise qualify for a GAD diagnosis regard their worry as non-excessive? We found that non-excessive worriers often focus on topics that might be perceived as normative (e.g. finances, well-being of loved ones), and focus less on non-specific concerns (e.g. 'everything') that may be easier to recognize as excessive. This may reduce insight, perhaps especially among lifelong worriers who have a limited basis for comparison. Alternatively, non-excessive worry might be a justifiable reaction to genuine deprivation or stress. We observed higher rates of non-excessive GAD in LMICs than HICs, perhaps reflecting heightened stress and uncertainty in parts of the world where caring for oneself and one's family can be a daily struggle. Greater persistence of symptoms in LMICs may also reflect a greater likelihood of ongoing stressors in those countries. Critically, an unintended consequence of the excessiveness requirement may be that individuals with low socioeconomic status or stigmatized identities – whose worries may be viewed as an understandable reaction to the stressors they face – may be less likely to receive a GAD diagnosis and gain access to quality treatment than more-advantaged patients with the same presenting complaint. We did not find a stronger association of household income with non-excessive than excessive GAD, but were unable to test whether other forms of disadvantage previously linked to chronic stress were concentrated among non-excessive cases (Hatzenbuehler; Zvolensky, Garey, & Bakhshaie). Such tests are needed to explore whether eliminating excessiveness reduces disparities in GAD diagnosis and treatment.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^113FJLcg]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnostic features from DSM-IV-TR describe the essential features as recurrent obsessions or compulsions that are time consuming — i.e., they take more than 1 hour a day — or cause marked distress or significant impairment, with obsessions defined as intrusive, persistent, unwanted thoughts, impulses, or images that give rise to marked anxiety or distress, and compulsions — also known as rituals — carried out repetitively, excessively, and usually according to rules or in a rigid manner that the patient feels driven to perform to prevent some feared event, undo some thought, or reduce anxiety or distress.

### 'On the different species of phobia' and' on the different species of mania' (1786): from popular furies to mental disorders in America [^116Uc2HR]. Medical Humanities (2021). Medium credibility.

Benjamin Rush's twin 1786 letters on the different species of phobia and mania sit at an extended historical juncture at which an early modern quasi-medical troping of mental disorder in American social commentary sobered up to mental medicine. The letters' satirical drive hinged on a perennial problem still occupying George Beard almost a century onward: which idiosyncratic trepidation or ill-grounded idea warranted the nomination of national and epochal ill? Rush's mania letter exemplified an established genre identifying popular and especially political crazes; at the same time, it foreshadowed the early 19th-century rise and mid-century fall of monomania as forensic-nosological stopgap. The phobia text established the term's dictionary (OED) sense of specific morbid fears, but did so in the form of a mobilisation of nosological jargon for social diagnostics purposes: an ambivalent prelude to Rush's later formal engagement with unreasonable fears and follies. Both letters draw attention to a pervasive duality in early modern and Enlightenment conceptions of hydrophobia, aerophobia, syphilophobia and lyssophobia, between public-health and mental-hygienic follies.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^116u3zy4]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) differential diagnosis — Compared with hypochondriasis, patients with hypochondriasis "do not have insight into the irrationality of his or her fears and behaviors", whereas "some insight is usually present in OCD". In body dysmorphic disorder, preoccupations are "limited to the fear or belief that one has a disturbing physical defect, when in reality the defect is nonexistent or slight". In postpartum OCD, distinguishing urges to harm an infant from postpartum depression is emphasized, with the statement that in OCD "there is little risk of direct harm to the infant", whereas in postpartum depression ideas "may be experienced as justified, may not be strongly resisted, and emerge from depressed mood", and "taking steps to protect the infant may be necessary". Motor or vocal tics differ in that "unlike compulsions", they are "neither preceded by thoughts nor aimed at relieving anxiety or preventing or undoing an external, undesired event". OCD and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) "may co-occur", but distinguishing features include that in OCPD the focus is on "doing things my way, the right way", OCD perfectionism is "focal and limited to feared events" while in OCPD such traits "globally color the individual's attitudes and behavior", and the person with OCPD "experiences the concerns and behaviors as part of the normal self and does not resist them".

### How I approach expressing condolences and longitudinal remembering to a family after the death of a child [^115xTHQ5]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Bereaved families fear their child being forgotten by those who knew their loved child, including their child's oncology team. Thoughtfully timed, family-centric condolences shared by pediatric oncology team members have the potential to extend our compassion and kindness toward a family during the darkness of grief. Well-intended medical teams sometimes feel "at a loss" in terms of what to say to a grieving family and how or when to say it. This paper provides a tangible overview of written or verbal condolence communication in a format that can be personalized to the provider and the patient's family.

### Sludge, dark patterns and dark nudges: a taxonomy of online gambling platforms' deceptive design features [^111YvpEi]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

An understanding of online gambling platforms' deceptive design does not need to begin in a vacuum, but can use concepts from the interdisciplinary field of behavioral science. Much of behavioral science research focuses on beneficial changes to design environments called 'nudges'. Auto‐enrolling workers into pensions is seen as one classic beneficial nudge, given the pervasive impact of default options on choice and people's tendency to under save for retirement. However, in recent years, attention has turned toward how online environments in particular can be designed in ways that make people worse‐off, called deceptive design here, for which three main terms have been used in the behavioral science literature.

The first established term, 'sludge', was coined by the originators of nudge. As helpful nudges often act to make some beneficial action easier to perform, sludges act in reverse to this, by instead making that beneficial action harder to perform. Examples of sludge include excessively complex forms to claim some government benefit or the use of deliberately long phoneline waiting times required to cancel a recurring subscription. 'Dark patterns' is the next established term, which originates from the user experience (UX) design community. This term refers to a range of tactics that website and app designers can use to trick people into taking actions that are more profitable for the website, such as by automatically signing them up for unwanted recurring subscriptions. Importantly, within the context of online gambling, this term includes tactics that could also be considered sludge, such as tactics used to make sensible deposit limits harder to set. The third and final established term, 'dark nudges', is a term that is intended to be as wide‐ranging as 'nudge'. Nudges can in principle use any tactic, with their core attribute being that they should help make people better‐off. Dark nudges can similarly in principle use any tactic, with their core attribute being the tendency to make people worse‐off. Dark nudges can, therefore, be seen as including the tactics highlighted by the first two terms, as well as others, such as the alcohol industry's presentation of drinking as a normal leisure activity.

### Advances in understanding illness anxiety [^1177HgWu]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Illness anxiety, also known in its more severe form as hypochondriasis, is a debilitating and chronic condition in which normal bodily symptoms are misinterpreted as signs of serious medical illness. Patients suffer with the fear that they are ill despite reassurance to the contrary and often overuse medical services in the process. This article critically evaluates the recent literature on illness anxiety and related, medically unexplained symptoms, highlighting new and interesting findings in the areas of prevalence, classification/diagnosis, management, and evidence-based treatment and new frontiers in understanding illness anxiety, such as brain imaging, neuroimmunology, and cyberchondria.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^115e4CKm]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) — DSM-IV-TR disease definition and symptom differentiation state that DSM-IV-TR identifies the essential features of OCD as recurrent obsessions or compulsions (Criterion A) that are severe enough to be time consuming, i.e., they take more than 1 hour a day, or cause marked distress or significant impairment (Criterion C). DSM-IV-TR describes obsessions as intrusive, persistent, unwanted thoughts, impulses, or images that give rise to marked anxiety or distress, and describes compulsions as physical or mental acts that the patient feels driven to perform in order to magically prevent some feared event, undo some thought, or reduce anxiety or distress. Compulsive acts — also known as rituals — are carried out repetitively, excessively, and usually according to rules or in a rigid manner, and the psychiatrist should differentiate between obsessions and mental rituals or compulsions since the cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches to these symptoms differ. Obsessions occur spontaneously or are evoked by a feared environmental stimulus or event and generate anxiety or distress, whereas mental compulsions such as counting, praying, or reviewing actions, conversations, or lists are initiated by the patient willfully, albeit sometimes reluctantly, with the aim of feeling safer or reducing anxiety or distress.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^111dcJRs]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder — assessment and screening directs that the psychiatrist should assess the patient for symptoms of OCD, guided by the diagnostic criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), and highlights that OCD is likely to be underdiagnosed unless specific screening occurs. Screening questions might include examples such as "Do you have unpleasant thoughts you can't get rid of?", "Do you worry that you might impulsively harm someone?", and "Do you have to count things, or wash your hands, or check things over and over?", and the psychiatrist must differentiate obsessions, compulsions, and rituals from similar symptoms found in other disorders. Unlike obsessions, the actions, conversations, or lists are initiated by the patient willfully, with the aim of feeling safer or reducing anxiety or distress, and the most common obsessional themes are fears of being contaminated or spreading contamination, accidentally or purposely harming others, making a significant mistake, committing a religious offense or moral infraction, contracting a disease, and being considered homosexual or committing homosexual or pedophilic acts.

### One last question: opening pandora's box? [^116qQ4hQ]. Annals of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Family physicians are oriented and trained to inquire about the meaning of patients' symptoms and to recognize when major concerns or worry are present. Yet, in the context of busy practices and the many interruptions of our workday, we may concentrate too much on efficiency in conducting visits and completing tasks for patients, with a resulting narrow focus on the medical or biological aspects of the patient's complaint. This essay tells the story of 2 patient encounters in which I, an experienced family physician, almost missed noticing deep fears experienced by each patient. These experiences led me to reflect on the contextual, patient, and personal factors that can get in the way of recognizing and reaching a deeper understanding of patients' worries, and on the power we have to assuage fears when we address them directly instead of hesitating to open Pandora's box.

### The night is dark and full of itches [^114pJmCX]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

"An itch, easy to scratch and when there is a reason, we celebrate". Who can understand an itch better than a dermatologist, for it is their bread and butter.

I happened to meet a lady in my practice whose predominant complaint was itching. Her appearance gave an impression that she was impoverished and seemed to be in distress. When she came in, she immediately clicked on and started complaining about her issues. She had intractable pruritis due to scabies, which was not a surprise considering her state of affairs. She was naturally talkative and had an aura that made her get people around her conversational. She revealed that she stayed alone in a small scrambled up house with no company and worked as a day laborer to meet her needs. After all her complaints she ended up saying, "Saaar, neither can I work nor sleep with this itch and if you cannot treat me, please give me something to end my miserable life. My nights have become a nightmare which I can't explain in words. I am a destitute and I do not have any relatives nor a reason to live. If my destiny is to suffer, then I would like to end it". These were her words and in my honest opinion no one is a destitute in this world. The belief in destiny is deeply rooted in this part of the world, and she was no different.

One's psychological and sentimental views go astray when poverty and sickness coexist. There are multiple scientific reasons as to why the mites itch at night. What the mite doesn't know is that it targets the impoverished whose only pleasure is a night's peaceful sleep. That sleep is necessary for their next day's venture, existence, and food. In front of me was a lady who was ready to end her life to cease the itch. I treated her with appropriate medications and advised her to return back after 2 weeks and decided against charging her for the consult. She came to me a little furious demanding as to why I did not charge her. I didn't have the courage to state the obvious and was beating around the bush. She hushed me with a determined voice. "Sir, I'm not a beggar. I make enough money to support myself. This isn't professional ethics, and you need to be paid for your work".

### Sadism and personality disorders [^114vrrFR]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

That being said, other approaches continue to consider sadism as a unique trait that cannot be subsumed under one higher-order factor such as D. One study, for example, found a superior fit for a bi-factor model that specifies a general antagonistic factor plus a specific sadism factor that reflects deriving pleasure from hurting others (see also). This notion was further supported by data showing that sadism specifically predicts enjoyment of internet trolling, even when other Dark Triad traits are statistically controlled for. Even studies eventually favouring the D factor approach suggest that, next to psychopathy, sadism is related to specific criteria after controlling for D, like self-centredness, insensitivity, and aggression. Put differently, while showing similar nomological networks, sadism comprises aspects not entirely reflected in D, and still remains theoretically distinct from psychopathy. Importantly, the overlap between sadism and other dark traits might also be partially attributable to the use of specific items that characterize multiple dark traits in measurement scales. Therefore, measures are needed that better differentiate between sadism and psychopathy, which can help dissolve the jingle-jangle fallacy of two differential concepts that often appear identical in analyses.

### Anxiety in synucleinopathies: neuronal circuitry, underlying pathomechanisms and current therapeutic strategies [^114dQsoe]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Concept of anxiety and fear

Anxiety is a generalized response to an unknown threat, while fear is focused on known external danger. In physiological conditions, the main function of both fear and anxiety is to predict, react, and adjust to the signal of danger and threat. Both are characterized by increased arousal, expectancy, autonomic and neuroendocrine activation, and specific behavior patterns. While fear and anxiety feel similar, they are distinguishable phenomena. From an evolutionary viewpoint, the term fear is used to describe feelings that occur when the source of the threat is either immediate or imminent, whereas anxiety is used to describe a feeling that occurs when the source of harm is uncertain or is distal in space or time. According to that, anxiety disorders are a group of psychiatric disorders and a syndrome of ongoing anxiety. Anxiety disorders comprise separation anxiety, selective mutism, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. The global prevalence of anxiety disorder in the general population is highly variable and ranged between 2.4% and 29.8% in the period 1980–2009. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2019, 301 million people were living with an anxiety disorder including 58 million children and adolescents. As with depression, anxiety disorders are more common among females than males (4.6% compared to 2.6% at the global level in 2015 according to the WHO).

Fear is commonly considered the biological basis of the emotion of all humans and many animals. Pavlovian fear conditioning is commonly used to learn about the behavioral characteristics and neural mechanisms of fear acquisition. This is a form of associative memory formation where a conditioned stimulus (CS) such as an auditory tone is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) such as a foot shock. As a result, a memory is formed which allows the CS to elicit freezing, a behavioral index of fear. Fear extinction is an adaptive process whereby defensive responses are attenuated following the repeated experience of prior fear-related stimuli without harm. Thus, interactions between fear conditioning and fear extinction shape behavior especially early in life. In anxiety disorders, patients usually process fear-inducing information in excessive detail. For instance, generalized anxiety disorders are characterized by an emotional state of excess and unrealistic worry, while panic attacks are characterized by repeated fear episodes.

### Over the edge: extending the duration of a reconsolidation intervention for spider fear [^1176ryxS]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologically disrupting fear memory reconsolidation dramatically reduces fear behaviour. For example, 2-3min of tarantula exposure followed by 40mg of propranolol HCl (i.e., a reconsolidation intervention) abruptly decreased spider avoidance, an effect that persisted one year later. However, the success of reconsolidation interventions is not guaranteed: Pavlovian fear-conditioning research shows that the window to target memory reconsolidation is small and easy to miss. If exposure is too long to trigger reconsolidation, but too short for extinction learning, an inactive transitional limbo state occurs, rendering the fear memory unchanged and insensitive to amnesic agents. In this pre-registered study, we aimed to find this behaviourally-controlled boundary condition. Spider-fearful participants underwent a ~3min (n = 23) or ~14min (n = 20) exposure to a tarantula, intended to trigger reconsolidation or the limbo state respectively, followed by 40mg of propranolol. We expected greater spider fear reduction after 3 than 14min of exposure. Unexpectedly, there were no group differences on any outcome measures. In both groups, Bayesian analysis revealed a marked reduction in fear behaviour towards a generalisation stimulus (a house spider) accompanied by lower self-reported distress, with a sharp decline in spider fear scores two days after treatment that persisted one year later. Possible explanations include that the boundary conditions of reconsolidation are wider in older and stronger memories than experimentally-induced fears, or that alternative processes caused the treatment effects. Although the mechanism is unclear, these results carry a tentative promising message for the potential of brief reconsolidation-targeting interventions to mitigate irrational fears.

### Treating nighttime fears in young children with bibliotherapy: evaluating anxiety symptoms and monitoring behavior change [^115NpjFm]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Children's nighttime fears are a normal part of child development and are transient for most children, but result in considerable distress for others. The present study evaluated a 4-week bibliotherapy intervention designed to treat young children with persistent and interfering nighttime fears utilizing a multiple baseline design.

Method

Nine children between 5 and 7 years of age with specific phobia diagnoses were randomized into one of three baseline control conditions (1, 2, or 3 weeks). The treatment protocol involved parents reading Uncle Lightfoot, Flip that Switch: Overcoming Fear of the Dark, Academic Version (Coffman, 2012) with their children over 4 weeks while engaging in activities prescribed in the book. Assessments took place at baseline, post treatment, and 1 month following treatment. Daily and weekly tracking of nighttime behaviors was also obtained.

Results

Pre-post group analyses revealed that eight of the nine children demonstrated clinically significant change in anxiety severity. In addition, decreases in child-reported nighttime fears were observed, as were parent-reported decreases in separation anxiety and increases in the number of nights children slept in their own bed.

Conclusions

The present study provides initial support for the use of bibliotherapy in the treatment of nighttime fears. Further replication and evaluation are needed to determine appropriate length of treatment and long-term effects. Implications of the findings are discussed.

### Committee opinion no. 705: mental health disorders in adolescents [^1162dwA3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Box 1 — Common mental health disorders and defining features in adolescents outlines anxiety disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and mood disorders. Generalized anxiety disorder involves excessive anxiety and worry about multiple events with intensity, duration, or frequency out of proportion and difficulty controlling worry. Social anxiety disorder is a marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations causing extreme distress or avoidance. Panic disorder is recurrent unexpected panic attacks; a panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or discomfort that peaks within minutes and during which time four or more of 13 physical and cognitive symptoms occur. OCD includes symptom dimensions such as cleaning, symmetry, forbidden or taboo thoughts, and harm. PTSD features characteristic symptom clusters after exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence. Mood disorders include adjustment disorder with depressed mood, in which symptoms occur within 3 months of the stressor onset, and major depressive disorder, defined by a period of at least 2 weeks with depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, with irritability possible in youth.

### CLINICAL PRACTICE. generalized anxiety disorder [^115Qhjqi]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on generalized anxiety disorder:

- **Definition**: GAD is a chronic disorder characterized by excessive anxiety and worry about a number of events or activities (such as work, home, and social) symptoms, and tension, which an individual finds difficult to control.
- **Pathophysiology**: GAD is mostly caused by genetic (altered DNA methylation and single nucleotide polymorphism) and environmental factors (stress, trauma, etc.).
- **Epidemiology**: The lifetime prevalence of DSM-5 GAD in the US is estimated at 7,800 cases per 100,000 individuals.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include restless feeling, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance, arguments with relatives or friends, difficulty/inability to complete tasks, restriction of usual activities, with associated autonomic, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary symptoms decreasing the overall health of the individual. GAD is associated with various comorbidities including depression, dysthymia, bipolar I and II, panic disorder with/without agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia, substance use disorder, and personality disorders (avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, schizoid, and antisocial).
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Anxiety disorders are associated with an increased risk of death with a natural mortality rate ratio of 1.39 (95% CI 1.28–1.51) and an unnatural mortality rate ratio of 2.46 (95% CI 2.20–2.73).

### The misuse of colour in science communication [^111QQWtD]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

BOX 1: Human colour perception

Colour is not inherent in objects. A perceived colour is the portion of light that is reflected from a surface and translated into a specific colour by our eyes and brain (Box Fig. 1). A certain colour is perceived via its hue, the true tint (i.e. yellow, orange, red, violet, blue or green), and its luminosity (the measure of how bright or dark a hue is). Within the eye, one type of light receptors, the rod cells, process achromatic information (i.e. lightness or grey-scale vision), which is derived mostly from the light's energy. The other type, the cone cells, handle chromatic information (the hue) mostly from the light's wavelength. The latter transmit information to the brain and create the sensation of colour that is so familiar to most of us.

Two thirds of all cone cells process longer wavelengths of light (i.e. colours like red, orange, yellow), which allows the human eye to perceive more colour detail across warmer colours than for cooler colours. Greenish colour gradients tend to under-represent a given data variation compared to yellow-red gradients. Three types of cone cells (for short, medium and, long wavelengths) build the trichromatic visual system that can, as a whole, represent all colours in our visual spectrum –.

The physiological prerequisites for perceiving colour suggest that there is no uniform colour perception among individuals; several physiological deviations can lead to a shift in colour perception, which, in general, is hardly measurable. However, it is not unlikely that at least one of the cone cell types is altered, defect, or even absent, which induces a significant shift in colour vision. Such a shift is commonly referred to as colour-vision deficiency (CVD), or colour blindness, and can be modelled by a given combination of the three fundamental spectral sensitivity functions representing short, medium and long wavelengths of the light(as represented in Fig. 2). The most common form of colour-vision deficiency is the red–green dichromatism, called deuteranomaly, concerning the M-cone and causing red and green to appear indistinguishable. Protanomaly, concerning the L-cone, and tritanomaly, concerning the S-cone cause reduced sensitivity to red and blue light, respectively. Total colour blindness is, fortunately, very rare, but does exist.

### Bright spots in dark times [^116ifun5]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The current war in Gaza has created a thick cloud over the surrounding region: a cloud of anger, frustration, and despair. Palestinians make up a large portion of the population in Jordan with 2.39 million registered refugees alone, not including non-registered refugees. Many have relatives living in Gaza, making them particularly invested in the conflict.

Discussion

The ongoing suffering of loved ones preoccupies them, making it difficult to focus on anything else. I also sometimes fall into despair even though I am a foreigner living in Jordan.

Conclusion

A bright spot between the thick clouds occurred during my time with Ali at "Camp for All", a camp for students with disabilities in Jordan.

### Current status and influencing factors of kinesiophobia in patients with peritoneal dialysis: a multicenter cross-sectional study [^116wnBy6]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a renal replacement therapy for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and is gradually becoming the preferred choice of therapy because of its low haemodynamic impact, better protection of residual renal function, and absence of dialysis-associated bloodstream infection. Studies have indicated that approximately 35–40% of patients worldwide with ESRD opt for PD treatment, with an annual growth rate of 8%. In addition, the number of PD patients in China had already exceeded 12,000 by the end of 2021.

Owing to insufficient nutrient intake or overconsumption during dialysis, PD patients are prone to muscle mass and strength decline, multimorbidity, weakness, etc. which leads to a decrease in their activity ability. This decline severely affects their quality of life and prognosis. The guidelines indicate that early postoperative exercise management in PD patients can effectively maintain good physical function. Activities such as walking and jogging do not significantly increase intra-abdominal pressure without emptying the peritoneal dialysate. Nevertheless, during the period of abdominal fluid retention in PD patients, they experience strong foreign body sensation and worry about the potential risks of catheter displacement, fracture, bleeding, and PD-related peritonitis owing to inappropriate exercise, resulting in a reduced motivation to exercise and a fear of movement, which is commonly referred to as kinesiophobia in psychological terms.

Kinesiophobia is defined as an excessive, irrational, and debilitating fear of physical movement and activity due to the fear of painful injury or reinjury. Back et al. reported that kinesiophobia significantly affects patients' attendance at exercise rehabilitation, resulting in inadequate exercise levels and decreased compliance, which can severely impact rehabilitation outcomes. Studies have indicated that insufficient exercise can lead to a decline in physical function, muscle atrophy, and sarcopenia in PD patients. Additionally, reduced strength increases the incidence of falls and fractures, increasing the risk of adverse outcomes. Király et al. reported that physical inactivity is associated with decreased quality of life and increased mortality risk in PD patients. Furthermore, exercise has been shown to improve depression and sleep, serving as a crucial nonpharmacological intervention. Consequently, it is vital to address kinesiophobia in PD patients to reduce its prevalence and increase patients' motivation to exercise.

### Clinical features and genetic mechanisms of anxiety, fear, and avoidance: a comprehensive review of five anxiety disorders [^117HzReU]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

AG

Fear

Extremely high (★★★★★), particularly in situations where individuals perceive that they cannot escape or receive help during a panic attack. Common fears include being in crowds, open spaces, or public transportation.

Anxiety

High and pervasive (★★★★☆), not only in feared situations but also in anticipation of entering these environments.

Avoidance

High (★★★★☆), with individuals often becoming housebound, severely limiting their social and occupational functioning. The onset of avoidance among individuals with AG typically occurs between late teens and mid-30s; however, AG may also develop following PD.

SP

Fear

Extremely high (★★★★☆ to ★★★★★), directly tied to a specific object or situation (e.g. heights, animals, flying). Exposure to a phobic stimulus triggers immediate fear responses, often resulting in panic-like symptoms.

Anxiety

Moderate anxiety (★★☆☆☆ to ★★★☆☆), which is generally low in the absence of the phobic stimulus but can escalate to high levels when the feared object or situation is anticipated or encountered.

Avoidance

Very high (★★★★☆ to ★★★★★), with individuals going to great lengths to avoid the phobic stimulus, leading to significant lifestyle restrictions and a reduced quality of life. The onset of avoidance among individuals with SP is typically in childhood, and earlier onset often leads to more ingrained avoidance behaviors over time.

### Influencing mechanisms of kinesiophobia in middle-aged and elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a cross-sectional study [^115ZpUyS]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common respiratory disease, which currently affects up to 391.9 million people worldwide, with the highest prevalence in people over 40 years of age. In China it is around 13.7% among people over 40 years of age, and it is expected that the total prevalence will continue to increase, reaching 24% by 2030. By 2023, COPD will be the third leading cause of death worldwide. Pulmonary rehabilitation is the first choice of non-pharmacological treatment for COPD patients, and exercise program is a core part of it. A growing body of research suggests that a modest increase in physical activity can significantly improve health outcomes in COPD patients. However, the current status of pulmonary rehabilitation participation is not encouraging, and kinesiophobia is an important psychological barrier to participation in COPD patients.

Kinesiophobia is an excessive and irrational fear of physical activity or exercise due to fear of injury or re-injury. One study showed that the prevalence of kinesiophobia in COPD patients was as high as 93%. A study has found that kinesiophobia significantly reduces participation in pulmonary rehabilitation in patients. As patients with COPD often experience dyspnoea and persistent fatigue, they will show more kinesiophobia, which may reduce their willingness to participate in pulmonary rehabilitation. At the same time, the recurrence of COPD symptoms leads to anxiety and depression in patients. This negative psychological state acts as a risk factor for controlling behaviours severely constraining COPD patients' participation in exercise rehabilitation. In addition, it has been demonstrated that exercise self-efficacy is also one of the important factors affecting patients' exercise rehabilitation. The reason for this may be that COPD patients' long-term symptoms such as dyspnoea and anxiety cause low levels of exercise self-efficacy in patients, which leads to avoidance of exercise. In contrast, high levels of social support can increase patients' exercise self-efficacy, thus reducing the level of kinesiophobia. Thus, it can be seen that exercise self-efficacy plays an important role in kinesiophobia, but the mechanism of action with the factors is not clear and needs further verification.

### Clinical features and genetic mechanisms of anxiety, fear, and avoidance: a comprehensive review of five anxiety disorders [^114JLRVA]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

SAD

Fear

Very high (★★★★☆), particularly in situations involving potential social rejection or when a negative evaluation is anticipated. The fear is typically focused on social interactions or performance situations.

Anxiety

High and persistent (★★★★☆), often occurring well in advance of the feared event. Individuals may experience anticipatory anxiety days or weeks before the actual event.

Avoidance

Significant (★★★★☆), leading individuals to avoid any situation where they fear being judged. This avoidance can severely affect social and occupational functioning. The age of onset for SAD is typically early adolescence, around age 13, and avoidance behaviors may become deeply ingrained if left untreated.

GAD

Fear

Low (★★☆☆☆), lower than in other anxiety disorders. Fear in GAD patients is often not tied to specific triggers but is generalized to involve multiple domains, such as health, finances, or safety.

Anxiety

Extremely high and chronic (★★★★★), affecting multiple areas of life. Individuals experience excessive uncontrollable worry, which affects more days than not over a period of six months.

Avoidance

Mild (★★☆☆☆), less pronounced than other anxiety disorders, although individuals may avoid situations that heighten their worries, such as stressful tasks or conflict situations. The onset of avoidance among individuals with GAD typically occurs in early adulthood, often in the early 30 s, with avoidance being less prominent but growing over time as a coping mechanism for chronic worry.

PD

Fear

High (★★★☆☆ to ★★★★☆), extremely high during panic attacks. Individuals often experience intense fear of losing control, dying, or going insane.

Anxiety

High anticipatory anxiety (★★★★☆), with individuals fearing the occurrence of future panic attacks, which can become as disabling as the attacks themselves.

Avoidance

Moderate to high (★★★☆☆ to ★★★★☆). Individuals begin to avoid places or situations where they have experienced panic attacks, fearing recurrence. This avoidance can lead to the development of AG, where individuals may avoid leaving their homes altogether. The onset of avoidance among individuals with PD typically ranges between late adolescence and early adulthood, around the ages of 20–24 years.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^111KwRts]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Core features of DSM-5 pediatric anxiety disorders — According to DSM-5, separation anxiety is characterized by developmentally inappropriate, excessive worry or distress associated with separation from a primary caregiver or major attachment figure, selective mutism is characterized by absence of speech in certain social situations despite the presence of speech in other situations, specific phobia is characterized by excessive fear or worry about a specific object or situation, social anxiety is characterized by excessive fear or worry about being negatively evaluated by others in social or performance situations, panic is characterized by unexpected, recurrent episodes of numerous cognitive manifestations, agoraphobia is characterized by excessive fear or worry being in situations in which the individual may be unable to escape or get help should panic-like or other overwhelming or embarrassing symptoms occur, generalized anxiety is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worries regarding numerous everyday situations or activities, and substance/medication-induced anxiety and anxiety due to another medical condition are characterized by anxiety occurring in the context of substance/medication use or a physical illness.

### Assessing the clinical utility of agoraphobia in the context of panic disorder [^1151p5m5]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

In the DSM-IV, a panic disorder (PD) diagnosis includes specification of agoraphobia, which is primarily an index of situational avoidance due to fear of panic. No other anxiety diagnosis requires specification of level of avoidance. This raises the question as to whether agoraphobia provides unique information beyond the core features of PD (i.e., panic attacks and panic-related worry). The incremental validity of agoraphobia, defined using DSM-IV specifiers versus level of situational avoidance, was examined in relation to the expression and treatment of PD (N = 146). Analyses indicate that agoraphobia status adds uniquely to the prediction of PD symptoms, impairment, and response to treatment. However, level of situational avoidance, defined either as a continuous or dichotomous variable, appears to have greater utility compared to the DSM-IV method of classifying agoraphobia. In summary, the agoraphobia specifier seems to have clinical utility but this could be improved by focusing on a dimensional assessment of situational avoidance.

### Diversity of effective treatments of panic attacks: what do they have in common? [^117KVLNF]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

By comparing efficacious psychological therapies of different kinds, inferences about common effective treatment mechanisms can be made. We selected six therapies for review on the basis of the diversity of their theoretical rationales and evidence for superior efficacy: psychoanalytic psychotherapy, hypercapnic breathing training, hypocapnic breathing training, reprocessing with and without eye-movement desensitization, muscle relaxation, and cognitive behavior therapy. The likely common element of all these therapies is that they reduce the immediate expectancy of a panic attack, disrupting the vicious circle of fearing fear. Modifying expectation is usually regarded as a placebo mechanism in psychotherapy, but may be a specific treatment mechanism for panic. The fact that this is seldom the rationale communicated to the patient creates a moral dilemma: Is it ethical for therapists to mislead patients to help them? Pragmatic justification of a successful practice is a way out of this dilemma. Therapies should be evaluated that deal with expectations directly by promoting positive thinking or by fostering non-expectancy.

### The cost of fear: avoidant decision making in a spider gambling task [^1116E5ug]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Individuals with anxiety disorders typically avoid fear-relevant stimuli even if they miss potential rewards. However, few studies have accounted for such costs of fear-related avoidance in doing so. In this study, 51 spider fearful and 49 non-fearful participants completed the Spider Gambling Task, our modification of the Iowa Gambling Task, to investigate whether fear-relevant stimuli trigger avoidant decisions in the presence of potential rewards. In one version, advantageous choices were associated with pictures of spiders, whereas the same pictures were associated with disadvantageous choices in another version. Fearful participants generally avoided choices associated with pictures of spiders, which resulted in lower overall gains in the version with advantageous spider decks. Although this relative avoidance was sustained, fearful participants progressively approach more advantageous spider choices. These findings demonstrate that phobic fear results in irrational avoidant decisions which can result in considerable cost. Potential long-term rewards for approach may, however, diminish absolute avoidance behavior.

### Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition, text revision (DSM-5-TR ™) [^1143fnuX]. APA (2022). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa" for anorexia nervosa.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis and classification of anorexia nervosa. The tool is used to identify the presence of anorexia nervosa in patients and further classify the severity and type of the disorder, as well as the current state of remission.

The primary components of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa include the restriction of energy intake leading to significantly low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, and disturbance in the way one's body weight or shape is experienced. Additional components include the presence of recurrent episodes of binge eating or purging behavior, or the absence of such behavior with weight loss accomplished primarily through dieting, fasting, or excessive exercise. The current body mass index (BMI) or BMI percentile for children and adolescents is also considered, with specific ranges indicating mild, moderate, severe, or extreme anorexia nervosa.

The tool also takes into account the state of remission, with criteria for partial remission (where low body weight is no longer present but fear of gaining weight or disturbances in self-perception of weight and shape persist) and full remission (where none of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time).

The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa is used to determine the presence of anorexia nervosa and its severity, type, and state of remission, providing a comprehensive diagnostic and classification system for this disorder.

The task involves summarizing the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa, focusing on a method that evaluates inputs, processes these using certain computational criteria, and produces outputs based on this evaluation. Below is a detailed explanation of how such a diagnostic system might work, including key interpretations of the criteria.

The process starts with gathering specific information about the individual, which includes symptoms and behaviors that align with the DSM-5 criteria for diagnosing anorexia nervosa.

1. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to a significantly low body weight relative to age, sex, development, and physical health.
2. Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though underweight.
3. Disturbance in the way one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight.

The system evaluates these criteria through inputs that could include medical histories, physician observations, and self-reported symptoms.

To perform a diagnosis using these inputs, the computation is essentially a checklist format:

- Check if the individual meets the criterion of significant restriction of energy intake.
- Determine if there is an intense fear of gaining weight or acts that prevent weight gain.
- Assess if there is a disturbed perception of body weight or shape and if there is a failure to recognize the seriousness of low weight.

If the individual meets all three criteria, the system outputs a potential diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. The DSM-5 emphasizes the importance of clinical judgment and the necessity of considering other mental health factors.

The output, in this case, can either confirm that the diagnosis criteria for anorexia nervosa are met or suggest that further evaluation is needed. The result includes the following parts:

- A detailed list of criteria met.
- Any criteria not met and possible reasons why.
- Recommendations for follow-up actions, such as further medical examinations or consultations with a mental health professional.

### Out of the shadows and into the spotlight: social blunders fuel fear of self-exposure in social anxiety disorder [^114RSQm8]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

In a study designed to clarify and extend previous research on social blunders in social anxiety, 32 participants with social anxiety disorder (SAD), 25 anxious control (AC) participants with anxiety disorders other than SAD, and 25 healthy control (HC) participants with no history of anxiety problems estimated the costs of hypothetical blunders committed by either themselves or by others. Participants with SAD rated the costs of their own imagined blunders as highly inflated relative to both AC and HC participants. In contrast, for blunders participants imagined others committing, only SAD and healthy control participants' cost estimates differed from one another. Moreover, concerns about revealing self-flaws — and, in particular, about appearing socially incompetent — accounted for significant, unique variance in SAD participants' exaggerated cost estimates of self blunders, over and above symptoms of social anxiety and depression. These results enhance our understanding of how and why socially anxious individuals negatively appraise social blunders and help to clarify the potential function and role of social mishap exposures in the treatment of SAD.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11535HZz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — screening and thresholds state that the Society no longer endorses the target 25(OH)D level of 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) and no longer endorses specific 25(OH)D levels to define vitamin D sufficiency, insufficiency, and deficiency; the panel did not find clinical trial evidence supporting distinct 25(OH)D thresholds tied to outcome-specific benefits. The guideline also suggests against routine 25(OH)D screening (in the absence of well-established indications), including in adults and children with obesity, in adults and children with dark complexions, and during pregnancy.

### Sertraline hydrochloride (Sertraline) [^116gE1zv]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride in long-term use, that is, for more than 3 menstrual cycles, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Social Anxiety Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia in adults.

The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of social anxiety disorder was established in two placebo-controlled trials of adult outpatients with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder as defined by DSM-IV criteria (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Social anxiety disorder, as defined by DSM-IV, is characterized by marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations involving exposure to unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by others and by fears of acting in a humiliating or embarrassing way. Exposure to the feared social situation almost always provokes anxiety and feared social or performance situations are avoided or else are endured with intense anxiety or distress. In addition, patients recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable and the avoidance and anticipatory anxiety of the feared situation is associated with functional impairment or marked distress.

The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response in adult patients with social anxiety disorder for up to 24 weeks following 20 weeks of Sertraline hydrochloride treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. Physicians who prescribe Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

### Age-related differences in the effect of chronic alcohol on cognition and the brain: a systematic review [^115idjXB]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Other behavioral outcomes

Anxiety: AUD is highly comorbid with anxiety disorders, especially in adolescence. While anxiety is not strictly a cognitive outcome, it is related to altered cognitive functioning. Many studies assessing the effects of ethanol on the rodent brain and cognition also include anxiety-related measures. Multiple paradigms have been developed to elicit behaviors thought to reflect anxiety in rodents (e.g. rearing, startle, avoidance, etc.). In the open field test (OFT), anxiety is indexed as the tendency to stay close to perimeter walls as animals have a natural aversion to brightly lit open spaces. In the elevated plus maze paradigm, rodents are placed at the center of an elevated four-arm maze with two open arms two closed arms. The open arms elicit unconditioned fear of heights/open spaces and the closed arms elicit the proclivity for enclosed, dark spaces. Anxiety is indexed as entries/duration of time in open vs. closed arms, as well as rearing, freezing, or other postural indices of anxiety. In startle paradigms, the startle response is a defensive mechanism reflecting anxiety which follows a sudden, unpredictable stimulus (e.g. tones, light). In light-dark box paradigms, anxiety is elicited using a testing apparatus with a light and dark compartment, relying on the conflict between natural aversions to well-lit spaces and the tendency to explore new areas. Percentage of time spent in the light compartment, latency to return to the dark compartment, movement between compartments (transitions), and rearing-behavior are measured as indices of anxiety. Anxiety can also be assessed using a social interaction test with an unfamiliar partner, with approach and avoidance behaviors measured to index anxiety. In the novel object test (NOT), anxiety is elicited by the introduction of a new object in the rodent's environment. The amount of contacts and time spent in contact with the object is used as an index of anxiety. Similarly, in the marble-burying test (MBT), novel marbles are placed in an environment and the amount of defensive burying of the objects is used as an index of anxiety.
Eleven studies examined anxiety-like behavior in rodents with mixed results across paradigms. Overall, five of the eleven studies observed age-related differences.
Two studies used the OFT, finding no effects of voluntary (2w, 4 h/day access) or forced (12/day vapor) ethanol exposure on anxiety-like behavior in adolescents or adult rats during withdrawal (7–9 h) or after a brief abstinence period (4 days). One study used both the MBT and NOT after voluntary ethanol consumption (2 h/d for 2 weeks; no abstinence) and observed higher anxiety in ethanol-exposed adults and reduced anxiety in ethanol-exposed adolescents compared to controls as indexed by marble burying. However, no age effects were observed in response to a novel object, with reduced interaction with the novel object in both age groups after chronic exposure.
Four studies used the elevated maze paradigm with mixed results. Only one study observed age-related differences in mice after chronic exposure (8–10w vapor). Adolescents showed reduced anxiety compared to adults during the acute withdrawal period, but all mice were kept under chronic social isolation and unpredictable stress conditions, which may have affected the results. Two studies in rats found no effect of intermittent (1 g/kg) or binge-like (5 g/kg) exposure in either age group after short (24 h) or sustained abstinence (20d). A third study observed heightened anxiety in both age groups after intermittent exposure (4 g/kg), with anxiety increasing with prolonged abstinence periods (24 h to 12d).
Three rat studies used a startle paradigm to assess anxiety. Two observed reduced acoustic startle responses after ethanol exposure (12 h/d vapor) in both age groups during acute withdrawal periods (7–10 h) and following more sustained abstinence (6d). In the other study, light-potentiated startle was also reduced in both ages during days 1–10 of withdrawal after binge-like exposure (2d on, 2d off), but age-related differences emerged when the rats were re-exposed via a 4-day binge (1–4/kg). Then, only adults showed higher levels of light-potentiated startle compared to controls, suggesting that ethanol pre-exposure increases anxiety in adults but not adolescents when re-exposed to ethanol after withdrawal.
Two studies used the light-dark box paradigm with mixed results. Only adult rats showed increased mild anxiety-like behaviors during early withdrawal (7–10 h) after chronic vapor exposure 12 h/d). In contrast, no age-related differences emerged after voluntary ethanol consumption (18 h/d access; 3d/w for 6 weeks), with male mice showing less anxiety-like behavior in both ages. In contrast, the one study using the social interaction test observed reduced anxiety in adult mice compared to both adolescents and age-matched controls during early withdrawal (4–6 h) after chronic, unpredictable vapor exposure.
In summary, there is inconsistent evidence for age-related differences in the effect of chronic ethanol exposure on anxiety outcomes in rodents. The substantial differences across studies in how anxiety was elicited and measured make it challenging to draw strong conclusions. In the five studies that found age-related differences, adults tend to show higher levels of anxiety, particularly during early withdrawal; however, the opposite was found in the one study examining anxiety in social interactions. Six studies did not observe any age-related differences. Overall, adolescents may be less sensitive to the anxiety-inducing effects of chronic alcohol exposure.
Social behavior: Two studies were identified that examined the effects of chronic ethanol exposure on social behavior in rats, with both observing age-related differences. After chronic exposure (1 g/kg, 7d), followed by a brief abstinence period (24–48 h), one study found a decrease in social preference in adolescents only, while the other study found no ethanol-related effects on social behavior (2 g/kg, 10d). After acute challenges, age and treatment interactions emerged in both studies, but the directions of the results are inconsistent. In the first study, adolescents showed increased social preference, as indexed by the number of cross-overs between compartments toward and away from a peer, across multiple acute doses (0.5–1.0 g/kg) administered immediately before testing, while adults showed no changes in social preference. In contrast, Morales et al. found evidence for age-related temporal differences in social activity after acute challenge, with adults showing decreased social impairment five minutes post injection (1 g/kg) and adolescents (1.25 g/kg) after 25 min compared to age-matched controls.
The findings from these two studies paint a complicated and inconsistent picture of the effects of ethanol on social behavior in adults and adolescents warranting further research. One study found support for a larger effect of chronic ethanol on adolescent social behavior compared to adults, while the other did not observe effects of ethanol in either group. One study found support for a larger effect of chronic plus acute ethanol intoxication on social behavior, with the opposite observed in the other.

### A comparison of DSM-5 and DSM-IV agoraphobia in the world mental health surveys [^11538SPA]. Depression and Anxiety (2019). Medium credibility.

One of the reasons for the controversy whether AG can be regarded as a disorder that is independent of PD (Grant et al. 2006; Wittchen et al. 2008, 1998) is that AG without a history of PD is not typically seen in clinical studies and it has been suggested that many individuals diagnosed with AG in epidemiological studies actually suffer from SP (Horwath, Lish, Johnson, Hornig, & Weissman, 1993). However, another study validated the existence of AG in the absence of panic attacks in a survey through a re‐evaluation with structured interviews (Faravelli, Cosci, Rotella, Faravelli, & Dell'Osso, 2008). A better distinction between SP and AG probably reflects better measurements of AG in recent surveys (Andrews & Slade, 2002; Wittchen et al. 2010). For example, to meet criteria for AG in this study, agoraphobic anxiety had to apply to at least two situations. The low percentage of AG cases seen in clinical care might also be the result of these individuals being less likely to seek help (Andrews & Slade, 2002; Wittchen et al. 1998), potentially as a result of avoidance behavior (Andrews & Slade, 2002). Indeed, the percentage of individuals with AG seeking treatment was lower compared with rates for individuals with PD in the WMH surveys (de Jonge, Roest, Lim, Levinson, & Scott, 2018; Roest et al. 2018).

### Deconstructing acrophobia: physiological and psychological precursors to developing a fear of heights [^114YUFYp]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acrophobia is one of the most prevalent phobias, affecting as many as 1 in 20 individuals. Of course, heights often evoke fear in the general population too, and this suggests that acrophobia might actually represent the hypersensitive manifestation of an everyday, rational fear. In this study, we assessed the role of sensory and cognitive variables in acrophobia.

Methods

Forty-five participants (Mean age 25.07 years, 71% female) were assessed using a booklet with self-reports as well as several behavioral measures. The data analysis consisted in multivariate linear regression using fear of heights as the outcome variable.

Results

The regression analyses found that visual field dependence (measured with the rod and frame test), postural control (measured with the Sharpened Romberg Test), space and motion discomfort (measured with the Situational Characteristics Questionnaire), and bodily symptoms (measured with the Bodily Sensation Questionnaire) all serve as strong predictors for fear of heights (Adjusted r(2) = .697, P < .0001). Trait anxiety (measured with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y-2) was not related with fear of heights, suggesting that this higher order vulnerability factor is not necessary for explaining this particular specific phobia in a large number of individuals.

Conclusion

The findings reveal that fear of heights is an expression of a largely sensory phenomena, which can produce strong feelings of discomfort and fear in the otherwise calm individuals. We propose a theory that embraces all these factors and provides new insight into the aetiology and treatment of this prevalent and debilitating fear.

### Fear-relevant illusory correlations in different fears and anxiety disorders: a review of the literature [^113MXyZ1]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Fearful individuals often overestimate the relationship between fear-relevant stimuli and aversive consequences. Such fear-relevant illusory correlations (ICs) might be involved in the maintenance of anxiety disorders. In this literature review, we found clear evidence that ICs are present and enhanced in fear of animals. We also revealed some evidence for ICs related to fear of flying, social anxiety, contamination fear, panic disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, but with considerably less clarity. Fear-relevant ICs seem to be best explained by both a priori expectancies and biased encoding of the experienced associations. Studies to date suggest that one important biased encoding process is the enhanced aversiveness/salience of fear-relevant outcomes. Future studies may improve insight by developing more reliable IC measures and testing the effect of encoding processes on treatment outcomes.

### Looking beyond fear: the extinction of other emotions implicated in anxiety disorders [^11759Q6S]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Previous research examining anxiety has traditionally focused on models of fear. More recently, attention has been directed to the role of disgust as an important emotion in the context of certain anxiety disorders. Further, it has been suggested that disgust, a form of evaluative responding, may be resistant to extinction and may contribute to relapse. However, previous work on this has largely relied on self-report ratings. In the current experiment, using a disgust conditioning and extinction procedure, disgust reactions were indeed shown to be resistant to extinction, as indexed by both self-report and an objective behavioral measure (visual avoidance). Furthermore, our research shows that individuals with greater levels of disgust sensitivity exhibit heightened resistance to extinction. In addition, expectancy of the disgusting US during extinction was dissociated from measures of disgust responding. Given that the treatment of choice for anxiety disorders (exposure therapy) is based on models of extinction, this research suggests that current treatments for anxiety disorders may not be adequately targeting disgust reactions, a crucial maintaining factor in certain anxiety disorders. As such, this inattention to disgust reactions may reduce the effectiveness of treatment in the short-term or may leave the patient vulnerable to relapse in the long-term.

### D-serine as the gatekeeper of NMDA receptor activity: implications for the pharmacologic management of anxiety disorders [^1113ArKi]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Fear, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are quite common and debilitating, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of ~28% in Western populations. They are associated with excessive fear reactions, often including an inability to extinguish learned fear, increased avoidance behavior, as well as altered cognition and mood. There is an extensive literature demonstrating the importance of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function in regulating these behaviors. NMDARs require the binding of a co-agonist, D-serine or glycine, at the glycine modulatory site (GMS) to function. D-serine is now garnering attention as the primary NMDAR co-agonist in limbic brain regions implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. L-serine is synthesized by astrocytes, which is then transported to neurons for conversion to D-serine by serine racemase (SR), a model we term the 'serine shuttle'. The neuronally-released D-serine is what regulates NMDAR activity. Our review discusses how the systems that regulate the synaptic availability of D-serine, a critical gatekeeper of NMDAR-dependent activation, could be targeted to improve the pharmacologic management of anxiety-related disorders where the desired outcomes are the facilitation of fear extinction, as well as mood and cognitive enhancement.

### The high place phenomenon: associations with markers of positive and negative mental health in individuals suffering from specific phobia or agoraphobia [^111wBrBE]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Background

The Call of the Void phenomenon (also known as 'L'Appel du Vide' in French) is a popular psychological concept that describes a seemingly inexplicable tendency to consider dangerous or self‐destructive actions in certain situations. Many people have experienced the sudden urge to jump when standing on a high place, such as a bridge or viewing platform. It has been speculated to be associated with suicidal ideation or a hidden death wish. Despite being a familiar experience for many, there is relatively little research on the subject. The term high place phenomenon (HPP) was coined by Hames et al. who were the first to investigate the concept. Overall, HPP was only investigated in two studies (Hames et al; Teismann et al.). In an American sample, Hames et al. found that 50% of participants who never considered suicide in their lives experienced aspects of the phenomenon at least once in their lives. In the group of lifetime suicidal ideators, more than 75% of the sample reported experiencing the urge to jump from a window of a tall building or from a bridge. Teismann et al. showed that 60% of a German online sample and 46% of a German patient sample were familiar with experiencing the HPP. In line with previous findings, the HPP was reported more frequently in the group of lifetime suicidal ideators (78.5%), but was still known to 45% of lifetime non‐ideators. In their studies, Hames et al. and Teismann et al. found associations of the HPP with depression and anxiety sensitivity. Anxiety sensitivity is a tendency to be fearful of arousal‐related bodily sensations and anxiety‐related symptoms (Reiss et al.). Based on these findings, Hames et al. interpreted the HPP as the result of a misinterpreted safety signal in a potentially dangerous situation ('Back up, you might fall'). However, the association between the HPP and depression, anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation could not be found in the German patient sample (Teismann et al.). In their study, Teismann et al. compare the HPP to intrusive thoughts: Intrusive thoughts are unpleasant, fleeting and egodystonic thoughts or images of, for example, sexual, violent and blasphemous content and are often associated with anxiety or distress (Berry and Laskey).

### The anxiety spectrum and the reflex physiology of defense: from circumscribed fear to broad distress [^111gn46g]. Depression and Anxiety (2012). Low credibility.

Guided by the diagnostic nosology, anxiety patients are expected to show defensive hyperarousal during affective challenge, irrespective of the principal phenotype. In the current study, patients representing the whole spectrum of anxiety disorders (i.e., specific phobia, social phobia, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), posttraumatic stress disorder(PTSD)), and healthy community control participants, completed an imagery-based fear elicitation paradigm paralleling conventional intervention techniques. Participants imagined threatening and neutral narratives as physiological responses were recorded. Clear evidence emerged for exaggerated reactivity to clinically relevant imagery — most pronounced in startle reflex responding. However, defensive propensity varied across principal anxiety disorders. Disorders characterized by focal fear and impairment (e.g., specific phobia) showed robust fear potentiation. Conversely, for disorders of long-enduring, pervasive apprehension and avoidance with broad anxiety and depression comorbidity (e.g. PTSD secondary to cumulative trauma, GAD), startle responses were paradoxically diminished to all aversive contents. Patients whose expressed symptom profiles were intermediate between focal fearfulness and broad anxious-misery in both severity and chronicity exhibited a still heightened but more generalized physiological propensity to respond defensively. Importantly, this defensive physiological gradient — the inverse of self-reported distress — was evident not only between but also within disorders. These results highlight that fear circuitry could be dysregulated in chronic, pervasive anxiety, and preliminary functional neuroimaging findings suggest that deficient amygdala recruitment could underlie attenuated reflex responding. In summary, adaptive defensive engagement during imagery may be compromised by long-term dysphoria and stress-a phenomenon with implications for prognosis and treatment planning.

### The Phoenix: a 20-year patient-doctor journey [^1113L1TY]. Annals of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In a previous story ("On Blindness and Blind Spots") 1 I sought to understand the psychological causes of a long-time patient's myriad of seemingly inexplicable symptoms. Since then, I learned more of her story, which helped me understand my patient with a new perspective. Dana shared with me, and now with the readers, short poetic pieces she has written to describe her traumatic experiences as a child-and the efforts she makes as a grown woman to heal, like the phoenix rises from its ashes. The value of belief in one's patient, alongside patience and the opportunity to build a trusting relationship over many years-as the truth has a pace of its own-are underscored.

### Psychological therapies versus pharmacological interventions for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults [^111d5kYR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Panic disorder is common and deleterious to mental well-being. Psychological therapies and pharmacological interventions are both used as treatments for panic disorder with and without agoraphobia. However, there are no up-to-date reviews on the comparative efficacy and acceptability of the two treatment modalities, and such a review is necessary for improved treatment planning for this disorder.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and acceptability of psychological therapies versus pharmacological interventions for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Specialised Register on 11 September 2015. This register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to present), Embase (1974 to present), and PsycINFO (1967 to present). We cross-checked reference lists of relevant papers and systematic reviews. We did not apply any restrictions on date, language, or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies with pharmacological interventions for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia as diagnosed by operationalised criteria in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved any disagreements in consultation with a third review author. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI). We used the random-effects model throughout.

Main Results

We included 16 studies with a total of 966 participants in the present review. Eight of the studies were conducted in Europe, four in the USA, two in the Middle East, and one in Southeast Asia. None of the studies reported long-term remission/response (long term being six months or longer from treatment commencement). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in terms of short-term remission (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17; 6 studies; 334 participants) or short-term response (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.86; 5 studies; 277 participants) (very low-quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and SSRIs in treatment acceptability as measured using dropouts for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22; 6 studies; 334 participants; low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and tricyclic antidepressants in terms of short-term remission (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; 3 studies; 229 participants), short-term response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.10; 4 studies; 270 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.30; 5 studies; 430 participants) (low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and other antidepressants in terms of short-term remission (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.67; 3 studies; 135 participants; very low-quality evidence) and evidence that psychological therapies did not significantly increase or decrease the short-term response over other antidepressants (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.37; 3 studies; 128 participants) or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.65; 3 studies; 180 participants) (low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and benzodiazepines in terms of short-term remission (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.65; 3 studies; 95 participants), short-term response (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.58; 2 studies; 69 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.36; 3 studies; 116 participants) (very low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressant alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of short-term remission (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05; 11 studies; 663 participants) and short-term response (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; 12 studies; 800 participants) (low-quality evidence), and there was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressants alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of treatment acceptability as measured by dropouts for any reason (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.51; 13 studies; 909 participants; very low-quality evidence). The risk of selection bias and reporting bias was largely unclear. Preplanned subgroup and sensitivity analyses limited to trials with longer-term, quality-controlled, or individual psychological therapies suggested that antidepressants might be more effective than psychological therapies for some outcomes. There were no data to contribute to a comparison between psychological therapies and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and subsequent adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence in this review was often imprecise. The superiority of either therapy over the other is uncertain due to the low and very low quality of the evidence with regard to short-term efficacy and treatment acceptability, and no data were available regarding adverse effects. The sensitivity analysis and investigation of the sources of heterogeneity indicated three possible influential factors: quality control of psychological therapies, the length of intervention, and the individual modality of psychological therapies. Future studies should examine the long-term effects after intervention or treatment continuation and should provide information on risk of bias, especially with regard to selection and reporting biases.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1176GTJo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D screening with a 25(OH)D test for adults with dark complexion — background: "Dark complexion" is defined by a phenotype that involves dark color of eyes, hair, and skin, and the panel was especially interested in skin pigmentation determined by the amount of melanin that can interfere with the production of vitamin D in response to exposure to UV-B rays. People at higher risk of low vitamin D status include individuals with dark skin, generally those whose ancestors originated from sunnier regions of the planet, including those with African heritage and descendants of indigenous peoples of the Americas, Oceania, and Asia. Some but not all studies suggest that the increase in 25(OH)D levels in response to vitamin D supplementation is not as robust in those with dark complexion compared to those with lighter complexion, but many such studies assess groups according to race/ethnicity rather than skin complexion, introducing uncertainty regarding the degree to which dark complexion per se impacts circulating 25(OH)D concentrations.

### Tampa scale of kinesiophobia for heart Turkish version study: cross-cultural adaptation, exploratory factor analysis, and reliability [^1114oigv]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

In recent years, secondary prevention programs focusing on physical activity and cardiac rehabilitation have been widely used to prevent all cardiac-related causes of mortality and morbidity. However, poor participation and adherence to the programs are growing problems for this population because of limited daily life activities. Worsening disease symptoms cause fear of movement and avoidance, resulting in activity limitation. Most pulmonary arterial hypertension and heart failure patients are fearful of being physically active because they anticipate shortness of breath, dizziness, or chest pain. Thus, in the long term, limited physical activity may result in negative physical and psychosocial consequences.

The term "kinesiophobia", or the fear of movement, was first introduced in 1990 by Kori et alin the context of lower back pain in order to assess musculoskeletal pain. They defined kinesiophobia as "an excessive, irrational, and debilitating fear of movement and activity resulting from a feeling of vulnerability to painful injury or re-injury". They developed the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), a 17-item scale to assess kinesiophobia. This scale has been translated into several languages, including Turkish, and checked for reliability and validity.–The TSK was later adapted for cardiac diseases by Bäck et aland designated the TSK Swedish Version for the Heart (TSK-SV Heart). The TSK-SV Heart includes the following constructs: perceived danger for heart problem, avoidance of exercise, fear of injury, and dysfunctional self based on the original framework by Kori et al. The TSK-SV Heart has been found to be reliable and valid for heart diseases.

There is a widespread awareness among researchers on the importance of kinesiophobia assessment related to serious cardiac diseases. Therefore, the aims of this study were 1) to perform a translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the TSK-SV Heart among patients with cardiac disease (pulmonary hypertension and heart failure), to investigate the scale's validity, and to conduct exploratory factor analysis (confirmatory factor analysis has been done previously in other languages) with responsiveness within a Turkish-speaking population sample and 2) to identify the presence of kinesiophobia in Turkish patients with pulmonary hypertension and heart failure.

2 METHODS

2.1 Survey samples

Data came from 27 surveys administered in low/lower‐middle income countries, upper‐middle income countries, and high‐income countries. A total of 136,357 respondents participated. Interviews were conducted face‐to‐face in respondent homes. Adults were selected based on multistage clustered area probability sampling designs designed to generate samples that were representative of the household populations in the countries. The details of within‐country sampling methods are described in detail elsewhere (Heeringa et al. 2008; Pennell et al. 2008).

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^1119mfgV]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Crisis and emergency risk communication — panic management guidance — states "Do not try to dispel panic" and that "Panic during a crisis is rare. People nearly always behave in a rational way during a crisis". When "told what to do by those in authority, people followed instructions", but "If no one is in charge and no advice is forthcoming people may:" "Assess the situation, and, based on their experiences, determine a course of action", "Take calm, self-protective actions that seem rational and appropriate to them, even if authorities recommend otherwise", and "Feel anxiety, fear, and even delayed panic attacks or PTSD when the crisis ends". The guidance advises to "Recognize the differences among your audience" because "A person anticipating high risk is much more likely to respond inappropriately than a person in the heat of the battle, who will act on the information and doesn't have the time to rethink", and notes that "the more removed people are from the real danger (in place and time), the more likely they are to allow their emotions full range". It emphasizes that "The condition most conducive to panic isn't bad news — it's conflicting messages from those in authority", with people upset when "They can't trust what those in authority are telling them", and warns, "If you start hedging or hiding the bad news, you increase the risk of a confused, angry, and uncooperative public".

### Psychometric properties of the French and english versions of the claustrophobia questionnaire (CLQ) [^116eVF86]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Research suggests that Claustrophobia, defined as the fear of enclosed spaces, may be better conceptualized as two separate, but related fears: (1) the fear of suffocation, and (2) the fear of restriction. The Claustrophobia Questionnaire (CLQ) is a self-report measure designed to assess these two fears. The original English version of the CLQ has demonstrated excellent psychometric properties. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate a French version of the CLQ for use in clinical and research settings and to replicate the psychometric findings of previous investigations of the English CLQ. Language-appropriate versions of the CLQ, as well as self-report measures of phobic, anxious and depressive symptomatology were distributed to undergraduate students at three Montréal, Québec universities. Results show that the CLQ possesses strong psychometric properties in both languages, and that the English and French versions of the CLQ appear to measure identical constructs. These findings are discussed in terms of proposed applications of the CLQ.

### Vulnerability as practice in diagnosing multiple conditions [^111ZMNTd]. Medical Humanities (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Hidden symptoms

Diagnosis, as a practice of matching sets of symptoms to categories of ill-health or disability, becomes complicated when particular symptoms may be variably present or hidden in the bodies of those negotiating multiple conditions. The presence of multiple conditions sometimes obscures particular presentations of illnesses and disabilities at particular times and in particular spaces. As such, attending to how those living with multiple conditions negotiate their medical encounters reveals fluctuations in which particular illness or disability is prominent relative to other illness and disability.

Our participants' accounts reveal how they are vulnerable with respect to their capacity to access appropriate care through a diagnosis, and how the biomedical model of diagnosis itself may be understood as vulnerable with respect to dealing with multiple conditions in the impossibility of isolating the presentation of any one illness or disability during the clinical encounter. The emphasis here is on the health system, not the specific physicians who practice within its framework. This notion of a vulnerability as an inherent incapacity of both patient and system in the face of multiple conditions is illustrated by Kirsty's account of her experiences of OCD, anxiety and depression:

… the depression was the first thing that was obvious when I was really ill. I just wasn't functioning and then, as the anti-depressants kicked in,… I was beginning to do more things. And it then became more obvious that it wasn't the [depression]. Say I was making a cup of tea — the depression was really bad, I couldn't think clearly. It was like being in the dark, in the fog and just not being able to think clearly. So I couldn't think to do things in the right order — like fill up the kettle then get the teabag. (I was) just doing things in the wrong order and not being able to think and not being able to coordinate. And as that began to be slightly more automatic and a bit clearer, it became obvious that I was then having to get the kettle in the right place and the mug and do something with the teabag and time it and all these sort of things.

### Global impoverishment of natural vegetation revealed by dark diversity [^1128cVXq]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

The notion of dark diversity aligns with Whittaker's classic alpha–beta–gamma diversity framework — a cornerstone of modern biodiversity research (Fig. 1). In Whittaker's work, alpha diversity represented the number of species at a particular site, gamma diversity comprised all species found in the surrounding region and beta diversity described changes in community composition along environmental gradients. The dark diversity concept is taxon-oriented, because it considers the suitability of each absent species for a study site. When aggregated, alpha and dark diversity together constitute the site-specific species pool, which includes only those species from the region that are suitable for a given site on the basis of its ecological conditions. In this context, beta diversity, as first defined by Whittaker, can be articulated as the change in site-specific species pools within gamma diversity. This is sometimes referred to as 'structured' beta diversity, whereas 'unstructured' beta diversity represents the variation in species composition among sampled sites within an ecologically similar area. The dark diversity concept enhances the alpha–beta–gamma framework by providing a site-specific toolbox that complements alpha diversity at a site with the set of suitable yet absent species (dark diversity), the biodiversity potential of the site (species pool size) and the degree to which this potential is realized (community completeness).

### What is light? The visible spectrum and beyond [^112Fs5m2]. Eye (2016). Low credibility.

In this International Year of Light, it is particularly appropriate to review the historical concept of what is light and the controversies surrounding the extent of the visible spectrum. Today we recognize that light possesses both a wave and particle nature. It is also clear that the limits of visibility really extend from about 310nm in the ultraviolet (in youth) to about 1100nm in the near-infrared, but depend very much on the radiance, that is, 'brightness' of the light source. The spectral content of artificial lighting are undergoing very significant changes in our lifetime, and the full biological implications of the spectral content of newer lighting technologies remain to be fully explored.

### Generalization of beneficial exposure effects to untreated stimuli from another fear category [^113WoqVs]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Previous research has shown that fear associated with one stimulus often spreads to other stimuli with similar perceptual features as well as across different stimulus categories. Exposure is considered as the most effective intervention to attenuate exaggerated fear. The extent to which exposure treatment effects can generalize to fears not targeted during treatment remains elusive. Previous studies on possible generalization of beneficial effects of exposure used stimuli sharing the same stimulus category and/or stimuli having high perceptual similarity. The current study examined whether exposure treatment generalization can be achieved for untreated stimuli which do not share any perceptual resemblance and belong to a different fear category. An analogue sample of fifty participants with fear of spiders (animal-related fears) and heights (natural environment-related fears) was tested. Participants have been randomly assigned to either an exposure treatment (n = 24) or a control condition (n = 26). Exposure treatment was designed to only target participants' fear of spiders, leaving their fear of heights untreated. Results demonstrated that the effects of exposure treatment generalized to fear of heights, as indicated by a reduction in behavioral avoidance, as well as self-reported acrophobia symptoms. The present study confutes the assumption that generalization of exposure effects to untreated fears is based on perceptual similarity. Clearly, further research is required to determine the decisive factors, in order to expand the generalization effect permanently to any given type of fear.

### Fear of heights in virtual reality saturates 20 to 40 M above ground [^117J9ShJ]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent epidemiological studies indicate that about one-third of the general population suffers from a more or less disabling height intolerance, with a relevant impact on quality of life in many of them. Acrophobia, the most severe form of visual height intolerance, has a life-time prevalence of around 5%. Although it is commonly believed that fear of heights should continuously aggravate with increasing elevation, this issue has not been systematically investigated yet. Here, we examined this topic using immersive virtual reality, an established tool in therapy for fear of heights, that allows to flexibly manipulate height stimuli. In a comprehensive cohort (including insusceptible subjects as well as subjects with height intolerance up to acrophobia) height intolerance severity was graded by an established metric scale (vHISS). Participants were randomly exposed to different virtual elevations using a head-mounted display. Behavioral responses to virtual height exposure were analogous to exposure in vivo. Participants exhibited increased anxiety and musculoskeletal stiffening with enhanced high-frequency body sway, to an extend that corresponded to the individual subjective height intolerance rating. For all behavioral responses, we observed a saturation above a certain altitude. Body sway and musculoskeletal stiffening became maximal at 20 m above ground, whereas anxiety saturated above 40 m. These results suggest that fear of heights is characterized by a nonlinear stimulus-response relationship and a dissociation between visual-height-induced bodily and emotional reactions.

### Origins and challenges of viral dark matter [^116aHHBu]. Virus Research (2017). Low credibility.

The accurate classification of viral dark matter - metagenomic sequences that originate from viruses but do not align to any reference virus sequences - is one of the major obstacles in comprehensively defining the virome. Depending on the sample, viral dark matter can make up from anywhere between 40 and 90% of sequences. This review focuses on the specific nature of dark matter as it relates to viral sequences. We identify three factors that contribute to the existence of viral dark matter: the divergence and length of virus sequences, the limitations of alignment based classification, and limited representation of viruses in reference sequence databases. We then discuss current methods that have been developed to at least partially circumvent these limitations and thereby reduce the extent of viral dark matter.

### Benzodiazepines versus placebo for panic disorder in adults [^11347y8h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent unexpected panic attacks consisting of a wave of intense fear that reaches a peak within a few minutes. Panic disorder is a common disorder, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 1% to 5% in the general population and a 7% to 10% prevalence in primary care settings. Its aetiology is not fully understood and is probably heterogeneous. Panic disorder is treated with psychological and pharmacological interventions, often used in combination. Although benzodiazepines are frequently used in the treatment of panic disorder, guidelines recommend antidepressants, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as first-line treatment for panic disorder, particularly due to their lower incidence of dependence and withdrawal reaction when compared to benzodiazepines. Despite these recommendations, benzodiazepines are widely used in the treatment of panic disorder, probably because of their rapid onset of action.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and acceptability of benzodiazepines versus placebo in the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR Studies and References), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), and PsycINFO (1967-) up to 29 May 2018. We handsearched reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews. We contacted experts in the field for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

All double-blind (blinding of patients and personnel) controlled trials randomising adults with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia to benzodiazepine or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently checked the eligibility of studies and extracted data using a standardised form. Data were then entered data into Review Manager 5 using a double-check procedure. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, settings, and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability.

Main Results

We included 24 studies in the review with a total of 4233 participants, of which 2124 were randomised to benzodiazepines and 1475 to placebo. The remaining 634 participants were randomised to other active treatments in three-arm trials. We assessed the overall methodological quality of the included studies as poor. We rated all studies as at unclear risk of bias in at least three domains. In addition, we judged 20 of the 24 included studies as having a high risk of bias in at least one domain. Two primary outcomes of efficacy and acceptability showed a possible advantage of benzodiazepines over placebo. The estimated risk ratio (RR) for a response to treatment was 1.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39 to 1.96) in favour of benzodiazepines, which corresponds to an estimated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 7). The dropout rate was lower among participants treated with benzodiazepines (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.64); the estimated NNTB was 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). We rated the quality of the evidence as low for both primary outcomes. The possible advantage of benzodiazepine was also seen for remission (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.88) and the endpoint data for social functioning (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.53, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.42), both with low-quality evidence. We assessed the evidence for the other secondary outcomes as of very low quality. With the exception of the analyses of the change score data for depression (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.04) and social functioning (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.88 to 0.24), all secondary outcome analyses showed an effect in favour of benzodiazepines compared to placebo. However, the number of dropouts due to adverse effects was higher with benzodiazepines than with placebo (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.15; low-quality evidence). Furthermore, our analyses of adverse events showed that a higher proportion of participants experienced at least one adverse effect when treated with benzodiazepines (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.37; low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Low-quality evidence shows a possible superiority of benzodiazepine over placebo in the short-term treatment of panic disorders. The validity of the included studies is questionable due to possible unmasking of allocated treatments, high dropout rates, and probable publication bias. Moreover, the included studies were only short-term studies and did not examine the long-term efficacy nor the risks of dependency and withdrawal symptoms. Due to these limitations, our results regarding the efficacy of benzodiazepines versus placebo provide only limited guidance for clinical practice. Furthermore, the clinician's choice is not between benzodiazepines and placebo, but between benzodiazepines and other agents, notably SSRIs, both in terms of efficacy and adverse effects. The choice of treatment should therefore be guided by the patient's preference and should balance benefits and harms from treatment in a long-term perspective.

Introduction

Fear is an invaluable resource that protects living beings from dangerous situations. It is not only relevant for innately fear-inducing stimuli, but it is also useful in rapidly creating associations between neutral stimuli and unpleasant outcomes, thus allowing organisms to adapt to an ever-changing environment. This process is called fear learning, and it is crucial to predict aversive events and ensure survival. To study physiological changes associated with fear learning in both animals and humans, researchers of several disciplines use fear conditioning, an experimental paradigm that allows investigation of these changes in a controlled environment. The first instance of human fear conditioning can be found in the famous, albeit very cruel, 'little Albert' experiment, in which a child was conditioned to fear a rat by pairing its presence with a loud, startling noise. This experimental procedure derived from the work of Ivan Pavlov, who studied the processes underlying appetitive conditioning in animals. Fear conditioning may occur when a previously neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) is paired with an intrinsically unpleasant or even harmful stimulus referred to as unconditioned stimulus (US), which elicits unconditioned responses (UR). After this association, the CS comes to elicit conditioned responses (CR), which are similar to the UR. As of today, most fear conditioning studies in humans use not one but two CSs, commonly termed CS+, associated with the US, and CS−, as a control stimulus but never paired with the US. Depending on the number of times that the CS+ is paired with the US, the paradigm consists of continuous pairings (when the CS+ is always paired with the US) or a partial reinforcement schedule (when the CS+ is reinforced only on some trials). Moreover, depending on the timing of US delivery, it is possible to distinguish between delay conditioning – when the US is delivered near the end of the CS+ – and trace conditioning – when the US is delivered after the CS+ offset. Additionally, fear conditioning paradigms can be defined as uninstructed, when participants begin the experiment without knowing which of the two stimuli will be paired with the US, or instructed, meaning that prior to the experiment participants will be taught which CS will be paired with the US. During extinction training, the CSs are presented, without the US. This engenders a new inhibitory learning of the CS-US association, so that the CS+ will no longer elicit CRs. Finally, retention tests allow to investigate the presence or absence of CRs after fear acquisition or extinction training. These procedures constitute an important experimental paradigm for the behavioral and cognitive sciences (Fig. 1). Thanks to decades of scientific research conducted by using the fear conditioning paradigm in humans, remarkably vast and deep understanding of fear itself and its related processes, like learning, memorization, retrieval, extinction, and reconsolidation has come to life.

Excessive alcohol use and binge drinking — definition, risks, and harm-reduction tips are as follows: Excessive alcohol use includes binge drinking, heavy drinking, and any drinking by pregnant women or people younger than the legal drinking age, and binge drinking is defined as consuming 4 or more drinks during a single occasion for women and 5 or more drinks during a single occasion for men. Excessive alcohol use, including binge drinking, is associated with short-term and long-term health conditions, increases a person's chances of engaging in risky sexual activity, and is also associated with unintentional injuries and violence. Tips for drinking less include setting limits, counting drinks, managing triggers, and being around people who support moderation in or abstinence from drinking.

### Fear in dreams and in wakefulness: evidence for day / night affective homeostasis [^115PVieU]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

In the domain of sleep research (irrespective of dreaming), REM sleep was found to play a role in emotional memory consolidation (Goldstein & Walker, 2014; Nishida, Pearsall, Buckner, & Walker, 2009; Sterpenich et al. 2014), including fear memory consolidation (Pace‐Schott, Germain, & Milad, 2015) and successful fear/safety recall (Menz, Rihm, & Buchel, 2016), while both NREM (Hauner, Howard, Zelano, & Gottfried, 2013; He et al. 2015) and REM sleep stages (Menz et al. 2016; Pace‐Schott et al. 2015) have been found to promote the retention and generalization of extinction learning. In addition, it was proposed that specifically REM sleep contributes to the attenuation of the emotional tone of waking‐life memories (Vallat, Chatard, Blagrove, & Ruby, 2017; Walker & van der Helm, 2009). Importantly, total sleep deprivation may cause a reduction of mPFC control over the limbic system, resulting in an accentuation of emotional responses to negative stimuli (Yoo et al. 2007) and an impairment of extinction recall (Straus, Acheson, Risbrough, & Drummond, 2017). We have previously suggested that these findings from sleep studies may putatively extend to or even depend on concomitant dreaming (Perogamvros et al. 2013; Perogamvros & Schwartz, 2012). In particular, the exposure to feared stimuli (objects, situations, thoughts, memories, and physical sensations) in a totally safe context during dreaming would thus resemble desensitization therapy (Levin & Nielsen, 2007). Besides, several studies have demonstrated that dreaming of negative waking‐life experiences (e.g. divorce) relates to the resolution of previous emotional conflicts and a reduction of next‐day negative mood (Cartwright et al. 2006; Cartwright, Lloyd, Knight, & Trenholme, 1984). While this was not the objective of the present work, we would like to emphasize that the present data do not allow us to make any inference about whether one occurrence of one specific emotion in a dream influences the emotional state or responsiveness on the following day. Moreover, correlational results cannot be interpreted in a unidirectional and/or causal way. Indeed, we could also suggest that fear suppression during wakefulness may lead to increased excitability of fear‐related experiences during sleep, namely in a condition where monitoring (emotion regulation) from the prefrontal cortex is reduced (Braun et al. 1997; Maquet et al. 1996).

Emotional and mental distress

Participants described feeling anxious about their health, limited support, restricted access to care, and concern for their unborn child's well-being. One participant was placed in segregation after her navel piercing jewelry was flagged by a full-body X-ray scanner during admission to the facility. Although she removed the jewelry immediately, she was still confined to segregation. She recounted this experience and described its impact on her mental health:

"[…] and then the whole thing that was in seg [segregation] that probably didn't help with my mental health, which doesn't help with like your whole body and like I should be moving a bit. I'm not saying like go play basketball in the yard, but I'm saying like, you know, the segregation thing was kind of… it was so… it was just so dumb". (PI01)

Another participant recounted experiencing emotional and mental distress due to limited support and the lack of healthcare during incarceration:

"You have no support in there, right? So that's your main, that's the main thing. You have no support. You don't have the healthcare. You don't have your needs [met] either, like you… just feel really down in general. Like… it's a really really dark dark space when you're in there". (PI04)

Several participants recalled being concerned for their unborn child's health and their preparedness for motherhood. One participant described experiencing withdrawal symptoms following the abrupt discontinuation of methadone, which she had been prescribed in the community prior to incarceration. She recalled fearing she might lose the pregnancy and worrying about her child's health. She also recalled fearing the involvement of child protection services and agonizing over whether she would be able to retain custody of her newborn. She stated:

### Traumatic stress reactivity promotes excessive alcohol drinking and alters the balance of prefrontal cortex-amygdala activity [^1123j5wc]. Translational Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder defined by the DSM-IV in terms of three major symptom clusters: persistent avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, hyperarousal and intrusive re-experiencing of the traumatic event. Notably, PTSD occurs only in a subset of humans exposed to a traumatic stressor, estimated to be between 10 and 25% of individuals, depending on the stress stimulus and the criteria used to assess PTSD (for example, Breslaun et al.). Important for the present report, PTSD and alcohol-use disorders are highly comorbid in humans and have partially overlapping symptomatic profiles (for example, Engdahl et al.).

PTSD has been described in terms of co-occurring maladaptive fear conditioning processes (that is, excessive fear learning or deficient fear extinction) and sensitized stress responses, which are mediated by changes in partially overlapping neural circuits (for example, Pape and Pare, and Shin and Liberzoni). Studies attempt to model these pathological neural cascades by exposing animals to a stimulus that mimics traumatic stress exposure in humans (for reviews, see Cohen et al. and Logrip et al.), although different stressors (for example, social defeat, footshock and predator odor) elicit different sets of behavioral and biological responses in rats. Animals can be divided into subgroups based on behavioral responses to the stressor, as long as the behavioral response is not maximal or uniform across rats. Predator odor stress allows for the division of animals into subgroups that exhibit either multiple co-occurring signs of behavioral dysregulation (for example, hyperarousal and high anxiety) or collective absence of these signs. This clustering of behavioral changes suggests a common underlying etiology for multiple behavioral counter-adaptations in animals that do not cope well with a traumatic stressor and in humans with PTSD.
