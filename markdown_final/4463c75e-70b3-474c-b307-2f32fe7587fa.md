## Question

What's the differential for high PTH

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of elevated PTH — what conditions to consider and how to approach the evaluation [^115mxSJ5] [^114DBWVe] [^117NS27X]. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical abnormality and assay issues, including repeat testing and the calcium–PTH relationship [^115mxSJ5] [^111g74q9]. Then, I should categorize by calcium status to guide the initial differential into hypercalcemia with high or inappropriately normal PTH, normocalcemia with high PTH, and hypocalcemia with high PTH, noting primary, secondary, and tertiary patterns [^117NS27X] [^114qfj9J]. Next, I will examine key etiologies in each category, including PHPT, FHH, CKD-related secondary HPT, vitamin D deficiency, malabsorption, medications, and rarer causes, while planning discriminative tests such as 24-hour urine calcium indices [^114DBWVe] [^1173ejdr]. Finally, I should consider special populations, red flags that warrant urgent action, and what to do when the diagnosis remains uncertain, including when to observe, replete vitamin D, or proceed to imaging only if surgery is contemplated [^112GUCcN] [^117NS27X] [^114wAa5f].

> Let me first confirm and characterize the biochemical abnormality, because I need to ensure the PTH elevation is persistent and not due to analytical variability or physiology before labeling it as primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism [^115mxSJ5]. I should double-check that intact PTH is measured with a second- or third-generation assay on at least two occasions 2–4 weeks apart and that albumin-corrected total calcium and ionized calcium are measured concurrently to establish the calcium–PTH relationship, while keeping in mind assay variability and fragment cross-reactivity that can complicate interpretation, especially in CKD and across different platforms [^115mxSJ5] [^111g74q9]. Wait, let me verify vitamin D status and kidney function as well, since 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and reduced eGFR are common confounders that elevate PTH and may precede changes in calcium or phosphate, and seasonal or circadian variation can also influence single PTH measurements, reinforcing the need for repeat labs [^111DWHjG] [^114qfj9J] [^113nbzh4].

> Now I will stratify by the calcium–PTH relationship to guide the initial pathway, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before I confirm calcium with both corrected total and ionized values because "inappropriately normal" PTH in the face of hypercalcemia still indicates PTH-dependent hypercalcemia and demands a primary workup [^115mxSJ5] [^117NS27X]. Hypercalcemia with elevated or inappropriately normal PTH suggests PHPT, FHH, tertiary HPT, or medication effects like thiazides or lithium, whereas normocalcemia with elevated PTH can be early PHPT or, more commonly, secondary HPT from vitamin D deficiency, CKD, malabsorption, renal calcium leak, or certain drugs, and hypocalcemia with elevated PTH reflects appropriate secondary HPT physiology such as CKD, severe vitamin D deficiency, or PTH resistance states like pseudohypoparathyroidism [^114DBWVe] [^114qfj9J] [^111PJEAj] [^1166KVaY].

> For hypercalcemia with non-suppressed PTH, primary hyperparathyroidism is the leading diagnosis, but I need to check population context and phenotype since many are asymptomatic and discovered on screening, with adenoma in about 80%, hyperplasia in 10–15%, and carcinoma less than 1%, and clinical targets often include bone and kidney involvement even when calcium elevation is mild [^1176xNEt] [^114guUzo]. I should confirm diagnosis with elevated albumin-adjusted or ionized calcium and elevated or inappropriately normal PTH on two occasions, and I should remember that PTH may be "normal" but still inappropriate given the hypercalcemia, which is diagnostic for PHPT when persistent [^115mxSJ5]. Wait, I should not forget FHH in younger patients or those with family history and low urinary calcium wasting, where the urinary calcium to creatinine clearance ratio is typically less than 0.01 and genetic CaSR variants shift the calcium–PTH set point, so I will plan a 24-hour urine calcium and creatinine or a clearance ratio to differentiate PHPT from FHH before committing to surgery [^114DBWVe] [^1173ejdr]. Hold on, I should verify tertiary HPT in the context of longstanding CKD or post-transplant autonomy, and I need to review medications because thiazides and lithium can elevate calcium and PTH, and, although I almost considered ectopic PTH as a meaningful possibility, wait, that is very rare and should be a diagnosis of exclusion [^114qfj9J] [^114DBWVe] [^117NS27X].

> If calcium is normal with elevated PTH, let me consider normocalcemic PHPT but I must first rule out secondary causes, since nPHPT requires persistently normal total and ionized calcium with elevated PTH on repeated testing over 3–6 months after excluding vitamin D deficiency, CKD, malabsorption, renal calcium leak, and drugs such as antiresorptives or calcimimetics that transiently alter PTH dynamics [^114KmBRe] [^114L9MaD]. I should replete vitamin D to at least 50 nmol/L, ensure adequate calcium intake, and reassess PTH because deficiency is a common driver of secondary HPT and correcting it often lowers PTH without exacerbating hypercalcemia in PHPT, which I need to recheck rather than assume normalization [^111DWHjG] [^111PJEAj]. Next, I will examine kidney function and phosphate with eGFR because early CKD stimulates PTH via impaired calcitriol activation and phosphate retention before calcium changes, and I will evaluate malabsorption history including bariatric surgery or celiac disease since post–Roux-en-Y patients frequently have elevated PTH despite normal calcium and vitamin D repletion can be inadequate alone [^114qfj9J] [^112zAuwy].

> After parathyroidectomy, I need to remember the postoperative eucalcemic hyperparathyroidism phenomenon, and wait, let me verify the expected time course because 25–28% can have elevated PTH early with normal calcium, often related to bone remineralization ("bone hunger"), vitamin D deficiency, renal impairment, or possible peripheral PTH resistance, with many normalizing over 6–12 months while a minority remain elevated long term [^115zy7U5] [^112fi8Mx] [^114hKR6D]. I should confirm risk factors such as higher preoperative PTH, impaired renal function, lower vitamin D, higher intraoperative PTH, and older age, and I should monitor longitudinally because a small subset with persistent elevation may signal recurrence, although most remain normocalcemic and some normalize PTH with time [^1174VN9S] [^115zy7U5].

> If hypocalcemia accompanies elevated PTH, I will now examine secondary hyperparathyroidism due to advanced CKD, severe vitamin D deficiency, or PTH resistance, since this pattern reflects an appropriate physiologic response in most cases rather than primary autonomy [^114qfj9J]. I should confirm CKD stage and apply KDIGO ranges that target PTH roughly 2–9 times the upper limit of normal in dialysis patients while following trends given assay variability, and I must check phosphate and calcitriol status because phosphate retention and low calcitriol are key drivers [^111Wfsp7] [^114dWdSx]. But wait, what if the clinical phenotype suggests pseudohypoparathyroidism with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, elevated PTH, and syndromic features such as brachydactyly or ectopic ossifications; in that case I should confirm PTH resistance and pursue molecular classification rather than escalating calcium alone [^1117cftq] [^1166KVaY].

> Special populations and contexts require tailored evaluation, and I need to ensure I adjust expectations in pregnancy where calcium physiology shifts, ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality, and conservative management with hydration and monitoring is appropriate for mild disease during gestation with definitive decisions individualized postpartum when feasible [^112GUCcN] [^114dvMhR] [^116eKQaq]. Hold on, bariatric surgery patients often have elevated PTH from malabsorption and may not normalize with increased calcium dose alone, so I should emphasize comprehensive nutritional management and realistic monitoring goals rather than expecting PTH normalization with calcium formulation changes [^112zAuwy]. I should also review medications like thiazides, lithium, anticonvulsants, denosumab, SGLT2 inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors that can affect calcium–PTH physiology, and I will keep genetic testing in mind for young patients, multiglandular disease, recurrence, or a suggestive family history to guide management and family counseling [^114DBWVe] [^117NS27X] [^117MGtsN].

> Let me synthesize the diagnostic approach without overcomplicating it, and wait, I almost ordered imaging up front, but I should correct that impulse because imaging is reserved for preoperative localization, not for establishing the diagnosis, which is biochemical [^114wAa5f] [^115mxSJ5]. I should first confirm elevated PTH on repeat with verified calcium status, then if hypercalcemia is present pursue a PHPT-pattern workup while distinguishing PHPT from FHH using 24-hour urine calcium and clearance ratios, medication review, and CKD history, and if normocalcemic with elevated PTH I should systematically exclude vitamin D deficiency, early CKD, malabsorption, renal calcium leak, and drug effects before labeling nPHPT, and if hypocalcemic with elevated PTH I should evaluate for CKD, severe vitamin D deficiency, and PTH resistance states [^1173ejdr] [^114KmBRe] [^114DBWVe] [^114qfj9J]. I need to ensure key tests are ordered up front, including 25-hydroxyvitamin D, eGFR and creatinine, phosphate and magnesium, 24-hour urine calcium and creatinine, and PTHrP only if malignancy is suspected in a PTH-suppressed hypercalcemia, and I should be alert to red flags such as severe or symptomatic hypercalcemia, acute kidney injury, or pathologic fracture that require urgent management and expedited etiologic workup [^111DWHjG] [^1173ejdr] [^117NS27X].

> When the diagnosis remains uncertain after initial evaluation, I should double-check that vitamin D has been repleted to at least 50 nmol/L and that adequate time, typically 2–3 months, has elapsed before repeating calcium–PTH testing to reassess the axis, because premature labeling of PHPT can occur if deficiency is not corrected first [^111pqKGW] [^111DWHjG]. Next, I should review whether observation is appropriate, since many asymptomatic PHPT cases remain stable for years with monitoring of serum calcium, renal function, and bone density, and I should refer to endocrinology for persistent calcium–PTH dissociation or complex scenarios to guide decisions about surgery versus surveillance [^114guUzo] [^11266dkG]. Hold on, let me verify one more time that imaging is only indicated if surgery is being contemplated, with sestamibi, ultrasound, or advanced localization chosen according to availability and expertise after the biochemical diagnosis is secured, to avoid incidental imaging pitfalls and false negatives in multigland disease [^114wAa5f].

> As a final check, if PHPT is confirmed and the patient meets guideline criteria or prefers definitive therapy, parathyroidectomy is curative and improves bone density and kidney stone risk, while if surgery is deferred or contraindicated I should consider antiresorptives to increase BMD and cinacalcet to lower serum calcium, always re-evaluating vitamin D status and renal function to optimize outcomes and reduce misattribution of secondary drivers to primary disease [^114guUzo] [^116SUpwz] [^113LsBWi] [^1152z3aX] [^111DWHjG].

Elevated PTH has a focused differential: **primary hyperparathyroidism** (adenoma, hyperplasia, carcinoma) [^1176xNEt], **secondary hyperparathyroidism** (CKD, vitamin D deficiency, malabsorption, hypocalcemia) [^114qfj9J] [^111PJEAj], and **tertiary hyperparathyroidism** (autonomous hyperplasia after prolonged secondary HPT). Less common causes include **familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia** (Ca/Cr clearance ratio < 0.01) [^114DBWVe], medications (lithium, thiazides), and PTH resistance syndromes (pseudohypoparathyroidism) [^1117cftq]. Evaluation includes **serum calcium, phosphate, 25(OH)D, creatinine/eGFR, and 24-hour urine calcium** [^111aZ7bs] [^1173ejdr]. Management is cause-specific: **surgery for PHPT** [^111aZ7bs] and **medical therapy for secondary or tertiary HPT** [^1128rqpT].

---

## Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT)

PHPT is characterized by **autonomous PTH secretion**, most commonly due to a single adenoma (80–85%) [^1176xNEt], multigland hyperplasia (10–15%), or rarely carcinoma (< 1%) [^114guUzo]. It typically presents with **hypercalcemia** [^114guUzo], elevated or inappropriately normal PTH, and complications such as nephrolithiasis, osteoporosis [^115Pc561], and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

---

## Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT)

SHPT results from chronic hypocalcemia or vitamin D deficiency, leading to **compensatory PTH elevation** [^116feLqL]. Common causes include:

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Reduced renal activation of vitamin D and phosphate retention cause hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism [^114qfj9J].

- **Vitamin D deficiency**: Reduced intestinal calcium absorption leads to hypocalcemia and compensatory PTH elevation [^111PJEAj].

- **Malabsorption syndromes**: Conditions such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or bariatric surgery can cause calcium and vitamin D malabsorption, leading to SHPT [^112zAuwy].

- **Hypocalcemia**: Chronic hypocalcemia from various causes can stimulate PTH secretion [^112noYiG].

---

## Tertiary hyperparathyroidism

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism results from prolonged secondary hyperparathyroidism, leading to **autonomous parathyroid hyperplasia** and persistent PTH elevation even after correction of the initial cause (e.g. after renal transplantation).

---

## Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH)

FHH is a genetic disorder characterized by mild hypercalcemia, elevated or inappropriately normal PTH, and **low urinary calcium excretion** (Ca/Cr clearance ratio < 0.01) [^114DBWVe]. It is caused by mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) gene and typically does not require surgery.

---

## Medications and substances

Certain medications and substances can elevate PTH levels. **Lithium** alters CaSR sensitivity and increases PTH secretion [^114DBWVe]; **thiazide diuretics** reduce renal calcium excretion, which may raise PTH; and calcium-sensing receptor antagonists, though rarely used clinically, also increase PTH.

---

## PTH resistance syndromes

Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is characterized by **resistance to PTH** [^1117cftq], leading to elevated PTH levels despite hypocalcemia. It is a rare genetic disorder with variable clinical manifestations, including skeletal abnormalities and endocrine resistance [^1166KVaY].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **comprehensive diagnostic approach** includes:

- **Serum calcium (total and ionized)**: To differentiate hypercalcemic from normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism [^114KmBRe].

- **Phosphate levels**: Typically low in PHPT and SHPT.

- **25-hydroxyvitamin D**: To assess vitamin D status [^111DWHjG].

- **Creatinine/eGFR**: To evaluate renal function [^111aZ7bs].

- **24-hour urinary calcium**: To differentiate PHPT from FHH [^114DBWVe].

- **Imaging**: Neck ultrasound, sestamibi scan, or 4D-CT for localization of parathyroid lesions [^114wAa5f].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **PHPT**: Parathyroidectomy is the definitive treatment [^114guUzo]. Medical management includes cinacalcet to lower calcium [^1152z3aX] and bisphosphonates or denosumab to improve bone density [^113LsBWi].

- **SHPT**: Address underlying causes (e.g. vitamin D supplementation, phosphate binders, calcimimetics) [^114qfj9J].

- **Tertiary hyperparathyroidism**: Parathyroidectomy or medical management with calcimimetics.

- **FHH**: Typically requires no treatment [^114DBWVe].

- **PTH resistance syndromes**: Calcium and active vitamin D supplementation [^1117cftq].

---

Elevated PTH levels arise from multiple causes — including primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism; familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia; medications; and PTH resistance syndromes. Accurate diagnosis and management require a **comprehensive evaluation** of calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, renal function, and urinary calcium excretion [^115mxSJ5].

PHP and related disorders are primarily clinical diagnoses. Identification of the molecular cause should be performed to confirm the clinical diagnosis and characterize the subtype of the disease (A++).

Testing for genetic or epigenetic causes should be based on the clinical characteristics, local access to genetic testing, and the most likely identified causes of the disease at the time of analysis according to the algorithm (see Molecular Diagnosis section) (A++).

The experts have highlighted that administration of exogenous PTH (modified Ellsworth–Howard test) is not necessary but might be helpful in research settings. Assessment of Gs α bioactivity is usually not required for the clinical diagnosis of PHP and related disorders.

- **Main clinical components**: In the majority of patients with PHP, the most important clinical manifestation is symptoms of hypocalcemia due to PTH resistance (45–80%). Periods of rapid growth and the associated increased calcium requirement, or nutritional calcium or vitamin D deficiency, might trigger or intensify symptoms.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114guUzo]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2018). High credibility.

In this review, we describe the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) with a focus on recent advances in the field. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone. Often, the presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic in regions where serum calcium levels are routinely measured. In addition to mild hypercalcemia, PHPT can manifest with osteoporosis and hypercalciuria as well as vertebral fractures and nephrolithiasis, both of which can be asymptomatic. Other clinical forms of PHPT, such as classical disease and normocalcemic PHPT, are less common.

Parathyroidectomy, the only curative treatment for PHPT, is recommended in patients with symptoms and those with asymptomatic disease who are at risk of progression or have subclinical evidence of end-organ sequelae. Parathyroidectomy results in an increase in bone mineral density (BMD) and a reduction in nephrolithiasis. Various medical therapies can increase BMD or reduce serum calcium levels, but no single drug can do both. More data are needed regarding the neuropsychological manifestations of PHPT and the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to sporadic PHPT, as well as on risk factors for complications of the disorder. Future work that advances our knowledge in these areas will improve the management of the disorder.

### Parathyroid disorders [^116feLqL]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Parathyroid disorders are most often identified incidentally by abnormalities in serum calcium levels when screening for renal or bone disease or other conditions. Parathyroid hormone, which is released by the parathyroid glands primarily in response to low calcium levels, stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption and serum calcium elevation, reduces renal calcium clearance, and stimulates intestinal calcium absorption through the synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.

Primary hyperparathyroidism, in which calcium levels are elevated without appropriate suppression of parathyroid hormone levels, is the most common cause of hypercalcemia and is often managed surgically. Indications for parathyroidectomy in primary hyperparathyroidism include the presence of symptoms, age 50 years or younger, serum calcium level more than 1 mg per dL above the upper limit of normal, osteoporosis, creatinine clearance less than 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m², nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and hypercalciuria.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by alterations in calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D regulation that result in elevated parathyroid hormone levels. It most commonly occurs with chronic kidney disease and vitamin D deficiency, and less commonly with gastrointestinal conditions that impair calcium absorption. Secondary hyperparathyroidism can be managed with calcium and vitamin D replacement and reduction of high phosphate levels. There is limited evidence for the use of calcimimetics and vitamin D analogues for persistently elevated parathyroid hormone levels.

### Elevated PTH with normal serum calcium level: A structured approach [^111PJEAj]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism is a common biochemical finding, usually identified during an assessment of bone or renal health. Hypercalcaemia must be considered by calculation of adjusted calcium, and a careful history taken to assess dietary calcium intake and the possibility of a malabsorption syndrome. Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) should be measured and replaced if indicated. The management plan for the patient is influenced by the context in which calcium and PTH were measured. In this brief review, we describe the assessment of a patient with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.

### Zemplar [^114qfj9J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin as vitamin D3 and from dietary intake as either vitamin D2 or D3. Both vitamin D2 and D3 require two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH)₂D₃], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium, and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Decreased levels of 1,25(OH)₂D₃ have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH)₂D₃ and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy.

- **Mechanism of action**: Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D2 analog of calcitriol. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding to VDRs.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism, specifically with respect to diagnosis, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend diagnosing hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism based on an elevated serum calcium level adjusted for albumin. This should be in conjunction with an elevated or inappropriately normal intact PTH level, using either a second or third generation assay, on two occasions at least two weeks apart.

### New parathyroid function index for the differentiation of primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism: a case-control study [^111pqKGW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

The symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) are mainly attributable to an elevated calcium concentration. However, many PHPT patients are asymptomatic, a phenomenon partly explained by a decrease in serum calcium concentrations due to vitamin D deficiency. Previous studies observed a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in both healthy individuals and PHPT patients. Thus, the third International Workshop guidelines recommend the exclusion of vitamin D deficiency-induced secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) prior to diagnosing PHPT. It is advisable to make a final diagnosis after correcting the vitamin D deficiency, noting that vitamin D repletion requires a period of 2–3 months.

A parathyroid function index (PFindex) greater than 34 could avoid this additional waiting time and allow the arrangement of advanced tests for PHPT, such as parathyroid ultrasound and radionuclide imaging. In the studied population, patients with suspected hyperparathyroidism and a PFindex greater than 6.9 pmol/L had a prevalence of PHPT and SHPT of 72.5% and 40.2%, respectively.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: New issues and new questions — bridging the past with the future [^11266dkG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

The earliest clinical descriptions of PHPT pointed to an inexorably progressive disorder. Now, in many asymptomatic individuals who do not meet any surgical guidelines, PHPT in general does not seem to be progressive. Most asymptomatic patients seem to remain asymptomatic over many years of observation.

In those with major clinical manifestations, nephrolithiasis is by far the most common. In these patients, surgery is clearly indicated. Bone densitometry is an indispensable component of the evaluation as well as monitoring because there is evidence of bone involvement in most patients. This contrasts with the skeletal X-ray, which is invariably negative. Nevertheless, patients with PHPT can show a bone mass measurement either at the cortical or cancellous skeleton that is more than 2 SDs below age- and sex-matched control subjects. Bone density, serum calcium concentration, and/or urinary calcium excretion can show evidence for progression in as many as 25% of patients with asymptomatic PHPT.

There are newer pharmacologic approaches to PHPT that are the subject of intense investigation. The bisphosphonates and the calcimimetics show particular promise in this regard. Unanswered are such questions as whether the lower bone density in the milder patients will increase substantially as in those who undergo successful parathyroidectomy and whether fracture risk would therefore be reduced. Can medical therapy reduce serum calcium, parathyroid hormone levels, and other biochemical indices of PHPT? Can medical therapy improve bone density without the need for surgery?

### Age-related increases in parathyroid hormone may be antecedent to both osteoporosis and dementia [^112W3biP]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Numerous studies have reported that age-induced increases in parathyroid hormone (PTH) plasma levels are associated with cognitive decline and dementia. However, little is known about the correlation that may exist between neurological processing speed and bone density in cases of hyperparathyroidism or elevated PTH. The latency of the P300 auditory evoked potential, which measures processing speed and has been shown to accurately predict memory impairment, has only been studied with PTH levels in chronic renal failure, with the most recent work on this topic published in 1983.

PTH is anabolic in bone, but when secreted in excess, it is catabolic. Its levels increase with age in both genders, paralleling the incidence of osteopenia and osteoporosis. Recombinant human PTH 1–34 (teriparatide) is now being used as a treatment for osteoporosis, and its administration has been shown to stimulate bone formation and increase bone mineral density. Interestingly, it has recently been discovered that intermittent administration of teriparatide inhibits endogenous PTH production, possibly via negative feedback. To date, there has not been any published research on teriparatide administration for hyperparathyroidism-induced osteoporosis.

Our greater understanding of PTH has led to the lowering of the reference ranges. In 2003, the American Kidney Foundation recommended that levels should be kept between 35 and 70 pg/ml for stage 3 chronic kidney disease, which is characterized by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m².

### Persistently elevated parathyroid hormone after successful parathyroid surgery [^112fi8Mx]. The Laryngoscope (2017). Low credibility.

The study aimed to explore potential causes of persistently elevated parathyroid hormone levels after curative parathyroidectomy in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism due to single gland disease. It utilized a case series design with planned data collection.

An analysis was conducted of 314 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who underwent parathyroid surgery in a tertiary academic practice between January 2009 and April 2013. Among these, 187 patients had single-gland disease; 68 failed to meet inclusion criteria, resulting in a study population of 119 patients. Preoperative values of parathyroid hormone, calcium, ionized calcium, 25-OH-vitamin D, creatinine, and glomerular filtration rate were determined, along with postoperative calcium, ionized calcium, and parathyroid hormone levels. Patients were divided into two groups based on their postoperative parathyroid hormone values: elevated parathyroid hormone and normal parathyroid hormone.

- **Results**: Thirty (25.2%) patients achieved postoperative normocalcemia but had elevated parathyroid hormone levels. This group had significantly higher preoperative levels of parathyroid hormone (P = 0.002) and creatinine (P = 0.007), and a lower glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.002) than patients with normal postoperative parathyroid hormone levels. The preoperative 25-OH-vitamin D level was not significantly associated with an elevated parathyroid hormone (odds ratio [OR]: 1.56). Preoperative impaired renal function, specifically an abnormal glomerular filtration rate (OR: 12.8), was significantly associated with elevated parathyroid hormone levels.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: Summary statement and guidelines from the fifth international workshop [^116SUpwz]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of primary hyperparathyroidism, specifically concerning antiresorptive agents, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of alendronate or denosumab to increase bone density if not contraindicated.

### Approach to the patient: Management of parathyroid diseases across pregnancy [^112GUCcN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Parathyroid disorders during pregnancy are relatively rare and are characterized by disturbances in calcium and mineral metabolism. In primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), elevated or inappropriately high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels increase serum calcium concentrations, while in hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT), reduced or inadequately low PTH levels lead to hypocalcemia. PHPT is a common endocrine disease with a female predominance and an age-dependent increase in prevalence, whereas HypoPT is a rare condition mainly caused by anterior neck surgery.

Management of parathyroid disorders during pregnancy can be challenging and significantly differs from that of nonpregnant patients. Scientific evidence from systematic evaluations regarding this issue is very limited, particularly concerning maternal management and fetal outcomes. Clinicians taking care of pregnant patients with parathyroid disorders require sufficient knowledge of the pathophysiology of the diseases themselves, as well as an understanding of the physiology of pregnancy. Pregnancy induces fundamental changes in bone and mineral metabolism in women during pregnancy and lactation, which have been summarized in Figure 1.

### Natpara (parathyroid hormone) [^112Euznm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these signs and symptoms of high or low blood calcium levels.

Natpara is a prescription parathyroid hormone (PTH) used with calcium and vitamin D to control low blood calcium (hypocalcemia) in people with low PTH blood levels (hypoparathyroidism). Natpara is only for people who do not respond well to treatment with calcium and active forms of vitamin D alone, because it may increase the possible risk of bone cancer (osteosarcoma). Natpara was not studied in people with hypoparathyroidism caused by calcium-sensing receptor mutations or in those who develop sudden hypoparathyroidism after surgery.

It is not known if Natpara is safe and effective for children 18 years of age and younger. Natpara should not be used in children and young adults whose bones are still growing.

Do not use Natpara if you are allergic to parathyroid hormone or any of the ingredients in Natpara. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in Natpara.

Before you start using Natpara, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: [continue the medication guide content as necessary]

### Etiology and pathophysiology of hypoparathyroidism: A narrative review [^1137UZxH]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

The kidney is a target organ often damaged in patients with hypoparathyroidism. Under normal conditions, parathyroid hormone (PTH) is critical to sustain renal distal tubular reabsorption of filtered calcium (Ca) and, therefore, to maintain the extracellular calcium concentrations. When PTH is absent, less calcium is reabsorbed, and the extracellular calcium level is not maintained within the normal range. However, the absolute amount of urinary calcium is not usually high because there is a reduced filtered load in untreated patients. Similarly, insufficient PTH secretion causes a larger proximal tubular reabsorption of filtered phosphate (P) resulting in hyperphosphatemia. Lack of PTH action impairs 1,25-(OH)₂D production; low 1,25-(OH)₂D contributes to reduced distal tubular calcium reabsorption and intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption, as suggested by animal studies.

Conversely, renal complications are found in patients with hypoparathyroidism treated with active vitamin D and/or calcium. Three main complications have been reported: nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Because the activation of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) inhibits distal tubular calcium reabsorption and enhances urinary calcium excretion, these problems are especially frequent in patients with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia 1 caused by activating mutations in CASR. Nephrolithiasis is reported to be a complication in up to 36% of patients with hypoparathyroidism. Nephrocalcinosis is reported to complicate the course of hypoparathyroidism in up to 38% of patients, depending on the population.

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: Evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^1127xQKH]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

The equilibrium between new bone formation and bone resorption determines the total net effect of PTH on bone remodeling. When Ca²⁺ levels in the extracellular space decrease, PTH secretion responds immediately to maintain normal calcium levels by increasing bone resorption more than formation. On the other hand, PTH deficiency results in low bone remodeling, leading to increased BMD, although data regarding fracture risk remain unclear. Overall, these features confirm that PTH plays a pivotal role in regulating bone remodeling. The bone abnormalities caused by endogenous PTH alterations in the context of common parathyroid disorders are detailed later.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113fus1j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the most common cause of hypercalcemia, is most often identified in postmenopausal women. The clinical presentation of PHPT has evolved over the past 40 years to include three distinct clinical phenotypes, each of which has been studied in detail and has led to evolving concepts about target organ involvement, natural history, and management.

- **Methods**: In the present review, I provide an evidence-based summary of this disorder as it has been studied worldwide, citing key concepts and data that have helped to shape our concepts about this disease.

- **Results**: PHPT is now recognized to include three clinical phenotypes: overt target organ involvement, mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia, and high PTH levels with persistently normal albumin-corrected and ionized serum calcium values. The factors that determine which of these clinical presentations is more likely to predominate in a given country include the extent to which biochemical screening is used, vitamin D deficiency is present, and whether parathyroid hormone levels are routinely measured in the evaluation of low bone density or frank osteoporosis. Guidelines for parathyroidectomy apply to all three clinical forms of the disease. If surgical guidelines are not met, parathyroidectomy can also be an appropriate option if no medical contraindications are present. If either the serum calcium or bone mineral density is of concern and surgery is not an option, pharmacological approaches are available and effective.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^114NPRLk]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder of calcium metabolism characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal concentrations of parathyroid hormone. Almost always, primary hyperparathyroidism is due to a benign overgrowth of parathyroid tissue, either as a single gland (80% of cases) or as a multiple gland disorder (15–20% of cases). Primary hyperparathyroidism is generally discovered when asymptomatic, but the disease always has the potential to become symptomatic, resulting in bone loss and kidney stones. In countries where biochemical screening tests are not common, symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism tends to predominate. Another variant of primary hyperparathyroidism has been described in which the serum calcium concentration is within the normal range, but parathyroid hormone is elevated in the absence of any obvious cause.

Primary hyperparathyroidism can be cured by the removal of the parathyroid gland or glands; however, the identification of patients who are best advised to undergo surgery requires consideration of regularly updated guidelines. Recommendations for patients who do not undergo parathyroid surgery include monitoring of serum calcium concentrations and bone density.

### Long-term follow-up of patients with elevated PTH levels following successful exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism [^115zy7U5]. World Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Several studies have documented elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels after seemingly successful exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). It is not known if this is a transient phenomenon after pHPT surgery or if it predisposes to recurrent disease. A series of 99 consecutive patients with pHPT who had solitary parathyroid adenomas were followed for five years. Serum levels of PTH and biochemical variables reflecting PTH activity were measured before operation, at eight weeks postoperatively, and then yearly for five years. All patients were normocalcemic after exploration.

At eight weeks after the operation, 28% of the patients had elevated serum PTH levels; at five years, this figure decreased to 16%. During the five-year follow-up, one group of patients normalized their PTH levels, another group's PTH levels fluctuated, and still another group had consistently normal PTH levels. Patients with fluctuating PTH levels had increased levels of serum calcium and phosphate. Some of these patients (15%) showed signs of impaired renal function. Two patients with consistently elevated PTH levels showed signs of mild renal dysfunction, and one of them developed recurrent hyperparathyroidism. Elevated PTH levels after successful parathyroid surgery is not a transient phenomenon. An increased risk for recurrent disease is postulated for some patients who do not normalize their PTH levels postoperatively, and long-term surveillance of these patients is suggested.

### Patients with elevated serum parathyroid hormone levels after parathyroidectomy: Showing signs of decreased peripheral parathyroid hormone sensitivity [^114hKR6D]. World Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

We have previously shown that patients with elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) after surgery for parathyroid adenoma have normal parathyroid and renal function but demonstrate signs of remineralization of cortical bone, decreased calcium absorption, and low levels of vitamin D. We hypothesized that decreased peripheral PTH sensitivity could also be of importance for this condition.

Thirteen patients operated on for a solitary parathyroid adenoma, with a mean ± SD preoperative serum level of calcium of 2.72 ± 0.12 mmol/L, were investigated 6 weeks after surgery using a standardized PTH (1–34) infusion test for 6 hours. The eight patients with elevated PTH levels had a lesser increase in serum levels of ionized calcium (0.02 ± 0.03 mmol/L) compared to the five patients with normal PTH levels (0.06 ± 0.02 mmol/L) [p < 0.05]. Patients with elevated PTH also showed a lesser decrease in serum phosphate levels [p < 0.05] and a trend toward a larger decrease in the excretion of urinary calcium [p = 0.08]. The increase in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) did not differ between the two groups of patients. Thus, patients operated on for parathyroid adenoma with postoperatively elevated serum PTH levels showed decreased peripheral sensitivity to PTH.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: What is the role of parathyroid surgery [^114L9MaD]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is an endocrine condition resulting from inappropriate parathyroid hormone (PTH) hypersecretion. Traditionally, the biochemical profile of PHPT is elevated serum calcium (> 2.6 mmol/l) with elevated or 'inappropriately normal' PTH, which may result in multi-system complications, including fractures and nephrolithiasis.

However, an increasingly common biochemical profile is of raised PTH in the context of normal serum calcium (total and ionised), vitamin D, and renal function — recognized as normocalcaemic PHPT (nPHPT). This biochemical picture is largely being discovered in patients through osteoporosis screening.

While the reported prevalence of nPHPT varies significantly within the literature (0.1–8.9%), a recent retrospective study of 6,280 patients by Schini et al. reported a prevalence of 0.18%.

Regarding medical management for primary hyperparathyroidism, and more specifically with respect to antiresorptive agents, PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend initiating bisphosphonates or denosumab when indicated to increase bone mineral density. Clinicians should consider initiating bisphosphonates or denosumab in combination with cinacalcet when indicated to lower serum calcium and increase bone mineral density.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and genetics of primary hyperparathyroidism [^116SAsJ3]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

Clinical consequences of dysregulated parathyroid function reveal more details about the clinical features of classical PHPT and other aspects of the disease, which are found in the accompanying article. The cardinal biochemical finding in PHPT is hypercalcemia. Clonally dysregulated overgrowth of one or more parathyroid glands, accompanied by a reduced expression of the CaSR in that tissue, is the most common pathophysiological basis for this finding. Thus, there is both a mass effect, with a net increase in the amount of PTH being secreted, as well as an altered set-point for calcium-mediated suppression of PTH secretion.

Perhaps because of these dual pathophysiologic mechanisms, serum levels of PTH do not correlate particularly well with the size of the adenoma in typical cases of PHPT. Even when such a correlation has been reported, gland size has been found to vary widely with a given level of circulating PTH, especially when the PTH value is mildly to moderately elevated. However, extreme elevations in PTH do raise the specter of parathyroid carcinoma.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism as a secondary cause of depression [^116aHJBV]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

A 27-year-old woman was initially diagnosed and treated for depression with suicide ideation. Thirteen months later, kidney stones, an elevated parathyroid hormone, and elevated calcium levels led to a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. The patient was treated for hyperparathyroidism by resection of the superior right parathyroid gland. When the calcium levels were regulated, the patient's moods, concentration, and memory returned to baseline.

### Eucalcemic parathyroid hormone elevation after parathyroidectomy for primary sporadic hyperparathyroidism: Risk factors, trend, and outcome [^1174VN9S]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

The change in mean postoperative serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels was observed on Day 1, at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 2 years after parathyroidectomy in patients with normal PTH levels at 6 months (group A) and those with elevated PTH at 6 months (group B). The blue line represents group A (n = 98) and the yellow line represents group B (n = 63).

- **Analysis of preoperative and perioperative factors**: Table 4 shows the multivariable analysis of the five most statistically significant preoperative and perioperative risk factors for elevated PTH (ePTH) 6 months after parathyroidectomy. Adenoma weight, rather than total parathyroid weight, was included in the multivariable analysis. After adjusting for preoperative PTH, creatinine level, and adenoma weight, advanced age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.042) and low 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 (25OHD 3) levels (OR = 1.043) were identified as independent preoperative factors for ePTH 6 months after surgery.

- **Analysis of operative and postoperative factors**: Table 5 presents the multivariable analysis of the five most statistically significant operative and postoperative risk factors for ePTH 6 months after parathyroidectomy. Factors beyond the 6-month mark were not considered, and only the 10-minute intraoperative PTH (IOPTH) measurement was included in the model. After adjusting for surgical approach, postoperative Day 0 calcium (Ca) level, and postoperative Day 1 Ca level, a high 10-minute IOPTH level (OR = 1.015) and a high postoperative 3-month PTH level (OR = 1.048) were identified as independent postoperative factors for ePTH 6 months after surgery.

### Machine learning-based prediction of elevated PTH levels among the US general population [^113nbzh4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, PTH was measured at one time during the survey and thus may not reflect patients' chronic status. There is a circadian rhythm and seasonal variation in PTH levels, and a single measurement might be affected by circadian rhythm. However, because seasonal variation in PTH levels might be inversely associated with the seasonal variation of vitamin D levels, the prediction model indirectly reflected the vitamin D status by other predictors and thus partly compensated for the seasonal variation in PTH levels.

Second, we included only participants with PTH measured and thus cannot rule out the possibility of selection bias. Third, because the purpose of our study was to build the prediction model of elevated PTH from demographic and clinical data, we did not employ the NHANES survey weight, which is generally recommended to produce nationally representative descriptive statistics. Thus, our findings may suffer from sampling bias and have limited generalizability.

Fourth, while we split the NHANES data into training and test data, we did not evaluate the validity of our prediction models in external data. Lastly, we did not have detailed information to differentiate the pathology of hyperparathyroidism (e.g. primary hyperparathyroidism and secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D deficiency or chronic kidney disease). However, the diagnosis of the etiology of hyperparathyroidism was based on a multimodal approach including biochemical data, ultrasonography, and scintigraphy, and this is outside the scope of our study.

### Hypercalcemia: A review [^117NS27X]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Hypercalcemia affects approximately 1% of the worldwide population. Mild hypercalcemia, defined as a total calcium level of less than 12 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 10 mg/dL or greater (≥ 2.5 mmol/L), or that develops rapidly over days to weeks, can cause nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma.

- **Observations**: Approximately 90% of people with hypercalcemia have primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) or malignancy. Additional causes of hypercalcemia include granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis, endocrinopathies like thyroid disease, immobilization, genetic disorders, and medications such as thiazide diuretics. Supplements like calcium, vitamin D, or vitamin A are potential contributors. Hypercalcemia has also been associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 protein inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, denosumab discontinuation, SARS-CoV-2, ketogenic diets, and extreme exercise, but these account for less than 1% of causes. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the most important initial test to evaluate hypercalcemia, as it distinguishes PTH-dependent from PTH-independent causes. In a patient with hypercalcemia, an elevated or normal PTH concentration is consistent with PHPT, while a suppressed PTH level (< 20 pg/mL depending on the assay) indicates another cause.

### Eucalcemic parathyroid hormone elevation after parathyroidectomy for primary sporadic hyperparathyroidism: Risk factors, trend, and outcome [^115vm6iU]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 1 shows the change in mean postoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) level on Day 1, at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 2 years after parathyroidectomy in Group A and Group B. In both groups, there was a significant rise in PTH from postoperative Day 1 to 3 months. However, after 6 months, there were no significant changes in PTH in Group A, whereas there was a significant drop in Group B. Postoperative PTH elevation appeared to peak at 3–6 months in Group B.

In the first 2 postoperative years, only 78 patients (48.4%) maintained normal postoperative PTH levels across the entire cohort. Furthermore, 75 patients (46.6%) had elevated PTH levels on at least one occasion, and 8 (5.0%) had persistently elevated PTH levels on all occasions. Upon further analysis, in Group B, 26 of 55 patients (47.3%) showed a normalized PTH at 12 months, while in Group A, 10 of 86 patients (11.6%) had an elevated PTH at 12 months. Overall, the proportion of patients with normalized PTH increased from 62.5% at 6 months to 78.7% at 2 years, although at 2 years, the difference in PTH levels was still significant between the two groups.

### Elevated parathyroid hormone levels after parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism [^1123e2Ry]. Head & Neck (2009). Low credibility.

Curative parathyroidectomy is associated with elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) with eucalcemia. This study sought to determine the frequency, clinical significance, and risk factors of this finding.

- **Methods**: Seventy-six consecutive patients surgically treated for primary hyperparathyroidism due to a single parathyroid adenoma in 2006 to 2007 were monitored for one month postoperatively; those with elevated PTH levels (> 70 pg/mL) were monitored for 18 months.

- **Results**: Nineteen patients (25%) had high postoperative PTH levels with normal calcium levels. Compared with the remaining patients, this group had a significantly higher average preoperative PTH level (224.89 vs. 156.86 pg/mL) and a lesser intraoperative decrease in PTH.

- **Conclusions**: About 25% of eucalcemic patients may have elevated PTH levels after parathyroidectomy. A high preoperative PTH level (> 225 pg/mL) may predict a persistently high postoperative level. Evaluation of blood and urine calcium, bone density, and cardiac function should be considered in affected patients.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: A current perspective [^113wbRCh]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (P-HPT) is one of the most common endocrine disorders. Eighty to eighty-five percent of cases are due to parathyroid adenomas, while hyperplasia and carcinoma account for 10% to 15% and less than 1% of cases, respectively. The past decade has witnessed remarkable advances in understanding the molecular basis of parathyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia. Additionally, imaging studies and the development of the intraoperative assay for parathyroid hormone have transformed the diagnosis and management of patients with these disorders.

- **Objective**: To review the pathology of parathyroid lesions associated with P-HPT, their molecular and genetic bases, including heritable hyperparathyroidism syndromes, and their clinical diagnosis and management.

- **Data sources**: Review of pertinent epidemiology, pathology, radiology, and surgery literature on the diagnosis, classification, and treatment of P-HPT.

- **Conclusions**: Although heritable causes of P-HPT, including multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 and 2A and hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, account for a minority of cases, advances in the characterization of the affected genes have provided insights into the genetic basis of sporadic parathyroid neoplasms. Alterations in cyclin D1 and loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 11q in adenomas and hyperplasias have provided support for the clonality of these lesions. Parafibromin, the protein product of the HRPT2 gene responsible for hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, has been implicated in the development of sporadic parathyroid carcinomas.

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: Evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^112noYiG]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a main regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism. Calcium levels (Ca²⁺) are tightly controlled through the action of PTH and 1,25(OH)₂D₃ (calcitriol). Calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) are localized on the parathyroid cell membrane and detect changes in the serum Ca²⁺ concentrations. Hypocalcemia triggers the release of PTH by the parathyroid cells; conversely, hypercalcemia suppresses the release of PTH.

PTH stimulates bone resorption, which increases serum calcium and phosphate (PO₄³⁻) levels. In the kidney, PTH stimulates the reabsorption of calcium and promotes phosphate excretion. PTH also promotes the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) to calcitriol in the kidney, the active form of vitamin D responsible for increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate.

All these well-orchestrated steps restore calcium levels to the normal range (8.5–10.5 mg/dL) and, via actions of PTH and other hormones such as fibroblast growth factor 23 in the kidney, restore the phosphate levels within the normal range (2.5–4.5 mg/dL).

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114rcog5]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2016). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common disorder characterized by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from one or more of the four parathyroid glands. In most individuals, a single benign parathyroid adenoma is the cause. However, multiglandular disease, typically seen in familial PHPT syndromes, is not rare. The genetics of PHPT is usually monoclonal when a single gland is involved and polyclonal in cases of multiglandular disease. Genes implicated in PHPT include proto-oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes.

Hypercalcemia is the biochemical hallmark of PHPT. The concentration of PTH is usually increased, though it can remain within the normal range, which is considered abnormal in the setting of hypercalcemia. Normocalcemic PHPT is now recognized as a variant where the serum calcium level is persistently normal, but PTH levels are elevated without an obvious inciting stimulus.

The clinical presentation of PHPT ranges from asymptomatic disease, commonly observed in countries with routine biochemical screening, to classic symptomatic disease with renal and/or skeletal complications. Recent revisions to management guidelines assist clinicians in deciding between a parathyroidectomy or a non-surgical course. This primer covers these topics, with particular attention to the epidemiology, clinical presentations, genetics, evaluation, and guidelines for managing PHPT.

### Clinical guidelines and PTH measurement: Does assay generation matter [^111g74q9]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an important regulator of calcium and phosphate homeostasis and bone remodeling. It is metabolized into PTH fragments, which are measured to varying extents by different generations of PTH assays due to differences in the fragments recognized and a lack of assay standardization. PTH measurement is utilized in the workup of several conditions, and clinical guidelines offer recommendations regarding these measurements.

This review provides an overview of the impact of differences between PTH assays, applying distinct clinical guidelines for primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism as well as the perioperative use of PTH measurements. Guidelines address PTH measurement in different ways, recommending either trend monitoring, the use of a fold increase of the upper reference limit, or an absolute PTH cutoff value.

- **Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT)**: For classic PHPT, the type of PTH assay used does not affect diagnosis or management because the precise concentration of PTH is less relevant.

- **Chronic kidney disease**: Guidelines recommend treating secondary hyperparathyroidism above a twofold to ninefold PTH increase, which results in different clinical decisions depending on the assay used.

- **Post-bariatric surgery patients**: Guidelines state absolute cutoff values for PTH, but the impact of different generation assays is unknown since a direct comparison of PTH assays has never been performed.

- **Parathyroid surgery**: PTH measurements with a third-generation assay reflect treatment success more rapidly than second-generation assays.

Increased awareness among clinicians regarding these aspects is essential.

### Rare genetic disorders that impair parathyroid hormone synthesis, secretion, or bioactivity provide insights into the diagnostic utility of different parathyroid hormone assays [^1117e8wU]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the major peptide hormone regulator of blood calcium homeostasis. Abnormal PTH levels can be observed in patients with various congenital and acquired disorders, including chronic kidney disease (CKD). This review focuses on rare human diseases caused by PTH mutations that have provided insights into the regulation of PTH synthesis and secretion, as well as the diagnostic utility of different PTH assays.

- **Recent findings**: Over the past years, numerous diseases affecting calcium and phosphate homeostasis have been defined at the molecular level that are responsible for reduced or increased serum PTH levels. The underlying genetic mutations impair parathyroid gland development, involve the PTH gene itself, or alter function of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) or its downstream signaling partners that contribute to the regulation of PTH synthesis or secretion. Mutations in the pre-sequence of the mature PTH peptide can impair hormone synthesis or intracellular processing, while amino acid substitutions affecting the secreted PTH(1–84) impair PTH receptor (PTH1R) activation or cause defective cleavage of the pro-sequence, thus resulting in the secretion of a pro-PTH with much reduced biological activity. Mutations affecting the secreted hormone can alter detection by different PTH assays, thus requiring detailed knowledge of the utilized diagnostic test.

- **Summary**: Rare diseases affecting PTH synthesis and secretion have offered helpful insights into parathyroid biology and the diagnostic utility of commonly used PTH assays.

### Persistent elevation of parathyroid hormone after curative parathyroidectomy: A risk factor for recurrent hyperparathyroidism [^115wWb6f]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Up to 45% of patients may have persistently elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels after curative parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), although the clinical significance is unclear. We aimed to assess the long-term clinical significance of persistently elevated PTH early after parathyroidectomy.

- **Methods**: A prospectively collected institutional database was queried for patients who underwent parathyroidectomy for sporadic PHPT between 12/99 and 6/22 and had normal serum calcium levels at 6 months postoperatively. Demographic and clinical data were collected, including diagnoses associated with secondary HPT (gastrointestinal malabsorptive diseases, kidney disease, and vitamin D deficiency). Patients were divided into two groups: normal PTH or elevated PTH at 6 months postoperatively. The rate of persistently elevated PTH, average time to PTH normalization, and time to recurrence were determined.

- **Results**: The final cohort included 1,146 patients; 849 (91%) had normal PTH levels and 194 (17%) had early postoperative normocalcemia with elevated PTH at 6 months postoperatively. Among 194 patients (mean follow-up: 50 ± 53 months), 14 (7.2%) developed rePHPT and 86 (44.3%) had normalization of PTH levels (median time to normalization: 12 months; IQR: 9 and 15). There was no difference in the presence of diagnoses associated with secondary HPT between patients who had rePHPT, normalization of PTH levels, or remained normocalcemic with persistently elevated PTH levels. The median time to recurrence was 22 months (IQR: 11 and 48).

### Parathyroid hormone, a uremic toxin [^114uNZWk]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Despite innovations in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism, uremic patients often exhibit marked elevation in PTH levels. Uremic toxicity is partly attributable to excess circulating PTH. It is well-established that PTH can induce changes in cell calcium, a crucial intracellular signal necessary for normal cell function. The effect of PTH in dialysis patients extends beyond bone, and the diversity of its biological effects is summarized in this review.

- **Presence of different circulating PTH fragments**: The review addresses the presence of various circulating PTH fragments in uremic patients.
- **PTH assays utilized**: It discusses the PTH assays currently used to measure circulating PTH.
- **PTH effects due to C-terminal PTH fragments**: Some PTH effects observed in uremic patients may result from interactions of the C-terminal PTH fragment with putative C-terminal PTH receptors.

### Molecular and clinical spectrum of primary hyperparathyroidism [^117MGtsN]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Recent data suggest an increase in the overall incidence of parathyroid disorders, with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) being the most prevalent parathyroid disorder. PHPT is associated with morbidities, such as fractures, kidney stones, and chronic kidney disease, and an increased risk of death. The symptoms of PHPT can be nonspecific, potentially delaying diagnosis. Approximately 15% of patients with PHPT have an underlying heritable form of the disease, which may be associated with extraparathyroidal manifestations. This association requires active surveillance for these manifestations, as seen in multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1 and 2A. Genetic testing for heritable forms should be offered to patients with multiglandular disease, recurrent PHPT, young onset PHPT (age ≤ 40 years), and those with a family history of parathyroid tumors. However, the genetic cause for the majority of patients with heritable forms of PHPT remains unknown. Distinction between sporadic and heritable forms of PHPT is useful in surgical planning for parathyroidectomy and has implications for the family. Genes currently known to be associated with heritable forms of PHPT account for approximately half of sporadic parathyroid tumors, but the genetic cause in approximately half remains unknown. Furthermore, there is no systemic therapy for parathyroid carcinoma, a rare but potentially fatal cause of PHPT. Improved understanding of the molecular characteristics of parathyroid tumors will allow us to identify biomarkers for diagnosis and novel targets for therapy.

### Diagnosis and management of hypophosphatemic disorders [^116heeBC]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Phosphate is not only an essential component of the mineralized skeleton but also plays a significant role in various physiological and cellular functions. Several mineral-regulating hormones, including 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast-growth factor 23, predominantly modulate serum phosphate levels at the level of the bone, kidney, and intestine. Impaired serum phosphate levels can lead to non-specific symptoms, and these levels are not routinely measured in laboratory analyses; thus, disorders of hypophosphatemia are often overlooked during patient evaluations.

In the past few decades, significant progress has been made in identifying the genetic causes of and novel therapies for hypophosphatemic disorders. This review discusses the regulation of phosphate homeostasis, clinical presentation, work-up, disorders, and treatment of hypophosphatemia.

	- It has been experimentally found that parathyroid miRNAs are dysregulated in experimental hyperparathyroidism, including miR-29, miR-21, miR-148, miR-30, and miR-141 (up-regulated); as well as miR-10, miR-125, and miR-25 (down-regulated). The let-7 family is a class of well-conserved miRNAs involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and metabolism. The miR-148 family, which is highly conserved across species, also plays a key role in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including Th1 and B-cell differentiation, autoimmune diseases, and tumorigenesis.

It has been experimentally demonstrated that inhibition of the enriched let-7 family increased the expression of miR-128 in normal and uremic rats as well as in mouse PTH secretion in parathyroid organ cultures. In contrast, inhibition of miR-148 family up-regulation prevented the elevation of serum parathyroid hormone levels and decreased the level of secreted PTH in parathyroid cultures from uremic rats. The antagonism of two miRNAs, let-7 and miR-148, regulated PTH secretion in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that let-7 and miR-148 may play a role in parathyroid function.

Further studies are needed in the future to clarify the target genes of let-7 and miR-148 in the parathyroid glands and how they are involved in the regulation of PTH synthesis and secretion, thus revealing their potential role in the pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism.

### Failure to diagnose and treat hyperparathyroidism among patients with hypercalcemia: Opportunities for intervention at the patient and physician level to increase surgical referral [^111Pk86F]. The Oncologist (2019). Low credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism is both underdiagnosed and undertreated, but the reasons for these deficiencies have not been described. The purpose of this study was to identify reasons for underdiagnosis and undertreatment of hyperparathyroidism that could be addressed by targeted interventions.

- **Materials and methods**: We identified 3,200 patients with hypercalcemia (serum calcium > 10.5 mg/dL) who had parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels evaluated at our institution from 2011 to 2016. We randomly sampled 60 patients and divided them into three groups based on their PTH levels. Two independent reviewers examined clinical notes and diagnostic data to identify reasons for delayed diagnosis or referral for treatment.

- **Results**: The mean age of the patients was 61 ± 16.5 years, 68% were women, and 55% were white. Fifty percent of patients had ≥ 1 elevated calcium level that was missed by their primary care provider. Hypercalcemia was frequently attributed to causes other than hyperparathyroidism, including diuretics (12%), calcium supplements (12%), dehydration (5%), and renal dysfunction (3%). Even when calcium and PTH were both elevated, the diagnosis was missed or delayed in 40% of patients. For 7% of patients, a nonsurgeon stated that surgery offered no benefit; 22% of patients were offered medical treatment or observation, and 8% opted not to see a surgeon. Only 20% of patients were referred for surgical evaluation, and they waited a median of 16 months before seeing a surgeon.

To address common causes for delayed diagnosis and treatment of hyperparathyroidism, we must…

### Hyperparathyroidism, humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, and the anabolic actions of parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-related protein on the skeleton [^111NcUNP]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

What have we learned from the Takeuchi case? It has been 80 years since malignancy-associated hypercalcemia was described, 45 years since HHM was first described, 15 years since PTHrP was identified, and 12 years since PTHrP immunoassays became available for clinical research. We now have a comprehensive understanding of HHM in pathophysiological terms and can reproduce the cardinal features of the syndrome in both laboratory animals and humans. The Takeuchi case highlights that there are still questions regarding HHM, such as the regulation differences of 1,25(OH)2D in patients with HHM and HPT, why normal osteoblast-osteoclast coupling is dysregulated in HHM, and fundamentally, what regulates osteoblast-osteoclast coupling, and why it is deranged in HHM. Given the rapid accumulation of new information about HHM, the anabolic effects of PTH and PTHrP, and osteoblast-osteoclast coupling over the past 10 years, there is reason to be optimistic that the answers to these questions will soon become clear.

### Effect of calcium citrate vs. calcium carbonate on elevated parathyroid hormone after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A double-blinded, randomized trial [^112zAuwy]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). High credibility.

Following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels potentially harmful to bone health are commonly observed. Owing to assumed superior absorption, calcium citrate is often recommended over calcium carbonate following RYGB for the treatment of elevated PTH. We aimed to investigate the impact of either calcium carbonate or calcium citrate (1200 mg elementary calcium) in patients with elevated PTH levels following RYGB.

- **Design**: Clinical, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial of a 12-week duration at a Danish University Hospital.

- **Patients and measurements**: Thirty-nine RYGB operated patients with elevated PTH levels (PTH > 6.9 pmol/L) and normal plasma levels of calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were randomized to either calcium carbonate or calcium citrate (1200 mg elementary calcium/daily). We assessed the change in PTH as the primary outcome.

- **Results**: The effect of the two calcium formulations on the change in PTH was comparable and neutral: -1.9% (calcium citrate) vs. +0.9% (calcium carbonate), P = 0.680. Compared to the carbonate-treated group, the following bone turnover markers decreased significantly in the citrate-treated group: procollagen I N-terminal propeptide (-16.6% vs. -3.2%, P = 0.021), osteocalcin (-17.2% vs. -4.3%, P = 0.007), and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (-5.9% vs. 3.7%, P = 0.027). These markers remained significantly decreased after multivariable adjustment.

- **Conclusion**: Increasing the dose of calcium supplementation in RYGB operated patients with slightly elevated PTH levels does not normalize PTH levels.

### Eucalcemic parathyroid hormone elevation after parathyroidectomy for primary sporadic hyperparathyroidism: Risk factors, trend, and outcome [^115bEebC]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

The results of the study are as follows: Table 1 provides a comparison of patient demographics, preoperative biochemical profiles, and bone mineral density (BMD) between groups A and B. Group B was significantly older at the time of parathyroidectomy (P = 0.003) and had higher preoperative calcium (P = 0.020), parathyroid hormone (PTH) (P < .001), and creatinine levels (P = 0.015), as well as lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3) levels (P = 0.007) compared to group A. However, preoperative serum alkaline phosphatase and 24-hour urine calcium excretion were similar between the two groups. Among the 137 patients (85.1%) who had BMD measured less than four months before surgery, the BMD at the forearm, femoral neck, and lumbar spine were significantly lower in group B compared to group A.

- **Table 1**: Comparison of patient demographics, preoperative biochemical profiles, and bone mineral density between those who had normal PTH levels six months after parathyroidectomy (Group A) and those who had elevated PTH levels six months after parathyroidectomy (Group B).

- **PTH**: Parathyroid hormone
- **25OHD3**: 25-hydroxyvitamin D3
- **Data Availability**: Available in 121 patients
- **BMD Measurement**: Available in 137 patients

Further analysis is presented in Table 2, which shows a comparison of operative findings between groups A and B. Group B had significantly heavier mean total parathyroid tissue excised (1467.5 ± 1946.0 mg vs. 937.5 ± 2113.9 mg, P < .001) and adenoma (1461.1 ± 1947.9 mg vs. 924.4 ± 2118.2 mg, P < .001) than group A. Although group B had significantly more focused or unilateral parathyroid exploration (92.1% vs. 79.6%, P = 0.044), the number of parathyroid glands excised and total operating time were similar between the two groups. As consistent with the higher preoperative PTH level, the intraoperative PTH (IOPTH) level at induction and at 0 minutes was higher in Group B.

### Mild primary hyperparathyroidism: A literature review [^115ACQ1q]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

The biochemical profile of classic primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) consists of both elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. The standard of care is parathyroidectomy unless prohibited by medical comorbidities. Because more patients are undergoing routine bone density evaluation and neck imaging studies for other purposes, there is a subset of people identified with a biochemically mild form of pHPT that expresses itself as either elevated calcium or parathyroid hormone levels. These patients often do not fall into the criteria for operation based on the National Institutes of Health consensus guidelines, and they can present a challenge of diagnosis and management. The purpose of this paper is to review the available literature on mild pHPT in an effort to better characterize this patient population and to determine whether patients benefit from parathyroidectomy. Evidence suggests that there are patients with mild pHPT who have overt symptoms that are found to improve after parathyroidectomy. There is also a group of patients with biochemically mild pHPT who are found to progress to classic pHPT over time; however, it is not predictable which group of patients this will be. Early intervention for this group with mild pHPT may prevent progression of bone, psychiatric, and renal complications, and parathyroidectomy has proven safe in appropriately selected patients at high volume centers.

### Associations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D with circulating PTH, phosphate and calcium in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism [^114osHtk]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite the NIH clinical recommendations, many clinicians remain reluctant to replace vitamin D in patients with hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP), amid concerns over potentially aggravating the hypercalcemia. Additionally, the optimum level of vitamin D replacement in PHP patients remains unclear.

We conducted a large retrospective study to determine the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, calcium, and other key biochemical markers in patients with PHP. Serum, plasma, and urinary biochemical measurements were collected from 251 patients diagnosed with PHP and hypercalcemia.

When examining the overall mean circulating levels during clinical follow-up, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D showed a highly significant correlation with plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) (r = -0.23, P = 0.0003) and serum phosphate (r = 0.16, P = 0.0119). No significant relationship was observed between serum calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (r = 0.002, P = 0.98). Mean plasma PTH levels during clinical follow-up were 51% lower in patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels over 60 nm compared to those with lower levels. Patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D > 60 nm exhibited significantly reduced PTH hypersecretion without experiencing worsened hypercalcemia.

### Eucalcemic parathyroid hormone elevation after parathyroidectomy for primary sporadic hyperparathyroidism: Risk factors, trend, and outcome [^1116AQeg]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Although primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) remains a relatively uncommon endocrine disease among Asian countries, with an incidence ranging between 0.5 and 1 per 3000 of the general population, it has been increasing over the last decade. This increase is related to better patient education, increased disease awareness, and more frequent serum calcium screening. Similar to the West, parathyroidectomy proves to be a cost-effective and curative treatment for the majority of pHPT patients. In experienced hands, the surgical cure rate approaches 95%–100% with minimal morbidity. However, despite attaining postoperative normocalcemia, parathyroid hormone (PTH) elevation is not uncommonly observed after surgery. In the literature, this phenomenon of eucalcemic parathyroid hormone elevation (ePTH) has been well described and studied, although the exact etiology remains poorly understood.

- **Causes and explanations**: A number of explanations or causes have been suggested, and they include relative postoperative hypocalcemia/vitamin D deficiency leading to secondary HPT, chronic renal impairment, renal leak of calcium, bone remineralization or bone hunger, changes in the calcium-sensing receptors, decreased vitamin D 1-alpha-hydroxylation, and PTH receptor downregulation as a response to the high preoperative PTH level.

Our clinical experience indicates that ePTH tends to concern referring physicians and treating surgeons alike. Furthermore, the natural history of postoperative ePTH and the optimal testing schedule following parathyroidectomy remain not entirely defined. More importantly, some authors have suggested that perhaps…

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism, specifically related to diagnosis, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend diagnosing normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism by confirming normal adjusted total calcium and normal ionized calcium levels, along with elevated intact PTH levels. This should be done using either a second or third-generation assay on at least two occasions over 3–6 months after excluding all alternative causes for secondary hyperparathyroidism.

### Targets for parathyroid hormone in secondary hyperparathyroidism: is a "one-size-fits-all" approach appropriate? A prospective incident cohort study [^111Wfsp7]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The following biological parameters were collected at the time of inclusion: PTH, calcemia, phosphorus, vitamin D, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin, hemoglobin, and measured ionized calcium. KDIGO™ guidelines have recommended maintaining PTH up to 2 to 9-fold above the normal range. Therefore, PTH was described as a binary variable (in or out of target) and a quantitative variable (multiple of the upper normal limit). According to KDIGO™ guidelines, calcemia was checked as hypo-, normo-, or hypercalcemia using 2.1 and 2.6 mmol/L as cut-off values and phosphatemia as hypo-, normo-, or hyperphosphatemia using 0.8 and 1.45 mmol/L as cut-off values. ALP was analyzed according to two stages using medians as cut-off values, albuminuria according to two stages using 25 g/L as the cut-off value, and hemoglobin according to three stages using 10 and 12 g/dL as cut-off values.

Four technologies were used for PTH dosing: chemiluminometric technology (48%), electrochemiluminescence method (23%), immuno-enzymology (11%), immune chemiluminometric technology (16%), and unknown (2%). Each kit was provided by several laboratories that had different standards.

All drugs acting on phospho-calcic metabolism were collected and classified into four groups: vitamin D and analogs, calcium supplementation, calcium-free phosphorus binders, and cinacalcet.

### Testing for primary hyperparathyroidism in 17,491 patients with hypercalcemia [^112jCwYy]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is underdiagnosed and associated with many adverse health effects. Historically, many hypercalcemic patients have not received parathyroid hormone (PTH) testing; however, the underlying reasons are uncertain. Our goals are to determine the PTH testing rate among hypercalcemic individuals at a large academic health system and to assess for characteristics associated with testing versus not testing for PHPT to inform future strategies for closing testing gaps.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included adult patients with ≥ 1 elevated serum calcium result between 2018 and 2022. Based on the presence or absence of a serum PTH result, individuals were classified as "screened" versus "unscreened" for PHPT. Demographic and clinical characteristics of these groups were compared.

- **Results**: The sample comprised 17,491 patients: 6567 male (37.5%), 10,924 female (62.5%), mean age 59 years. PTH testing was performed in 6096 (34.9%). Characteristics independently associated with the greatest odds of screening were five or more elevated calcium results (odds ratio [OR] 5.02, P < 0.0001), calcium > 12.0 mg/dL (OR 2.48, P < 0.0001), and osteoporosis (OR 2.42, P < 0.0001). Characteristics associated with the lowest odds of screening were age < 35 years (OR 0.60, P < 0.0001), death during the study period (OR 0.68, P < 0.0001), age ≥ 85 years (OR 0.70, P = 0.0007), and depression (OR 0.84, P = 0.0081).

- **Conclusions**: Only 35% of hypercalcemic patients received PTH testing. Although the presence of PHPT-associated morbidity was…

### Diagnosis and management of pseudohypoparathyroidism and related disorders: First international consensus statement [^1166KVaY]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

This consensus statement covers recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) and related disorders. These disorders comprise metabolic conditions characterized by physical findings that variably include short bones, short stature, a stocky build, early-onset obesity, and ectopic ossifications. They also often have endocrine defects, including resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH) and TSH.

The presentation and severity of PHP and its related disorders vary between affected individuals, with considerable clinical and molecular overlap between the different types. A specific diagnosis is often delayed due to a lack of recognition of the syndrome and its associated features. Participants in this consensus statement agreed that the diagnosis of PHP should be based on major criteria, including resistance to PTH, ectopic ossifications, brachydactyly, and early-onset obesity. Clinical and laboratory diagnoses should be confirmed by molecular genetic analysis.

Patients should be screened at diagnosis and during follow-up for specific features such as PTH resistance, TSH resistance, growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadism, skeletal deformities, oral health issues, weight gain, glucose intolerance or type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, as well as subcutaneous and/or deeper ectopic ossifications, and neurocognitive impairment.

Overall, a coordinated and multidisciplinary approach from infancy through adulthood, including a transition program, should help improve the care of patients affected by these disorders.

### The case for routine parathyroid hormone monitoring [^114dWdSx]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a uremic toxin with multiple systemic effects, including bone disorders (renal osteodystrophy), myopathy, neurologic abnormalities, anemia, pruritus, and cardiomyopathy. Hyperparathyroidism is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and results in significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated. Clinical practice guidelines from the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) initiative broadened the optimal PTH range to more than 2 and less than 9 times the upper limit of normal for the assay measured. Furthermore, the guidelines recommend following trends in PTH to determine the appropriate therapy. These guidelines overcome issues with assay variability and help clinicians make judgments when treating individual patients. They also require frequent measurement in order to determine trends and implement appropriate treatments.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113dWWvX]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to review primary hyperparathyroidism and the key issues relevant to practicing endocrinologists. The methods involved reviewing the latest information on the presentation, diagnosis, and both traditional and nontraditional aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism.

The results showed that the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is straightforward when a traditional hypercalcemic patient is documented to have an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. It is common to identify patients with normal serum calcium levels but elevated PTH levels, where no secondary causes for hyperparathyroidism can be confirmed. Traditional target organs of primary hyperparathyroidism, such as the skeleton and kidneys, continue to be a focus in patient evaluation. Bone mineral density demonstrates a typical pattern of involvement, with the distal one-third radius being selectively reduced compared to the lumbar spine, where bone mineral density is generally well maintained. There is interest in the neurocognitive and cardiovascular aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism; however, they have not been definitively shown to aid in the decision for, or against surgery. Recommendations for surgery in primary hyperparathyroidism are based on guidelines that focus on serum calcium level, renal function, bone mineral density, and age. For patients who do not meet the guidelines, a nonsurgical management approach is considered beneficial.

In conclusion, primary hyperparathyroidism continues to show changes in its clinical profile, with normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism being of significant interest.

False-negative results in choline/methionine studies may occur in cases of moderate hypercalcemia and non-elevated PTH serum levels (so-called "abnormally normal serum PTH level"). In the case of MGD, one or several hyperplastic glands may be missed, particularly in sHPT or MEN. False-negative results may also be caused by a too restricted field of view, in particular in case of recurrence after parathyroidectomy.

### Hypercalcemia secondary to gastrointestinal stromal tumors: Parathyroid hormone-related protein independent mechanism [^1168S9UE]. Endocrine Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common paraneoplastic manifestation of many malignancies like breast, ovarian, and squamous-cell cancers of the head and neck; however, there have only been a few case reports of hypercalcemia associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). We report a case of GIST presenting with hypercalcemia without any osseous metastasis and provide a literature review regarding the mechanisms of hypercalcemia and therapeutic strategies.

- **Methods**: We present a case report and a review of the relevant literature.

- **Results**: A 52-year-old woman with a history of localized breast cancer in remission presented with a pelvic 13 × 12 cm GIST with peritoneal, liver, and lung metastases. She had hypercalcemia of 14.3 mg/dL (reference range 8.5–10.5 mg/dL). Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) was undetectable, and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) was appropriately low at 1 pg/mL (reference range 10–65 pg/mL). The 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25 OH₂ vit D) level was elevated at 131 pg/mL (reference range 18–78 pg/mL) with normal renal function. Calcium levels responded transiently to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and bisphosphonates, but within a year, she expired due to tumor progression.

- **Conclusion**: GIST is a rare cause of hypercalcemia. In addition to PTHrP expression, direct tumor production of 1,25(OH)₂ vit D or the 1-α hydroxylase enzyme resulting in the activation of 25-hydroxy vitamin D may be an alternative mechanism in GIST-related hypercalcemia. Therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and bisphosphonates is recommended, though prognosis is poor. Further investigations are needed to characterize the etiology and management of this condition.

### Calcitonin: current concepts and differential diagnosis [^112632Xm]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Endogenous CT secretion can increase as a physiological consequence of excessive stimuli, such as hypercalcemia and hypergastrinemia. Primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy are the most common causes of hypercalcemia, accounting for approximately 90% of cases. However, chronic hypercalcemia is a rare cause of CT elevation. Oral calcium administration elicits diverse hormonal responses in these cases, aiding in the differential diagnosis of these conditions. Thyroid parafollicular cells can express calcium-sensing receptors similar to those on the parathyroid gland. In contrast to PTH, binding of the receptor stimulates CT release. Hypergastrinemia can be caused by achlorhydria (e.g. pernicious anemia, atrophic gastritis, antacids) or Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. Finally, CT can be elevated in various situations in which its precursors are elevated, such as pancreatitis, bacterial inflammation, sepsis, or CGRP inhibitors (migraine treatment).

Overproduction of CT can also occur primarily rather than as a response to CT secretagogues. While not pathognomonic, elevated CT is mostly associated with MTC, serving as a diagnostic and prognostic tool as described in previous chapters. However, MTC is not the only thyroid pathology that can present with hypercalcitoninemia.

CCH has been associated with slight increases in both basal and stimulated serum CT levels.

### Natpara (parathyroid hormone) [^117T9J92]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Warning: Potential risk of osteosarcoma**: In male and female rats, parathyroid hormone caused an increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor). The occurrence of osteosarcoma was dependent on parathyroid hormone dose and treatment duration. This effect was observed at parathyroid hormone exposure levels ranging from 3 to 71 times the exposure levels in humans receiving a 100 mcg dose of Natpara. These data could not exclude a risk to humans [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

Because of a potential risk of osteosarcoma, use Natpara only in patients who cannot be well-controlled on calcium and active forms of vitamin D alone and for whom the potential benefits are considered to outweigh this potential risk [see Indications and Usage (1), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Avoid use of Natpara in patients who are at increased baseline risk for osteosarcoma, such as patients with Paget's disease of bone or unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase, pediatric and young adult patients with open epiphyses, patients with hereditary disorders predisposing to osteosarcoma or patients with a prior history of external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Program availability**: Because of the risk of osteosarcoma, Natpara is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Natpara REMS Program [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Primary hyperparathyroidism and the kidney: Biochemical and clinical spectrum [^115Pc561]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism manifests biochemically as a disturbance in serum calcium homeostasis, with the kidney playing a central role in setting serum calcium levels. It boasts the highest rate of active calcium transport and modulates serum calcium homeostasis through its endocrine role in 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D secretion. Receptors for PTH are widely expressed throughout the renal tubule, contributing to calcium transport and endocrine function. Biochemical manifestations include increased tubular reabsorption of calcium, decreased reabsorption of phosphate and bicarbonate, and hypercalciuria. In some patients, a reduction in glomerular filtration may occur, perturbing diagnostic relationships among biochemical variables and inducing further increases in PTH secretion. Parathyroidectomy rapidly restores biochemical abnormalities to normal, except for chronic reduced glomerular filtration.

Clinical manifestations include nephrolithiasis, which is common, and nephrocalcinosis, which is less common. Nephrocalcinosis can occur with or without nephrolithiasis. Risk factors for nephrolithiasis involve oversaturation of urine with calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate. Risk factors for nephrocalcinosis remain unclear. Parathyroidectomy significantly reduces the incidence of nephrolithiasis but has limited effect on nephrocalcinosis.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^1176xNEt]. Lancet (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on primary hyperparathyroidism:

- **Definition**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is an endocrine disorder of calcium metabolism resulting from an abnormal increase in the secretion of PTH from one or more of the parathyroid glands.

- **Pathophysiology**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is primarily caused by solitary parathyroid adenoma (80%), four-gland hyperplasia (10–15%), multiple adenomas (5%), and parathyroid cancer (< 1%).

- **Epidemiology**: The average incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism in men and women in the US is 24.7 and 65.5 cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The age-adjusted prevalence in men and women is 85.2 and 232.7 per 100,000 individuals, respectively.

- **Disease course**: Primary hyperparathyroidism can present with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic biochemical abnormalities to overt end-organ complications. In developed countries, approximately 85% of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis, identified incidentally through routine biochemical screening, while around 20% present with renal manifestations (such as nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis), skeletal complications (including fractures, osteitis fibrosa cystica, or bone pain), or symptomatic hypercalcemia. In contrast, the majority of patients in developing countries present with symptomatic disease. Symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is associated with overt skeletal and renal complications and may also include cardiovascular and neurocognitive symptoms.
