## Question

Nausea after delivering a baby

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage nausea after delivering a baby. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about temporal patterns and immediate postpartum causes. Then, I should verify persistent postpartum nausea and its differential. Next, I will assess severity and risk stratification, followed by targeted diagnostics. After that, I need to outline evidence-based management, including pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies, and consider special populations like breastfeeding. Finally, I should integrate mental health screening, follow-up, and a concise decision algorithm, while double-checking for pitfalls and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the temporal frame because timing shapes the differential. Immediate postpartum nausea within hours to a few days often reflects anesthesia-related effects, uterotonic agents, or surgical factors, whereas persistent postpartum nausea beyond a week demands a broader differential including gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, infectious, medication-induced, and psychiatric etiologies, so I need to anchor the evaluation to onset and trajectory before jumping to conclusions [^115tX9y8] [^111UuQq9] [^114ZBRkD].

> I will now examine anesthesia-related causes for early postpartum nausea, especially after cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia. Wait, let me verify the prevalence and contributors: intraoperative nausea and vomiting during cesarean under regional anesthesia is common, with pooled estimates around 36 percent, and risk factors include hypotension, uterine exteriorization, opioid administration, and patient factors such as motion sickness history, so I should screen for these intraoperative triggers and document neuraxial opioid exposure and blood pressure nadir during the case [^114mUJBK] [^112i7d91] [^1178AL88].

> Next, I should review medication-related contributors in the immediate postpartum period. Uterotonics used for active management of the third stage, particularly ergometrine, increase nausea and vomiting risk, and neuraxial opioids for postoperative analgesia can provoke PONV, so I need to check the obstetric and anesthetic medication record carefully and correlate timing of antiemetic needs with these exposures [^114ZBRkD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "just hormones". While rapid hormonal shifts after delivery may contribute to nausea, I should confirm that persistent postpartum nausea beyond a week warrants a structured differential including gastrointestinal causes such as GERD, gastritis, ileus, or obstruction; endocrine issues like thyroid dysfunction; neurologic causes including migraine or elevated intracranial pressure; infectious etiologies; medication or supplement effects; and psychiatric conditions including anxiety and postpartum depression, tailoring the workup to associated symptoms and risk factors [^115tX9y8] [^111GcL98].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook the link between antepartum nausea and vomiting and postpartum psychiatric sequelae. Women with a history of hyperemesis gravidarum are at increased risk of postnatal depression, anxiety, and PTSD, and systematic reviews suggest a dose-response relationship between NVP severity and PPD risk, so persistent postpartum nausea should prompt screening for mood and anxiety disorders and consideration of integrated mental health follow-up [^116sFGht] [^112EayQt] [^113YZ1uV].

> Let me consider severity assessment next, because it guides escalation. I should confirm symptom burden using validated tools where feasible; the PUQE scoring system, adapted for postpartum context, helps quantify nausea, retching, and vomiting frequency, and I should also screen for red flags such as dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, inability to tolerate oral intake, weight loss, or signs of organ dysfunction that would necessitate urgent intervention [^115tX9y8].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and avoid unnecessary testing. Initially, I thought a comprehensive metabolic panel would be first-line, but wait, I should verify that basic labs are usually sufficient. A CBC, electrolytes, renal function, and glucose are appropriate starting points, with targeted tests such as liver enzymes, thyroid function, or urinalysis guided by history and exam, reserving imaging for suspected obstruction or neurologic processes and avoiding routine extensive panels when alarm features are absent [^115tX9y8] [^111GcL98].

> I will now examine pharmacologic management for persistent postpartum nausea, keeping breastfeeding safety in mind. First-line options include antihistamines such as doxylamine, dimenhydrinate, or promethazine, and dopamine antagonists like metoclopramide, with attention to dosing and extrapyramidal risks; serotonin antagonists such as ondansetron are reasonable second-line agents and are considered compatible with breastfeeding, though I should counsel on rare QT prolongation risk and consider ECG if cardiac risk factors exist [^1122WsJU] [^114CRN54] [^113nKxGj] [^1114UojN] [^1116acuL].

> But wait, what if the nausea is anesthesia-related or peri-cesarean? I should double-check prophylaxis and rescue strategies. For intraoperative and postoperative nausea and vomiting around cesarean, 5-HT3 antagonists, dopamine antagonists, and sedatives reduce IONV and PONV to varying degrees, and metoclopramide has supportive evidence for prophylaxis in this setting, though contemporary consensus notes metoclopramide may be less effective for PONV prophylaxis than other agents, so I should individualize based on risk, timing, and agent availability [^111UuQq9] [^113bcYwA] [^114YuJTu] [^114SN7XJ].

> Let me reconsider nonpharmacologic strategies because they can meaningfully augment care. Small frequent meals, avoidance of dietary triggers, oral rehydration with electrolytes, and supportive measures such as acupressure or ginger may help, and for severe refractory cases, enteral nutrition via nasogastric tube can be considered in a multidisciplinary setting to restore nutrition and hydration while minimizing parenteral risks [^115tX9y8] [^115RKrzL].

> I should confirm setting-of-care decisions aligned with severity. Mild symptoms can be managed outpatient with antiemetics and close follow-up, moderate symptoms may benefit from ambulatory day-unit care for hydration and escalation, and severe cases warrant inpatient management with IV fluids, electrolyte monitoring, and coordinated multidisciplinary input including obstetrics, anesthesia, gastroenterology, and mental health as indicated [^112MW6Sk] [^112kq1ea] [^1117ox9a].

> Next, I should review special populations, especially breastfeeding mothers. Most antiemetics, including doxylamine, metoclopramide, and ondansetron, are generally compatible with breastfeeding, but I need to check infant sedation risk with sedating agents and consider timing doses to minimize transfer, while also remembering that persistent maternal dehydration can impair milk supply and infant feeding, reinforcing the need for aggressive hydration support [^notfound].

> I will now integrate mental health screening because it is easy to miss yet clinically consequential. Given the elevated risk of PPD, anxiety, and PTSD after HG, I should administer validated screens such as the EPDS and consider trauma-informed care, and if symptoms persist beyond six weeks postpartum, I should escalate to formal psychiatric evaluation and treatment to mitigate long-term maternal and infant impacts [^116sFGht] [^112EayQt] [^114LJF8a].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway and double-check it aligns with evidence. If nausea is immediate postpartum, I prioritize anesthesia-related and medication causes and treat symptomatically with 5-HT3 antagonists or dopamine antagonists as appropriate. If nausea persists beyond a week, I broaden the differential, obtain basic labs, and initiate first-line antiemetics with supportive measures. If symptoms are severe or refractory, I escalate to second-line agents, consider inpatient care, and involve specialty consultation. Throughout, I screen for mental health comorbidity and ensure close follow-up to track response and adjust therapy [^115tX9y8] [^116sFGht] [^1122WsJU].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and communication are thorough. I should record onset, severity metrics, associated symptoms, medication exposures, obstetric and anesthetic details, diagnostic results, and the rationale for chosen therapies, and I should provide anticipatory guidance on warning signs that warrant urgent reassessment, including intractable vomiting, signs of dehydration, severe abdominal pain, fever, neurologic changes, or worsening mood symptoms [^115tX9y8].

Postpartum nausea is common and usually benign, but persistent or severe symptoms warrant evaluation for **postpartum complications** (e.g. infection, anemia, thyroid disease, PPH, preeclampsia) [^notfound] and **psychiatric comorbidity** (PPD, anxiety) [^116sFGht]. Initial workup should include a focused history, exam, and basic labs (CBC, electrolytes, renal/liver function, TSH) [^115tX9y8]; further testing is guided by findings. Management is cause-specific, with antiemetics (ondansetron, metoclopramide, promethazine) for symptom control and treatment of underlying conditions [^115tX9y8]; persistent nausea should prompt screening for PPD and anxiety [^112EayQt]. Most cases resolve with targeted therapy, but ongoing symptoms need reassessment for missed causes or complications [^115tX9y8].

## Common causes of nausea after childbirth

- **Hormonal changes**: Rapid postpartum shifts in estrogen, progesterone, and hCG can cause transient nausea [^notfound].

- **Gastrointestinal factors**: Postpartum ileus, constipation, or GERD are common after delivery, especially with cesarean or opioid use [^notfound].

- **Medications**: Opioids, antibiotics, magnesium sulfate, and uterotonics (e.g. ergometrine) can cause nausea [^notfound].

- **Anesthesia-related effects**: Spinal/epidural anesthesia and neuraxial opioids can cause nausea/vomiting [^111UuQq9].

- **Fatigue and stress**: Sleep deprivation, pain, and emotional stress contribute to nausea [^notfound].

- **Hematologic factors**: Anemia from blood loss or iron deficiency can cause nausea [^notfound].

---

## Less common but serious causes

Persistent or severe nausea may signal **serious conditions** requiring prompt evaluation:

| **Condition** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Postpartum hemorrhage | Excessive blood loss causing anemia and hypovolemia [^112JN6Wb] |
| Infection | Endometritis, urinary tract infection, or mastitis [^notfound] |
| Thyroid dysfunction | Postpartum thyroiditis or hyperthyroidism [^notfound] |
| Preeclampsia/eclampsia | Hypertensive disorders persisting postpartum [^notfound] |
| Gastrointestinal obstruction | Rare but serious complication [^111GcL98] |
| Medication-induced gastritis | NSAIDs or other medications [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **History**: Onset, duration, severity, associated symptoms (fever, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness), medication use, and obstetric history [^115tX9y8].

- **Physical examination**: Vital signs, abdominal exam, uterine assessment, and neurologic exam [^notfound].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function, TSH, and urinalysis [^notfound].

- **Imaging**: Abdominal ultrasound or CT if obstruction or other intra-abdominal pathology is suspected [^111GcL98].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Supportive care**: Hydration, small frequent meals, rest, and stress reduction [^115tX9y8].

- **Pharmacologic treatment**: Antiemetics (ondansetron, metoclopramide, promethazine) for symptom control [^1122WsJU].

- **Treatment of underlying conditions**: Antibiotics for infection, iron supplementation for anemia, thyroid hormone replacement, or surgical intervention if obstruction is present [^notfound].

- **Psychological support**: Counseling and support groups for postpartum adjustment and stress management [^1177V1cr].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

Untreated postpartum nausea can lead to:

- **Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance**: Especially with vomiting [^11535q4t].

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Due to poor intake [^113313LC].

- **Delayed recovery**: Prolonged recovery and increased healthcare use [^1136Cd6w].

- **Psychological impact**: Increased risk of postpartum depression and anxiety [^116sFGht].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Most cases resolve with appropriate treatment; prognosis is **generally excellent**. Recurrence is uncommon unless chronic conditions (e.g. thyroid disease, GERD) persist or new pregnancies occur.

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies include **adequate hydration and nutrition**, judicious use of medications with antiemetic prophylaxis when indicated, and patient education on warning signs and when to seek care [^11667biW] [^1122WsJU].

---

Postpartum nausea is common and usually benign, but persistent or severe symptoms need evaluation for complications and psychiatric comorbidity. A **focused workup and cause-specific treatment** — with antiemetic support — are key, and persistent symptoms should trigger screening for PPD/anxiety [^113YZ1uV].

### Interventions for preventing nausea and vomiting in women undergoing regional anaesthesia for caesarean section [^113bcYwA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting are distressing symptoms which are experienced commonly during caesarean section under regional anaesthesia and can also occur in the period following the procedure.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions given prophylactically to prevent nausea and vomiting in women undergoing regional anaesthesia for caesarean section.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (27 February 2012) and reference lists of identified studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and excluded quasi-RCTs and cross-over studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and carried out data extraction. Data entry was checked.

Main Results

Fifty-two studies met the inclusion criteria but only 41 studies, involving 5046 women, provided useable data for the review involving women having caesareans under regional anaesthesia. The majority of the studies involved women undergoing elective caesarean section. Only two studies included emergency surgery, however, they did not stratify data according to type of surgery. The studies covered numerous comparisons, but the majority of studies involved 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists, dopamine receptor antagonists, corticosteroids or acupressure. Studies were mainly small and of unclear quality. Three classes of intervention were found to be effective in at least three out of four of our primary outcomes (intraoperative nausea, intraoperative vomiting, postoperative nausea and postoperative vomiting). These interventions were 5-HT(3) antagonists, dopamine antagonists and sedatives. Other classes of intervention were effective for fewer than three of our primary outcomes. With 5-HT antagonists, we found a reduction in intraoperative nausea (average risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.88, eight studies, 720 women). There were also reductions in postoperative nausea (average RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.64, four studies, 405 women) and vomiting (average RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.77, five studies, 565 women). We did not detect a significant reduction in intraoperative vomiting (average RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.00, seven studies, 668 women). Dopamine antagonists demonstrated a reduction in intraoperative nausea (average RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.57, nine studies, 636 women) and intraoperative vomiting (average 0.39, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.64, eight studies, 536 women), with similar reductions in postoperative nausea (average RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.91, five studies, 412 women) and vomiting (average RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.91, six studies, 472 women). These differences were observed with both metoclopramide and droperidol. Sedatives (most commonly propofol) demonstrated a reduction in intraoperative nausea (average RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96, four studies, 285 women) and intraoperative vomiting (average RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.68, four studies, 285 women), also with a reduction in postoperative nausea (average RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.71, two studies 145 women) and vomiting (average RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.28, two studies, 145 women). Acupressure was found to be effective for intraoperative nausea (average RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.90, six studies, 649 women) but not postoperative nausea (average RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.00, three studies, 429 women). Acupressure was not effective at reducing vomiting either intraoperatively (average RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.18, six studies, 649 women) or postoperatively (average RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.06, three studies, 429 women). Other effective intervention classes included corticosteroids, antihistamines, and anticholinergics. There were insufficient data to demonstrate any class of intervention was superior to another. There were no significant differences observed in the comparison of combined versus single interventions. Few studies assessed our secondary outcomes or the incidence of adverse effects. However, one study showed an increase in respiratory depression with sedation (midazolam) compared with dopamine antagonists.

Authors' Conclusions

This review indicates that many different interventions have efficacy in preventing nausea and vomiting in women undergoing regional anaesthesia for caesarean section. There is little evidence that combinations of treatment are better than single agents.

### Prevalence and associated factors of intraoperative nausea and vomiting of mothers who gave birth with cesarean section under regional anesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis; 2023 [^114Rw8cU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

The condition known as intraoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV) disturbs the patient and can make surgery more difficult. The anesthesia technique and the preventive and therapeutic measures taken by the anesthetist determine the incidence of IONV during CS under regional anesthesia.

When nausea and vomiting start during surgery and continue throughout the recovery phase, it reduces patient comfort, delays hospital leave, and adds expenses. When considering certain potential outcomes, including dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, wound dehiscence, venous hypertension and bleeding, esophageal rupture, airway obstruction, and aspiration pneumonia, this issue merits more investigation. All these complication have their clinical impact on the parturients. Dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities can frequently impair cellular function, resulting in muscular weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and altered mental status and even organ failure. Wound dehiscence induces risk of infection, slows recovery and may demand additional surgery. Venous hypertension can cause edema, skin ulceration, and an increased risk of bleeding, particularly in locations with limited venous return. Forceful vomiting can cause esophageal rupture, which is a life-threatening illness that predisposes for rapid surgical intervention. Airway obstruction can be caused by edema, foreign bodies, or decreased consciousness, can quickly lead to hypoxia and cardiac arrest, making prompt detection and management. Finally, aspiration pneumonia is a dangerous infection that can lengthen hospital stays, decrease lung function, and even be fatal.

### Assessment of management approaches for hyperemesis gravidarum and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a retrospective questionnaire analysis [^117CNC7p]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Despite the grave ramifications of this condition, many healthcare providers do not meet the needs of their HG patients. This is evident not only from the sheer number of medications that patients are trialing as shown in our data, but also from several studies regarding lessened quality of life and even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Furthermore, we discovered that more than half of the patients who are prescribed medication for their symptoms are experiencing a plethora of side effects. It is vital to reverse this trend; health care providers need to be aware of the high burden NVP/HG and its current treatment places on these patients.

Support and high-quality care are essential for this vulnerable population. However, the lack of a unified standard of care for NVP/HG patients prevents the condition from being widely recognized and downplays the need for effective interventions, which is considered one of the highest priorities of experts in this field regarding this condition. Without fully understanding the etiology of this multifactorial condition, the obstetrics community is at a loss for solutions to the root-cause of this problem. By emphasizing the lack of efficacious, well-tolerated treatment, we hope that this research will inspire the obstetrics community to better understand NVP/HG, including treatments and outcomes. Though pregnant people are a controversial study population, high-quality research is necessary to bridge this gap. Effective therapeutics for NVP/HG will give patients a better outlook on pregnancy, an improved relationship with their healthcare providers, and a higher quality of life during and after pregnancy.

### Interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^114bSzSe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting are the most common symptoms experienced in early pregnancy, with nausea affecting between 70 and 85% of women. About half of pregnant women experience vomiting.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different methods of treating nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (December 2002) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2002).

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of any treatment for nausea and/or vomiting in early pregnancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers assessed the trial quality and extracted the data independently.

Main Results

Twenty-eight trials met the inclusion criteria. For milder degrees of nausea and vomiting, 21 trials were included. These trials were of variable quality. Nausea treatments were: different antihistamine medications, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), the combination tablet Debendox (Bendectin), P6 acupressure and ginger. For hyperemesis gravidarum, seven trials were identified testing treatments with oral ginger root extract, oral or injected corticosteroids or injected adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), intravenous diazepam and acupuncture. Based on 12 trials, there was an overall reduction in nausea from anti-emetic medication (odds ratio 0.16, 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.33).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Anti-emetic medication appears to reduce the frequency of nausea in early pregnancy. There is some evidence of adverse effects, but there is very little information on effects on fetal outcomes from randomised controlled trials. Of newer treatments, pyridoxine (vitamin B6) appears to be more effective in reducing the severity of nausea. The results from trials of P6 acupressure are equivocal. No trials of treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum show any evidence of benefit. Evidence from observational studies suggests no evidence of teratogenicity from any of these treatments.

### Interventions for preventing nausea and vomiting in women undergoing regional anaesthesia for caesarean section [^111UuQq9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting are distressing symptoms which are experienced commonly during caesarean section under regional anaesthesia and in the postoperative period. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions versus placebo or no intervention given prophylactically to prevent nausea and vomiting in women undergoing regional anaesthesia for caesarean section.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (16 April 2020), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of studies and conference abstracts, and excluded quasi-RCTs and cross-over studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and carried out data extraction. Our primary outcomes are intraoperative and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Data entry was checked. Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Eighty-four studies (involving 10,990 women) met our inclusion criteria. Sixty-nine studies, involving 8928 women, contributed data. Most studies involved women undergoing elective caesarean section. Many studies were small with unclear risk of bias and sometimes few events. The overall certainty of the evidence assessed using GRADE was moderate to very low. 5-HT 3 antagonists: We found intraoperative nausea may be reduced by 5-HT 3 antagonists (average risk ratio (aRR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 0.71, 12 studies, 1419 women, low-certainty evidence). There may be a reduction in intraoperative vomiting but the evidence is very uncertain (aRR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.73, 11 studies, 1414 women, very low-certainty evidence). There is probably a reduction in postoperative nausea (aRR 0.40, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.54, 10 studies, 1340 women, moderate-certainty evidence), and these drugs may show a reduction in postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.69, 10 studies, 1450 women, low-certainty evidence). Dopamine antagonists: We found dopamine antagonists may reduce intraoperative nausea but the evidence is very uncertain (aRR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.52, 15 studies, 1180 women, very low-certainty evidence). Dopamine antagonists may reduce intraoperative vomiting (aRR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.60, 12 studies, 942 women, low-certainty evidence) and postoperative nausea (aRR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79, 7 studies, 601 women, low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if dopamine antagonists reduce postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.92, 9 studies, 860 women, very low-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids (steroids): We are uncertain if intraoperative nausea is reduced by corticosteroids (aRR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.83, 6 studies, 609 women, very low-certainty evidence) similarly for intraoperative vomiting (aRR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87, 6 studies, 609 women, very low-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids probably reduce postoperative nausea (aRR 0.59, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.73, 6 studies, 733 women, moderate-certainty evidence), and may reduce postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.95, 7 studies, 793 women, low-certainty evidence). Antihistamines: Antihistamines may have little to no effect on intraoperative nausea (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.11, 1 study, 149 women, very low-certainty evidence) or intraoperative vomiting (no events in the one study of 149 women). Antihistamines may reduce postoperative nausea (aRR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.64, 4 studies, 514 women, low-certainty evidence), however, we are uncertain whether antihistamines reduce postoperative vomiting (average RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.81, 3 studies, 333 women, very low-certainty evidence). Anticholinergics: Anticholinergics may reduce intraoperative nausea (aRR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.87, 4 studies, 453 women, low-certainty evidence) but may have little to no effect on intraoperative vomiting (aRR 0.79, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.54, 4 studies; 453 women, very low-certainty evidence). No studies looked at anticholinergics in postoperative nausea, but they may reduce postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.74, 1 study, 161 women, low-certainty evidence). Sedatives: We found that sedatives probably reduce intraoperative nausea (aRR 0.65, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.82, 8 studies, 593 women, moderate-certainty evidence) and intraoperative vomiting (aRR 0.35, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.52, 8 studies, 593 women, moderate-certainty evidence). However, we are uncertain whether sedatives reduce postoperative nausea (aRR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.71, 2 studies, 145 women, very low-certainty evidence) and they may reduce postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.28, 2 studies, 145 women, low-certainty evidence). Opioid antagonists: There were no studies assessing intraoperative nausea or vomiting. Opioid antagonists may result in little or no difference to the number of women having postoperative nausea (aRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.45, 1 study, 120 women, low-certainty evidence) or postoperative vomiting (aRR 1.25, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.43, 1 study, 120 women, low-certainty evidence). Acupressure: It is uncertain whether acupressure/acupuncture reduces intraoperative nausea (aRR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.74, 9 studies, 1221 women, very low-certainty evidence). Acupressure may reduce intraoperative vomiting (aRR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.80, 9 studies, 1221 women, low-certainty evidence) but it is uncertain whether it reduces postoperative nausea (aRR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.75, 7 studies, 1069 women, very low-certainty evidence) or postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.79, 7 studies, 1069 women, very low-certainty evidence). Ginger: It is uncertain whether ginger makes any difference to the number of women having intraoperative nausea (aRR 0.66, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.21, 2 studies, 331 women, very low-certainty evidence), intraoperative vomiting (aRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.00, 2 studies, 331 women, very low-certainty evidence), postoperative nausea (aRR 0.63, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.77, 1 study, 92 women, very low-certainty evidence) and postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.20, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.65, 1 study, 92 women, very low-certainty evidence). Few studies assessed our secondary outcomes including adverse effects or women's views.

Authors' Conclusions

This review indicates that 5-HT 3 antagonists, dopamine antagonists, corticosteroids, sedatives and acupressure probably or possibly have efficacy in reducing nausea and vomiting in women undergoing regional anaesthesia for caesarean section. However the certainty of evidence varied widely and was generally low. Future research is needed to assess side effects of treatment, women's views and to compare the efficacy of combinations of different medications.

### Pregnancy complications and birth outcomes among women experiencing nausea only or nausea and vomiting during pregnancy in the Norwegian mother and child cohort study [^1111C5pF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

To compare pregnancy complications and birth outcomes for women experiencing nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, or nausea only, with symptom-free women.

Methods

Pregnancies from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (n = 51 675), a population-based prospective cohort study, were examined. Data on nausea and/or vomiting during gestation and birth outcomes were collected from three questionnaires answered between gestation weeks 15 and 30, and linked with data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Chi-squared tests, one way analysis of variance, multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were used.

Results

Women with nausea and vomiting (NVP) totalled 17 070 (33%), while 20 371 (39%) experienced nausea only (NP), and 14 234 (28%) were symptom-free (SF). When compared to SF women, NVP and NP women had significantly increased odds for pelvic girdle pain (adjusted odds ratio, aOR, 2.26, 95% confidence interval, 95% CI, 2.09–2.43, and aOR 1.90, 95% CI, 1.76–2.05, respectively) and proteinuria (aOR 1.50, 95% CI 1.38–1.63, and 1.20, 95% CI 1.10–1.31, respectively). Women with NVP also had significantly increased odds for high blood pressure (aOR 1.40, 95% CI 1.17–1.67) and preeclampsia (aOR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01–1.27). Conversely, the NVP and NP groups had significantly reduced odds for unfavourable birth outcomes such as low birth weight infants (aOR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60–0.88, and aOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60–0.88, respectively) and small for gestational age infants (aOR 0.78, 95% CI 0.73–0.84, and aOR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81–0.93, respectively).

Conclusions

We found that women with NVP and NP are more likely to develop pregnancy complications, yet they display mostly favourable delivery and birth outcomes.

### Nausea, vomiting and poor appetite during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes in rural Nepal: an observational cohort study [^117D168v]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting are experienced by 35–91% of pregnant women worldwide. The consequences of nausea and vomiting for pregnant women correlate with the severity of symptoms and range from reduced quality of life and depressive symptoms to preeclampsia, malnutrition, weight loss and dehydration. Severe symptoms such as nausea accompanied with vomiting have been suggested to have greater negative impact on maternal wellbeing, pregnancy outcomes as well as birth outcomes. There is a risk that women are being undertreated for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy due to the high prevalence and self-limiting nature of the condition as well as insufficient safety data for pharmacological treatment. The etiology of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is assumed to be multifactorial and sometimes considered an evolutionary response that protects the woman from ingesting harmful foods, which may further contribute to its undertreatment. One theory suggests that hormone levels, including human chorionic gonadotropin and estrogen, are responsible due to their concurrence with the peak of nausea and vomiting symptoms. Additionally, factors associated with increased nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum include lower education level, symptoms in a previous pregnancy, primigravity, obesity, younger age, family history of hyperemesis gravidarum, psychosocial morbidity and carrying a female fetus.

Given the potential effects of nausea and vomiting on food intake and maternal well-being, intra-uterine growth restriction is a concern. Nausea and vomiting has been associated with lower-than-recommended weight gain in pregnancy, which in turn has been associated with small for gestational age infants (SGA) and prematurity. SGA is considered a measure of intrauterine growth restriction, as genetic differences in birth size are relatively small in healthy pregnancies. The strength of association of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy with SGA, LBW and preterm birth are inconsistent in the literature. Although inconclusive, it has been suggested that more severe symptoms of nausea and vomiting are more strongly associated with adverse birth outcomes.

Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is especially concerning in low and middle income countries where resources might be limited in terms of food availability and access to health care, and where women may be nutritionally deficient prior to the start of pregnancy. Most prior studies have been based in high-income countries and few studies have examined this association in low-income settings. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of nausea, vomiting and poor appetite during pregnancy on birth outcomes using data collected in the rural plains of southern Nepal.

### WITHDRAWN: active versus expectant management in the third stage of labour [^114ZBRkD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Expectant management of the third stage of labour involves allowing the placenta to deliver spontaneously or aiding by gravity or nipple stimulation. Active management involves administration of a prophylactic oxytocic before delivery of the placenta, and usually early cord clamping and cutting, and controlled cord traction of the umbilical cord.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of active versus expectant management on blood loss, post partum haemorrhage and other maternal and perinatal complications of the third stage of labour.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing active and expectant management of the third stage of labour in women who were expecting a vaginal delivery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality was assessed and data were extracted independently by the reviewers.

Main Results

Five studies were included. Four of the trials were of good quality. Compared to expectant management, active management (in the setting of a maternity hospital) was associated with the following reduced risks: maternal blood loss (weighted mean difference -79.33 millilitres, 95% confidence interval -94.29 to -64.37); post partum haemorrhage of more than 500 millilitres (relative risk 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.46); prolonged third stage of labour (weighted mean difference -9.77 minutes, 95% confidence interval -10.00 to -9.53). Active management was associated with an increased risk of maternal nausea (relative risk 1.83, 95% confidence interval 1.51 to 2.23), vomiting and raised blood pressure (probably due to the use of ergometrine). No advantages or disadvantages were apparent for the baby.

Authors' Conclusions

Routine 'active management' is superior to 'expectant management' in terms of blood loss, post partum haemorrhage and other serious complications of the third stage of labour. Active management is, however, associated with an increased risk of unpleasant side effects (eg nausea and vomiting), and hypertension, where ergometrine is used. Active management should be the routine management of choice for women expecting to deliver a baby by vaginal delivery in a maternity hospital. The implications are less clear for other settings including domiciliary practice (in developing and industrialised countries).

### Effects of supportive counseling using a positive psychology approach on coping patterns among pregnant women with nausea and vomiting [^1153TdSR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pregnancy nausea and vomiting (NVP) is a common complaint in the first half of pregnancy, affecting 50–90% of pregnant women to varying degrees. Nausea, vomiting, gagging, dizziness, increased sensitivity to odour, increased cravings for certain foods, changes in daily functioning, mood, and fatigue are among the symptoms. The cause of NVP is unknown and multifactorial in which biological, psychological, social, economic, and psychological factors can all be involved.

Lack of timely treatment of NVP results in severe maternal and fetal complications, such as low birth weight, preterm delivery, and reduces the quality of life in women. Additionally, hyperemesis gravidarum and low quality of life negatively affect coping with pregnancy and the role of motherhood. A poorer adaptation to pregnancy is associated with prenatal stress, depression, and anxiety. On the other hand, poor psychological adjustment was directly related to the severity of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy and the perceived stress level was inversely related to the perceived social support.

Results

Search strategy

In this systemic review and meta-analysis, searching for potential studies was done in three phases. During the initial searching phase from major databases around 30,807 studies were identified. In the second phase of the search process around 107 studies were identified. Also after screening of studies identified with the two phases, cross reference searching of the included full texts was done and around 13 studies were identified. After duplication removal, removal of ineligible articles, and screening with other reasons 4,376 articles were found. Sixty-three articles were left with title and abstract screening. Twenty-nine studies that met the inclusion criteria were left for appraisal with full text. During the critical appraisal of the full texts, around eight studies were excluded for different reasons, and then 21 articles were left to be included in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis of this systematic review and meta-analysis (Fig. 1).

Excluded studies

Studies done to compare effect of different medications on IONV without a placebo were excluded from this study. Because these studies were unable to reveal the overall prevalence of IONV. Also, studies with inappropriate data in terms of method and results were excluded (Table 1).

Table 1
Studies excluded from this systematic review and meta-analysis due to different reasons

Characteristics of included studies

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, a total of 21 studies with an overall sample size of 4684 participants were included. The sample size of the included studies ranged from 80 to 1028. Eight of the included studies were done in the African context. The prevalence of IONV ranged from 11.96% to 58%. The included studies were done with variable study objectives, methods, and exposures. There are studies done to assess the effects of different medications on the prevalence of IONV during CS. Around 13 studies were done with RCT methods. For instance, studies were done on the effects of metoclopramide, ginger extracts, midazolam, fentanyl, dexamethasone, ketamine, propofol. Since all of the included studies were assessed to have moderate and above quality based on the JBI and New Castel Ottawa assessment tool, we included them (Table 2).

### Treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum and nausea and vomiting in pregnancy: a systematic review [^1122WsJU]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Nausea and vomiting affects approximately 85% of pregnant women. The most severe form, hyperemesis gravidarum, affects up to 3% of women and can have significant adverse physical and psychological sequelae.

Objective

To summarize current evidence on effective treatments for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum.

Evidence Review

Databases were searched to June 8, 2016. Relevant websites and bibliographies were also searched. Titles and abstracts were assessed independently by 2 reviewers. Results were narratively synthesized; planned meta-analysis was not possible because of heterogeneity and incomplete reporting of findings.

Findings

Seventy-eight studies (n = 8930 participants) were included: 67 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 11 nonrandomized studies. Evidence from 35 RCTs at low risk of bias indicated that ginger, vitamin B6, antihistamines, metoclopramide (for mild symptoms), pyridoxine-doxylamine, and ondansetron (for moderate symptoms) were associated with improved symptoms compared with placebo. One RCT (n = 86) reported greater improvements in moderate symptoms following psychotherapy (change in Rhodes score [range, 0 {no symptoms} to 40 {worst possible symptoms}], 18.76 [SD, 5.48] to 7.06 [SD, 5.79] for intervention vs 19.18 [SD, 5.63] to 12.81 [SD, 6.88] for comparator [P < .001]). For moderate-severe symptoms, 1 RCT (n = 60) suggested that pyridoxine-doxylamine combination taken preemptively reduced risk of recurrence of moderate-severe symptoms compared with treatment once symptoms begin (15.4% vs 39.1% [P < .04]). One RCT (n = 83) found that ondansetron was associated with lower nausea scores on day 4 than metoclopramide (mean visual analog scale [VAS] score, 4.1 [SD, 2.9] for ondansetron vs 5.7 [SD, 2.3] for metoclopramide [P = 0.023]) but not episodes of emesis (5.0 [SD, 3.1] vs 3.3 [SD, 3], respectively [P = 0.013]). Although there was no difference in trend in nausea scores over the 14-day study period, trend in vomiting scores was better in the ondansetron group (P = 0.042). One RCT (n = 159) found no difference between metoclopramide and promethazine after 24 hours (episodes of vomiting, 1 [IQR, 0–5] for metoclopramide vs 2 [IQR, 0–3] for promethazine [P = 0.81], VAS [0–10 scale] for nausea, 2 [IQR, 1–5] vs 2 [IQR, 1–4], respectively [P = 0.99]). Three RCTs compared corticosteroids with placebo or promethazine or metoclopramide in women with severe symptoms. Improvements were seen in all corticosteroid groups, but only a significant difference between corticosteroids vs metoclopramide was reported (emesis reduction, 40.9% vs 16.5% at day 2; 71.6% vs 51.2% at day 3; 95.8% vs 76.6% at day 7 [n = 40, P < .001]). For other interventions, evidence was limited.

Conclusions and Relevance

For mild symptoms of nausea and emesis of pregnancy, ginger, pyridoxine, antihistamines, and metoclopramide were associated with greater benefit than placebo. For moderate symptoms, pyridoxine-doxylamine, promethazine, and metoclopramide were associated with greater benefit than placebo. Ondansetron was associated with improvement for a range of symptom severity. Corticosteroids may be associated with benefit in severe cases. Overall the quality of evidence was low.

### WITHDRAWN: interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^1163uimD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting are the most common symptoms experienced in early pregnancy, with nausea affecting between 70 and 85% of women. About half of pregnant women experience vomiting.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different methods of treating nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (December 2002) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2002).

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of any treatment for nausea and/or vomiting in early pregnancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers assessed the trial quality and extracted the data independently.

Main Results

Twenty-eight trials met the inclusion criteria. For milder degrees of nausea and vomiting, 21 trials were included. These trials were of variable quality. Nausea treatments were: different antihistamine medications, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), the combination tablet Debendox (Bendectin), P6 acupressure and ginger. For hyperemesis gravidarum, seven trials were identified testing treatments with oral ginger root extract, oral or injected corticosteroids or injected adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), intravenous diazepam and acupuncture. Based on 12 trials, there was an overall reduction in nausea from anti-emetic medication (odds ratio 0.16, 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.33).

Authors' Conclusions

Anti-emetic medication appears to reduce the frequency of nausea in early pregnancy. There is some evidence of adverse effects, but there is very little information on effects on fetal outcomes from randomised controlled trials. Of newer treatments, pyridoxine (vitamin B6) appears to be more effective in reducing the severity of nausea. The results from trials of P6 acupressure are equivocal. No trials of treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum show any evidence of benefit. Evidence from observational studies suggests no evidence of teratogenicity from any of these treatments.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^111NogsU]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) introduction — clinical impact and prior guidance notes that PONV is a common adverse event after surgery and anesthesia, and it is distressing for patients, delays post-anesthesia recovery, and can sometimes lead to more serious complications. Optimal management of PONV requires a multidisciplinary approach, with evidence-based care and appropriate institutional infrastructure, and in the last consensus guideline, the expert panel recommended a general approach to multimodal PONV prophylaxis, and rescue treatment with antiemetics from a different pharmacological class. Since the last guideline, there has been a plethora of studies on various novel antiemetic combinations and a growing body of literature on genetic, socioeconomic, and diversity considerations, and the updated guidelines will address the emerging clinical evidence as well as novel considerations in PONV management.

Metoclopramide in cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia — if administered after cord clamping, metoclopramide provided faster onset of intraoperative antiemetic efficacy than dexamethasone, but other single agents (ondansetron, dexamethasone, glycopyrrolate) were reported as more effective; while metoclopramide may be an alternate choice when other dopamine antagonists are not available, it is not recommended for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis.

### Gastrointestinal diseases during pregnancy: what does the gastroenterologist need to know? [^1164cbRP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The approach to nausea and vomiting entails the exclusion of other causes, especially if these symptoms persist during the second and third trimesters. Most women do not require pharmacological treatment and can be managed with alternative options and dietary modifications. Diet recommendations include fractionized meals and avoidance of fatty foods and fresh vegetables that can delay gastric emptying. Daily consumption of 1.5 L of water or drinks containing glucose, salt and potassium are recommended. Both thiamine (vitamin B1) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) have proven their efficacy and are indicated as routine supplements in patients with protracted vomiting. A 2010 Cochrane review evaluated nine randomized trials involving ginger. Based on expert experience, ginger can be considered a non-pharmacologic option during pregnancy.

Concerning the pharmacological treatment, antiemetics can be an option for women with persistent nausea and vomiting. Histamine receptor blockers (anti-H1), such as promethazine, cyclizine, cinnarizine, doxylamine and dimenhydrinate, are considered first-line treatment, because no adverse fetal effects have been described. Doxylamine has the advantage of being safe when symptoms begin (6–7 weeks). In a cohort of 608,385 pregnancies, Pasternak et al evaluated ondansetron, an H3 receptor blocker, and concluded that it was not associated with a significant increase in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, major birth defects, preterm delivery or small born infants for gestational age. However, there are studies documenting congenital heart defects, especially when ondansetron was taken in the first trimester. Consequently, it is recommended as second-line therapy. Phenothiazines are another first-line treatment option, including prochlorperazine, chlorpromazine and perphenazine. Studies have not shown increased risk for major malformations. Finally, metoclopramide, a dopamine antagonist, can also be safely prescribed. However, it crosses the placenta and is considered a second-line treatment option, given its potential extrapyramidal effects on both the fetus (third trimester) and the mother (first trimester).

### The impact and management of hyperemesis gravidarum: current and future perspectives [^1177V1cr]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a severe form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy affecting around 1%-3% of pregnancies worldwide and is the most common reason for hospital admission in early pregnancy. HG can have lasting consequences for both pregnant individuals and their offspring. Current best-practice management includes symptomatic treatment with anti-emetic pharmacological treatment, rehydration if needed, and psychological support. There is a lack of high-quality evidence on treatment for HG. Future research should focus on understanding the cause, developing effective treatment, and so limiting the burden of disease on patients and healthcare systems.

### Features of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy as predictive factors of post-partum depression: a systematic review [^113AVnNn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and implications

Historically, NVP, including HG, actually understood as a somatic condition, was wrongly considered: women with NVP first had their symptoms blamed on them and were treated horrifically as a result, even as recently as 2002 in France. Then NVP was considered as a psychosomatic illness associated with a subconscious attempt to reject an unwanted pregnancy. Our systematic review shows the strong relationship between nausea and vomiting during pregnancy and PPD. Furthermore, HG has been demonstrated to increase rates of suicidal ideation.

Our systematic review highlights the importance of closely monitoring NVP symptoms in pregnant women, particularly their severity and duration. The use of simple, non-intrusive questions could be an effective approach for such monitoring. However, it is essential for researchers to agree on a single standardized international tool, such as the PUQE-24, to ensure assessment consistency. Severe NVP symptoms, including those associated with HG or persisting after the first trimester of pregnancy, may suggest an increased risk of PPD. These symptoms should prompt healthcare professionals to consider screening for PPD both during pregnancy and for at least 6 months after delivery.

Early NVP detection and management could contribute to the timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment of PPD, potentially improving outcomes for both mothers and their children.

While our review demonstrates an association between NVP/HG and PPD, further research is needed to determine whether early detection and management of NVP can contribute to improved diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes for PPD. Prospective studies and intervention trials are warranted to clarify whether such strategies can positively impact maternal and child health. Furthermore, in line with Tambelli et al. 2022, it would be interesting in future studies to address separately each dimension involved in NVP and HG. The different dimensions are nausea, vomiting (according to their severity and duration), daily sleep impairments and fear of childbirth. Using this dimensional approach, one or more dimensions could be studied as a possible predictive factors of PPD.

Finally, we argue the need to consider that NVP and PPD symptoms are both underlined by the intertwining between psychological, somatic, as well as sociocultural and economic factors. Women with NVP (1) have psychological responses that become intertwined with, and possibly exacerbate, their physical symptoms and (2) their physical symptoms associated with sleep disturbances could foster depressive symptoms.

Eligibility criteria

Inclusion criteria

Studies conducted on and reporting the prevalence and/or associated factors of intraoperative nausea and vomiting for mothers who gave birth with cesarean section under regional anesthesia were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Furthermore, the following criteria were considered as an inclusion criterion.

Study design

All types of studies (cross-sectional, case controls, and cohort, RCTs, etc.).

Language

The articles were published only in the English language.

Population

Parturient who gave birth with cesarean section under regional anesthesia.

Publication condition

Both published and unpublished articles from different universities' repositories.

Publication year

All publications reported up to December 12, 2023, within the last 10 years.

Exposure

Cesarean section, operation, spinal anesthesia, and also there were studies done on different premedication and prophylaxis exposure.

Outcome

Prevalence and associated factors or determinants of Intraoperative nausea and vomiting,

Exclusion criteria

Studies lacking appropriate data were excluded. There were studies done to compare the effects of different medications on the prevalence of IONV without a placebo. These studies were excluded from prevalence and factor analysis. Also, studies that haven't full text and failure to reply from the corresponding authors to get the full text were excluded from this meta-analysis.

Study identification and selection

After reading the title and abstracts, all studies with full text were exported to the Endnote X7 reference manager software. All five authors (BCD, NZ, NG, GM, and DTL) assessed and screened the full text of the studies based on aims, methodology, participants, and their findings. The quality of the studies was assessed by all authors independently and any disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus. For issues not resolved with discussion majority vote was done to make a decision.

Outcome measurement

The primary outcome of interest for this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the prevalence of intraoperative nausea and vomiting during cesarean section under regional anesthesia. The events from all studies were taken if they report with prevalence of IONV. For comparative studies, we took the counts of participants who had IONV from all the groups and divided them by the total sample size to get the overall prevalence of IONV. The pooled prevalence of IONV was summarized and reported by using effect size in terms of prevalence with a 95​% confidence interval. The secondary outcome of the study was the factors that had significant association with the primary outcome were analyzed and reported with odds ratio and 95% confidence interval.

### Features of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy as predictive factors of post-partum depression: a systematic review [^112rnM3k]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) represent a common disorder, reported by 50–90% of pregnant women with a severe form named Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG), which is the leading cause of hospitalization during the first trimester. NVP now recognized as a genetic and biological condition, has frequently been misdiagnosed as a mental health disorder. Affected women were often accused of feigning their symptoms, and management approaches that are now deemed unacceptable — such as isolation — were historically employed in the care of women with NVP. It is assumed that serious physical illnesses significantly affect patients' quality of life and cause psychological distress. Indeed, NVP exerts a significant psychological burden and negatively impact quality of life and emotional well-being during and after pregnancy. They are associated with psychiatric conditions including anxiety and depression. Given the comorbidity between several psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), it is essential to distinguish between them in order to ensure targeted and effective clinical management.

Furthermore, PPD is the most common post-partum complication and affects 10 to 20% of new mothers. PPD is strongly associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation and attempts, and suicide remains a leading cause of death during the perinatal period. PPD can have long-term negative effects on the child, the mother and the family environment. Early identification and timely intervention are essential; therefore, recognizing predictive symptoms of postpartum depression is crucial to enable preventive, individualized follow-up and to avert devastating impacts on families and society.

In the literature, although NVP and HG have validated definitions (see Table 1), their descriptions vary among studies. Furthermore, the relationship between nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and PPD is controversial. Some studies have reported this association, but others have not. This could be explained by several reasons: the studies included data gathered with different methodologies and mainly focused on HG and not NVP. PPD was assessed using different tools and at different times after delivery. In addition, the authors often investigated the causal relationship between NVP/HG and psychiatric symptoms.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^112jrPfs]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Evidence base for PONV rescue therapy notes inadequate published evidence on PONV rescue treatment, with the lack of evidence presenting a challenge in developing evidence-based guidelines or recommendations on the optimal agent, dose, route, tolerability, and safety profile. Because of the lack of RCTs, higher-grade evidence, and current studies with today's practices and medications, it may be tempting to assume that drugs which are effective for PONV prophylaxis would also be effective for rescue treatment, although this may not be the best approach but it is the option used by frontline anesthesia professionals without more research. A recent SR focused on PONV rescue treatments after failed prophylaxis or no prophylaxis, and Forty-five RCTs were included.

- ASA physical status

- menstrual cycle

- level of anesthesia provider's experience

- perioperative fasting

- BMI

- anxiety

### Effects of opioids administered via intravenous or epidural patient-controlled analgesia after caesarean section: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116MG3y4]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main finding of the present study is that opioids delivered via PCEA generally provide better pain relief than IVPCA. In addition, PCEA treatments yield lower odds of developing nausea, vomiting, sedation or drowsiness than IVPCA treatments. However, PCEA treatments, especially PCEA fentanyl and PCEA sufentanil, are prone to causing pruritus. The same agents, such as fentanyl, sufentanil, meperidine, tramadol and hydromorphone, resulted in significantly better pain relief when delivered via PCEA than when delivered via IVPCA. Fentanyl delivered via PCEA had significantly lower odds of nausea or vomiting than when delivered via IVPCA. In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference in nausea or vomiting when sufentanil, meperidine, tramadol and hydromorphone were delivered via IVPCA or PCEA. Fentanyl and meperidine delivered via PCEA resulted in significantly lower odds of sedation or drowsiness than when delivered via IVPCA. Fentanyl delivered via PCEA had significantly higher odds of pruritus than when delivered via IVPCA. In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference in pruritus whether meperidine was delivered via IVPCA or PCEA. The sensitivity analyses showed that the better analgesic efficacy of PCEA treatments was not significantly driven by the addition of local anaesthetics.

### Practice guidelines for obstetric anesthesia: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on obstetric anesthesia and the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology [^112gEnam]. Anesthesiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Cesarean delivery — neuraxial opioids for postoperative analgesia: Randomized controlled trials comparing epidural opioids with intermittent injections of IV or intramuscular opioids report improved postoperative analgesia for epidural opioids after cesarean delivery (Category A2-B evidence), and a meta-analysis reports equivocal findings for nausea, vomiting, and pruritus (Category A1-E evidence). RCTs also report improved postoperative analgesia when patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) is compared with IV patient-controlled analgesia (Category A2-B evidence), with equivocal findings for nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and sedation (Category A2-E evidence). The consultants and ASA members strongly agree that selecting neuraxial opioids rather than intermittent injections of parenteral opioids should be considered for postoperative analgesia after neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery.

### Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^116X3M7v]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common experiences in pregnancy, affecting 70% to 80% of all pregnant women. Various metabolic and neuromuscular factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), an entity distinct from NVP. However, their exact cause is unknown. Consequently, treatment of NVP and HG can be difficult, as neither the optimal targets for treatment nor the full effects of potential treatments on the developing fetus are known. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis, outcomes, and treatment of NVP and HG.

### Effect of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy on mother-to-infant bonding and the mediation effect of postpartum depression: the Japan environment and children's study [^114LJF8a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Measurements

Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP)

We collected information on NVP from self-reported questionnaires administered during mid/late pregnancy. Mothers were asked, "Did you have morning sickness during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy?" (1 = never, 2 = nausea but no vomiting, 3 = vomiting but being able to eat, 4 = vomiting and being unable to eat). We classified participants as No NVP, Mild NVP, Moderate NVP, and Severe NVP, respectively.

Mother-to-infant bonding (MIB)

MIB was assessed at one year after delivery using the Japanese version of the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale (MIBS-J). The MIBS-J consists of ten items with total scores ranging from 0 to 30. Each item is scored on a four-point scale from 0 to 3. Higher scores indicated worse MIB. We considered MIBS-J scores of five or more as likely to have MIB disorder. This cut-off (4/5) is used in the Japanese version of MIBS. The Cronbach's alpha of MIBS-J is 0.72 in our study.

Postpartum depression

Postpartum depression was assessed at one month after delivery using the Japanese version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The EPDS consists of ten items with total scores ranging from 0 to 30, each rated on a four-point scale from 0 to 3. A higher score implies more severe depressive symptoms. The EPDS Japanese version's Cronbach's alpha was 0.78, indicating potent internal consistency.

### Metoclopramide for nausea and vomiting prophylaxis during and after caesarean delivery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114YuJTu]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting occur commonly during and after Caesarean delivery (CD) performed under neuraxial anaesthesia. Metoclopramide is a prokinetic agent reported to be safe in parturients. This meta-analysis assesses the efficacy of metoclopramide for prophylaxis against intra- and postoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV and PONV) in parturients undergoing CD under neuraxial anaesthesia. We performed a literature search of MEDLINE (1966–2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE (1947–2011), Google scholar, and CINAHL for randomized controlled trials which compared metoclopramide with placebo in women having CD under neuraxial anaesthesia. Eleven studies with 702 patients were included in the analysis. Administration of metoclopramide (10 mg) resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of ION and IOV when given before block placement [relative risk (RR) (95% confidence interval, 95% CI) = 0.27 (0.16, 0.45) and 0.14 (0.03, 0.56), respectively] or after delivery [RR (95% CI) = 0.38 (0.20, 0.75) and 0.34 (0.18, 0.66), respectively]. The incidence of early (0–3 or 0–4 h) PON and POV [RR (95% CI) = 0.47 (0.26, 0.87) and 0.45 (0.21, 0.93), respectively] and overall (0–24 or 3–24 h) PON (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.52, 0.92) were also reduced with metoclopramide. Extra-pyramidal side-effects were not reported in any patient. In conclusion, this review suggests that metoclopramide is effective and safe for IONV and PONV prophylaxis in this patient population. Given the quality of the studies and the infrequent use of neuraxial opioids, these results should be interpreted with caution in current practice and further studies are needed to confirm those findings.

### Management of hyperemesis gravidarum [^111BQdoL]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy are common complaints and vary considerably in duration and severity. Hyperemesis gravidarum represents the extreme end of the spectrum associated with dehydration and weight loss. As embryonic organogenesis occurs during the first trimester, pharmacological intervention for any condition during this period poses a significant clinical dilemma requiring careful assessment of risks and benefits. In the UK, there are no formal national guidelines for the management of hyperemesis gravidarum. In addition, no high-quality evidence exists for i.v. fluid and electrolyte replacement in hyperemesis gravidarum, and a Cochrane review on interventions for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy specifically excluded studies on hyperemesis gravidarum. In this article, we review the evidence for the efficacy and safety of different management options for hyperemesis gravidarum.

### Interventions for treating hyperemesis gravidarum [^1158rPHw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy affecting 0.3% to 1.0% of pregnancies, and is one of the most common indications for hospitalization during pregnancy. While a previous Cochrane review examined interventions for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, there has not yet been a review examining the interventions for the more severe condition of hyperemesis gravidarum.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety, of all interventions for hyperemesis gravidarum in pregnancy up to 20 weeks' gestation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field's Trials Register (20 December 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of any intervention for hyperemesis gravidarum. Quasi-randomized trials and trials using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion. We excluded trials on nausea and vomiting of pregnancy that were not specifically studying the more severe condition of hyperemesis gravidarum.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed the eligibility of trials, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

Twenty-five trials (involving 2052 women) met the inclusion criteria but the majority of 18 different comparisons described in the review include data from single studies with small numbers of participants. The comparisons covered a range of interventions including acupressure/acupuncture, outpatient care, intravenous fluids, and various pharmaceutical interventions. The methodological quality of included studies was mixed. For selected important comparisons and outcomes, we graded the quality of the evidence and created 'Summary of findings' tables. For most outcomes the evidence was graded as low or very low quality mainly due to the imprecision of effect estimates. Comparisons included in the 'Summary of findings' tables are described below, the remaining comparisons are described in detail in the main text. No primary outcome data were available when acupuncture was compared with placebo, There was no clear evidence of differences between groups for anxiodepressive symptoms (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.40; one study, 36 women, very low-quality evidence), spontaneous abortion (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.03; one study, 57 women, low-quality evidence), preterm birth (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.26; one study, 36 women, low-quality evidence), or perinatal death (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.04 to 8.30; one study, 36 women, low-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to identify clear differences between acupuncture and metoclopramide in a study with 81 participants regarding reduction/cessation in nausea or vomiting (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.49 and RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.48, respectively; very low-quality evidence). In a study with 92 participants, women taking vitamin B6 had a slightly longer hospital stay compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) 0.80 days, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.52, moderate-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate a difference in other outcomes including mean number of episodes of emesis (MD 0.50, 95% CI -0.40 to 1.40, low-quality evidence) or side effects. A comparison between metoclopramide and ondansetron identified no clear difference in the severity of nausea or vomiting (MD 1.70, 95% CI -0.15 to 3.55, and MD -0.10, 95% CI -1.63 to 1.43; one study, 83 women, respectively, very low-quality evidence). However, more women taking metoclopramide complained of drowsiness and dry mouth (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.23 to 4.69, and RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.10 to 5.11, respectively; moderate-quality evidence). There were no clear differences between groups for other side effects. In a single study with 146 participants comparing metoclopramide with promethazine, more women taking promethazine reported drowsiness, dizziness, and dystonia (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.87, RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.69, and RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.90, respectively, moderate-quality evidence). There were no clear differences between groups for other important outcomes including quality of life and other side effects. In a single trial with 30 women, those receiving ondansetron had no difference in duration of hospital admission compared to those receiving promethazine (MD 0.00, 95% CI -1.39 to 1.39, very low-quality evidence), although there was increased sedation with promethazine (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.94, low-quality evidence). Regarding corticosteroids, in a study with 110 participants there was no difference in days of hospital admission compared to placebo (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.70 to 0.10; very low-quality evidence), but there was a decreased readmission rate (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.94; four studies, 269 women). For other important outcomes including pregnancy complications, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and congenital abnormalities, there was insufficient evidence to identify differences between groups (very low-quality evidence for all outcomes). In other single studies there were no clear differences between groups for preterm birth or side effects (very low-quality evidence). For hydrocortisone compared with metoclopramide, no data were available for primary outcomes and there was no difference in the readmission rate (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.28; one study, 40 women). In a study with 80 women, compared to promethazine, those receiving prednisolone had increased nausea at 48 hours (RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.72; low-quality evidence), but not at 17 days (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.15, very low-quality evidence). There was no clear difference in the number of episodes of emesis or subjective improvement in nausea/vomiting. There was insufficient evidence to identify differences between groups for stillbirth and neonatal death and preterm birth.

Authors' Conclusions

On the basis of this review, there is little high-quality and consistent evidence supporting any one intervention, which should be taken into account when making management decisions. There was also very limited reporting on the economic impact of hyperemesis gravidarum and the impact that interventions may have. The limitations in interpreting the results of the included studies highlights the importance of consistency in the definition of hyperemesis gravidarum, the use of validated outcome measures, and the need for larger placebo-controlled trials.

### A scoping review of models of care and services for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum [^113313LC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG) is a severe form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP), and the most common cause of hospitalisation during the first and second trimesters. Evidence suggests that while 70% of pregnant women experience nausea and vomiting, the prevalence of HG is estimated to be much lower (between 0.3%−3.6% globally). Characterised by early onset of symptoms, severe vomiting and/or nausea, and an inability to eat and/or drink normally or participate in daily living activities, HG has significant effects on the physical and mental health of pregnant women. Unmanaged cases of HG can be life threatening, with severe complications including Wernicke's encephalopathy, electrolyte imbalances and vitamin K deficiency.

Whilst recent advances have been made in better understanding the cause of HG and in developing curative treatments, such treatments are not yet available. Current management options for women with severe NVP and HG include pharmaceutical interventions, intravenous rehydration, outpatient care and other supportive treatments such as acupuncture and acupressure.

To support the implementation of evidence into practice, several clinical practice guidelines are available to inform health care providers and health policy and practice stakeholders responsible for service delivery models and ongoing quality improvement. A recent systematic review and appraisal of these guidelines found that national guidelines published in Australia, the UK, the USA and Canada provided similar recommendations, with UK guidelines updated since publishing of the review.

Despite the availability of relatively harmonised guidelines to support practice, inefficiencies remain in service delivery models for women with NVP and HG. In some cases, there are no or few health and social care options available. In the USA, high and increasing rates of presentation to the emergency department for HG have been reported. This has resulted in increased emergency department costs, with one study citing a 65% increase in patient costs. Similarly in the UK, hospital admissions for HG are increasing. This has resulted in calls for further investigation into the role of improved primary care management.

### Is pregnancy a disease? A normative approach [^115vk7Qw]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

A person who is happy to be pregnant may welcome even unpleasant symptoms such as stretch marks and nausea. The pain of childbirth may be treated as a badge of honour. Perhaps then, the 'badness' component of pregnancy can simply be disregarded in such cases. If so, a wanted pregnancy is not a disease, whatever its impact on a person's health. However, for consistency, this might imply that in other cases where a person finds value in their experience, they can no longer claim to have a disease. There is a wealth of qualitative research showing that sufferers often ascribe value to their experience of conditions that are uncontroversially regarded as being diseases, such as cancer and heart disease. If we then conclude that for such people their condition is no longer bad for them, and thus that they do not have a disease, this implies a very rigid and binary understanding of the relationship between subjective value and disease. People either value P, in which case it is not a disease, or they do not value it, in which case it may be a disease.

In reality, people's subjective beliefs and values are not fixed in this binary way. Therefore, if values play a role in classifying disease, we should not expect this to yield a neat, reliable distinction between what constitutes a disease and what does not. A more plausible way of accommodating value is to acknowledge that the experience of valuing some aspect of P does not necessarily conflict with P's badness for the sufferer in terms of the objective harms and risks as outlined above. Accordingly, a wanted pregnancy may qualify as a disease on this interpretation.

Moreover, it is worth emphasising that pregnancy commonly causes far more risky and unpleasant symptoms than those we have listed above. The idea that pregnant women should regard pain, nausea and stretch marks with joy may be understandable. But pregnancy frequently involves far more serious risks. It is for this reason that the WHO, as noted above, emphasis that medical care makes the difference between life and death for birthing women. In a world in which misogyny and pronatalism continue to exercise powerful sway, it is not implausible that even serious risks and injuries may be viewed by pregnant and non-pregnant people alike as a mark of suitability for motherhood: a confirmation that the prospective mother is prepared to accept suffering as her lot.

### Evaluation of nausea and vomiting [^111GcL98]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of nausea and vomiting, making further evaluation unnecessary. Acute symptoms generally are the result of infectious, inflammatory, or iatrogenic causes. Most infections are self-limiting and require minimal intervention; iatrogenic causes can be resolved by removing the offending agent. Chronic symptoms are usually a pathologic response to any of a variety of conditions. Gastrointestinal etiologies include obstruction, functional disorders, and organic diseases. Central nervous system etiologies are primarily related to conditions that increase intracranial pressure, and typically cause other neurologic signs. Pregnancy is the most common endocrinologic cause of nausea and must be considered in any woman of childbearing age. Numerous metabolic abnormalities and psychiatric diagnoses also may cause nausea and vomiting. Evaluation should first focus on detecting any emergencies or complications that require hospitalization. Attention should then turn to identifying the underlying cause and providing specific therapies. When the cause cannot be determined, empiric therapy with an antiemetic is appropriate. Initial diagnostic testing should generally be limited to basic laboratory tests and plain radiography. Further testing, such as upper endoscopy or computed tomography of the abdomen, should be determined by clinical suspicion based on a complete history and physical examination.

### Prevalence and associated factors of intraoperative nausea and vomiting of mothers who gave birth with cesarean section under regional anesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis; 2023 [^117GphGH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Regional anesthesia is an effective, safe, and anesthetic choice for elective and emergency cesarean sections. Despite major advances in spinal, epidural, and combined spinal-epidural anesthesia techniques, intraoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV) are still present in a significant number of patients. These symptoms can be distressing and uncomfortable for patients, and they may have a negative impact on surgical procedures. It reduces patient comfort, delays hospital leave, and adds expenses. When considering certain potential outcomes, including dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, wound dehiscence, venous hypertension and bleeding, esophageal rupture, airway obstruction, and aspiration pneumonia, this issue merits more investigation.

The pooled prevalence of intraoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV) during CS under spinal anesthesia of this study was 36% (95% CI: 31–41%). This high prevalence greatly affects the patients for distress, interferes with surgical procedures, causes aspiration of vomitus, and will precipitate intraoperative bleeding. This result was in line with a prospective observational study conducted at two Cape Town Level hospitals on 258 pregnant patients who were undergoing cesarean sections.

### Prevalence and associated factors of intraoperative nausea and vomiting of mothers who gave birth with cesarean section under regional anesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis; 2023 [^1116acuL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Although IONV has not been thoroughly examined, nausea and vomiting during the postoperative phase of regional anesthesia have been extensively researched, and up to 80% of cesarean section cases develop PONV.

When the uterus is forced back into the abdominal region, vomiting is one of the most frequent side effects of spinal anesthesia, occurring in 66% of instances. This is treated with a range of drugs; the most popular medication is metoclopramide.

Preoperative and intraoperative use of drugs, including 5-HT3 antagonists (e.g. ondansetron), dopamine antagonists (e.g. metoclopramide, droperidol), and sedatives (midazolam & propofol), can reduce nausea and vomiting during and after surgery under regional anesthesia. Corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone), antihistamines (e.g. cyclizine), and anticholinergics (e.g. scopolamine), careful hypotension monitoring, obtaining a good anesthetic block, gentle surgical technique, and prudent use of uterotonic drugs were also effective interventions for nausea and vomiting. In addition, acupressure was useful in lowering nausea but not vomiting. But all these medications could have their own side effects and contraindications. So, it is better to weight the risk benefit comparisons of each interventions. For instance Metoclopramide, can cause extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as tardive dyskinesia, restlessness, and muscle spasms, particularly with prolonged use or high doses. Other side effects include drowsiness, fatigue, and diarrhea. It's contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma, mechanical bowel obstruction, and a history of EPS. In addition, Ondansetron can cause headache, constipation, and rarely, cardiac arrhythmias like QT prolongation. Its use should be cautious in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or those taking other QT-prolonging medications.

### Managing hyperemesis gravidarum: a multimodal challenge [^113cpDwm]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

About 50% - 90% of all pregnancies are accompanied by nausea and vomiting. According to a study of more than 360 pregnant women, only 2% experienced only nausea in the morning whereas, in 80%, complaints persisted throughout the day. The condition is usually self-limiting and peaks at around 9 weeks gestation. At 20 weeks symptoms typically cease. However, in up to 20% of cases, nausea and vomiting may continue until delivery.

This condition is known as nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) or emesis gravidarum and is of no pathological significance as long as the affected women do not feel unwell or restricted in their daily life. There are, however, different grades in the scope of NVP, which range from occasional morning-sickness to excessive vomiting that persists throughout the day. The most severe grade of NVP often leads to hyperemesis gravidarum (HG; see below), but it can be difficult to differentiate between the two conditions.

A prospective study of more than 9000 pregnant women showed that NVP occurred significantly more often in primigravidas and in women who were less educated, younger, non-smokers and overweight or obese. The incidence of NVP was also higher in women with a history of nausea and vomiting in a previous pregnancy.

In order to exclude differential diagnoses the following crucial parameters should be investigated: Onset of nausea and vomiting (nearly all of the cases begin before 9 weeks of gestation), attendant symptoms, underlying chronic disorders or, in rare cases, hereditary diseases (see Figures 1 and 2).

Figure 1
Differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting.

Figure 2
Differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting in respect to abdominal symptoms.

A small percentage of pregnant women experience a severe form of nausea and vomiting that is termed HG (synonym: excessive vomiting during pregnancy). This disorder has an estimated incidence of 0.5% - 2% of all live births. A standard definition of HG is the occurrence of more than three episodes of vomiting per day with ketonuria and more than 3 kg or 5% weight loss. However, the diagnosis is usually made clinically following the exclusion of other causes.

### The outpatient management and special considerations of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [^115X18nF]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

With 50–90% of pregnant women experiencing nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), the burden of illness can become quite significant if symptoms are under-treated and/or under-diagnosed, thus allowing for progression of the disease. The majority of these women will necessitate at least one visit with a provider to specifically address NVP, and up to 10% or greater will require pharmacotherapy after failure of conservative measures to adequately control symptoms. As a result, initiation of prompt and effective treatment in the outpatient setting is ideal. Once NVP is diagnosed and treatment is started, it is crucial to track symptoms in order to assess for a decrease in or resolution of symptoms as well as an escalation in symptoms requiring additional therapy. Of note, co-existing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Helicobacter pylori infection, and psychosocial factors may have a negative impact on the management of NVP. Ultimately, every woman has her own perception of disease severity and desire for treatment. It is critical that both the provider and patient be proactive in the diagnosis and management of NVP.

Heterogeneity and publication bias

To reduce the risk of bias, extensive searches were done. The authors' collaborative work was crucial in selecting articles based on clear objectives and eligibility criteria, determining study quality, and extracting and obtaining information to minimize bias. We investigate publication bias qualitatively by visually inspecting the funnel plot. Furthermore, Egger's and Begg's correlation tests were performed at a 5% significant level to determine the presence of significant publication bias. The heterogeneity of included studies was detected by using the I² statistic, which is a quantitative measure of lack of consistency across studies. If an I² statistic of studies is between 0 and 50%, it is considered as low heterogeneity, an I² statistic of 50–75% is considered to have moderate heterogeneity, and if the I² statistic is larger than 75%, a high degree of heterogeneity are considered in these trials. Usually, it is considered that there is no important heterogeneity if the value of I² across the studies is less than 50%. Meta-regression was done by taking sample size, study country, study design, and year of publication as a moderator. Subgroup analysis was also performed by sample size, study country, study design, and year of publication to decrease the random variations among the primary study's point estimates. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to ascertain the possible cause of heterogeneity. If significant heterogeneity was detected, a random-effects model with the DerSimonian-Laird method was used for analysis.

Significant heterogeneity among included studies in a meta-analysis influences the method to meta-regression, subgroup analysis, and sensitivity analysis. Meta-regression is used to determine whether specific factor can account for the observed heterogeneity and how these factors influence effect size. Subgroup analysis, on the other hand, requires categorizing studies based on a specific characteristic and determining whether the effect size differs significantly between these subgroups, implying that the grouping variable is a source of heterogeneity. Finally, sensitivity analysis is critical for assessing the strength of meta-analysis conclusions in the presence of heterogeneity. This can include removing studies with extreme effect sizes, a high risk of bias, or those that contribute the most to heterogeneity in order to determine whether the overall conclusions are consistent.

### Persistent postpartum pain – A somatic and psychologic perfect storm [^111xgeWi]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The female reproductive system is evolutionary designed for pregnancy and childbirth. Despite the physiological nature of reproduction, pregnancy induces a myriad of changes in the body that are considered pathological under many other circumstances. For example, the cardiovascular, respiratory, hormonal, gastrointestinal and homeostatic adaptations of pregnancy share similar features with conditions such as liver failure or sepsis (eg, increased cardiac output (CO), decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR), increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and interstitial fluid retention). Some of the previous conditions cause somatic and/or visceral pain. Nerve compression can be caused by retained fluid in tight spaces resulting for example in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Anatomical realignments in the vertebral and thoraco-abdominal regions induce back pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), constipation, pubic symphyseal separation, amongst other conditions. These changes contribute to the symptoms of physical discomfort that are common during pregnancy, such as fatigue, nausea, cramping, back pain, and in some instances, they add to a preexisting pain in the same region. Parturition then further superimposes severe acute pain on those changes. Finally, modern medicine has resulted in the development of several obstetrical interventions, including but not limited to induction of labor, neuraxial anesthesia, and cesarean delivery (CD). A survey of 1123 mothers examined their well-being 9–12 months following childbirth. More than sixty-nine percent of respondents reported a condition that negatively influenced their lives, and 37% reported moderate or major severity of pain in the form or backache, abdominal pain, vaginal pain, or dyspareunia.

Patients may develop persistent postpartum pain (PPP) because of the inherent pain inducing physiological and pathological adaptation to the state of pregnancy, or because of the inherent noxious changes of operative and pharmacological interventions during labor.

As the understanding of chronic pain following medical interventions is growing, the focus has shifted from the observation of pain intensity only to include the impact of pain on the quality of life and functionality. Chronic pain severity is now defined as a more complex entity with three components, including intensity, pain-related distress, and pain-related interference with activities of daily living. Following that approach, more attention has been given to the potential negative impact of pregnancy and childbirth on the woman's peripartum health and wellbeing. In addition to acute pain and its management, the significant incidence of chronic postpartum pain has been recognized in the last two or three decades.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189 summary: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^116Pm8Yn]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a common condition that affects the health of a pregnant woman and her fetus. It can diminish a woman's quality of life and also significantly contributes to health care costs and time lost from work (1, 2). Because morning sickness is common in early pregnancy, the presence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be minimized by obstetricians, other obstetric care providers, and pregnant women and, thus, undertreated (1). Furthermore, some women do not seek treatment because of concerns about the safety of medications (3). Once nausea and vomiting of pregnancy progresses, it can become more difficult to control symptoms. Treatment in the early stages may prevent more serious complications, including hospitalization (4). Safe and effective treatments are available for more severe cases, and mild cases of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be resolved with lifestyle and dietary changes. The woman's perception of the severity of her symptoms plays a critical role in the decision of whether, when, and how to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy should be distinguished from nausea and vomiting related to other causes. The purpose of this document is to review the best available evidence about the diagnosis and management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

Regarding medical management for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, more specifically with respect to antiemetics, RCOG 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that ondansetron is safe during pregnancy. Do not discourage ondansetron use if first-line antiemetics are ineffective. Reassure patients regarding a very small increase in the absolute risk of orofacial clefting with ondansetron use in the first trimester while balancing with the risks of poorly managed HG.

### Vomiting in pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of low birth weight: a cohort study [^113Cjmh6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Low birth weight (LBW) leads to a higher risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity, including impaired growth and cognitive development. More long-term complications include higher risks for high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes, early age at menarche and menopause, and reduced bone mineral density and osteoporosis. LBW can relate to one or both of premature birth and fetal growth restriction, or being constitutionally small, and risk of LBW can be related to such factors as ethnic differences, multiple birth pregnancies, maternal age at birth, fetal environmental factors such as exposure to alcohol, smoking or illicit drugs, maternal nutrition during pregnancy, poor socioeconomic status and genetic defects. Another risk factor appears to be hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy that can lead to maternal dehydration and weight loss. Treatment of severe nausea and vomiting in pregnancy with anti-emetics may even be associated with a reduction in the prevalence of LBW, although such findings are by no means universal.

Whilst the association between hyperemesis gravidarum and higher risk of LBW is reasonably well established, what is not so clear is whether potentially less severe nausea and/or vomiting in pregnancy is also associated with the risk of delivering LBW babies. The only recent related evidence suggests that it may be associated with being small for gestational age (SGA) due to fetal growth restriction, one of the main reasons for a baby having a LBW. This study was therefore designed to test the hypothesis that nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, of insufficient severity to require treatment, is associated with the risk of delivering a LBW baby. To do this we used data collected for the Cambridge Baby Growth Study.

### What are the costs associated with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum? A systematic review [^117RhQSt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Support for affected women

This review highlights the costs associated with absenteeism, however, it is likely the current body of research provides a conservative estimate of the true economic burden, including presenteeism. The research did not adequately account for other relevant costs that are incurred by women, families and employers. Commonly neglected cost inputs included the omission of expenses related to medical and other pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies, such as allied health and complementary therapies utilised by affected women to alleviate symptoms. Other financial costs commonly excluded were those associated with additional paid services like childcare, absenteeism for partners and family members, and those related to the well documented negative psychological effects of debilitating NVP and HG. The detrimental effects on maternal wellbeing of women with NVP and HG can be severe, increasing risk of developing anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and sometimes leading to termination of wanted pregnancies, all further contributing to the true economic burden associated with NVP and HG.

Evidence-based policy recommendations should address the economic burden on women, including lost income due to absenteeism and reduced capacity for work, as well as the substantial out of pocket costs faced by women and families. Providing support mechanisms, such as paid sick leave or flexible work arrangements, as well as timely management, could help to mitigate these costs.

### Long-term neurodevelopment of children exposed to maternal nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and diclectin [^1145M7Dk]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effects of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) and its treatment with diclectin on child neurodevelopment.

Study Design

An observational cohort study of mother-child pairs ascertained via a pregnancy call-in center was conducted. Three groups of children were studied: 45 with NVP and diclectin, 47 with NVP no diclectin, and 29 with no NVP. Phone calls to mothers during pregnancy and 6 to 9 months after childbirth yielded information on pregnancy, birth, and early child development. Children aged 3 to 7 years received a comprehensive set of psychological tests. Mothers were assessed for IQ and socioeconomic status.

Results

All children scored in the normal range for IQ, with the NVP-exposed group scoring higher than the non-exposed group on Performance IQ (P < .02), NEPSY Verbal Fluency (P < .003) and Phonological Processing (P < .004), and McCarthy Numerical Memory (P < .004). Predictors of enhanced results were NVP severity and maternal IQ.

Conclusions

NVP has an enhancing effect on later child outcome. Diclectin does not appear to adversely affect fetal brain development and can be used to control NVP when clinically indicated.

### Resident obstetricians' awareness of the oral health component in management of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [^1169TF9p]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting are common in early pregnancy (4 th to 7 th week after last menstrual cycle) in 50–90% of pregnant women and resolves in all but 10% of these women. Many obstetricians encounter this problem and should be familiar with the probable outcomes and current treatment options. Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy are usually self- limiting conditions. Women with uncomplicated nausea and vomiting of pregnancy have been noted to have improved pregnancy outcomes compared to women with complicated nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

Improving the oral health of pregnant women prevents complications of dental diseases during pregnancy. Maternal oral diseases have been associated with pre-term births, development of pre-eclampsia and delivery of a "small-for-gestational-age" infant. This could lead to infant mortality and morbidity. Nausea and vomiting may cause a woman to avoid routine oral health practices such as tooth brushing and flossing. This could lead to dental caries, gingivitis which is reported to be the most common oral disease during pregnancy with a prevalence rate of 60–75% and periodontitis, a bacterial infection which is detectable in up to 30% of pregnant women which has been linked with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as pre-term delivery and low birth weight outcome among infants. Food cravings induced by pregnancy may lead to frequent consumption of foods high in carbohydrates and therefore increase the risk of dental caries. Tooth erosion can result from nausea and vomiting of pregnancy because of the hydrochloric acid content of regurgitated gastric juice. In addition, the buffering capacity of saliva could change during pregnancy thus creating a more acidic environment. This coupled with frequent vomiting increases the tendency for tooth erosion. The effects of tooth erosion such as marked tooth sensitivity may last beyond the duration of the pregnancy.

### Interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^1113NVSo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting are the most common symptoms experienced in early pregnancy, with nausea affecting between 70 and 85% of women. About half of pregnant women experience vomiting.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of different methods of treating nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Date of last search: October 2001.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of any treatment for nausea and/or vomiting in early pregnancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality was assessed and data were extracted independently by two reviewers.

Main Results

Twenty-three trials were included. These trials were of variable quality. Nausea treatments were different anti-histamine medications, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), the combination tablet Debendox (Bendectin) and P6 acupressure. For hyperemesis gravidarum five trials were identified testing treatments with oral ginger root extract, oral corticosteroids or injected adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and intravenous diazepam. Based on 13 trials, there was an overall reduction in nausea from anti-emetic medication (odds ratio 0.17, 95% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.21).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Anti-emetic medication appears to reduce the frequency of nausea in early pregnancy. There is some evidence of adverse effects, but there is very little information on effects on fetal outcomes from randomised controlled trials. Of newer treatments, pyridoxine (vitamin B6) appears to be more effective in reducing the severity of nausea. The results from trials of P6 acupressure are equivocal. No trials of treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum show any evidence of benefit. Evidence from observational studies suggests no evidence of teratogenicity from any of these treatments.

### Pregnancy complications and birth outcomes among women experiencing nausea only or nausea and vomiting during pregnancy in the Norwegian mother and child cohort study [^115rMdmg]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We found that women with NVP and NP collectively had higher odds for pelvic girdle pain, severe pelvic girdle pain, high blood pressure before and during pregnancy, proteinuria, and preeclampsia than the SF group. The NP group had reduced odds of gestational diabetes with no prior history. The NVP and NP groups collectively had a higher proportion of term births, and lower odds for an emergency caesarean delivery, birth type other than normal cephalic, preterm birth, low Apgar score after 5 min, low birth weight and SGA infants than the SF group. The NVP and NP groups also had higher odds of giving birth to a female infant.

To our knowledge, this is the first study finding a relationship between NVP or NP and PGP or severe PGP. Importantly, the higher odds for pregnancy complications during gestation for the NVP and NP women are counterbalanced by reduced odds for unfavourable delivery and birth outcomes.

### The burden of illness of severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in the United States [^112xS6Us]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Our purpose was to determine the extent to which nausea and vomiting of pregnancy affects a woman's quality of life (QOL), ability to function, and health care resource use.

Study Design

We conducted an observational, multicenter, prospective cohort study by gathering data on the symptoms, QOL, and health care resource use from women who have nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

Results

All 8 domains of health measured by the Short Form-36 QOL survey were limited by patient symptoms. This limitation manifested itself as patient-time loss from work and other normal activities, unpaid caregiver-time loss from work, and use of health care resources (eg, hospitalization). All types of time loss were correlated to severity of symptoms.

Conclusions

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy can severely reduce a woman's QOL and ability to function. The degree of limitation is associated with the severity of symptoms.

### Interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^115rYG2c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea, retching and vomiting are very commonly experienced by women in early pregnancy. There are considerable physical and psychological effects on women who experience these symptoms. This is an update of a review of interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy previously published in 2003.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of all interventions for nausea, vomiting and retching in early pregnancy, up to 20 weeks' gestation.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 May 2010).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of any intervention for nausea, vomiting and retching in early pregnancy. We excluded trials of interventions for hyperemesis gravidarum which are covered by another review. We also excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials using a crossover design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four review authors, in pairs, reviewed the eligibility of trials and independently evaluated the risk of bias and extracted the data for included trials.

Main Results

Twenty-seven trials, with 4041 women, met the inclusion criteria. These trials covered many interventions, including acupressure, acustimulation, acupuncture, ginger, vitamin B6 and several antiemetic drugs. We identified no studies of dietary or other lifestyle interventions. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of P6 acupressure, auricular (ear) acupressure and acustimulation of the P6 point was limited. Acupuncture (P6 or traditional) showed no significant benefit to women in pregnancy. The use of ginger products may be helpful to women, but the evidence of effectiveness was limited and not consistent. There was only limited evidence from trials to support the use of pharmacological agents including vitamin B6, and anti-emetic drugs to relieve mild or moderate nausea and vomiting. There was little information on maternal and fetal adverse outcomes and on psychological, social or economic outcomes. We were unable to pool findings from studies for most outcomes due to heterogeneity in study participants, interventions, comparison groups, and outcomes measured or reported. The methodological quality of the included studies was mixed.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the high prevalence of nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy, health professionals need to provide clear guidance to women, based on systematically reviewed evidence. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to support that advice. The difficulties in interpreting the results of the studies included in this review highlight the need for specific, consistent and clearly justified outcomes and approaches to measurement in research studies.

### Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: an obstetric syndrome [^116aYt4Y]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Although the cause of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is not known, there is strong evidence linking human chorionic gonadoptropin or estrogens. Evidence is presented to show that the incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is linked to temporal and pathologic alterations in these hormones during pregnancy. The way in which the pregnant woman responds to the primary stimulus to nausea and vomiting of pregnancy appears to depend on her susceptibility mediated by vestibular, gastrointestinal, olfactory, and behavioral pathways. Conceiving of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy as a syndrome suggests new pathways of investigation and possible therapies.

### Prevalence and associated factors of intraoperative nausea and vomiting of mothers who gave birth with cesarean section under regional anesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis; 2023 [^1178AL88]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cesarean section (CS) is one of the most common obstetric procedures performed worldwide. Spinal anesthesia is a commonly practiced rapid, simple, and safe method of anesthesia for cesarean sections. Intraoperative Nausea and vomiting is the experience of nausea and vomiting during a surgical procedure, often associated with anesthesia and surgical manipulation, which is a common complication of Regional/spinal anesthesia, and procedures like a CS, by which parturient feel discomfort and disturbed.

Due to hormonal changes and elevated intra-abdominal pressure, there is an increased risk of nausea and vomiting during the latter stages of pregnancy. It has been demonstrated that nausea and vomiting are the main side effects of spinal anesthesia, which makes these patients' experiences unpleasant.

Nausea and vomiting are frequent side effects of many surgical procedures. However, with CS performed under regional anesthesia, it occurs even more frequently. The patient is at a higher risk of developing IONV due to many factors such as patient related factors like; increased intra-gastric pressure, hypotension, the patient's mental state and procedure related factors like; stretching of the peritoneum (exteriorization of the uterus), excessive surgical manipulation, visceral stimulation, use of opioids, use of uterotonic drugs. One significant risk factor for IONV is hypotension linked to spinal, epidural, and spinal-epidural (combined) anesthesia. Peritonealization, exteriorizing the uterus for suturing, and peritoneal cleaning are other surgical methods that may also be linked to IONV.

### Features of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy as predictive factors of post-partum depression: a systematic review [^113YZ1uV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

To investigate the association between nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP), including hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), and postpartum depression (PPD), and to identify predictive symptoms of PPD to improve preventive care and follow-up.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted in six databases from inception to June 25, 2024, using predefined keywords and MeSH terms related to PPD and pregnancy-related vomiting. Eligible studies included original research articles examining the association between PPD and NVP (any duration or severity, including HG). Articles were restricted to English or French. Diagnostic criteria for NVP and PPD had to be clearly specified. The systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024508214). Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Two independent researchers conducted article screening, data extraction, and bias assessment.

Results

Out of 355 identified articles, 18 (mainly prospective and retrospective cohort studies) were included. Analysis revealed a significantly increased risk of PPD in women with NVP, ranging from adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of 1.54 [95% CI 1.42–1.68] for mild NVP to 6.52 [95% CI 3.76–11.30] for severe NVP and 2.26 [95% CI 1.04–4.92] for persistent symptoms. These values represent the lowest and highest aORs reported in individual studies, not a pooled meta-analytic estimate. The association remained significant in large-scale studies after adjusting for confounders.

Conclusions

This review highlights the importance of monitoring the severity and duration of NVP during pregnancy. Identifying these symptoms should prompt systematic PPD screening, especially within the first 6 months postpartum, to facilitate timely intervention and improve maternal mental health outcomes.

Trial Registration

PROSPERO registration date April 30 th 2024. PROSPERO registration number CRD42024508214.

### Early nasogastric tube feeding in optimising treatment for hyperemesis gravidarum: the MOTHER randomised controlled trial (maternal and offspring outcomes after treatment of hyperEmesis by refeeding) [^11535q4t]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) is common, affecting 50–80% of pregnancies. Often these symptoms are mild and self-limiting and resolve without intervention in the second trimester. In other cases however, severe intractable vomiting can lead to dehydration, electrolyte disturbances and significant weight loss necessitating hospital admission. The condition of intractable vomiting during pregnancy is called hyperemesis gravidarum (HG). HG has repeatedly been associated with poor pregnancy outcome including low birth weight (LBW, < 2500 g: OR 1.42), small for gestational age (OR 1.28) and prematurity (OR 1.32). Furthermore, HG has a major impact on maternal wellbeing and quality of life and remains the largest single cause of hospital admission in early pregnancy. However, the aetiology of HG is poorly understood.

Approximately 0.8–2% of all pregnancies are complicated by HG. Currently, there are no treatments with proven efficacy available according to the latest Cochrane review on interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy. Hospitalisation can be required for intravenous treatment of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Currently, women who suffer from HG do not receive any particular nutritional attention, although enteral tube feeding is sometimes used as a treatment of last resort. Enteral tube feeding effectively treats both dehydration and malnutrition in non-pregnant patients with poor intake and has been shown to be safer than parenteral nutrition in pregnancy. Moreover, in several small studies in women with HG, which did not employ a control group, it alleviated symptoms and was well tolerated if continued in a home setting. There have been no controlled trials to investigate the extent to which enteral tube feeding can positively affect pregnancy outcome and maternal quality of life, nausea and vomiting symptoms or time in hospital.

At present, there is no evidence on the effectiveness and efficiency of rehydration and dietary interventions for HG. We hypothesise that enteral tube feeding in addition to standard care is a more effective treatment for HG symptoms than standard care with intravenous rehydration alone, and improves pregnancy outcome.

This multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to compare early enteral tube feeding in addition to standard care, with standard care alone. Outcomes of interest are birth weight and maternal nausea and vomiting symptoms, maternal quality of life, duration of hospitalisation, weight gain and neonatal morbidity. The study is conducted within the Dutch Consortium for Studies in Obstetrics, Fertility and Gynaecology.

### Features of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy as predictive factors of post-partum depression: a systematic review [^112EayQt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

The association between nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) and postpartum depression (PPD) was reported in several studies, with odds ratios for severity of NVP ranging from 1.54 [95% CI (1.42–1.68)] to 6.52 [95% CI (3.76–11.30)]. For persistent NVP, one study reported an odds ratio of 2.26 [95% CI (1.04–4.92)]. It should be noted that these values represent the lowest and highest odds ratios identified in individual studies included in this review; no meta-analysis was performed, and these are not pooled estimates.

The strength of the association between NVP and PPD appears to increase progressively and linearly with the symptom severity. Indeed, the aOR values increased progressively with NVP intensity, becoming particularly high in the presence of HG. Similarly, the association between NVP and PPD tended to intensify during the postpartum period, from 6 weeks to 6 months after delivery.

### What are the costs associated with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum? A systematic review [^1136Cd6w]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Cost estimates of NVP and HG

Cost estimates from the included studies are summarised in Table 1. Two studies estimated an annual cost of NVP and HG in their respective countries of origin, both identifying a substantial economic burden associated with NVP and HG. Table 1 illustrates that all studies included in the review used diverse costs inputs and outcome measures, thus making it impractical to draw direct comparisons between estimates across the studies.

Three studies presented cost estimates per patient over different time frames. A modelling study estimated a cost per patient with HG in the United States (US) of USD$61,528 (in 2023-year value). Another study analysing primary data reported an estimated weekly cost per patient with severe NVP in Canada of USD$880 (in 2023-year value). This weekly cost value when considered over 36 weeks of pregnancy equates to USD$31,680 per patient.

Three studies reported increasing costs with increasing severity of symptoms. A Canadian study, reported increasing costs from all perspectives with increasing self-reported severity of the symptoms, an association further illustrated in a later modelling study in the United States.

Costs to facility and system level costs

Most studies (n = 6) included direct medical costs substantially contributing to the economic burden of disease. Common cost components included cost of hospital inpatient and day stay admissions, cost of drug treatments, cost of healthcare professionals as well as cost of emergency services.

Cost effectiveness of models of care

Two studies performed cost analyses of models of care. A study from the UK performed a cost utility analysis of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) which compared day care to inpatient management of NVP after random allocation of pregnant women presenting to a tertiary referral maternity hospital for treatment of NVP. The study revealed a notable cost difference between day care and inpatient management of NVP, with day care treatment demonstrating significantly lower costs compared to hospital stays. Similarly, another study from the UK specifically assessed the cost saving benefits in treatment of NVP and HG after the introduction of a specific day stay Hyperemesis Unit. Implementation of the ambulatory unit for the assessment and management of HG showed cost benefits for both the service provider and the patient.

Indirect costs

Four studies considered the economic burden associated with absenteeism from work resulting in an opportunity cost of lost income. Resulting lost income from time off from work was shown to be a significant cost to the woman across multiple studies. No other indirect costs were examined in these studies.

Methods

Study setting, data source, and search strategies

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the pooled prevalence and associated factors of IONV among mothers who gave birth with CS under regional anesthesia. Potential studies were identified with three phases. Initially searching with major databases like PubMed/MEDLINE, Hinari, Google Scholar, Scopus, and EMBASE/Science Direct was done with searching terms of "(Magnitude) OR (Prevalence) OR (Incidence) AND (associated factors) OR (predictors) OR (determinants) OR (risk factors) AND (intraoperative nausea and vomiting) AND (cesarean section) OR (Cesarean delivery) OR (Parturients) OR (Mothers) AND (spinal anesthesia) OR (regional anesthesia) OR (neuraxial anesthesia)". In the second phase, searching with these databases was done with another searching phrase like "Intraoperative nausea and vomiting during cesarean section under spinal anesthesia". In the third phase of the search process, cross references of all included studies with full text after appraisal was done with Google Scholar and google search. A grey literature search was done to identify Research and Trial registers, theses/dissertations, organizations/websites, data – statistics, circulars, and reports. The search result was filtered with free full text, human species, English language, and published within 10 years. In addition, grey literature was searched with the search phrases "Magnitude/prevalence/incidence of intraoperative nausea and vomiting during cesarean section under spinal anesthesia" so as not to miss important articles. The search was done on 10–12/12/2023. The topic was checked for duplication in the PROSPERO and it is registered in the PROSPERO with the registration number of CRD42023495124. This systematic review and meta-analysis was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist.

Research questions

The research questions that this systematic review and meta-analysis answered are;

What is the pooled prevalence of intraoperative nausea and vomiting for mothers who gave birth with cesarean section under regional anesthesia?
What is/are the determinant factors that affect the prevalence of intraoperative nausea and vomiting during cesarean section?

We used the PEO (Population: All parturient; Exposures - Surgery/cesarean section, spinal Anesthesia; and Outcomes - intraoperative nausea and vomiting, determinant factors) approach to include and exclude studies to answer the research questions.

### Evaluation and treatment of nausea and vomiting in adults [^115tX9y8]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms that can reduce quality of life and indicate life-threatening illness. Acute nausea and vomiting last up to 7 days. In the absence of alarm symptoms, they are typically treated symptomatically and without an extensive evaluation. Typical causes include gastroenteritis or other viral syndromes, foodborne illness, acute migraine headaches, vestibular disturbances, early pregnancy, and adverse effects of medication. Chronic nausea and vomiting last 4 weeks or longer and have a broad differential diagnosis. Causes can be gastrointestinal, infectious, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric, or related to medications and toxins. A careful history of related factors is essential to guide the initial evaluation and narrow the differential diagnosis. These factors include associated symptoms, timing of onset and duration of symptoms, exacerbating or relieving factors, alarm symptoms, medication and substance use, relationship with recent food ingestion, and comorbidities. Nonpharmacologic management options include fluid and electrolyte replacement; small, frequent meals; and avoidance of trigger foods. Antiemetic drugs effectively reduce symptoms of acute nausea and vomiting, but chronic symptoms are often more challenging to treat. When a specific etiology is not identified, a serotonin antagonist or dopamine antagonist can be used. However, medications may also target the suspected cause of symptoms and the neurotransmitters involved in central and peripheral pathways of nausea and vomiting. Pharmacologic therapy should be used for the shortest time necessary to control symptoms.

### Prevalence and associated factors of intraoperative nausea and vomiting of mothers who gave birth with cesarean section under regional anesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis; 2023 [^114mUJBK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cesarean section is one of the most common obstetric procedures performed worldwide under spinal anesthesia which is a commonly practiced rapid, simple, and safe method. Vomiting and nausea are frequent side effects of many surgical procedures. However, with cesarean sections performed under regional anesthesia, this issue occurs even more frequently. The existing evidence regarding the prevalence and associated factors of intraoperative nausea and vomiting is inconsistent. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the pooled prevalence and associated factors of intraoperative nausea and vomiting.

Methods

This is a systematic review and meta-analysis study that was done based on studies published within the last 10 years on the prevalence and associated factors of intraoperative nausea and vomiting during cesarean section under regional anesthesia. After PubMed, Google Scholar, HINAR, Scopus, Science Direct, and grey literature extensive search for primary studies, their quality was assessed with JBI and modified Newcastle Ottawa appraisal assessment tool and data was extracted. STATA MP version 17.0 was used for all possible analyses of the study.

Results

Twenty-nine studies were met the inclusion criteria of this systematic review and meta-analysis. However, only 21 studies were included by excluding eight studies due to inappropriate method & outcomes and language other than English. The pooled prevalence of intraoperative nausea and vomiting was 36% (95% CI- 31%, 41%) with heterogeneity (I²–93.1%). Premedicated with metoclopramide, uterus exteriorization, motion sickness, preeclampsia, and intraoperative propofol were associated with the prevalence of intraoperative nausea and vomiting significantly.

Conclusion

The pooled prevalence of intraoperative nausea and vomiting during cesarean section under regional anesthesia was high (36%) which needs more strategies for prevention.

### What are the costs associated with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum? A systematic review [^111yx2YG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

The different medical interventions lead to direct costs incurred by the healthcare system and result in an economic burden of disease. Other costs incurred include the societal costs stemming from the impact of severe NVP and HG on decreased productivity, absenteeism from work, need for partner support and other effects often referred to as indirect costs. These include loss of income, where one-third of women with NVP require time off work, and any other costs incurred by the patient's family or partner/carer (loss of income, transport, childcare).

Despite the prevalence, morbidity, and known direct and indirect costs of NVP and HG, limited research exists regarding resource use, treatments, and potential cost savings for treatments and models of care. It is therefore crucial to examine economic evidence to inform health policies, and understand appropriate funding and resource allocation to mitigate the severe impact of NVP and HG.

Aims and Objectives

The aim of this study was to systematically identify and examine the existing evidence on the economic burden of NVP and HG. Specifically, the study sought to review and synthesise costs associated with NVP and HG in terms of (1) healthcare resource utilisation (direct costs) and (2) personal costs to the woman and her family/caregivers (indirect costs), with the goal of directing healthcare resource allocation in the future. The estimation of costs will provide evidence for the economic burden of NVP and HG and an insight into the key areas that these costs are originating from.

### Features of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy as predictive factors of post-partum depression: a systematic review [^111cCGD6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations of the study

This was the first systematic review to explore the link between NVP-HG and PPD using data from cohort studies to identify predictive symptoms of PPD. It offers valuable insights that could inform the development of systematic screening methods for NVP-HG. This review followed the PRISMA guidelines and used a double-blind selection strategy. The assessment of bias using the NOS scale indicated that the overall quality of the selected studies was generally good. One of the limitations of our systematic review is the absence of direct patient or public involvement (PPI) in the design, selection of outcomes, or interpretation of results. While PPI is increasingly encouraged in health research, it is not systematically required for literature-based reviews relying solely on the analysis of published studies, as outlined in current international guidelines.

Nevertheless, the lack of PPI may limit the consideration of certain perspectives, particularly those related to patient priorities, expectations, or lived experiences, which can influence the clinical relevance and applicability of our conclusions. We acknowledge this limitation and note that, within the methodological framework of our review, patient involvement was not deemed essential but could represent an area for improvement in future research on this topic.

However, the methodological heterogeneity in NVP and PPD assessment and the lack of consensus on their definition in the selected studies limit the drawing of definitive conclusions. Some articles lacked precision regarding PPD, focusing instead on broader concepts of psychological or emotional distress, and therefore, were excluded from this review. Additionally, the research was limited to articles written in English or French. Three articles could not be accessed in full, and one was excluded due to errors in the aOR measurement.

### Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy [^115mhRdR]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting is extensive and the underlying cause can be difficult to diagnose. Treatment of nausea and vomiting also can be unsatisfactory because the available pharmacotherapy does not correct the fundamental underlying pathophysiologic abnormalities. In contrast, the diagnosis of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy generally is straightforward. Almost 80% of women have some degree of nausea in the first trimester of pregnancy, and the diagnosis of pregnancy is established easily by the patient or physician. The spectrum varies from mild nausea to hyperemesis gravidarum. Various treatment approaches are addressed.

### Interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^117Js84X]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea, retching and vomiting are very commonly experienced by women in early pregnancy. There are considerable physical, social and psychological effects on women who experience these symptoms. This is an update of a review of interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy previously published in 2010.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of all interventions for nausea, vomiting and retching in early pregnancy, up to 20 weeks' gestation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field's Trials Register (27 April 2013).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of any intervention for nausea, vomiting and retching in early pregnancy. We excluded trials of interventions for hyperemesis gravidarum, which are covered by another Cochrane review. We also excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials using a cross-over design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four review authors, in pairs, reviewed the eligibility of trials and independently evaluated the risk of bias and extracted the data for included trials.

Main Results

Thirty-seven trials involving 5049 women, met the inclusion criteria. These trials covered many interventions, including acupressure, acustimulation, acupuncture, ginger, chamomile, lemon oil, mint oil, vitamin B6 and several antiemetic drugs. We identified no studies of dietary or other lifestyle interventions. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of P6 acupressure, auricular (ear) acupressure and acustimulation of the P6 point was limited. Acupuncture (P6 or traditional) showed no significant benefit to women in pregnancy. The use of ginger products may be helpful to women, but the evidence of effectiveness was limited and not consistent, though two recent studies support ginger over placebo. There was only limited evidence from trials to support the use of pharmacological agents including vitamin B6, and anti-emetic drugs to relieve mild or moderate nausea and vomiting. There was little information on maternal and fetal adverse outcomes and on psychological, social or economic outcomes. We were unable to pool findings from studies for most outcomes due to heterogeneity in study participants, interventions, comparison groups, and outcomes measured or reported. The methodological quality of the included studies was mixed.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the high prevalence of nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy, women and health professionals need clear guidance about effective and safe interventions, based on systematically reviewed evidence. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to support any particular intervention. This is not the same as saying that the interventions studied are ineffective, but that there is insufficient strong evidence for any one intervention. The difficulties in interpreting and pooling the results of the studies included in this review highlight the need for specific, consistent and clearly justified outcomes and approaches to measurement in research studies.

### Summary of the effect of an exercise intervention on antenatal depression and the optimal program: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114J77nN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

The maximum prenatal anti-depressant intervention effect was achieved with exercise lasting 6–10 weeks, and the amount of intervention effect decreased gradually with longer intervention gestational weeks. Related studies have shown that exercise in early pregnancy may lead to threatened abortion due to embryonic instability. While in late pregnancy, due to weight gain and heavy body burden, exercise tends to overwork the body and may lead to adverse outcomes such as premature birth, so the mid-pregnancy stage of 6–10 weeks is the best intervention stage and gestational weeks.

Overall, under the premise of highlighting the principles of maximum caution and progressive load, it is important to focus on controlling the total intensity of exercise and adequate rest and recovery after exercise for pregnant women to avoid the accumulation of exercise load that causes adverse physical and psychological reactions or signs of excessive exercise load (e.g. over fatigue and sleep disorders), which in turn can increase the psychological burden and aggravate depression in pregnant women.

Exercise format

Based on the safety of individual exercise for pregnant women, the lack of exercise monitoring, and technical support, exercise interventions were based on group and individual + group exercises. The group exercise format achieved the greatest amount of effect in improving antenatal depression. Group exercise promotes socialization and increases pregnant women's motivation, exercise volume, and self-efficacy. Social support and communication are effective ways for pregnant women to overcome their bad moods, and the degree of social support is negatively associated with antenatal depression. Group exercise interventions can increase communication and contact between pregnant women and pregnant women and pregnant women and health care providers, build maternal confidence in natural childbirth, prepare the mind for childbirth physiologically and psychologically, and eliminate triggers for the development of depression. Regular group exercise reduces maternal fatigue, negative emotions, and common pregnancy symptoms (nausea/vomiting), as opposed to exercise alone. In addition, group exercise may help improve the mastery of exercise intensity, the standardization of movements, and the accuracy of performing exercises as required, which to some extent, alleviates anxiety and depressive symptoms in pregnant women.

### Practice bulletin summary no. 153: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^111Q7Szq]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a common condition that affects the health of the pregnant woman and her fetus. It can diminish the woman's quality of life and also significantly contributes to health care costs and time lost from work (1, 2). Because "morning sickness" is common in early pregnancy, the presence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be minimized by obstetricians, other obstetric providers, and pregnant women and, thus, undertreated (1). Furthermore, some women do not seek treatment because of concerns about safety of medications (3). Once nausea and vomiting of pregnancy progresses, it can become more difficult to control symptoms; treatment in the early stages may prevent more serious complications, including hospitalization (4). Mild cases of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be resolved with lifestyle and dietary changes, and safe and effective treatments are available for more severe cases. The woman's perception of the severity of her symptoms plays a critical role in the decision of whether, when, and how to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. In addition, nausea and vomiting of pregnancy should be distinguished from nausea and vomiting related to other causes. The purpose of this document is to review the best available evidence about the diagnosis and management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^113D5sFt]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) — pharmacologic research and combination therapy emphasizes that further investigations of the genetic and internal environment predispositions to PONV could personalize preventive strategies, and that the developing field of pharmacogenomics in relation to antiemetic efficacy is of equal clinical interest. There is yet a paucity of research on PONV risk and management in special patient populations, including children, pregnant patients, and patients having cesarean delivery. The page notes a rising incidence of obesity, bariatric surgery worldwide, and a recent dramatic increase in the use of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, with how these factors influence PONV risk assessment and treatment not yet clearly understood. The current armamentarium of antiemetic drugs provides a solid approach to reduce PONV for most patients, but further research could look to enhance efficacy and reduce side effects; the NK-1 receptor antagonist class is of particular interest because of high efficacy and reasonable duration, as well as potential anxiolytic, antidepressant and antipruritic effects. A combination drug of long acting netupitant with palonosetron is approved in the US for CINV, and research in combination or co-administration of drugs for PONV indications should be done focusing on synergistic effects while monitoring clinical and drug-interaction (CYP450) side effects.

### The HAPPY study (holistic approach to pregnancy and the first postpartum year): design of a large prospective cohort study [^114XmisH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

To assess the severity of NVP (or 'morning sickness') in the early phase of pregnancy, we use the first trimester Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) scale. The assessment is based on three physical symptoms over the first trimester: nausea, vomiting, and retching. The PUQE, which consists of three quantification items with five answer categories, appears to be a reliable instrument to determine severity of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Within the HAPPY study, the Dutch version of the PUQE is assumed to be validated.

To examine CTS, the question: "Did you suffer any of the following symptoms during pregnancy: pain, tingling sensations, or numbness in hands or wrists?" is used including the three key symptoms of CTS. Subsequently, the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) is a disease-specific CTS questionnaire that consists of two subscales: the symptom severity scale (11 items) and the functional status scale (8 items). It has been validated in The Netherlands, showing adequate psychometric properties. The BCTQ is assessed at 32 weeks of gestation and retrospectively at one week postpartum to evaluate CTS symptoms during the last eight weeks of pregnancy. Moreover, in order to evaluate the course of symptoms after childbearing it is assessed at 6 weeks, and 4, 8 and 12 months postpartum.

Furthermore, women are asked whether a negative event did occur during the first trimester of pregnancy or during the period between the previous and next assessment until 12 months postpartum.

Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS 20.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20, IBM, Chicago, Illinois, USA). The confirmatory factor analysis will be done using AMOS (version 18, IBM, Chicago, Illinois, USA).

First, we will test for normality and the computation of descriptive statistics. Data will be presented as mean scores ± SD for continuous data and as percentages for categorical data. At a univariate level, differences in mean scores on questionnaires between subgroups (e.g. with and without thyroid dysfunction, preterm birth, or major depression) will be analysed using t-tests (for parametric data) and Mann–Whitney-U tests (for non-parametric data). Significance will be tested two-sided at a significance level of 0.05. Relations between continuous variables will be calculated using Pearson or Spearman correlations.

### The impact and management of hyperemesis gravidarum: current and future perspectives [^114Z4qY4]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a severe form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy affecting around 1%–3% of pregnancies worldwide and is the most common reason for hospital admission in early pregnancy. HG can have lasting consequences for both pregnant individuals and their offspring. Current best‐practice management includes symptomatic treatment with anti‐emetic pharmacological treatment, rehydration if needed, and psychological support. There is a lack of high‐quality evidence on treatment for HG. Future research should focus on understanding the cause, developing effective treatment, and so limiting the burden of disease on patients and healthcare systems.
