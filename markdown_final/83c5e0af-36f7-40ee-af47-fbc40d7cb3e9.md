## Question

Can midodrine be used to wean patients of vasopressin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether midodrine can be used to help wean patients off vasopressin, including how this might be done in practice and what the supporting evidence is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and mechanisms of midodrine versus vasopressin. Then, I should verify the clinical evidence for midodrine as an adjunct to intravenous vasopressors in the ICU. Next, I will examine whether any trials specifically address midodrine during vasopressin weaning. After that, I need to check guideline positions and safety considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, cautious approach and state the bottom line with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic distinction, because I need to ensure we are not conflating mechanisms. Midodrine is an oral alpha-1 adrenergic agonist prodrug that increases systemic vascular resistance via peripheral arteriolar vasoconstriction, whereas vasopressin is a V1 receptor agonist causing vasoconstriction with additional V2-mediated antidiuretic effects. These are mechanistically different, so midodrine cannot directly substitute for vasopressin's V1 activity, though both raise blood pressure via vasoconstriction.

> Next, I should review the direct clinical evidence for midodrine as an adjunct to IV vasopressors in the ICU. The pivotal randomized MIDAS trial in 132 ICU patients on a single IV vasopressor found no significant reduction in time to vasopressor discontinuation with midodrine 20 mg every 8 hours versus placebo, and no differences in ICU discharge readiness or length of stay. Importantly, bradycardia occurred more often with midodrine, which I need to keep in mind for safety [^116yQWyA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single RCT. I should double-check meta-analytic data. Multiple contemporary systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest that adjunctive midodrine may reduce ICU length of stay and duration of IV vasopressor support, but the certainty is low to very low, with trial sequential analyses indicating that the required information size has not been met; mortality signals are exploratory and should be interpreted cautiously, and bradycardia risk appears increased in pooled analyses, reinforcing the need for vigilance [^1175MzeA] [^116Fi2TV] [^112NDrQ8] [^111goyvH].

> Wait, let me verify whether any studies specifically test midodrine to wean vasopressin itself. I need to check carefully, because extrapolating from "vasopressor weaning" broadly to "vasopressin weaning" could be misleading. I do not find randomized trials or robust observational studies that specifically evaluate midodrine as a bridge during vasopressin tapering; the available data address midodrine as an adjunct to ongoing IV vasopressors, often norepinephrine, rather than a vasopressin-sparing strategy, so evidence for vasopressin-specific weaning is lacking [^notfound].

> I should confirm what guidelines say, because off-label use should align with consensus where possible. Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 recommends adding vasopressin to norepinephrine when MAP is inadequate, but does not address midodrine for vasopressor weaning; hepatology guidance for HRS-AKI suggests midodrine plus octreotide only when terlipressin and norepinephrine are unavailable, underscoring that midodrine is not a routine substitute for vasopressin in shock states; neurology and cardiology guidelines address midodrine for orthostatic hypotension and neurogenic syncope, not for ICU vasopressor weaning, so there is no guideline endorsement for midodrine to facilitate vasopressin discontinuation [^111AYW9B] [^113eS1ck] [^113kNvA2] [^113sJq7p] [^114rn4jH].

> Let me consider safety next, because even if midodrine can raise MAP, I need to ensure risks are acceptable. Bradycardia is consistently more frequent with midodrine in ICU cohorts, and supine hypertension is a recognized risk requiring dose timing and monitoring; in patients with impaired cardiac function, afterload increases from alpha-1 agonism may be problematic, and vasopressin itself can reduce cardiac output, so layering midodrine could theoretically worsen cardiac performance in select patients; I should confirm renal dosing cautions as well, since desglymidodrine is renally cleared [^111goyvH] [^112RrVrZ] [^115M3kvq].

> But wait, what if the clinical scenario is a patient stable on low-dose vasopressin with persistent vasodilation and the team wants to minimize central lines and ICU days? Could midodrine still help indirectly. Observational data suggest midodrine may reduce vasopressor duration and ICU length of stay in mixed ICU populations, and some centers report increased use with apparent hemodynamic benefit, though confounding is substantial; in resource-constrained settings or when vasopressin is being weaned alongside norepinephrine, a cautious, monitored trial of midodrine may be reasonable, but I should frame this as hypothesis-generating rather than evidence-based for vasopressin-specific weaning [^1132txk4] [^116wSn8c] [^115jrGyJ].

> I will now examine a practical approach if midodrine is considered, keeping the limitations explicit. First, I should confirm hemodynamic stability and that the patient is in the recovery phase with improving perfusion and no active ischemia. Then, initiate midodrine at 10 mg orally three times daily while continuing the vasopressor, monitor MAP, heart rate, and signs of bradycardia or supine hypertension, and only begin tapering the IV vasopressor after a consistent MAP response. If vasopressin is being weaned, I should follow established vasopressin weaning principles that prioritize maintaining adequate MAP, often favoring tapering vasopressin after norepinephrine in combined regimens to avoid unopposed afterload, and I should be prepared to pause or reverse the taper if hypotension recurs. Tapering midodrine itself before discontinuation may reduce rebound hypotension based on retrospective data, though this remains low-certainty [^111vKjAi] [^113cnEdp].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing and pharmacokinetics to time monitoring appropriately. Midodrine's active metabolite peaks at 1–2 hours, so early hemodynamic checks after each dose are sensible. Given the risk of supine hypertension, the last daily dose should be at least 3–4 hours before bedtime, and I should avoid use in patients with significant urinary retention or uncontrolled supine hypertension. If renal function is impaired, I should start at lower doses and titrate cautiously due to reduced clearance of the active metabolite [^116XrDev] [^1135g37L] [^115M3kvq].

> Let me reconsider the core question and ensure I am not overstating. Can midodrine be used to wean patients off vasopressin? Mechanistically, it can provide alternative vasoconstriction, but there is no direct, high-quality evidence that midodrine facilitates vasopressin weaning specifically; randomized data show no benefit for accelerating discontinuation of IV vasopressors overall, and meta-analytic signals of benefit are low certainty and not vasopressin-specific, so routine use for vasopressin weaning is not supported; selective, monitored use may be reasonable in stable patients when benefits outweigh risks and when standard weaning principles are followed, ideally within shared decision-making that acknowledges off-label status and uncertainty [^114NKWWs] [^1175MzeA] [^116Fi2TV].

---

Midodrine is **not a substitute for vasopressin** and should not be used to wean patients off vasopressin. Vasopressin is a **V1 receptor agonist** with unique hemodynamic effects, whereas midodrine is an **alpha-1 agonist** [^114NKWWs] with a different mechanism and weaker pressor effect. No evidence supports midodrine for vasopressin weaning, and using it may cause rebound hypotension or inadequate perfusion. Vasopressin should be tapered gradually while monitoring MAP, and midodrine should only be considered for persistent hypotension after vasopressin is stopped, if at all.

---

## Pharmacological differences between midodrine and vasopressin

Midodrine and vasopressin have distinct mechanisms and hemodynamic profiles, making midodrine **unsuitable as a replacement** for vasopressin during weaning.

| **Parameter** | **Midodrine** | **Vasopressin** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism of action | Alpha-1 adrenergic agonist causing peripheral vasoconstriction [^114NKWWs] | V1 receptor agonist causing vasoconstriction and V2 effects reducing renal water excretion [^11688QRk] [^114cQa9V] |
| Hemodynamic effects | Increases SVR and MAP; limited effect on cardiac output | Increases SVR and MAP; may reduce cardiac output; norepinephrine-sparing [^115r56hn] |
| Clinical use | Orthostatic hypotension; off-label ICU hypotension [^112Degxv] | Septic shock; vasodilatory shock; hepatorenal syndrome [^111AYW9B] |

---

## Clinical evidence regarding midodrine for vasopressor weaning

Evidence does not support midodrine for vasopressin weaning; available data address **vasopressor weaning broadly**, not vasopressin specifically. The MIDAS randomized trial found no reduction in vasopressor duration or ICU length of stay with midodrine and a higher incidence of bradycardia [^114NKWWs]. Meta-analyses suggest possible reductions in vasopressor duration and ICU stay, but the evidence is low to very low certainty and not specific to vasopressin weaning [^1175MzeA] [^116Fi2TV].

---

## Potential risks and complications

Using midodrine to wean vasopressin may cause **rebound hypotension** or inadequate perfusion because midodrine lacks vasopressin's unique hemodynamic effects. Risks include bradycardia, supine hypertension, and organ hypoperfusion, especially in patients with autonomic dysfunction or cardiovascular instability [^114NKWWs] [^111Jji61].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

No guideline endorses midodrine for vasopressin weaning; vasopressin is tapered based on hemodynamic stability and MAP response, typically after norepinephrine is reduced. Midodrine is not recommended as a substitute or bridge during vasopressin weaning [^1175MzeA] [^111vKjAi].

---

## Clinical scenarios where midodrine may be considered

Midodrine may be considered only for persistent hypotension after vasopressin is discontinued, and even then **cautiously and with close monitoring**. It is not appropriate for patients with bradycardia, supine hypertension, or autonomic dysfunction.

---

## Recommended weaning strategy for vasopressin

A **stepwise approach** is recommended:

- **Assess stability**: Ensure MAP ≥ 65 mmHg on stable or decreasing vasopressor doses.
- **Reduce vasopressin**: Taper vasopressin gradually (e.g. 0.04 units/min by 0.01 units/min every 1–2 hours) while monitoring MAP and organ perfusion.
- **Monitor closely**: Watch for rebound hypotension and adjust norepinephrine as needed.
- **Discontinue**: Stop vasopressin when MAP remains ≥ 65 mmHg without it, then continue to wean norepinephrine.

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Midodrine is **not a substitute for vasopressin** and should not be used to wean patients off vasopressin. Vasopressin should be tapered gradually with close hemodynamic monitoring, and midodrine should only be considered for persistent hypotension after vasopressin is stopped, if at all.

## References

### Droxidopa or atomoxetine for refractory hypotension in critically ill cardiothoracic surgery patients [^116NRfjG]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of droxidopa or atomoxetine on intravenous (IV) vasoactive agent discontinuation in cardiothoracic intensive care unit (ICU) patients with hypotension refractory to midodrine.

Design

Single-center, retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Tertiary- and quaternary-care university teaching hospital.

Participants

Included patients who received at least 4 consecutive doses of droxidopa or atomoxetine and remained on concurrent midodrine. Patients were excluded if they received study medication before admission, had clinical deterioration after study medication initiation requiring additional vasoactives/escalation of IV vasoactive dosage for at least 12 hours, had a diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome, were prisoners, or were pregnant.

Interventions

Droxidopa, atomoxetine, or both.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary endpoint was time to discontinuation of IV vasoactive agents after initiation of study medication, analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier estimate with the Wilcoxon method, censoring death within 24 hours of the last dose of study medication. No adjustment for repetitive analyses was made, as the analysis was hypothesis-generating. Of the 72 charts reviewed, 45 patients met inclusion criteria (18 atomoxetine, 17 droxidopa, and 10 both). There were no differences in median time to discontinuation of IV vasoactive agents (21.9 days v 8.0 days v 13.9 days, respectively; p = 0.259) or ICU or hospital length of stay between groups. A higher percentage of patients who survived to hospital discharge received both study medications or droxidopa alone (90% v 76.5%) than atomoxetine alone (44.4%, p = 0.028).

Conclusions

Droxidopa and atomoxetine are oral vasoactive agents with potential mechanisms to facilitate IV vasopressor weaning for patients in the ICU with hypotension refractory to midodrine, but further prospective research is needed.

### Effect of midodrine versus placebo on time to vasopressor discontinuation in patients with persistent hypotension in the intensive care unit (MIDAS): an international randomised clinical trial [^114NKWWs]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

ICU discharge is often delayed by a requirement for intravenous vasopressor medications to maintain normotension. We hypothesised that the administration of midodrine, an oral α 1 -adrenergic agonist, as adjunct to standard treatment shortens the duration of intravenous vasopressor requirement.

Methods

In this multicentre, randomised, controlled trial including three tertiary referral hospitals in the US and Australia, we enrolled adult patients with hypotension requiring a single-agent intravenous vasopressor for ≥ 24 h. Subjects received oral midodrine (20 mg) or placebo every 8 h in addition to standard care until cessation of intravenous vasopressors, ICU discharge, or occurrence of adverse events. The primary outcome was time to vasopressor discontinuation. Secondary outcomes included time to ICU discharge readiness, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, and ICU readmission rates.

Results

Between October 2012 and June 2019, 136 participants were randomised, of whom 132 received the allocated intervention and were included in the analysis (modified intention-to-treat approach). Time to vasopressor discontinuation was not different between midodrine and placebo groups (median [IQR], 23.5 [10–54] vs 22.5 [10.4–40] h; difference, 1 h; 95% CI-10.4 to 12.3 h; p = 0.62). No differences in secondary endpoints were observed. Bradycardia occurred more often after midodrine administration (5 [7.6%] vs 0 [0%], p = 0.02).

Conclusion

Midodrine did not accelerate liberation from intravenous vasopressors and was not effective for the treatment of hypotension in critically ill patients.

### Trends in use of midodrine in the ICU: a single-center retrospective case series [^116wSn8c]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Midodrine is an oral alpha-agonist approved for orthostatic hypotension. The use of midodrine as a vasopressor sparing agent has steadily increased in the ICU despite limited evidence for its safety in that setting. We describe the trends in use and reported side effects and complications of midodrine in multidisciplinary ICUs of a tertiary care institution.

Design

Single-center retrospective case series.

Setting

Medical and surgical ICU patients from January 2011 to October 2016 at Mayo Clinic, Rochester.

Patients

Adult patients admitted to any ICU who received midodrine for hypotension were eligible.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

We reviewed the mean arterial pressures and cumulative vasopressor dose before and after midodrine administration and assessed for reported complications. During the study period, a total of 1,119 patients were initiated on midodrine, 56% in surgical ICUs, 42% in medical ICUs, and 2% in a mixed medical and surgical neurology ICU. There was a significant decrease in the number of patients on vasopressors 24 hours after initiation of midodrine (663 to 344; p < 0.001); among the patients that remained on vasopressors, there was a significant decrease in the median cumulative vasopressor dose (p = 0.002). There was a significant increase in median mean arterial pressure 24 hours after initiation of midodrine among patients who were not on vasopressors (65–68; p < 0.01). Asymptomatic bradycardia (heart rate < 50 beats/min) was the most common side effect (n = 172 patients, median 39 beats/min). Two patients developed bowel ischemia after initiation of midodrine that prompted discontinuation of midodrine in one case. Evaluating trends of utilization, the off-label use of midodrine has increased steadily over the years across ICUs.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that midodrine is being increasingly used as an adjunct to increase mean arterial pressure and facilitate weaning of vasopressors in the ICU. Prospective trials are required to further establish the appropriate timing, efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of midodrine use in ICU patients.

### Midodrine hydrochloride (midodrine HCl) [^112dTocf]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical Studies

Midodrine has been studied in 3 principal controlled trials, one of 3-weeks duration and 2 of 1 to 2 days duration. All studies were randomized, double-blind and parallel-design trials in patients with orthostatic hypotension of any etiology and supine-to-standing fall of systolic blood pressure of at least 15 mmHg accompanied by at least moderate dizziness/lightheadedness.

Patients with pre-existing sustained supine hypertension above 180/110 mmHg were routinely excluded. In a 3-week study in 170 patients, most previously untreated with midodrine, the midodrine-treated patients (10 mg t.i.d., with the last dose not later than 6 P.M.) had significantly higher (by about 20 mmHg) 1-minute standing systolic pressure 1 hour after dosing (blood pressures were not measured at other times) for all 3 weeks. After week 1, midodrine-treated patients had small improvements in dizziness/ lightheadedness/unsteadiness scores and global evaluations, but these effects were made difficult to interpret by a high early drop-out rate (about 25% vs 5% on placebo). Supine and sitting blood pressure rose 16/8 mmHg and 20/10 mmHg, respectively, on average.

In a 2-day study, after open-label midodrine, known midodrine responders received midodrine 10 mg or placebo at 0, 3 and 6 hours. One-minute standing systolic blood pressures were increased 1 hour after each dose by about 15 mmHg and 3 hours after each dose by about 12 mmHg; 3-minute standing pressures were increased also at 1, but not 3, hours after dosing. There were increases in standing time seen intermittently 1 hour after dosing, but not at 3 hours.

In a 1-day, dose-response trial, single doses of 0 mg, 2.5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg of midodrine were given to 25 patients. The 10 mg and 20 mg doses produced increases in standing 1-minute systolic pressure of about 30 mmHg at 1 hour; the increase was sustained in part for 2 hours after 10 mg and 4 hours after 20 mg. Supine systolic pressure was ≥ 200 mmHg in 22% of patients on 10 mg and 45% of patients on 20 mg; elevated pressures often lasted 6 hours or more.

Special Populations

A study with 16 patients undergoing hemodialysis demonstrated that midodrine hydrochloride is removed by dialysis.

### Midodrine as adjunctive support for treatment of refractory hypotension in the intensive care unit: a multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled trial (the MIDAS trial) [^115Bfmn8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

The sample size estimation is informed by the previous observational study by Levine et al. In this study, the rates of vasopressor administration decreased by 38% from −0.62 ± 1.40 mcg/min per hour to −2.20 ± 2.45 mcg/min per hour after addition of midodrine. Based on a median time of 17 h from midodrine initiation to discontinuation of IV vasopressors, the 38% reduction translates to an estimated 6 h difference. 6 h is also thought to be a meaningful time frame in terms of reduction in duration of vasopressor treatment. Accordingly, we expect that a sample size of 50 subjects per group will provide us with > 80% probability (power) to detect a difference of 6 h in the primary outcome. Allowing for drop-out, our target sample size is 120.

The study analysis will be by intention to treat. We will analyze our data by using a Student's t -test to determine whether time from initiation of midodrine until discontinuation of IV vasopressors, time from ICU/HDU admission to ICU/HDU discharge readiness, and ICU and hospital LOS differs between groups. Using a Chi-Square test, we will test whether rates of ICU/HDU readmission and incidence of adverse events is different between treatment groups. Time-dependent survival analysis will be employed to assess relationships between addition of midodrine/placebo and ICU/hospital LOS, with mortality considered as the time-dependent covariate. A P value of < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All analyses will be conducted by a statistician blinded to intervention group assignment.

### Midodrine as adjunctive support for treatment of refractory hypotension in the intensive care unit: a multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled trial (the MIDAS trial) [^112TXfMV]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Intervention

A target blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP) or MAP) is determined by the treating physician at enrollment of each patient. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive midodrine 20 mg daily or placebo three times daily, in addition to continuation of the IV vasopressor, until the primary outcome (cessation of IV vasopressors) or an adverse event occurs. The study drug and placebo will be delivered in the form of non-identifying capsules, containing either the active ingredient midodrine, or lactose powder. All patients will receive usual supportive care (intravenous fluids, antibiotics etc.) as per the treating physicians and standard practice. A flowchart of the study procedures is shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2
Flowchart of study procedures

The study drug will be delivered in a double-blind manner until:
Primary outcome is reached – cessation of IV vasopressors; or
Patient is discharged from the ICU; or
Patient develops further hypotension – requiring noradrenaline > 8 mcg/min, phenylephrine > 100 mcg/min, or metaraminol > 60 mcg/min; or
Adverse event occurs – subject develops signs and symptoms of organ failure or hypoperfusion, adverse events related to midodrine including serious allergic reaction, or death.

Blinding and randomization

The principal investigator or research coordinator at each participating site will enroll patients. All study personnel will be blinded, except the investigational pharmacist, to the treatment group of the subjects. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either midodrine or placebo. Randomization will be performed with the use of a computer-generated randomization list and will be stratified by site. An independent statistician not responsible for analyzing the data will create the allocation sequence. This list will be provided by the independent statistician directly to the compounding pharmacy. Individual patient's drug bottles will be labeled with site-specific randomization numbers, which will become the patient's study number. Study sites will dispense the study drug bottles sequentially to patients in the order that they are included in the study.

Outcomes

The primary outcome is time (hours) from initiation of midodrine or placebo to discontinuation of IV vasopressors. Secondary outcomes include time (hours) from ICU admission to discharge readiness, ICU LOS (days), hospital LOS (days), rates of readmission to ICU or HDU, and rates of adverse events related to midodrine administration. A cost consequence analysis will also be performed by a medical economist based on the ICU and hospital LOS.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115tSXsk]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVES:

To summarize the efficacy of midodrine as an adjunctive therapy in critically ill patients. Safety of midodrine was assessed as a secondary outcome.

DATA SOURCES:

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using a peer-reviewed search strategy combining the themes of vasopressor-dependent shock, critical care, and midodrine and including MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane library databases until September 14, 2023.

STUDY SELECTION:

We included studies if they: 1) included patients with vasopressor-dependent shock, 2) were performed in the ICU, 3) evaluated oral midodrine therapy compared with placebo or usual care, and 4) evaluated one of the outcomes of interest.

DATA EXTRACTION:

We extracted data independently in duplicate using standardized data abstraction forms, which included the following specific variables: patient characteristics, age, sex, type of ICU, etiology of shock, number of patients, study inclusion and exclusion criteria, and geographical location. We also captured the type, dose, and duration of IV vasopressors, any cointervention used, and outcome data.

DATA SYNTHESIS:

We identified seven randomized controlled trials (six included in the pooled analysis) and ten observational studies (four included in the pooled analysis) that met eligibility criteria. Adjunctive midodrine may decrease ICU length of stay (LOS) and there is low certainty of effect on hospital LOS. Midodrine may decrease IV vasopressor support duration, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality. Pooled observational data was based on very low certainty data for all outcomes of interest. The trial sequential analysis-informed required sample size was not met for ICU LOS or IV vasopressor duration and this contributed to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations assessments of imprecision for both outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS:

Adjunctive midodrine may decrease ICU LOS, duration of IV vasopressor therapy, and mortality in critically ill patients. However, required sample sizes was not met to determine our outcomes of interest. Midodrine may increase risk of bradycardia. While midodrine may provide benefit for patient-centered outcomes, due to increased risk of adverse events, further large-scale studies are needed to inform and guide its routine use in the ICU.

RESULTS

Study Characteristics

Study details are summarized in Table 1. Of 982 citations identified in the search, we included 17 eligible studies (seven RCTs and ten observational studies) (Fig. 1). Studies only presented in abstract form were not included in the pooled analysis. Only adult patient studies were identified. Study outcomes are summarized in Table 2.

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis diagram illustrating the search and selection process applied for all studies included and excluded over the course of our systematic review. RCT = randomized controlled trial.

Study Quality

The risk of bias attributed to the RCTs was judged as moderate or high, whereas the observational studies were judged to have a high risk of bias (Supplementary File 1, Table S1). Regarding the RCTs, it was found that with a low certainty of assessment midodrine may decrease ICU LOS, duration of vasopressor support, and mortality (Supplementary File 2, Table S2 a). With a very low certainty of evidence midodrine may decrease hospital LOS and increase AEs. Observational studies showed very low certainty evidence for our selected outcomes (Supplementary File 2, Table S2 b).

Midodrine Dosing Protocol

In the included RCTs, oral midodrine dosing was most consistently administered at 10 mg three times per day (TID) (n = 5) with only one RCT dosing at 20 mg TID. Of the observational studies, only five followed a defined dosing protocol (n = 4 at 10 mg; n = 1 at 20 mg) (Table 1).

Orthostatic hypotension pharmacologic therapy — midodrine and fludrocortisone are described with dosing, effects, and supporting evidence: Midodrine is stated to be "a useful addition to the first-line treatment in patients with chronic ANF" and that "midodrine increases BP in both supine and upright posture and that it ameliorates the symptoms of OH"; "Midodrine (5–20 mg, three times daily) has been shown to be effective in three randomized placebo-controlled trials". Fludrocortisone is presented as "Fludrocortisone (0.1–0.3 mg once daily) is a mineralocorticoid that stimulates renal sodium retention and expands fluid volume", with evidence "from two small observational studies (in combination with head-up sleeping) and one double-blind trial in 60 patients", in which treated patients "were less symptomatic with higher blood pressures".

### Midodrine for severe orthostatic hypotension [^115PzuNH]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

Midodrine (Bramox-Brancaster Pharma Limited) was authorised in the UK by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in March 2015 for "the treatment of severe orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic dysfunction in adults when corrective factors have been ruled out and other forms of treatment are inadequate".(1) Previously, midodrine had only been available in the UK as an unlicensed product used on a named-patient basis. It is the first drug to be licensed in the UK for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension. Here we consider the evidence for midodrine in the treatment of severe orthostatic hypotension and how it fits with current management strategies.

### Continuation of newly initiated midodrine therapy after intensive care and hospital discharge: a single-center retrospective study [^115pog1P]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Midodrine is an α1-agonist approved for orthostatic hypotension. Recently, it has received attention as an oral vasopressor to facilitate ICU discharge. The purpose of this study was to identify the incidence of continuation of newly initiated midodrine upon ICU and hospital discharge and identify risk factors associated with its occurrence.

Design

Single-center retrospective study.

Setting

ICU patients from January 2011 to October 2016 at Mayo Clinic, Rochester.

Patients

Adult patients admitted to any ICU who received new midodrine for hypotension and survived to discharge.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

During the study period, 1,010 patients were newly started on midodrine and survived to ICU discharge. Midodrine was continued in 67% (672/1,010) of patients at ICU discharge. Admission to cardiovascular surgery ICU and mixed medical/surgical ICU was a risk factor for midodrine continuation at ICU discharge (odds ratio, 3.94 [2.50–6.21] and 2.03 [1.29–3.20], respectively). At hospital discharge, 34% (311/909) of patients were continued on midodrine therapy. History of congestive heart failure predicted midodrine continuation at hospital discharge (odds ratio, 1.49 [1.05–2.12]). Hypertension and use of mechanical ventilation were associated with a decreased odds of midodrine prescription at both ICU and hospital discharge. Of those discharged from the ICU or hospital on midodrine, 50% were concomitantly prescribed antihypertensives. Discharge from the ICU on midodrine was associated with a significantly shorter ICU length of stay (7.5 ± 8.9 vs 10.6 ± 13.4 d) and reduced risk of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.32–0.70]; p < 0.001), despite no difference in baseline severity of illness scores. In contrast, patients discharged from the hospital on midodrine had a higher risk of 1-year mortality (hazard ratio, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.26–2.04]; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

This study established a high prevalence of midodrine continuation in transitions of care. The risks and benefits of this practice remain unclear. Future studies should explore the impact of this practice on patient outcomes and resource utilization. These insights could be used to model interventions for proper tapering, discontinuation, or follow-up of new start midodrine.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116UdMfC]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Midodrine may decrease ICU LOS, duration of IV vasopressor therapy, and mortality in critically ill patients. Midodrine may also be associated with increased risk of bradycardia, although this finding is based on very low certainty evidence. Current literature appears to show that midodrine may be beneficial in terms of improving patient-centered outcomes, although use of the vasoactive agent in the ICU may be best undertaken when warranted in specific clinical scenarios and under the direction of shared decision-making and values-based care, as further large-scale studies will be needed to guide routine use of adjunctive midodrine in the ICU.

### Midodrine hydrochloride [^111Jji61]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Supine Hypertension: The most potentially serious adverse reaction associated with Midodrine hydrochloride therapy is marked elevation of supine arterial blood pressure (supine hypertension). Systolic pressure of about 200 mmHg were seen overall in about 13.4% of patients given 10 mg of Midodrine hydrochloride. Systolic elevations of this degree were most likely to be observed in patients with relatively elevated pre-treatment systolic blood pressures (mean 170 mmHg). There is no experience in patients with initial supine systolic pressure above 180 mmHg, as those patients were excluded from the clinical trials. Use of Midodrine hydrochloride in such patients is not recommended. Sitting blood pressures were also elevated by Midodrine hydrochloride therapy. It is essential to monitor supine and sitting blood pressures in patients maintained on Midodrine hydrochloride. Uncontrolled hypertension increases the risk of cardiovascular events, particularly stroke.

### Rifaximin and midodrine improve clinical outcome in refractory ascites including renal function, weight loss, and short-term survival [^116Vxax5]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Backgrounds and Aims

The occurrence of refractory ascites in nearly 17% of patients with decompensated cirrhosis is an unresolved issue. Advanced liver disease, functional renal impairment, and vascular insensitivity to vasopressors are the main causes of its refractoriness. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact on diuresis, weight loss, and short-term survival if midodrine and rifaximin were added to the diuretic therapy (DT).

Materials and Methods

The study evaluated the eligibility of 650 patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites who were selected during the period from November 2011 to May 2015. A total of 50 patients were excluded and finally 600 were selected and divided into the following groups: patients exposed to DT (n = 200) as a control group, or DT with midodrine and rifaximin group (n = 400). Body weight, mean arterial pressure, and glomerular filtration rate were determined. Plasma renin and aldosterone were also determined. Follow-up was performed after 2, 6, and 12 weeks, and then every 2 months for 24 months.

Results

The mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in the midodrine and rifaximin group (P = 0.000), and there was a highly significant weight loss after 12 weeks (12.5kg) (P = 0.000), a highly significant increase in serum sodium, urine output, and urinary sodium excretion (P = 0.000), and creatinine clearance was more reduced in the control group. With rifaximin and midodrine, a complete response occurred in 310 (78%) patients, a partial response in 72 (18%), and no response in 18 (4%) versus 30 (15%), 110 (55%), and 60 (30%) in the control group, respectively (P = 0.000). Midodrine and rifaximin significantly reduced paracentesis needs when compared with the controls (18 study patients vs. 75 DT-only patients, P = 0.000).

Conclusion

Adding rifaximin and midodrine to DT enhanced diuresis in refractory ascites with improved systemic, renal hemodynamics and short-term survival.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112d9NUn]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

An unexpected finding was the seeming decrease in mortality with midodrine, albeit based on low certainty evidence. This is an intriguing finding as previous studies evaluating the use of differing vasopressors have not revealed an effect on mortality. However, this was derived from only two RCTs involving 88 patients. While potentially an important finding, it remains exploratory in nature.

Regarding the safety of midodrine, the data for AEs provided a limited ability to interpret the impact of midodrine use compared with control. However, their appeared to be a higher occurrence of bradycardia with midodrine compared with placebo. Three of the included studies reported a significant higher occurrence of bradycardia with midodrine when compared with placebo. Any future use or study of midodrine should ensure appropriate consideration and monitoring for this potential adverse effect.

### The effects of vasopressor choice on renal outcomes in septic shock: a systematic review of randomised trials as a guide for future research [^116STyB4]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Terlipressin was compared to norepinephrine in 4 studies. Three studies, including a total of 119 participants, suggest improvement in the odds of AKI with terlipressin, however no study demonstrated statistical significance. The dominant study of terlipressin (526 participants) reported no difference in the rate of KDIGO graded AKI between vasopressor arms. Heterogeneity was present across all terlipressin studies, including in baseline clinical characteristics and vasopressor doses (terlipressin 1.3–8.3 mcg/min, norepinephrine 5–35 mcg/min). In addition, the study by Gupta et al. was of a sub-population of septic shock with acute on chronic liver failure. Resulting heterogeneity is difficult to evaluate further, as was the case previously for septic shock subpopulation studies.

The remaining two studies were of a pilot nature. Chawla et al. recruited a sample of 20 particularly high risk patients with distributive shock, confirmed by the study author to all be septic, and compared angiotensin II to placebo. Although designed to test for changes in open-label norepinephrine required to maintain target MAP, there was one new case of AKI giving 2 additional cases overall with angiotensin II as compared to placebo. In their work on enteral midodrine alongside standard care norepinephrine, Davoudi-Monfared et al. report one additional case of AKI with midodrine.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Fi2TV]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To summarize the efficacy of midodrine as an adjunctive therapy in critically ill patients. Safety of midodrine was assessed as a secondary outcome.

Data Sources

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using a peer-reviewed search strategy combining the themes of vasopressor-dependent shock, critical care, and midodrine and including MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane library databases until September 14, 2023.

Study Selection

We included studies if they: 1) included patients with vasopressor-dependent shock, 2) were performed in the ICU, 3) evaluated oral midodrine therapy compared with placebo or usual care, and 4) evaluated one of the outcomes of interest.

Data Extraction

We extracted data independently in duplicate using standardized data abstraction forms, which included the following specific variables: patient characteristics, age, sex, type of ICU, etiology of shock, number of patients, study inclusion and exclusion criteria, and geographical location. We also captured the type, dose, and duration of IV vasopressors, any cointervention used, and outcome data.

Data Synthesis

We identified seven randomized controlled trials (six included in the pooled analysis) and ten observational studies (four included in the pooled analysis) that met eligibility criteria. Adjunctive midodrine may decrease ICU length of stay (LOS) and there is low certainty of effect on hospital LOS. Midodrine may decrease IV vasopressor support duration, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality. Pooled observational data was based on very low certainty data for all outcomes of interest. The trial sequential analysis-informed required sample size was not met for ICU LOS or IV vasopressor duration and this contributed to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations assessments of imprecision for both outcomes.

Conclusions

Adjunctive midodrine may decrease ICU LOS, duration of IV vasopressor therapy, and mortality in critically ill patients. However, required sample sizes was not met to determine our outcomes of interest. Midodrine may increase risk of bradycardia. While midodrine may provide benefit for patient-centered outcomes, due to increased risk of adverse events, further large-scale studies are needed to inform and guide its routine use in the ICU.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) management — key continued recommendations are as follows: Midodrine is reasonable in patients with recurrent VVS with no history of hypertension, HF, or urinary retention. The usefulness of orthostatic training is uncertain in patients with frequent VVS. Fludrocortisone might be reasonable for patients with recurrent VVS and inadequate response to salt and fluid intake, unless contraindicated. Beta blockers might be reasonable in patients 42 years of age or older with recurrent VVS. Encouraging increased salt and fluid intake may be reasonable in selected patients with VVS, with suggested amounts including ingestion of 2 to 3 L of fluid per day and a total of 6 to 9 g (100 to 150 mmol) of salt per day, or about 1 to 2 heaping teaspoonfuls, unless contraindicated. In selected patients with VVS, it may be reasonable to reduce or withdraw medications that cause hypotension when appropriate. In patients with recurrent VVS, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor might be considered.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^113PfTKx]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

We used a modified Delphi methodology for grading recommendations, built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category and not by hierarchy, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition; appropriate diagnostic studies to ascertain causative organisms before starting antibiotics; early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy; reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate; a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response; source control with attention to the method that balances risks and benefits; equivalence of crystalloid and colloid resuscitation; aggressive fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure; vasopressor preference for norepinephrine and dopamine; cautious use of vasopressin pending further studies; avoiding low-dose dopamine administration for renal protection; consideration of dobutamine inotropic therapy in some clinical situations; avoidance of supranormal oxygen delivery as a goal of therapy; stress-dose steroid therapy for septic shock; use of recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and high risk for death; with resolution of tissue hypoperfusion and in the absence of coronary artery disease or acute hemorrhage, targeting a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL; appropriate use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets; a low tidal volume and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome; application of a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome; a semirecumbent bed position unless contraindicated; protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia, using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions/lightening; avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible; maintenance of blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization; equivalence of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration and intermittent hemodialysis; lack of utility of bicarbonate use for pH ≥ 7.15; use of deep vein thrombosis/stress ulcer prophylaxis; and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate. Pediatric considerations included a more likely need for intubation due to low functional residual capacity; more difficult intravenous access; fluid resuscitation based on weight with 40–60 mL/kg or higher needed; decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance as the most common hemodynamic profile; greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points; unsettled issue of high-dose steroids for therapy of septic shock; and greater risk of hypoglycemia with aggressive glucose control.

Conclusion

Evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that are hoped to translate into improved outcomes for the critically ill patient. The impact of these guidelines will be formally tested and guidelines updated annually and even more rapidly as some important new knowledge becomes as available.

### Vasopressin and its analogues in patients with septic shock: holy grail or unfulfilled promise? [^11688QRk]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) recommends norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor in patients with septic shock. For many years, there has been growing evidence that high doses of norepinephrine might have cardiac and immunological adverse effects and be associated with poorer outcomes. Current SSC guidelines therefore suggest adding vasopressin, a non-catecholaminergic vasopressor, as a second-line vasopressor rather than increasing the norepinephrine dose in patients requiring doses of norepinephrine base > 0.25–0.50 µg/kg/min, after excluding persistent hypovolemia and cardiac dysfunction. Vasopressin is a peptide hormone that causes vasoconstriction through its specific receptor, the arginine vasopressin receptor V1. Up to one-third of patients with septic shock may have vasopressin deficiency, which contributes to refractory septic shock. Vasopressin use is associated with a norepinephrine-sparing effect, which may in turn reduce the complications induced by high-doses of norepinephrine, by decreasing the vasopressor load: this is the concept of decatecholaminization. Nevertheless, the use of vasopressin in patients with septic shock has not yet demonstrated clear benefits in terms of patient outcomes, such as less cardiotoxicity, reduced use of renal replacement therapy or decreased mortality. The heterogeneity in the use of vasopressin and the definition of early vasopressin administration between different studies as well as many unresolved issues regarding the use of vasopressin in patients with septic shock could explain the absence of clear and relevant clinical benefits. Thus, the identification of subgroups of patients likely to benefit the most from vasopressin, the management of vasopressin administration (time to initiation, optimal doses, weaning strategy) and a better understanding of the interactions between vasopressin and corticosteroids represent major areas of research for future studies.

### Midodrine as adjunctive support for treatment of refractory hypotension in the intensive care unit: a multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled trial (the MIDAS trial) [^116XrDev]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment with vasopressors is one of the most common reasons for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Persistent hypotension in otherwise resuscitated patients can be a delay to discharging patients from the ICU. The addition of oral midodrine may be a solution to reduce the duration of time the patient remains on IV vasopressors and ICU length of stay (LOS).

Midodrine, an oral alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, has approval by the United States Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatmentof symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Midodrine is a prodrug that is metabolized to form desglymidodrine, with peak blood levels of midodrine reached within 30 min and the active metabolite peaking about 1 to 2 h after administration. It has a relatively safe side effect profile with minimal central nervous system side effects, and good oral bioavailability.

* Exploratory post-hoc analysis of SOAP II trial

A final, but important, consideration is that our results may also be limited by study population heterogeneity. Similar to the issues with mixed shock reviews, the patients included in this study may also be too diverse. Septic shock cohorts are likely to be composed of many sub-populations, each with different phenotypes, chronic diseases, risk factors and exposures to certain medications. This is in addition to the between study heterogeneity in norepinephrine base doses, timing and duration of interventional vasopressors as well as co-therapy use. It is possible that certain septic shock sub-groups may have renal benefit from particular vasopressors, but that this signal is lost in both individual studies and this review.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (OH). Because Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP can cause marked elevation of supine blood pressure (BP > 200 mmHg systolic), it should be used in patients whose lives are considerably impaired despite standard clinical care, including non-pharmacologic treatment (such as support stockings), fluid expansion, and lifestyle alterations. The indication is based on Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP effect on increases in 1-minute standing systolic blood pressure, a surrogate marker considered likely to correspond to a clinical benefit. At present, however, clinical benefits of Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP principally improved ability to perform life activities, have not been established. Further clinical trials are underway to verify and describe the clinical benefits of Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP.

After initiation of treatment, Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP should be continued only for patients who report significant symptomatic improvement.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113dNTZn]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Screening and Data Extraction

We included studies if they met the following eligibility criteria: 1) patients with vasopressor-dependent shock, 2) ICU setting, 3) evaluated oral midodrine therapy compared with placebo or usual care, and 4) evaluated an outcome of interest. We included both adult and pediatric studies, all dosing regimens, and etiologies of vasopressor-dependent hypotension. We included only observational studies that had an exposure and control cohort, as well as RCTs. We further reviewed previous systematic reviews, narrative reviews, and meta-analyses to ensure we captured all relevant studies.

We identified eligible studies using a two-staged screening process. First, two investigators (S.J.K. F.H.) independently and in duplicate reviewed the titles and abstracts of all citations. Disagreements were discussed and adjudicated by a third author (O.G.R.) as needed. Second, the same two reviewers screened full texts for eligibility independently and in duplicate. Reasons for exclusion were captured in the second phase, and we resolved any disagreements during this stage using discussion and third-party adjudication, as needed.

We extracted data independently in duplicate using standardized data abstraction forms, which included the following specific variables: patient characteristics, age, sex, type of ICU, etiology of shock, number of patients, study inclusion and exclusion criteria, and geographical location. We also captured the type, dose, and duration of IV vasopressors, any cointervention used (i.e. steroids use) in either the intervention or comparator groups and outcome data.

Risk of Bias Assessment

We assessed risk of bias of the included studies using the modified Cochrane tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa tool for observational studies. We used the GRADE framework to evaluate certainty in pooled outcome data based on the following domains: risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias. We assessed certainty as very low, low, moderate, or high. We used narrative statements to formulate findings in keeping with GRADE guidance.

Adverse events

Adverse events will be recorded daily. Nursing charts and documentation, as well as physicians' notes will be reviewed daily to identify potential adverse events. Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or diseases chronologically associated with midodrine or placebo administration. The relationship of any adverse event to the study drug will be assessed by the investigator and qualified by strength of association (not related, unlikely related, possibly related, probably related, or definitely related) and severity of the event (mild, moderate or severe). All adverse events will be summarized by the study staff and, where appropriate, reported to the local human research committee. Serious adverse events (SAE) are hypertension (increase in SBP 20% higher than the predefined goal set by the primary team, or > 160 mmHg), bradycardia (decrease in heart rate 20% lower than the predefined goal set by the primary team or < 40 beats per minute), hemodynamically significant tachyarrythmias (resulting in drop in SBP > 20 mmHg), or new organ failure (evidence of inadequate organ oxygenation, liver and renal failure as per definitions in exclusion criteria).

Data and safety monitoring board

Data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) has been created and comprises of physicians with relevant critical care experience. The members are not involved in the study and will be completely independent of any study-related patient recruitment and data collection.

### Midodrine in end-stage heart failure [^1158KLS4]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2023). High credibility.

It is estimated that 5% of patients with heart failure (HF) will progress to end-stage disease refractory to medical therapy and might require prolonged hospitalisation with inotropic support. We present the case of a patient with end-stage HF who was admitted with cardiogenic shock. During his hospitalisation, he required prolonged intravenous vasopressor therapy due to refractory hypotension. He did not qualify for heart transplantation or left ventricular-assist device strategies. Midodrine was started as a last resort attempt to wean off vasopressors. After 5 days of therapy, the patient was weaned entirely off vasopressors and was discharged home for hospice care. By the time of discharge, he was tolerating low-dose carvedilol along with midodrine. We propose midodrine as a reasonable alternative for patients with end-stage HF with reduced ejection fraction and refractory hypotension, who are dependent on intravenous vasoactive drugs and are not candidates for advanced HF therapies.

Risk factors for the development of AKI in DC include infections (ie, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and fluid loss (ie, LVP without administration of albumin). Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, hospital mortality of HRS-AKI may be as high as 32%. Prompt recognition of worsening renal function is critical. Initial therapy is volume expansion with 20%–25% intravenous albumin at 1 g/kg/day for 48 hours (then continued at lower doses), aggressive treatment of infections, and stopping diuretics. Vasoconstrictors are an important component of early treatment, and improvements in MAP indicate a higher probability of improvement. Terlipressin, a synthetic selective vasopressin analog, acts as a splanchnic vasoconstrictor and, when administered with albumin, has shown benefit in reversing HRS-AKI (although with significant adverse effects primarily related to vasoconstriction including abdominal pain, cardiovascular events, and respiratory failure) and is widely used in Europe and Asia. As terlipressin is not currently available in North America, norepinephrine is recommended and has demonstrated effectiveness; it is preferred over vasopressin as vasopressin's renal V2 effects can worsen volume overload and hyponatremia. Norepinephrine should be titrated to both MAP and urine output and should be continued until creatinine returns to baseline. Midodrine, albumin, and octreotide combination therapy is more commonly used in a non-ICU setting and will not be discussed here.

Although some small studies have reported promising results, the role of TIPS in patients with HRS-AKI is not well-defined. A meta-analysis of 128 patients demonstrated improvement in renal function in almost all patients, but unclear survival benefits (72% short-term and 47% 1-year survival). Renal replacement therapy addresses volume overload and electrolyte abnormalities, but does not improve survival and is recommended only as a temporizing measure until hepatic transplantation in the appropriate patient.

### Vasopressin and its analogues in patients with septic shock: holy grail or unfulfilled promise? [^111vKjAi]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

How vasopressin should be weaned?

Seven retrospective studies found that vasopressin should be tapered after norepinephrine to avoid arterial hypotension, while the single small, randomized trial found opposite results. However, there was no impact of the occurrence of arterial hypotension and mortality. The very recent randomized trial RENOVA including 91 patients receiving norepinephrine and vasopressin found a trend towards a higher incidence of arterial hypotension in the first 24 h after vasopressor reduction (43.6% vs. 25.6%, p = 0.15), when weaning was initiated with norepinephrine.

Whatever weaning strategy is considered, physicians should keep in mind that vasopressin is a pure vasopressor, unlike norepinephrine which is an inopressor. Therefore, weaning from norepinephrine results in a loss of its inotropic activity and some patients may experience or unmask cardiac dysfunction when given vasopressin alone, due to increased left ventricular afterload.

### Vasopressin and its analogues in patients with septic shock: holy grail or unfulfilled promise? [^115r56hn]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Because of the adverse effects of high doses of norepinephrine, it is currently suggested that vasopressin, a non-catecholaminergic vasopressor, be used as a second-line vasopressor in patients with septic shock requiring doses of norepinephrine base > 0.25–0.50 µg/kg/min, after excluding persistent hypovolemia and cardiac dysfunction. To date, the use of vasopressin has no beneficial effect on mortality and the reduction in the need for RRT and the risk of atrial fibrillation needs to be confirmed. Nevertheless, vasopressin use is associated with a norepinephrine-sparing effect, which is an interesting strategy in terms of decatecholaminization. Clinical use of vasopressin should balance hemodynamic goals and potential ischemic risks, especially in patients with impaired cardiac function or acidemia.

There are still several unresolved issues regarding the worldwide availability of vasopressin, the identification of subgroups of patients most likely to benefit from it and the management of its administration, including the timing of its initiation, the optimal dose and the weaning strategy. Patient selection and the timing of vasopressin administration remain particularly critical, and future approaches may be guided by biomarkers such as copeptin or dynamic tests to help personalize therapy. A better understanding of the interactions between vasopressin and corticosteroids is also needed. The results of an ESICM-endorsed survey on vasopressin use in patients with septic shock (PRESS Survey) will provide new insights into these issues and could be the first step in further studies.

### The effects of vasopressor choice on renal outcomes in septic shock: a systematic review of randomised trials as a guide for future research [^1159SRcA]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Two small studies of terlipressin report lower rates of RRT when compared to norepinephrine in septic shock. However, despite similar dosing, the dominant study by Lui et al. failed to show a difference between vasopressor arms. Unfortunately, this outcome is documented in prose which precludes further evaluation. The remaining study of terlipressin uses higher doses and examines a sub-population of septic shock patients with cirrhosis. This study suggests a lower duration AKI with terlipressin. However, caution is warranted in the interpretation of these results due to inconsistent denominator reporting.

Selepressin was studied in a single large adaptive trial by Laterre et al. designed for dose determination and efficacy evaluation. The trial was stopped early, with 562 and 266 patients recruited to selepressin and norepinephrine arms respectively, due to futility. In addition to equivalence in the study's primary outcome of ventilator- and vasopressor-free days, no difference was demonstrated in either renal failure free days or duration of RRT.

The remaining three studies examined the adrenoceptor agonists dopamine, phenylephrine and midodrine. The study by Zampieri et al. is an exploratory post-hoc analysis of the SOAP II study. The original study recruited a mixed shock population, and although RRT free days was reported, results were not broken down into shock aetiology sub-populations. It was, therefore, screened out at full text review. However, this recent report contains novel statistical analysis of the existing data in the 542 (63%) of the study population with septic shock. Win ratio analysis demonstrates fewer wins with dopamine with regard to rate of RRT, suggesting this vasopressor was inferior to norepinephrine therapy in terms of this outcome. Phenylephrine, as fist line vasopressor, was reported by Morelli et al. from a small double blinded RCT. This study demonstrated no benefit with phenylephrine, with higher rates of RRT (7, 44%) when compared to norepinephrine (2, 13%). Finally, a single study of midodrine demonstrated similar rates of RRT (2, 13% vs. 2, 15%) when this agent was given in addition to open label norepinephrine, as opposed to norepinephrine alone.

2017 ACC/AHA/HRS syncope guideline — neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH) management states that acute water ingestion is recommended in patients with syncope caused by neurogenic OH for occasional, temporary relief, and that physical counter-pressure maneuvers, compression garments, and midodrine can be beneficial. In neurogenic OH, acute water ingestion can temporarily restore orthostatic tolerance and is not intended for routine or long-term use. Physical counter-pressure maneuvers, including isometric contraction such as leg crossing, lower body muscle tensing, maximal force handgrip, and squatting, can increase blood pressure, but the benefit is limited to patients with sufficient prodrome and the ability to perform these maneuvers adequately and safely. Compression garments can improve orthostatic symptoms and blunt associated blood pressure decreases and should be at least thigh high and preferably include the abdomen. Midodrine can be beneficial, with a dose-dependent effect usually corresponding to an increase in standing blood pressure, though its use may be limited by supine hypertension and side effects including scalp tingling, piloerection, and urinary retention.

### Midodrine as adjunctive support for treatment of refractory hypotension in the intensive care unit: a multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled trial (the MIDAS trial) [^114g2szL]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

One limitation of this study is the fixed drug dosing. This was selected to simplify the protocol and it was shown to be safe during the pilot study. However, an individualized dose titrated according to renal or hepatic function may allow midodrine to be used in a wider range of patients. A second limitation is we do not have a standardized protocol with regards to blood pressure targets for initiation, escalation, or weaning of IV vasopressors. The different blood pressure goals set by the primary care team may confound the individual duration of vasopressor treatment. A third limitation is that we are not studying the use of this drug on the ward environment, which is another useful indication of midodrine in preventing ICU admission.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111goyvH]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

ICU and Hospital Mortality

The use of midodrine may decrease in-hospital mortality (pooled RCT data RR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.45–0.94]; low certainty) (Supplementary File 3, Fig. S1 a,), although there was a very low certainty of effect from observational studies (RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.33–3.00]; very low certainty) (Supplementary File 3, Fig. S1 b).

Adverse Events

Two RCTs reported on overall AEs, showing no significant difference between the midodrine and the control groups with very low certainty (Supplementary File 4, Fig. S2). Bradycardia was the most reported AE. It was reported in one RCT (n = 5, 7.6% vs. n = 0), and three observational studies (n = 26, 16.5% vs. n = 83, 17.5%; n = 4, 21.1% vs. n = 1, 2.4%; and n = 13, 29.5% vs. n = 52, 14.9% in midodrine vs. control, respectively). Details of the AEs are presented in Table 2.

Pooled analysis showed that midodrine had a very low certainty of effect on AEs based on data from RCTs (Supplementary File 2, Table 2S a). It was not possible to evaluate this effect in observational studies.

Subgroup and Sensitivity Analysis

Of those identified a priori (septic vs. nonseptic, surgical vs. nonsurgical, cirrhotic vs. noncirrhotic), we were only able to identify septic vs. nonseptic patients from the identified studies. We did not find evidence of subgroup effect based on septic vs. other etiologies of shock (Supplementary File 5, Fig. S3). A sensitivity analysis was completed (Supplementary File 6, Table S3,), although the results of this were unremarkable.

### Refractory bradycardia and hypotension in patients with autonomic dysfunction treated with pseudoephedrine [^112TD2An]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

We describe a man in his 40s with a history of chronic intranasal cocaine use and C5-C7 incomplete quadriplegia complicated by neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, admitted to the intensive care unit for worsening bradycardia and hypotension requiring initiation of dopamine and an increase of his home midodrine dose. The patient experienced refractory bradycardia and hypotension with weaning of dopamine, and therefore a recommendation was made to add pseudoephedrine to his current regimen. This case describes the addition of pseudoephedrine to facilitate weaning off intravenous vasopressors within 24 hours in a patient with refractory bradycardia and hypotension secondary to autonomic dysfunction.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113oV4Ei]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies have evaluated the use of midodrine for vasopressor support in the ICU. Observational studies have used inconsistent administration protocols, demonstrating variable results; small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated no difference between placebo and midodrine in IV vasopressor duration or ICU LOS. The small sample sizes of previous studies have resulted in the need for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. While other systematic reviews have been conducted, they did not use Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE), lacked subgroup analysis, and did not perform trial sequential analysis (TSA). Further, previous reviews have not included the latest studies, evaluated only RCTs, or only observational studies.

The primary objective of this study was to summarize the efficacy of midodrine as an adjunctive medication in the ICU from the totality of published literature. Our secondary objective was to report on the safety of midodrine.

### Midodrine as adjunctive support for treatment of refractory hypotension in the intensive care unit: a multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled trial (the MIDAS trial) [^113B113z]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Midodrine has previously been evaluated in a series of prospective trials for orthostatic hypotension. Jankovic et al. found a dose of 10 mg three times daily (TDS) increased standing systolic blood pressure by 22 mmHg versus placebo. Wright et al. conducted a dose response study and found that midodrine (10 mg and 20 mg) increased standing blood pressure compared with placebo.

Midodrine has also been studied in the setting of dialysis-induced hypotension, and administration of 2.5–10 mg prior to dialysis improved the symptoms of intradialytic hypotension and increased post-dialysis systolic blood pressure.

In the critical care environment, the authors have obtained an Investigational New Drug (IND) approval from the United States FDA (IND 113,330; date of receipt: September 12, 2011) to study its effects in patients who require low dose IV vasopressors following resuscitation. We then conducted an observational study on the use of oral midodrine to hasten weaning of IV vasopressors in a cohort of surgical ICU patients. In this prospective observational study, 20 patients who met surgical ICU discharge criteria except for persistent requirement for IV vasopressors (phenylephrine < 150 mcg/min or noradrenaline < 8 mcg/min) received oral midodrine (modal dose 20 mg, range 5–20 mg) TDS. Requirements for IV vasopressors were assessed following each of the first four doses of midodrine. The rates of decline of vasopressor requirement in the 12 h preceding midodrine, and from initiation of midodrine until 4 h post the fourth dose were calculated. 6 of 20 study patients were able to be weaned from vasopressors following the first dose of midodrine, increasing to 14 of 20 following the fourth dose. The rate of decline in vasopressor requirements increased from 0.62 mcg/min per hour to 2.20 mcg/min per hour (p = 0.012), meaning less IV vasopressor was required. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and total body fluid balance were not significantly different pre and post midodrine administration, suggesting that changes in hemodynamic status or fluid resuscitation were not responsible for the change in the rate of decline in vasopressor requirements.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^117Lczwz]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Maintain perfusion in hypotension — In cases of hypotension, a drug with combined inotropic and vasopressor properties may be necessary to maintain adequate perfusion, and dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine are useful adjuncts to augment contractility in the setting of significant hypotension (systolic BP < 80–90 mm Hg), with norepinephrine being a potent α1-receptor agonist that leads to vasoconstriction with less prominent inotropic and chronotropic effects. For refractory hypotension caused by peripheral vasodilation not responding to initial interventions, more pure vasopressors such as arginine vasopressin or phenylephrine may be required, arginine vasopressin causes peripheral vasoconstriction with less impact on PVR and supports glomerular filtration via selective efferent arteriole constriction, and attempts should be made to wean off these treatments as rapidly as possible. Although short-term inotropic agents improve hemodynamics, long-term administration is associated with increased myocardial oxygen consumption and possibly increased mortality, clinical guidelines recommend against the routine use of these agents in hospitalized patients with acute HF, and in rare cases, dobutamine can cause eosinophilic myocarditis with further deterioration of cardiac function.

### Feasibility, utility, and safety of midodrine during recovery phase from septic shock [^1132txk4]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

We describe the feasibility, utility, and safety of oral midodrine to replace IV vasopressors during recovery from septic shock.

Methods

This was a retrospective study performed in a medical ICU. All study subjects had a diagnosis of septic shock requiring at least 24 hours of IV vasopressors and demonstrated clinical stability with stable or decreasing doses of IV vasopressors. The two groups compared were those who received IV vasopressors only and those who received IV vasopressors with adjunctive midodrine.

Results

Of the 275 study patients, 140 received an IV vasopressor only and 135 received midodrine in addition to an IV vasopressor. There was no difference between the groups' demographics (age, sex, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation 4 score). Mean IV vasopressor duration was 3.8 days in the IV vasopressor only group and 2.9 days in the IV vasopressor with midodrine group (P < .001). An IV vasopressor was reinstituted after discontinuation in 21 of 140 (15%) patients in the IV vasopressor only group and in 7 of 135 (5.2%) patients in the IV vasopressor with midodrine group (P = 0.007). ICU length of stay was 9.4 days in the IV vasopressor only group and 7.5 days in the IV vasopressor with midodrine group (P = 0.017). There were no complications associated with midodrine use except transient bradycardia in one patient, which resolved upon discontinuation of midodrine.

Conclusions

Midodrine may reduce the duration of IV vasopressors during recovery phase from septic shock and may be associated with a reduction in length of stay in the ICU.

### Midodrine hydrochloride (midodrine HCl) [^112oUJcF]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Midodrine hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (OH). Because midodrine hydrochloride tablets can cause marked elevation of supine blood pressure (BP > 200 mmHg systolic), it should be used in patients whose lives are considerably impaired despite standard clinical care, including non-pharmacologic treatment (such as support stockings), fluid expansion and lifestyle alterations. The indication is based on midodrine hydrochloride tablet's effect on increases in 1-minute standing systolic blood pressure, a surrogate marker considered likely to correspond to a clinical benefit. At present, however, clinical benefits of midodrine hydrochloride tablets, principally improved ability to perform life activities, have not been established. Further clinical trials are underway to verify and describe the clinical benefits of midodrine hydrochloride tablets.

After initiation of treatment, midodrine hydrochloride tablets should be continued only for patients who report significant symptomatic improvement.

Pharmacologic Therapy

Currently, there are no approved medications for treating HRS‐AKI in the United States. Therapeutic alternatives are needed for the minority of patients who are critically ill and awaiting LT and the majority of patients who are ineligible for LT. At present, the mainstay of pharmacologic therapy consists of plasma expanders to increase intravascular volume and, in combination with vasoconstrictors, reverse splanchnic vasodilatation. This is thought to improve the systemic circulation and increase arterial pressure, leading to increased renal perfusion pressure, glomerular filtration rate, and overall renal function.

Volume Expansion

Albumin is considered a crucial plasma expander for the treatment of HRS‐AKI. Albumin maintains or increases cardiac output even in the most advanced phases of liver disease. Preclinical studies indicate that albumin may also have anti‐inflammatory properties. However, in a recent study in the United Kingdom, during which 777 patients with cirrhosis were given the standard of care dose of albumin (median of 20 g/patient) or increased albumin (to a target of ≥ 30 g/L), albumin did not reduce the incidences of infection, kidney dysfunction, or death.

Vasoconstrictors

The vasoconstrictive component of treatment can occur via several mechanisms. Alpha‐adrenergic receptor agonists, including norepinephrine and midodrine, act by binding to alpha‐1‐adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to vasoconstriction. The somatostatin analog octreotide inhibits the release of glucagon and other vasodilator peptides, leading to vasoconstriction in splanchnic, portal, and systemic circulations. Vasopressin and vasopressin analogs (ornipressin, terlipressin) bind to V1 receptors of vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to vasoconstriction, mainly of the splanchnic circulation. Despite the lack of approved indications in HRS‐AKI by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), vasoconstrictors that are commonly administered with albumin in the United States include midodrine and octreotide. The adrenergic agonist norepinephrine is also used to treat HRS‐AKI, but its administration requires ICU care. Thus, it is often used in patients with severe HRS‐AKI. Terlipressin, a vasopressin analog, is commonly used in combination with albumin for HRS‐AKI management around the world but is currently unavailable in the United States.

Midodrine hydrochloride should be used cautiously in patients with urinary retention problems, as desglymidodrine acts on the alpha-adrenergic receptors of the bladder neck.

Midodrine hydrochloride should be used with caution in orthostatic hypotensive patients who are also diabetic, as well as those with a history of visual problems who are also taking fludrocortisone acetate, which is known to cause an increase in intraocular pressure and glaucoma.

Midodrine hydrochloride use has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Because desglymidodrine is eliminated via the kidneys, and higher blood levels would be expected in such patients, Midodrine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment, with a starting dose of 2.5 mg (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Renal function should be assessed prior to initial use of Midodrine hydrochloride.

Midodrine hydrochloride use has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Midodrine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, as the liver has a role in the metabolism of midodrine.

Information for Patients: Patients should be told that certain agents in over-the-counter products, such as cold remedies and diet aids, can elevate blood pressure, and therefore, should be used cautiously with Midodrine hydrochloride, as they may enhance or potentiate the pressor effects of Midodrine hydrochloride (see Drug Interactions). Patients should also be made aware of the possibility of supine hypertension. They should be told to avoid taking their dose if they are to be supine for any length of time, i.e., they should take their last daily dose of Midodrine hydrochloride 3 to 4 hours before bedtime to minimize nighttime supine hypertension.

### Initiating angiotensin II at lower vasopressor doses in vasodilatory shock: an exploratory post-hoc analysis of the ATHOS-3 clinical trial [^116t4vjq]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

In this post-hoc analysis, patients were grouped by the NED at study drug initiation into low (≤ 0.25 µg/kg/min) and high (> 0.25 µg/kg/min) subgroups. This cut-off was established on the basis of post-marketing observational studies demonstrating that 0.2–0.3 µg/kg/min NED is a common criterion in local hospital protocols for adding AT II, with one study suggesting better hemodynamic response to AT II below these thresholds. Further, a study investigating the impact of NED on outcomes with vasopressin, reported that starting vasopressin at a NED dose of 10 µg/min was associated with a significantly lower likelihood of in-hospital mortality compared to waiting until a NED of 25 µg/min. Presuming clinical use of AT II as part of an early multimodal approach along with NE (10 µg/min or 0.1 µg/kg/min) and vasopressin (0.04 units/min), would yield a NED of 0.2 µg/kg/min at initiation. We set our threshold slightly above this NED because of the ATHOS-3 eligibility criterion that patients be on a minimum NED of 0.2 µg/kg/min. Utilizing a NED cut-off criterion of 0.25 µg/kg/min resulted in an approximately 1:2 distribution of low: high-NED cases deemed suitable for this exploratory analysis. Finally, we performed sensitivity analyses using NED thresholds of 0.2 and 0.3 µg/kg/min.

Within each subgroup, we compared the differences in 28-day survival between patients receiving AT II or placebo. The primary outcome was the difference in 28-day survival between the AT II and placebo groups in those with a baseline NED ≤ 0.25 µg/kg/min at the time of study drug initiation. The secondary outcome was the difference in 28-day survival between the two groups in those with a baseline NED > 0.25 µg/kg/min. Other exploratory outcomes included the proportion of patients achieving a MAP response at hour 3, the degree of change in background vasopressors at hour 3, survival at 7 days, and cumulative incidence of discontinuation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) at 7 days. Safety was assessed and reported through 28 days.

### Terlipressin versus other vasoactive drugs for hepatorenal syndrome [^117YB2ut]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatorenal syndrome is defined as severe renal failure occurring in people with cirrhosis and ascites. Systematic reviews of randomised clinical trials found that, compared with placebo, terlipressin may reduce mortality and improve renal function in people with hepatorenal syndrome, but we need current evidence from systematic reviews on the benefits and harms of terlipressin versus other vasoactive drugs.

Objectives

To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of terlipressin versus other vasoactive drugs for people with hepatorenal syndrome.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Science Citation Index Expanded; conducted manual searches of references in relevant literature; and wrote to experts and pharmaceutical companies (date of last search November 2016).

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing terlipressin versus any other type of vasoactive drugs for hepatorenal syndrome. We allowed albumin and other cointerventions if provided equally in the comparison groups.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently extracted data. The primary outcomes were mortality, hepatorenal syndrome (persistent hepatorenal syndrome despite treatment), and serious adverse events. We conducted meta-analyses and present the results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We performed sensitivity, subgroup, and Trial Sequential Analyses and evaluated bias control based on the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group domains.

Main Results

We included 10 randomised clinical trials with 474 participants. The trials compared terlipressin versus noradrenaline (seven trials), octreotide (one trial), midodrine and octreotide (one trial), or dopamine (one trial). All participants in both groups received albumin as cointervention. We classified two trials at low risk of bias and eight trials at high risk of bias in the assessment of mortality and all trials at high risk of bias for remaining outcomes. In five trials, investigators specifically stated that they did not receive funding from for-profit organisations. We had no information about the funding source from the remaining five trials. Terlipressin was not superior or inferior compared with other vasoactive drugs in regard to mortality when including the two trials with a low risk of bias (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.36; 94 participants, very low quality evidence) or when including all 10 trials (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.06; 474 participants; I² = 0%; very low quality evidence). One meta-analysis including nine trials suggested a beneficial effect of terlipressin on hepatorenal syndrome (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.99; 394 participants; I² = 26%; very low quality evidence). Due to the high mortality of hepatorenal syndrome, the registration of other serious adverse events is uncertain, but comparing terlipressin and other vasoactive drugs we found no significant difference (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.06; 474 participants; I² = 0%; very low quality evidence). Several trials did not report systematically of adverse events, but terlipressin seemed to increase the risks of diarrhoea or abdominal pain, or both (RR 3.50, 95% CI 1.19 to 10.27; 221 participants; 5 trials, I² = 0%). However, Trial Sequential Analyses found insufficient evidence to support or refute any differences between interventions for all outcomes. Considering reversal of hepatorenal syndrome, subgroup analyses on the type of other vasoactive drugs found that terlipressin was superior compared with midodrine and octreotide (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.72) or octreotide alone (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.96), but each subgroup only included one small trial. None of the remaining subgroup or sensitivity analyses found differences between terlipressin and other vasoactive drugs. We downgraded the evidence to very low quality because of the high risk of bias, imprecision, and the results of the Trial Sequential Analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found insufficient evidence to support or refute beneficial or harmful effects of terlipressin and albumin versus other vasoactive drugs and albumin. Additional research is needed to evaluate if clinically meaningful differences exist between interventions.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1133Y1ow]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This meta-analysis and systematic review evaluated the efficacy of midodrine as an oral adjuvant therapy for critically ill patients requiring IV vasopressor therapy. Pooled data from RCTs showed that adjunctive midodrine may decrease ICU LOS, vasopressor support duration, as well as both ICU and hospital mortality. Conversely, midodrine had a very low certainty of effect on hospital LOS and AEs. While the decrease in ICU LOS is based on low certainty data, the mean duration of stay was less for the midodrine group by just over 1 day (MD, 1.01 d), which has been previously identified as a minimal clinically important difference for ICU LOS. Further studies will be necessary to increase the precision of these findings.

Despite pooled data from the RCTs showing a signal toward reduced LOS in the midodrine group, this signal was not apparent when considering the totality of evidence gathered. Pooled data from observational studies evaluating this outcome was inconsistent with that of the RCTs, however of lower certainty and therefore should not inform conclusions. These findings speak to the biological plausibility of midodrine. A decrease in vasopressor duration likely indicates a reduced need for support, possibly shortening the ongoing need for ICU admission. While these findings confirm the potential scientific rationale, there remain several possible reasons we have not found a significant association between midodrine and a shorter ICU LOS. First, as evident by our TSA, sample size may not be sufficient. Second, there may be other factors leading to the determination of discharge, including when the decision to discharge is made, how ICU LOS is being recorded, and what factors may affect actual ICU discharge (e.g. bed availability). Third, patients may have other indications to remain in the ICU such as ventilatory support or close monitoring.

### Should we wean patients off vasopressors before weaning them off ventilation? [^111Aig8s]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

However, the study by Zarrabian and colleagues is important. It included a huge number of patients, and the statistical analysis was well conducted, in particular, to erase the limitations owing to its retrospective nature. It confirms two observational studies of smaller size that already suggested that weaning patients under a low dose of vasopressor was safe. Then, as the authors themselves underline, the study contributes to the certainty that there is equipoise as to the safety of such practice. It calls for the conduct of randomized controlled studies that will definitively answer the question of whether we can and whether we should extubate patients for whom the only obstacle to doing so is the administration of a low dose of norepinephrine.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1175MzeA]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

The objective of this study was to summarize the safety and efficacy of midodrine as an IV vasopressor weaning agent in the ICU from the totality of published literature while utilizing Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations and trial sequential analysis (TSA) to determine the certainty of the evidence.
Adjunctive midodrine may decrease ICU length of stay (LOS), IV vasopressor support duration, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality. The TSA-informed required sample size was not met for ICU LOS or IV vasopressor duration.
Midodrine administration in the ICU may serve to benefit patient-centered outcomes, although additional, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the routine use of midodrine as an adjunctive IV vasopressor weaning agent in the ICU.

Hemodynamic support with IV vasopressors is a common indication for ICU admission. Use of vasopressors contributes to approximately one-fourth of ICU admissions and one-fifth of ICU days. They are associated with adverse effects including tissue necrosis, cardiac dysfunction, and bowel ischemia. The presence of central venous catheters can lead to associated bloodstream infections, venous thrombosis, and impaired mobility. As patients recover, IV vasopressors may be their only indication for ICU admission. This may prolong their length of stay (LOS) and contribute to ICU strain.

While guidelines exist for IV vasopressors, no current guidance exists regarding use of oral therapies for vasopressor-dependent shock. There is limited data examining their role as IV vasopressor-sparing therapy. An effective oral adjunctive therapy could shorten the duration of IV vasopressors and liberate these patients earlier from the ICU. Midodrine-hydrochloride is a commonly used oral vasopressors and the alpha-agonist has previously been used to attenuate symptoms of orthostatic and intradialytic hypotension.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111tTVp6]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

LIMITATIONS AND STRENGTHS

We recognize several limitations of this systematic review. First, the included studies contain significant heterogeneity. In observational studies, the midodrine dosing regimens are inconsistent and the studies did not follow a previously established protocol. For RCTs, bias is shown with long recruitment periods and small sample size. We incorporated these factors into our GRADE ratings. Second, clinical heterogeneity existed between studies in setting, patient population, and outcome assessment. Specifically, midodrine was studied in different phases of shock, contributing to clinical heterogeneity across included studies. Any future large-scale study should focus on a particular phase of shock. There may also exist additional subgroups to be considered (e.g. type of initial vasopressor, etiology of shock, etc.). Unfortunately, it was not possible to evaluate these in our study; however, these should be considered in future study. Finally, studies did not routinely report on AEs such as ICU readmissions, which could possibly influence the utility of midodrine in the ICU. We also had several strengths, including use of the GRADE framework to evaluate the certainty of findings, and TSA to determine if the optimal information size was met. Finally, our review is the largest and most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of midodrine in critically ill patients to date, effectively evaluating the totality of published evidence.

### Essential ICU drug shortages for COVID-19: what can frontline clinicians do? [^115jrGyJ]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

It is not inconceivable that even alternative medications can run out, especially in regions that are already resource-limited. In such cases, non-pharmacologic or unconventional measures should be explored. For instance, analgesia may be attained through acupuncture, and anxiety can be alleviated with patient-directed music intervention. Another example is oral midodrine, which is currently being investigated as a means to wean critically ill patients from intravenous vasopressors. Drug shortages may compel clinicians to use oral midodrine as a sole agent for blood pressure augmentation. Physicians, nurses, and pharmacists would then need medicolegal protection when using therapies that are off-label, but that would be necessary for the well-being of patients.

### Effect of midodrine versus placebo on time to vasopressor discontinuation in patients with persistent hypotension in the intensive care unit (MIDAS): an international randomised clinical trial [^116yQWyA]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The study MIDAS was published by Peter Santer and colleagues in 2020 in the journal Intensive Care Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Critical illness, Sepsis and septic shock and Hypovolemic shock. In the MIDAS study, the trial question was: what is the role of midodrine on time to vasopressor discontinuation in patients with persistent hypotension in the ICU? In the MIDAS study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the MIDAS study, the population was: 132 patients (64 female, 68 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with hypotension requiring a single-agent intravenous vasopressor for ≥ 24 hours. The key exclusion criteria were clinical evidence of inadequate tissue oxygenation, hypovolemic shock or hypotension due to adrenal insufficiency, liver failure, chronic renal failure, severe organic heart disease, acute urinary retention, pheochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, bradycardia. In the MIDAS study, the interventions were: n = 66 midodrine (20 mg PO every 8 hours plus standard care) n = 66 placebo (matching placebo every 8 hours plus standard care). In the MIDAS study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in median time to discontinuation of vasopressors (23.5 hours vs. 22.5 hours; AD 1 hours, 95% CI -10.4 to 12.3). In the MIDAS study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in median time to ICU discharge readiness (5 days vs. 5 days;) No significant difference in median ICU length of stay (6 days vs. 6 days;) No significant difference in median hospital length of stay (11 days vs. 14 days; AD -3 days, 95% CI -6.3 to 0.3). In the MIDAS study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse event rates. significant difference in bradycardia (7.6% vs. 0%). In the MIDAS study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with hypotension requiring a single-agent intravenous vasopressor for ≥ 24 hours, midodrine was not superior to placebo with respect to median time to discontinuation of vasopressors.

Vasovagal syncope — midodrine: Four randomized trials on midodrine have shown a consistent risk reduction of approximately 70%; however, in a 23-patient study there was only an insignificant trend to benefit in 3-month exposure arms, and major limitations include the need for frequent dosing, effects on supine hypertension, and unknown teratogenic effects; caution is advised in older men due to potential urinary retention, and in the absence of compelling evidence, it seems reasonable to attempt therapy with midodrine for patients whose symptom severity merits it.

### Midodrine for the early liberation of vasopressor support in the ICU… [^1118EXte]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Vasopressors are medications that are given intravenously to increase the blood pressure of patients with illnesses that cause dangerous blood pressure drops. When a doctor prescribes a vasopressor, they ask that the dose be adjusted to achieve a specific blood pressure. This kind of medical support with intravenous vasopressors are usual treatments in intensive care unit settings. Oral vasopressors, such as midodrine, have been historically used to maintain blood pressure in non-critically ill patients. In this study, the investigators will be using midodrine to reduce the need for IV vasopressors as blood pressure improves during the stay in the ICU The LIBERATE pilot study will evaluate the role of midodrine for patients with low blood pressure in the ICU. The investigators are planning on enrolling up to 20 study participants to evaluate this question in the General Systems ICU at the University of Alberta Hospital.

Purpose: Resuscitation and hemodynamic support with intravenous vasopressors is a prime indication of treatment in intensive care unit settings. Hemodynamic support is typically provided with intravenous vasopressors. However, these have been shown to have significant negative effects including increased central venous catheter line associated infections, venous thromboembolic disease, impaired mobility and gastrointestinal injury and ischemia. In the environment strained healthcare resources and limited ICU capacity, the ability to safely wean patients from IV vasopressors with transition to oral hemodynamic supporting agents would greatly improve how patients navigate through the healthcare system. This in turn will improve patient-centered case. Primary Objective: To determine if recruitment for LIBERATE is achievable and feasible To compare the effect of enteral midodrine vs placebo on duration of vasopressor support.

Secondary Objective: To compare the effect of enteral midodrine vs. placebo on: ICU length of stay 90-day all-cause mortality Rate of re-initiation of IV vasopressors Rates of ICU re-admission Adverse events Research Method/Procedures: The LIBERATE Trial is a single centre, concealed-allocation parallel-group blinded pilot RCT. Patients will be randomly assigned to midodrine or placebo for the duration of their IV vasopressor therapy and 24h following the discontinuation of their IV vasopressor therapy.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^113WWJKe]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

ESC Guidelines — alpha-agonist vasoconstrictors for reflex syncope show mixed evidence: etilefrine showed no difference versus placebo in acute tilt and during follow-up with 25 mg twice daily, while a single dose of midodrine 1 h before tilt testing significantly reduced syncope during tilt; midodrine has been tested in three small open label randomized trials in patients with very frequent 'hypotensive' symptoms (> 1 syncope/month), but frequent dosing limits long-term compliance and caution is needed in older males due to urinary outflow effects; overall, chronic treatment with α-agonists alone may be of little use and long-term treatment cannot be advised for occasional symptoms, though a self-administered single dose 'pill-in the pocket' strategy at least 1 h before a typical trigger may be useful in selected patients.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1161UXQK]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Should adjuvant oral therapies improve patient outcomes like ICU LOS, these results could serve to inform practice guidelines pertaining to vasopressor-dependent shock. Decreasing ICU LOS would increase capacity and decrease ICU strain, it would also ensure that critically ill patients could receive care in the most appropriate setting. Previous studies have suggested that increasing turnover in the ICU is crucial, allowing earlier exposure to interventions in the ICU capable of influencing patient outcomes. Additionally, during times of decreased bed availability ICUs are forced to ration resources, however, those refused admission based on perceived need are then met with an increased risk of death while in hospital. An adjunctive therapy, such as midodrine for IV vasopressor-dependent shock, could potentially improve patient disposition, and ensure that ICU capacity is maintained for those that require this level of care.

### 2015 Heart Rhythm Society expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of postural tachycardia syndrome, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and vasovagal syncope [^1124wmq8]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) — "Nonpharmacologic treatments should be attempted first with all patients" and include withdrawing medications that might worsen POTS, enhanced salt and fluid intake, compression garments, and limiting deconditioning; for suspected hypovolemia, patients "should drink at least 2–3 L of water per day, and dietary salt intake should be increased to approximately 10–12 g/day". Exercise is advised with a "regular, structured, graduated, and supervised exercise program", and initially "exercise should be restricted to non-upright exercises". For rescue volume expansion, "1 L of normal saline infused over 1 hour decreases orthostatic tachycardia and improves symptoms for several hours to 2 days"; although not trial-tested, "this approach is recommended as rescue therapy", whereas "Long-term infusions of intravenous saline are not recommended for routine care". To reduce tachycardia and palpitations, "low-dose propranolol (10–20 mg PO) acutely lowers standing heart rate", while higher doses are less tolerated; ivabradine may help, with "Approximately 60% of patients with POTS treated with ivabradine in an open-label study" showing symptom improvement. For cholinergic augmentation, "Pyridostigmine is a peripheral acetylcholinesterase inhibitor", and "The drug blunts orthostatic tachycardia and can improve chronic symptoms but is limited by adverse effects such as diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramps, nausea, and increased urinary urgency and frequency". For venous return and vasoconstriction, midodrine "significantly reduces orthostatic tachycardia but to a lesser degree than intravenous saline" and "should be administered 3 times daily", with dosing "only… during daytime hours" due to supine hypertension risk.

### Vasopressin and its analogues in patients with septic shock: holy grail or unfulfilled promise? [^113o8KHd]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Gaps in knowledge

The SSC guidelines suggest initiating vasopressin as second-line vasopressor in patients who require doses of norepinephrine base > 0.25–0.50 µg/kg/min, after excluding persistent hypovolemia and cardiac dysfunction. However, several issues remain to be clarified and represent future areas of research to optimize and personalize the use of vasopressin and to better identify the subgroups of patients likely to benefit most from its use (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
Future areas of research on the use of vasopressin and its analogues in patients with septic shock. First, a better identification of subgroups of patients likely to benefit most from vasopressin administration. Second, the management of vasopressin administration (time to initiation, optimal doses, weaning strategy). Third, the development of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven algorithms to personalize strategies and improve patient outcomes. Fourth, to better define the place of the analogues in the management of patients with septic shock

How to identify patients who could benefit from vasopressin?

Only a third of patients with septic shock experience vasopressin deficiency and responsiveness to vasopressin is correlated with survival. Identifying patients likely to benefit from vasopressin supplementation is therefore a crucial issue, which remains a challenge to this day, even with machine learning algorithms. Measuring blood vasopressin concentration remains technically challenging because of its short half-life, but copeptin, secreted in quantities equimolar to vasopressin, could be a surrogate marker. Dynamic tests, such as hypertonic saline infusion (5% hypertonic saline at 0.06mL/kg/min over two hours via a central venous catheter), could assess the osmoregulatory response and help distinguish patients with septic shock with or without increase in blood vasopressin concentration in relation to an increase in blood sodium concentration. The hypertonic saline-stimulated copeptin test may be more effective than the arginine stimulation test in diagnosing vasopressin deficiency, but it remains unclear whether static or dynamic tests of the vasopressin axis will help identify patients with septic shock and vasopressin deficiency.

An alternative approach would be to sequence patients' single nucleotide polymorphisms to determine which vasopressor would be most appropriate, given the polymorphic variability of the adrenergic or vasopressin receptors. However, the delay in direct sequencing prevents this approach from being used in routine care.

### Midodrine as adjunctive support for treatment of refractory hypotension in the intensive care unit: a multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled trial (the MIDAS trial) [^113DzDHF]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This article presents the protocol and data analysis plan for the MIDAS trial; an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the addition of midodrine to IV vasopressor treatment in otherwise stable ICU patients.

Midodrine, an oral alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, was approved for the treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension under the United States FDA's accelerated approval regulations in 1996. In August 2010, the FDA proposed to withdraw approval because of the lack of post-approval studies that confirm the clinical benefit of the drug. It was the first time the agency had issued such a notice. Subsequent to support for its use from patients, doctors and professional organizations, the FDA reversed its decision to withdraw approval, but this decision was met with mixed response.

Over recent years, there has been increasing interest in using midodrine to help patients wean off or avoid IV vasopressors. The drug has a reasonable safety profile, its main side effects being pilomotor reaction, urinary retention, and supine hypertension. The use of an oral vasopressor such as midodrine in addition to IV vasopressors in otherwise resuscitated and stable ICU patients has several reasons for attractiveness. Firstly, it helps to avoid some of the potential complications of administering IV vasopressors, such as risks of central line insertion and catheter-related bloodstream infections. Secondly, they may help to shorten the duration of IV vasopressor treatment, and hence reduce ICU length of stay and ICU-acquired complications. This has significant cost implications for the patient and hospital.

We communicated directly with the United States FDA and obtained IND approval to study the use of midodrine in the ICU setting. In our pilot observational study, we detected that midodrine treatment was associated with an increase in the magnitude of decline of the IV vasopressor rate. This pilot study offered promising data, but was limited in its small sample size (20 patients) and lack of a control group. We designed the MIDAS trial as a pragmatic clinical trial to study its use in routine patient care conditions. We have designed the inclusion and exclusion criteria so they can be applied to a broad clinical setting across a wide range of patients. We hope to improve the generalizability of our results by carrying out the study in a multicentric design.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^114cQa9V]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Vaptans

Vaptans are vasopressin antagonists that competitively bind and block the V2-receptors of arginine vasopressin in the renal collecting ducts and induce a highly hypotonic diuresis without affecting the excretion of electrolytes. In three RCTs involving 1200 patients, satavaptan was no more effective than placebo in controlling ascites and need for LVPs, though it improved serum sodium concentration in those with hyponatraemia. Two of the studies were terminated owing to an increase in serum bilirubin, higher mortality (31% vs 22%), mostly due to increased cirrhosis complications and other adverse events. Two meta-analyseson vaptans in cirrhosis reported improved serum sodium levels and ascites mobilisation, but without a beneficial effect on cirrhosis-related complications or mortality (RR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.26). Current evidence does not support routine use of vaptans in cirrhosis.

Midodrine

Portal hypertension and splanchnic vasodilatation are major contributors to the development of ascites. In fact, mean arterial pressure and plasma norepinephrine are two of the best predictors of prognosis in ascites. Therefore, vasopressors such as midodrine, an α-adrenergic agonist, have been used in non-azotemic patients with ascites, resulting in significant increase in mean arterial pressure and urine sodium excretion and significant decreases in plasma renin and aldosterone.

A small RCT in patients with refractory ascites (midodrine 7.5 mg three times a day vs standard medical therapy) showed that at 3 months 94% versus 50% had a complete/partial ascites control, with a trend for a survival benefit in the midodrine group. In another small RCT (midodrine vs placebo), significant reduction in body weight and abdominal girth was observed after 2 weeks of midodrine therapy. Though larger RCTs are needed to confirm these findings, it may be appropriate to consider use of midodrine in refractory ascites on a case-by-case basis.

ICU Length of Stay

When compared with IV vasopressors alone, adjunctive midodrine may decrease ICU LOS (mean difference [MD], 1.01 d less [95% CI, 2.23 d less to 0.22 d more]; low certainty) (Fig. 2 A), while the pooled data from observational studies was of very low certainty (MD, 0.22 d more [95% CI, 1.45 d less to 1.90 d more]; very low certainty) (Fig. 2 B). In TSA of ICU LOS, the optimal information size (n = 1124) has not been reached despite the trend toward favoring midodrine (Fig. 3 A).

Hospital Length of Stay

Midodrine has a very low certainty of effect on hospital LOS (MD, 1.10 d less [95% CI, 3.69 d less to 1.49 d more]; very low certainty) (Fig. 2 C) with similar findings from pooled observational studies (MD, 1.68 d more [95% CI, 3.40 d less to 6.77 d more]; very low certainty) (Fig. 2 D).

Duration of IV Vasopressor Support

Midodrine may decrease vasopressor support duration (MD, 19.66 hr less [95% CI, 37.87 hr less to 1.46 hr less]; low certainty) (Fig. 4 A), although the evidence from pooled observational data was of very low certainty (MD, 0.07 hr less [95% CI, 26.32 hr less to 26.18 hr more]; very low certainty) (Fig. 4 B). TSA of vasopressor duration showed that the optimal information size (n = 688) was not met (Fig. 3 B).

### Midodrine as adjunctive support for treatment of refractory hypotension in the intensive care unit: a multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled trial (the MIDAS trial) [^114WqcMr]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) are often treated with intravenous (IV) vasopressors. Persistent hypotension and dependence on IV vasopressors in otherwise resuscitated patients lead to delay in discharge from ICU. Midodrine is an oral alpha-1 adrenergic agonist approved for treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. This trial aims to evaluate whether oral administration of midodrine is an effective adjunct to standard therapy to reduce the duration of IV vasopressor treatment, and allow earlier discharge from ICU and hospital.

Methods

The MIDAS trial is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial being conducted in the USA and Australia. We are targeting 120 patients. Adult patients admitted to the ICU who are resuscitated and otherwise stable on low dose IV vasopressors for at least 24 h will be considered for recruitment. Participants will be randomized to receive midodrine (20 mg) or placebo three times a day, in addition to standard care. The primary outcome is time (hours) from initiation of midodrine or placebo to discontinuation of IV vasopressors. Secondary outcomes include time (hours) from ICU admission to discharge readiness, ICU length of stay (LOS) (days), hospital LOS (days), rates of ICU readmission, and rates of adverse events related to midodrine administration.

Discussion

Midodrine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. In August 2010, FDA proposed to withdraw approval of midodrine because of lack of studies that verify the clinical benefit of the drug. We obtained Investigational New Drug (IND 113,330) approval to study its effects in critically ill patients who require IV vasopressors but are otherwise ready for discharge from the ICU. A pilot observational study in a cohort of surgical ICU patients showed that the rate of decline in vasopressor requirements increased after initiation of midodrine treatment. We hypothesize that midodrine administration is effective to wean IV vasopressors and shorten ICU and hospital LOS. This trial may have significant implications on lowering costs of hospital care and obtaining FDA approval for new indications for midodrine.

Trial Registration

This study has been registered at clinicaltrials.gov on 02/09/2012 (NCT01531959).

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114b11wy]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Data Analysis

We evaluated data from observational studies and RCTs separately in keeping with Cochrane guidance. We present continuous data using means and, and as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, both with 95% CIs. For studies that did not report mean andfor continuous outcomes, we used methods for transformation as recommended by the Cochrane handbook for systematic review. We performed all meta-analyses using RevMan V.5.4 software (Copenhagen, Denmark: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration, 2014) using the method of DerSimonian and Laird to pool effect sizes for each outcome using a random-effects model and inverse variance weighting. Studies published as abstract only were excluded from pooled analysis. We assessed for statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic, the chi-square test for homogeneity (p < 0.1 for significance of substantial heterogeneity), and visual inspection of the forest plots. For the presentation of results, we have primarily focused on the pooled data with a higher certainty of evidence. We performed subgroup analysis comparing patients with septic shock to those with shock from an alternative etiology. Sensitivity analysis was performed for included studies specifically for their impact on heterogeneity.

Trial Sequential Analysis

We conducted TSA using a random-effects model for ICU LOS and duration of IV vasopressor therapy. For the TSA, we used a statistical significance level of 5%, a power of 80%, and an RR reduction of 10% to represent a clinically important difference. We used a model variance-based heterogeneity correction and performed analysis using TSA V.0.9.5.10 beta software (Copenhagen Trial Unit, Centre for Clinical Intervention Research, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark).

### The impact of midodrine tapering versus nontapering regimens on the clinical outcomes of critically ill patients: a retrospective cohort study [^113cnEdp]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Midodrine has been used in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting to reduce the time to vasopressor discontinuation. The limited data supporting midodrine use have led to variability in the pattern of initiation and discontinuation of midodrine.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness and safety of 2 midodrine discontinuation regimens during weaning vasopressors in critically ill patients.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted at King Abdulaziz Medical City. Included patients were adults admitted to ICU who received midodrine after being unable to be weaned from intravenous vasopressors for more than 24 hours. Patients were categorized into two subgroups depending on the pattern of midodrine discontinuation (tapered dosing regimen vs. nontapered regimen). The primary endpoint was the incidence of inotropes and vasopressors re-initiation after midodrine discontinuation.

Results

The incidence of inotropes or vasopressors' re-initiation after discontinuation of midodrine was lower in the tapering group (15.4%) compared with the non-tapering group (40.7%) in the crude analysis as well as regression analysis (odd ratio [OR] = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.03, 0.73, P = 0.02). The time required for the antihypertensive medication(s) initiation after midodrine discontinuation was longer in patients who had dose tapering (beta coefficient (95% CI): 3.11 (0.95, 5.28), P = 0.005). Moreover, inotrope or vasopressor requirement was lower 24 hours post midodrine initiation. In contrast, the two groups had no statistically significant differences in 30-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, or ICU length of stay.

Conclusion and Relevance

These real-life data showed that tapering midodrine dosage before discontinuation in critically ill patients during weaning from vasopressor aids in reducing the frequency of inotrope or vasopressor re-initiation. Application of such a strategy might be a reasonable approach among ICU patients unless contraindicated.

### Response to "Weaning order of vasoactive drugs" [^116dakti]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

We thank Drs Michels and Trevisol for their thoughtful comments regarding our recent randomized controlled trial on the incidence of hypotension while tapering vasopressors in patients on concomitant norepinephrine (NE) and vasopressin (AVP) recovering from septic shock.

We understand their concern that the rapid taper rates of NE in our study could have influenced the hemodynamic tolerance to the vasoactive drug tapering. As they stated in their letter, this could be supported by the fact that the median time to hypotension after tapering vasopressor was shorter in the NE-tapered-first group (2.0 (1.2–2.5) h) than the AVP-tapered-first group (4.3 (2.5–5.1) h). In this study, because we tried to taper the same relative amount of both vasopressors (33%), we ended up decreasing NE by 0.1 μg/kg/min which is a relatively large dose compared with conventional doses of 2–5 μg/min. However, the best method of weaning NE including magnitude as well as time interval is not established and should be a subject for future studies.

Drs Michels and Trevisol seem to have a misunderstanding about Table 3 in our original manuscript, which compares clinical characteristics of the subgroup of patients with hypotension according to which vasopressor was tapered immediately before developing the primary outcome, regardless of treatment allocation. The hospital mortality in patients developing hypotension after NE tapering was 46.5%, not 58.97%. The high hospital mortality seen in these patients despite a short duration of vasopressor support until study inclusion may be due to the fact that, at inclusion, these patients were still severely ill patients with severe shock needing support by two pressors at high doses. Also, intensive care unit (ICU) mortality was 28.3%, which suggests that at least some of the patients (15.2%) died after patients were transferred to the general ward, presumably due to his or her underlying conditions and not due to the episode of septic shock that brought them to the ICU. The duration from the maximum dose of NE to the initiation of intervention could have provided more information on patient characteristics. Unfortunately, these data could not be extracted from our case report forms.

### Midodrine as adjunctive support for treatment of refractory hypotension in the intensive care unit: a multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled trial (the MIDAS trial) [^113yratZ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Cardenas et al. reported on the use of midodrine to wean requirement of IV vasopressors in a medical ICU population. During a six month period, 50 patients who met discharge criteria except for the use of low to moderate dose of a single IV vasopressor were administered oral midodrine (average initial and maximal doses 30.5 mg and 66.6 mg per day). Midodrine was continued on the ward and reduced as tolerated by the admitting team. No adverse effects were observed. In this study, 27 (54%) of the patients were discharged from the hospital on midodrine (average dose 17.8 mg per day). Another recent retrospective study from a medical ICU included 275 patients over one year, with a diagnosis of septic shock and required at least 24 h of IV vasopressors, who were stable or on reducing doses of IV vasopressors. The authors compared patients on IV vasopressors only to those who received IV vasopressors plus adjunctive midodrine (with a starting dose of 10 mg TDS) and showed a reduction in the mean IV vasopressor duration (2.9 days versus 3.8 days, p < 0.001) and reduced ICU length of stay (7.5 versus 9.4 days, p = 0.017) in the IV vasopressor plus midodrine group.

There are also a case report and two case series of the use of midodrine to wean from or prevent the need for IV vasopressors. O'Donnell reported on the use of midodrine 10 mg TDS to wean a patient from noradrenaline infusion post C7 to T6 laminectomy for spinal cord compression secondary to a leukemic deposit. Sharma reported the use of oral midodrine 10 mg TDS to wean IV dopamine infusions in three patients with hypotension secondary to myocardial stunning post percutaneous coronary intervention. Sharma also reported on the use of oral midodrine for hypotension post carotid artery stenting. Four patients with persistent hypotension post carotid artery stenting were successfully treated with midodrine 10 mg TDS, avoiding the requirement for ICU admission (the preceding 11 cases required IV dopamine infusions in ICU).

### The use of vasoconstrictors in patients with cirrhosis: type 1 HRS and beyond [^116cVF3c]. Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

In patients with cirrhosis and type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), systemic vasodilation, which is mainly attributable to splanchnic vasodilation, plays a critical role in the activation of endogenous vasoconstrictor systems, resulting in renal vasoconstriction and functional renal failure. It has been suggested that the use of splanchnic (and systemic) vasoconstrictors such as terlipressin (a vasopressin analog) or alpha-1-adrenoceptor agonists (midodrine or noradrenaline) may improve renal function in patients with type 1 HRS. Six studies (with only one randomized study in a small series of patients) have shown that terlipressin improves renal function in these patients. However, there is evidence that terlipressin alone may be less effective than terlipressin combined with intravenous albumin in improving renal function. Future randomized studies should confirm this difference and evaluate the impact of terlipressin therapy (with or without intravenous albumin) on survival. Interestingly, in nonrandomized studies, the use of alpha-1 agonists combined with other therapies (octreotide and albumin for midodrine; furosemide and albumin for noradrenaline) has been shown to improve renal function in patients with type 1 HRS. The efficacy and safety of combined therapies including alpha-1 agonists should be confirmed in randomized studies. Finally, preliminary evidence suggests that vasoconstrictor administration may be a novel therapeutic approach targeting vasodilation involved in the mechanism of: (1) renal failure in type 2 HRS; (2) paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction; and (3) arterial hypotension induced by byproducts of gram-negative bacteria. Further studies are needed in all these fields.

### The impact of midodrine on outcomes in patients with intradialytic hypotension [^1112zuaF]. American Journal of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a frequent complication of hemodialysis, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Off-label use of the alpha-1 andrenergic receptor agonist midodrine to reduce the frequency and severity of IDH is common. However, limited data exist to support this practice. This study sought to examine real-world efficacy of midodrine with respect to relevant clinical and hemodynamic outcomes.

Methods

Here, we compared a variety of clinical and hemodynamic outcomes among adult patients who were prescribed midodrine (n = 1,046) and matched controls (n = 2,037), all of whom were receiving in-center hemodialysis treatment at dialysis facilities in the United States (July 2015 - September 2016). Mortality, all-cause hospitalization, cardiovascular hospitalization, and hemodynamic outcomes were considered from the month following the initiation of midodrine (or corresponding month for controls) until censoring for discontinuation of dialysis, transplant, loss to follow-up, or study end (September 30, 2016). Rate outcomes were compared using Poisson models and quantitative outcomes using linear mixed models; all models were adjusted for imbalanced patient characteristics.

Results

Compared to non-use, midodrine use was associated with higher rates of death (adjusted incidence rate ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.15–1.62), all-cause hospitalization (1.31, 1.19–1.43) and cardiovascular hospitalization (1.41, 1.17–1.71). During follow-up, midodrine use tended to be associated with lower pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure (SBP), lower nadir SBP, greater fall in SBP during dialysis, and a greater proportion of treatments affected by IDH.

Conclusion

Although residual confounding may have influenced the results, the associations observed here are not consistent with a potent beneficial effect of midodrine with respect to either clinical or hemodynamic outcomes.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112U5idc]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A recently published meta-analysis found that midodrine was not associated with a decrease in ICU LOS, hospital LOS, mortality, or ICU readmissions, although five of six studies included were retrospective cohort studies, thus limiting the ability to form conclusions given the increased risk of bias. Furthermore, the studies included were found to be low quality, having not employed defined dosing protocols, with considerable heterogeneity between the included patients and outcomes reported. This previous review did not evaluate the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE framework or use TSA. In our systematic review, the use of the TSA and GRADE framework for summarizing the evidence highlighted the limitations of previous research.

Further study of adjunctive midodrine for vasopressor weaning is necessary to provide clarity to an increasingly inconclusive practice. This systematic review and meta-analysis provides low certainty evidence supporting that midodrine may reduce ICO LOS and time on IV vasopressors. However, adequate sample size was not reached when pooling results from the included studies as per our TSA. Additionally, increased risk of AEs, specifically bradycardia, with midodrine was found. Off-label use of midodrine in the critical care setting is a relatively common practice, as evidenced by the studies consolidated for this systematic review. This off-label use remains inconsistent in the timing of midodrine administration, dosing regimens, and discontinuation practices. Current evidence shows that adjunctive midodrine may be beneficial in terms of patient-centered outcomes when used as an oral vasopressor weaning agent. To this end, and considering midodrine may be associated with increased risk of AEs such as bradycardia, further study will be required to guide routine use of midodrine in critically ill patients and to determine if there is clinical merit to its application in the ICU. Until a definitive recommendation can be made, use of midodrine in the ICU should be undertaken based on shared decision-making between the provider and patient in the context of their own specific values, or that of the family, and the understanding that the medication is being used off-label.
