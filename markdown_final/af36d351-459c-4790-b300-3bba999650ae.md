## Question

What's is tranexamic acid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what tranexamic acid is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about its pharmacologic identity and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify the core clinical indications and the strength of evidence, especially for trauma and postpartum hemorrhage. Next, I will review dosing, timing, and routes of administration. After that, I need to check safety, contraindications, and special populations. Finally, I will consider practical pearls, controversies, and a concise synthesis that ties mechanism to outcomes and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic identity and mechanism. Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine analog that competitively binds lysine-binding sites on plasminogen, preventing plasminogen from binding to fibrin and thereby inhibiting fibrinolysis; this stabilizes preformed clots without directly activating coagulation, which is a key distinction I should emphasize to avoid overcalling it a procoagulant [^113PbLWx] [^115tcgqk]. Wait, let me verify tissue persistence and pharmacodynamics: antifibrinolytic concentrations persist in tissues for roughly 17 hours and in serum for 7–8 hours, which helps explain sustained clinical effects beyond the plasma half-life, and at therapeutic concentrations it does not meaningfully alter platelet count or coagulation factor assays, which reassures me about its selectivity for fibrinolysis [^113PbLWx].

> Next, I should review the core clinical indications and the strength of evidence. The most robust data are in trauma and postpartum hemorrhage: CRASH-2 showed that early intravenous tranexamic acid reduced all-cause mortality in bleeding trauma patients, with the clearest benefit when given within 3 hours of injury, and WOMAN demonstrated a reduction in death due to bleeding in women with postpartum hemorrhage when given within 3 hours of birth, which aligns with a time-sensitive antifibrinolytic mechanism [^115yiout] [^112j8Nbc]. Hold on, I should verify the timing signal in trauma: exploratory analyses suggest the mortality benefit is greatest when administered within 1 hour and may wane after 3 hours, with potential harm if delayed beyond 3 hours, reinforcing the need for early administration in appropriate patients [^114JNk6E] [^112kzTTB].

> I will now examine perioperative and gynecologic applications. In total joint arthroplasty, multiple high-quality studies and guidelines support that intravenous, topical, or oral tranexamic acid reduces calculated blood loss and transfusion requirements without increasing thromboembolic events, and single-dose regimens are generally sufficient, with no clear advantage to multiple doses in primary procedures, which is useful for streamlining protocols [^115e1nk1] [^111JXRhs]. For heavy menstrual bleeding, oral tranexamic acid is effective at reducing menstrual blood loss and improving quality of life, and it is a reasonable nonhormonal option when hormonal therapy is undesirable or contraindicated, though I should confirm renal dosing and cycle-limited use to mitigate risk [^116ZmAGD] [^115EEs4y].

> Let me consider dosing, timing, and routes of administration across settings. Standard adult trauma dosing is 1 gram IV over 10 minutes followed by 1 gram infused over 8 hours, ideally initiated as early as possible and within 3 hours of injury; prehospital administration is supported by multiple guidelines and has shown safety, with subgroup signals of benefit when given very early, though overall functional outcomes in PATCH-Trauma were neutral, so I should be careful not to overgeneralize beyond mortality signals [^1117ayBp] [^113BvsHj] [^116mAGwJ]. For postpartum hemorrhage, 1 gram IV with a second dose if bleeding continues is standard, again emphasizing early administration; for heavy menstrual bleeding, oral regimens typically use 1300 mg twice daily for up to 5 days during menses, with renal dose adjustments as needed [^112j8Nbc]. I should double-check the dental indication: in hemophilia undergoing tooth extraction, 10 mg/kg IV before extraction and 10 mg/kg every 6–8 hours for 2–8 days afterward is recommended, with slow infusion to avoid hypotension [^114tbPY8].

> Now, safety and contraindications require careful verification. Overall, tranexamic acid is well tolerated; major safety concerns include dose-related seizures, particularly with high IV doses or in renal impairment, and a theoretical thrombotic risk that has not manifested consistently in randomized trials of bleeding patients, though vigilance is prudent in patients with active thromboembolic disease or on prothrombotic agents [^114jCCE8] [^111BAa2E]. Wait, I should confirm the renal dosing guidance: dose reduction is recommended in moderate to severe renal impairment because clearance is predominantly renal and accumulation increases exposure, so I need to ensure creatinine-based adjustments are applied in practice [^112ZvvgF]. I also need to check for medication errors: tranexamic acid must not be administered intrathecally; there are repeated FDA warnings about inadvertent neuraxial administration causing seizures, arrhythmias, and permanent neurologic injury, so storage and labeling separation from local anesthetics are critical [^11786PKE] [^111L8mLY].

> Let me review special populations and pregnancy considerations. In pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period, tranexamic acid is considered acceptable for treatment of postpartum hemorrhage and crosses the placenta with cord levels approximating maternal levels; animal data do not show teratogenicity, but human first-trimester data are limited, so risk–benefit assessment is essential when considering use outside the immediate postpartum window [^1141eDW9]. For pediatrics, evidence is extrapolated from adult trauma and perioperative data; while pediatric trauma RCTs are limited, perioperative pediatric use has shown reductions in transfusion without clear safety signals, but I should confirm institutional protocols and weight-based dosing before recommending routine use [^1172wLL1].

> Next, I should review practical pearls and controversies. Early administration is the most consistent predictor of benefit in trauma and postpartum hemorrhage, and delays beyond 3 hours may blunt or negate benefit, so systems that enable rapid identification and treatment are crucial; conversely, routine prophylaxis for all births is not supported by current high-quality evidence, with WOMAN-2 showing no reduction in clinically diagnosed postpartum hemorrhage in women with moderate to severe anemia given prophylactic tranexamic acid, underscoring that treatment, not blanket prophylaxis, is where benefit lies [^114JNk6E] [^111EoMYm]. But wait, what if the patient has suspected fibrinolytic shutdown in trauma? Observational data suggest potential harm in shutdown phenotypes, yet current European trauma guidelines still recommend early tranexamic acid without waiting for viscoelastic testing, so I should individualize and avoid late administration rather than withholding indicated early therapy [^113vt5je] [^113cDKYz].

> I should also confirm the role in gastrointestinal bleeding and intracerebral hemorrhage. Evidence in upper gastrointestinal bleeding is mixed and heterogeneous, with some meta-analyses suggesting reduced rebleeding and mortality, but concerns about thrombotic risk in cirrhosis and lack of consistent high-quality data mean tranexamic acid should not be routine for GI bleeding outside trials or specific protocols; similarly, TICH-2 did not show a mortality benefit in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, so use remains investigational in that context [^111f1dAK] [^112vnCc6] [^113W2UQY]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while antifibrinolysis is mechanistically attractive in hyperfibrinolytic states, patient selection and timing likely modulate any benefit, which explains the discordant results across settings [^112vnCc6].

> Finally, I will synthesize a concise clinical definition. Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine-analog antifibrinolytic that stabilizes fibrin by inhibiting plasminogen–fibrin binding, thereby reducing bleeding without directly activating coagulation; it is best supported for early treatment of traumatic hemorrhage and postpartum hemorrhage, reduces transfusion needs in major orthopedic surgery, and is effective for heavy menstrual bleeding, with safety generally favorable but requiring attention to dose, renal function, and avoidance of neuraxial administration; early use is the key modifier of benefit, and routine prophylaxis outside defined surgical contexts is not supported by current high-quality evidence [^113PbLWx] [^115yiout] [^112j8Nbc] [^115e1nk1] [^116ZmAGD] [^11786PKE] [^111EoMYm].

---

Tranexamic acid is a **synthetic antifibrinolytic** that competitively inhibits plasminogen activation, stabilizing fibrin clots and reducing bleeding [^113PbLWx]. It is **first-line for postpartum hemorrhage** [^112j8Nbc], reduces mortality in trauma when given within 3 hours [^112kzTTB], and lowers transfusion needs in surgery [^113u76rm]. Common adverse effects are gastrointestinal symptoms and dizziness; seizures can occur at high doses, especially with renal impairment [^114jCCE8]. It is contraindicated in active thromboembolism, severe renal failure, and hypersensitivity; dose adjust for renal impairment and avoid intrathecal administration [^112ZvvgF] [^11786PKE].

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: Competitive inhibition of plasminogen activation, preventing fibrin degradation and stabilizing clots [^115tcgqk].

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Rapid IV distribution (Vd ~9–12 L); minimal protein binding (~3%); terminal half-life ~2 h; ~90% excreted unchanged in urine [^112ZvvgF].

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Antifibrinolytic effect persists ~17 h in tissues and ~7–8 h in serum; does not affect platelet count or coagulation factors at therapeutic levels [^113PbLWx].

---

## Clinical indications

| **Indication** | **Clinical context** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Postpartum hemorrhage | Treatment of established PPH | High (WOMAN trial) [^112j8Nbc] |
| Trauma | Significant hemorrhage within 3 hours of injury | High (CRASH-2) [^114JNk6E] |
| Surgical bleeding | Perioperative reduction of blood loss and transfusion | High (multiple RCTs) [^113u76rm] |
| Heavy menstrual bleeding | Oral therapy for menorrhagia | Moderate (RCTs) [^116ZmAGD] |
| Hemophilia | Short-term use around tooth extraction | High (FDA-approved) [^115YBAXY] |

---

## Clinical efficacy

- **Postpartum hemorrhage**: Reduces death due to bleeding by ~19% when given within 3 hours; WHO first-line recommendation [^11416vD9].

- **Trauma**: Reduces all-cause mortality by ~9% and bleeding deaths by ~15% when administered within 3 hours; benefit diminishes and may reverse if delayed [^115yiout] [^114JNk6E].

- **Surgical bleeding**: Consistently reduces blood loss and transfusion requirements across orthopedic, cardiac, and other surgeries [^113u76rm] [^115e1nk1].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Common adverse effects**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache.

- **Serious adverse effects**: Seizures (dose-related, higher risk with renal impairment) [^114jCCE8].

- **Thromboembolic risk**: No significant increase in venous or arterial thrombosis in major trials, but caution is advised in patients with thromboembolic disease [^111BAa2E] [^1158g4vg].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **active thromboembolic disease**, **severe renal failure**, and **hypersensitivity to tranexamic acid**. Precautions include **renal impairment** (dose adjustment required) [^112ZvvgF], **history of seizures**, and **concomitant prothrombotic medications** [^111B4bt5].

---

## Dosage and administration

- **Postpartum hemorrhage**: 1 g IV over 10 minutes; repeat once if bleeding continues after 30 minutes [^112j8Nbc].

- **Trauma**: 1 g IV over 10 minutes, followed by 1 g IV over 8 hours; administer within 3 hours of injury [^115yiout].

- **Surgical bleeding**: Typically 1–2 g IV before incision; topical or oral formulations may be used depending on procedure [^113u76rm] [^115e1nk1].

- **Heavy menstrual bleeding**: 1300 mg orally three times daily for up to 5 days during menstruation [^116ZmAGD].

---

## Special populations

In renal impairment, **dose adjustment is required** based on creatinine clearance [^notfound]. In pregnancy, it is considered safe and is recommended by WHO for PPH treatment [^111z8MHS]. In pediatrics, evidence is limited; use is extrapolated from adult data with caution.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

WHO recommends tranexamic acid as **first-line treatment for PPH** [^112j8Nbc]. The **EAST guidelines** recommend early tranexamic acid in trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock [^1133rVEN]. The **AAOS guidelines** recommend tranexamic acid to reduce blood loss and transfusion in total joint arthroplasty [^115e1nk1].

---

Tranexamic acid is a **well-established antifibrinolytic** with broad indications, strong efficacy in PPH and trauma, and a favorable safety profile when used appropriately. Early administration and adherence to guidelines maximize benefit and minimize risks.

### When to use tranexamic acid for the treatment of major bleeding? [^112vnCc6]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic agent originally developed for the management of bleeding in the setting of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Over the last 15 years, there has been accumulating evidence on the use of TXA for the treatment of active bleeding in a variety of clinical contexts. Clinical trials have shown that the efficacy and safety of TXA for the treatment of bleeding differ according to the clinical context in which it is being administered, timing of administration, and dose. Early administration is important for efficacy, particularly in trauma and PPH. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms by which TXA provides benefit, optimal modes of administration and dosing, and its effect in some clinical settings, such as spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. There is no evidence that TXA increases the risk of thrombotic events in patients with major bleeding overall. However, there is evidence of increased risk of venous thrombosis in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. There is also evidence of increased risk of seizures with the use of higher doses. This review summarizes the current evidence for the use of TXA for patients with active bleeding and highlights the importance of generating evidence of efficacy and safety of hemostatic interventions specific to the bleeding contexts-as findings from 1 clinical setting may not be generalizable to other contexts-and that of individual patient assessment for bleeding, thrombotic, and other risks, as well as important logistical and other practical considerations, to optimize care and outcomes in these settings.

### Tranexamic acid – A narrative review for the emergency medicine clinician [^113S96By]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over the last decade, tranexamic acid (TXA) has been incorporated into treatment algorithms for a multitude of emergent conditions and the evidence surrounding its role in emergency medicine continues to evolve.

Objective

The objective of this literature review is to provide an evidence-based approach to the utilization of TXA in the emergency department.

Discussion

The most robust trials suggest TXA may offer a modest improvement in mortality in patients at risk of significant bleeding from trauma, but is not beneficial in spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding. The role of TXA in other clinical scenarios is less clear and requires clinical judgment.

Conclusion

Tranexamic acid appears to be a reasonable adjunct for the emergency medicine clinician to consider in the management of many hemorrhagic conditions and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema. Additional high-quality research in these areas is needed to further identity patients who may benefit most from TXA.

### Tranexamic acid for postpartum bleeding: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1153KMPp]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid is a recommended treatment for women with a clinical diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage, but whether it can prevent bleeding is unclear. We conducted a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials to assess the effects of tranexamic acid in women giving birth.

Methods

In this systematic review and IPD meta-analysis, we searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to Aug 4, 2024 for randomised trials that assessed the effects of tranexamic acid in women giving birth. Trials were eligible if they were prospectively registered, placebo-controlled, included more than 500 women, and had a low risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. IPD were requested from the trial investigators. The primary outcomes were the numbers of women with life-threatening bleeding and thromboembolic events. We used a one-stage model to analyse the data and explored whether the effect of tranexamic acid varied by the underlying risk of life-threatening bleeding, type of birth, presence of moderate or severe anaemia, or timing of administration (before or after a diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage). This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022345775.

Findings

We analysed data on 54404 women from five trials. We obtained IPD for 43409 women from four trials and aggregate data on 10995 women from one trial. All trials had a low risk of bias. Life-threatening bleeding occurred in 178 (0.65%) of 27300 women in the tranexamic acid group versus 230 (0.85%) of 27093 women in the placebo group (pooled odds ratio [OR] 0.77 [95% CI 0.63–0.93]; p = 0.008). There was no evidence that the effect of tranexamic acid varied by the underlying risk of life-threatening bleeding, type of birth, presence of moderate or severe anaemia or timing of administration. No significant difference was identified between tranexamic acid and placebo groups with regard to thromboembolic events: 50 (0.2%) of 26571 women in the tranexamic acid group had fatal or non-fatal thromboembolic events versus 52 (0.2%) of 26373 women in the placebo group (pooled OR 0.96 [0.65–1.41]; p = 0.82) with no significant heterogeneity identified in the subgroup analyses.

Interpretation

Tranexamic acid reduces the risk of life-threatening postpartum bleeding. We found no evidence that tranexamic acid increases the risk of thrombosis. Although we do not recommend the use of tranexamic acid in all women giving birth, consideration should be given to its use before a diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage in women at high risk of death.

### Association of tranexamic acid administration with mortality and thromboembolic events in patients with traumatic injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115zFman]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the administration of tranexamic acid associated with mortality and thromboembolic events in patients with traumatic injury?

Findings

This systematic review and meta-analysis included 31 randomized clinical trials and observational studies with 43 473 patients, among whom tranexamic acid was associated with lower 1-month mortality compared with the control cohort. Data from tranexamic acid studies, especially thromboembolic events, are largely heterogeneous.

Meaning

These findings suggest that tranexamic acid may decrease mortality in patients with traumatic injury, but the incidence of thromboembolic events remains unclear because trials and populations with traumatic injury are often not comparable and data vary largely.

### Tranexamic acid for postpartum bleeding: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111z8MHS]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Tranexamic acid reduces mortality in women with a clinical diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage. In the randomised, placebo-controlled, WOMAN trial, when given within 3 h of birth, tranexamic acid decreased bleeding deaths by about a third. In this trial, no discernible increase in thromboembolic events were observed with tranexamic acid, although the effect estimates were imprecise.WHO recommends tranexamic acid for all women with a clinical diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage.

Administration of tranexamic acid before a diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage is made could further reduce maternal mortality. Many women die soon after the onset of bleeding and tranexamic acid is more effective when given early. However, this would mean treating a much larger number of women. Although all women bleed to some extent after birth, in most women the bleeding is well tolerated. Administration of tranexamic acid to all women before a diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage is made would expose many women to the potential adverse effects of tranexamic acid, such as an increase in thrombosis, but only a small proportion of women would benefit.

To assess the balance of benefits and harms of tranexamic acid, precise estimates of the effects of tranexamic acid are needed in addition to an understanding of whether they vary with the underlying risks of bleeding and thrombosis. We conducted a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis using data from large, high-quality randomised trials to quantify the effects of tranexamic acid in women giving birth.

### Update on applications and limitations of perioperative tranexamic acid [^116LSjBf]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a potent antifibrinolytic with documented efficacy in reducing blood loss and allogeneic red blood cell transfusion in several clinical settings. With a growing emphasis on patient blood management, TXA has become an integral aspect of perioperative blood conservation strategies. While clinical applications of TXA in the perioperative period are expanding, routine use in select clinical scenarios should be supported by evidence for efficacy. Furthermore, questions regarding optimal dosing without increased risk of adverse events such as thrombosis or seizures should be answered. Therefore, ongoing investigations into TXA utilization in cardiac surgery, obstetrics, acute trauma, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, pediatric surgery, and other perioperative settings continue. The aim of this review is to provide an update on the current applications and limitations of TXA use in the perioperative period.

### Effect of tranexamic acid by baseline risk of death in acute bleeding patients: a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data from 28 333 patients [^114jDYKY]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Editor's key points

- This meta-analysis investigated how the effectiveness and safety of tranexamic acid varies by the baseline risk of death as a result of acute bleeding.
- The study shows that many deaths from bleeding are in patients at low or intermediate risk.
- The effectiveness of tranexamic acid seems not to vary by the baseline risk of patients.
- Tranexamic acid should therefore not be limited to the most severely injured or bleeding patients.

The Anti-Fibrinolytic Trials Collaboration previously published a meta-analysis of individual patient data showing that early administration of tranexamic acid safely reduces death from acute severe bleeding. When given soon after bleeding onset, tranexamic acid reduces the relative risk of death as a result of bleeding by about one-third. Early tranexamic acid treatment is widely recommended in treatment guidelines for acute severe bleeding, including postpartum haemorrhage and major trauma.

Many guidelines, especially those for trauma, focus on the use of tranexamic acid in severely injured patients with a high risk of death from bleeding. Although these patients have much to gain from tranexamic acid treatment, they are few in number and many die at the scene. Because there are many more patients with less severe injuries and a lower risk of death from bleeding, if tranexamic acid was similarly effective, prompt treatment of these patients could prevent many deaths. We examined how the effectiveness and safety of antifibrinolytic drugs vary by the baseline risk of death as a result of bleeding.

### The effect of tranexamic acid on postpartum bleeding in women with moderate and severe anaemia (WOMAN-2): an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115dw6Po]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study WOMAN-2 was published by WOMAN- Trial Collaborators. and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Postpartum hemorrhage. In the WOMAN-2 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of tranexamic acid on postpartum hemorrhage in women with moderate-to-severe anemia? In the WOMAN-2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the WOMAN-2 study, the population was: 15068 female patients. The inclusion criteria were women with moderate-to-severe anemia. The key exclusion criteria were indication for or contraindication to tranexamic acid; allergy to tranexamic acid or its components; postpartum hemorrhage before the umbilical cord is cut or clamped. In the WOMAN-2 study, the interventions were: n = 7580 tranexamic acid (at an intravenous dose of 1 g as soon as possible but no later than 15 minutes after umbilical cord is cut or clamped) n = 7488 placebo (matching placebo intravenous injection). In the WOMAN-2 study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in clinically diagnosed postpartum hemorrhage (7% vs. 6.6%; RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19). In the WOMAN-2 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in mean estimated blood loss (309.8 mL vs. 310.8 mL; AD -0.95 mL, 95% CI -7.1 to 5.21) No significant difference in mean corrected 24-hour hemoglobin (82.2 g/L vs. 82.1 g/L; AD 0.12 g/L, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.5) No significant difference in death or near miss at 24 hours (1.6% vs. 1.8%; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.12). In the WOMAN-2 study, the conclusion was: in women with moderate-to-severe anemia, tranexamic acid was not superior to placebo with respect to clinically diagnosed postpartum hemorrhage.

### Tranexamic acid in trauma: how should we use it? [^117U4KxE]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces blood loss by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of fibrin. It is often used in surgery to decrease bleeding and the need for blood transfusion. In 2011, results from a multi-center, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial (CRASH-2 trial) showed that TXA (1 g loading dose over 10 min followed by an infusion of 1 g over 8 h) safely reduces mortality in bleeding trauma patients. Initiation of TXA treatment within 3 h of injury reduces the risk of hemorrhage death by about one-third, regardless of baseline risk. Because it does not have any serious adverse effects, TXA can be administered to a wide spectrum of bleeding trauma patients. Limiting its use to the most severely injured or those with a diagnosis of 'hyperfibrinolysis' would result in thousands of avoidable deaths. A clinical trial (CRASH-3 trial) of TXA in patients with traumatic brain injury is now in progress.

### Tranexamic acid for gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^111f1dAK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a common life-threatening emergent condition. Immediate tranexamic acid is useful for reducing hemorrhage following operation and bleeding trauma, but evidence on the effects of tranexamic acid in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding is limited or highly heterogeneous. It is still unclear about using tranexamic acid in the emergent condition of gastrointestinal bleeding. This study, therefore, aimed to determine whether or not tranexamic acid should be used in gastrointestinal bleeding management through systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

We searched three biomedical databases for relevant randomized controlled trials on this topic. Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data for bias assessment and meta-analysis of bleeding, further intervention, mortality, transfusion, and intensive care unit admission. Available data were pooled using a random-effects model, and the results were presented as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity and small study effects were also assessed.

Results

Thirteen randomized controlled trials (n = 2271) were included in the present synthesis. Our meta-analysis revealed that tranexamic acid significantly reduced the rates of continued bleeding (RR = 0.60; 95%CI, 0.43–0.84), urgent endoscopic intervention (RR = 0.35; 95%CI, 0.24–0.50), and mortality (RR = 0.60; 95%CI, 0.45–0.80) compared with the placebo.

Conclusion

According to the available evidence, the present synthesis confirms that tranexamic acid is an effective medication for patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Early administration of tranexamic acid may be worth to be recommended for treating upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the emergency department. However, the effects of tranexamic acid on lower gastrointestinal bleeding warrant further clarification.

### Efficacy of high dose tranexamic acid (TXA) for hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117ExdE9]. Injury (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Standard dose (≤ 1 g) tranexamic acid (TXA) has established mortality benefit in trauma patients. The role of high dose IV TXA (≥ 2 g or ≥ 30 mg/kg as a single bolus) has been evaluated in the surgical setting, however, it has not been studied in trauma. We reviewed the available evidence of high dose IV TXA in any setting with the goal of informing its use in the adult trauma population.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and unpublished sources from inception until July 27, 2022 for studies that compared standard dose with high dose IV TXA in adults (≥ 16 years of age) with hemorrhage. Screening and data abstraction was done independently and in duplicate. We pooled trial data using a random effects model and considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational cohort studies separately. We assessed the individual study risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational cohort studies. The overall certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

Results

We included 20 studies with a combined total of 12,523 patients. Based on pooled RCT data, and as compared to standard dose TXA, high dose IV TXA probably decreases transfusion requirements (odds ratio [OR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 0.97, moderate certainty) but with possibly no effect on blood loss (mean difference [MD] 43.31 mL less, 95% CI 135.53 to 48.90 mL less, low certainty), and an uncertain effect on thromboembolic events (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.04, very low certainty) and mortality (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.32, very low certainty).

Conclusion

When compared to standard dose, high dose IV TXA probably reduces transfusion requirements with an uncertain effect on thromboembolic events and mortality.

### Effect of tranexamic acid by baseline risk of death in acute bleeding patients: a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data from 28 333 patients [^112QkdTC]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Tranexamic acid appears to be safe and effective regardless of the baseline risk for patients treated within 3 h since injury. Because many deaths are in patients at low and intermediate risk, tranexamic acid use should not be restricted to the most severely injured or bleeding patients. As tranexamic acid is safe, it should be considered as an early preventive measure rather than a treatment for severe coagulopathic bleeding.

### Tranexamic acid for acute hemorrhage: a narrative review of landmark studies and a critical reappraisal of its use over the last decade [^1138qjj8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

The publication of the Clinical Randomization of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Hemorrhage-2 (CRASH-2) study and its intense dissemination prompted a renaissance for the use of the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid (TXA) in acute trauma hemorrhage. Subsequent studies led to its widespread use as a therapeutic as well as prophylactic agent across different clinical scenarios involving bleeding, such as trauma, postpartum, and orthopedic surgery. However, results from the existing studies are confounded by methodological and statistical ambiguities and are open to varied interpretations. Substantial knowledge gaps remain on dosing, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, and clinical applications for TXA. The risk for potential thromboembolic complications with the use of TXA must be balanced against its clinical benefits. The present article aims to provide a critical reappraisal of TXA use over the last decade and a "thought exercise" in the potential downsides of TXA. A more selective and individualized use of TXA, guided by extended and functional coagulation assays, is advocated in the context of the evolving concept of precision medicine.

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^112WzGz9]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an anti-fibrinolytic agent that acts by inhibiting plasminogen activation and fibrinolysis. Although its first clinical use dates back more than 50 years, this hemostatic agent is still the object of intense clinical and developmental research. In particular, renewed interest in TXA has arisen following evidence that it has a beneficial effect in reducing blood loss in a variety of medical and surgical conditions at increased risk of bleeding. Given this characteristic, TXA is currently considered a mainstay of Patient Blood Management programs aimed at reducing patients' exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion. Importantly, recent large randomized controlled trials have consistently documented that the use of TXA confers a survival advantage in a number of globally critical clinical conditions associated with acute bleeding, including traumatic injury and post-partum hemorrhage, without increasing the thromboembolic risk.

### Effect of early tranexamic acid administration on mortality, hysterectomy, and other morbidities in women with post-partum haemorrhage (WOMAN): an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112j8Nbc]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Post-partum haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide. Early administration of tranexamic acid reduces deaths due to bleeding in trauma patients. We aimed to assess the effects of early administration of tranexamic acid on death, hysterectomy, and other relevant outcomes in women with post-partum haemorrhage.

Methods

In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited women aged 16 years and older with a clinical diagnosis of post-partum haemorrhage after a vaginal birth or caesarean section from 193 hospitals in 21 countries. We randomly assigned women to receive either 1 g intravenous tranexamic acid or matching placebo in addition to usual care. If bleeding continued after 30 min, or stopped and restarted within 24 h of the first dose, a second dose of 1 g of tranexamic acid or placebo could be given. Patients were assigned by selection of a numbered treatment pack from a box containing eight numbered packs that were identical apart from the pack number. Participants, care givers, and those assessing outcomes were masked to allocation. We originally planned to enrol 15000 women with a composite primary endpoint of death from all-causes or hysterectomy within 42 days of giving birth. However, during the trial it became apparent that the decision to conduct a hysterectomy was often made at the same time as randomisation. Although tranexamic acid could influence the risk of death in these cases, it could not affect the risk of hysterectomy. We therefore increased the sample size from 15000 to 20000 women in order to estimate the effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of death from post-partum haemorrhage. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ISRCTN76912190 (Dec 8, 2008); ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00872469; and PACTR201007000192283.

Findings

Between March, 2010, and April, 2016, 20060 women were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive tranexamic acid (n = 10051) or placebo (n = 10009), of whom 10036 and 9985, respectively, were included in the analysis. Death due to bleeding was significantly reduced in women given tranexamic acid (155 [1.5%] of 10036 patients vs 191 [1.9%] of 9985 in the placebo group, risk ratio [RR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.65–1.00; p = 0.045), especially in women given treatment within 3 h of giving birth (89 [1.2%] in the tranexamic acid group vs 127 [1.7%] in the placebo group, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52–0.91; p = 0.008). All other causes of death did not differ significantly by group. Hysterectomy was not reduced with tranexamic acid (358 [3.6%] patients in the tranexamic acid group vs 351 [3.5%] in the placebo group, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88–1.07; p = 0.84). The composite primary endpoint of death from all causes or hysterectomy was not reduced with tranexamic acid (534 [5.3%] deaths or hysterectomies in the tranexamic acid group vs 546 [5.5%] in the placebo group, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87–1.09; p = 0.65). Adverse events (including thromboembolic events) did not differ significantly in the tranexamic acid versus placebo group.

Interpretation

Tranexamic acid reduces death due to bleeding in women with post-partum haemorrhage with no adverse effects. When used as a treatment for postpartum haemorrhage, tranexamic acid should be given as soon as possible after bleeding onset.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^1117ayBp]. Critical Care (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for traumatic hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to tranexamic acid, ABC-T 2023 guidelines recommend to administer tranexamic acid in patients with trauma with bleeding or at risk of significant bleeding as soon as possible, if feasible, en route to the hospital and within 3 hours after injury at a loading dose of 1 g infused over 10 minutes, followed by an IV infusion of 1 g over 8 hours.

### Tranexamic acid: less bleeding and less thrombosis? [^1112NaLC]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

The early administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) to bleeding trauma patients reduces all-cause mortality without increasing the risk of vascular occlusive events. Indeed, the risk of arterial thrombosis appears to be reduced with TXA. In this commentary we hypothesize that TXA has an antithrombotic effect and explore potential mechanisms. These include inhibition of the inflammatory effects of plasmin, effects on platelets and effects on factors V and VIII. If proven, these antithrombotic effects would have major implications for the systemic use of TXA in surgical patients, where TXA has been clearly shown to reduce bleeding.

### Tranexamic acid-associated seizures: causes and treatment [^114jCCE8]. Annals of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Antifibrinolytic drugs are routinely used worldwide to reduce the bleeding that results from a wide range of hemorrhagic conditions. The most commonly used antifibrinolytic drug, tranexamic acid, is associated with an increased incidence of postoperative seizures. The reported increase in the frequency of seizures is alarming, as these events are associated with adverse neurological outcomes, longer hospital stays, and increased in-hospital mortality. However, many clinicians are unaware that tranexamic acid causes seizures. The goal of this review is to summarize the incidence, risk factors, and clinical features of these seizures. This review also highlights several clinical and preclinical studies that offer mechanistic insights into the potential causes of and treatments for tranexamic acid-associated seizures. This review will aid the medical community by increasing awareness about tranexamic acid-associated seizures and by translating scientific findings into therapeutic interventions for patients.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on mortality in patients with traumatic bleeding: prespecified analysis of data from randomised controlled trial [^113mB7Zh]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To examine whether the effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of death and thrombotic events in patients with traumatic bleeding varies according to baseline risk of death. To assess the extent to which current protocols for treatment with tranexamic acid maximise benefits to patients.

Design

Prespecified stratified analysis of data from an international multicentre randomised controlled trial (the CRASH-2 trial) with an estimation of the proportion of premature deaths that could potentially be averted through the administration of tranexamic acid.

Participants

13,273 trauma patients in the CRASH-2 trial who were treated with tranexamic acid or placebo within three hours of injury and trauma patients enrolled in UK Trauma and Audit Research Network, stratified by risk of death at baseline (< 6%, 6–20%, 21–50%, > 50%).

Intervention

Tranexamic acid (1 g over 10 minutes followed by 1 g over eight hours) or matching placebo.

Main Outcome Measure

Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for death in hospital within four weeks of injury, deaths from bleeding, and fatal and non-fatal thrombotic events associated with the use of tranexamic acid according to baseline risk of death. Unless there was strong evidence against the null hypothesis of homogeneity of effects (P < 0.001), the overall odds ratio was used as the most reliable guide to the odds ratios in all strata.

Results

Tranexamic acid was associated with a significant reduction in all cause mortality and deaths from bleeding. In each stratum of baseline risk, there were fewer deaths among patients treated with tranexamic acid. There was no evidence of heterogeneity in the effect of tranexamic acid on all cause mortality (P = 0.96 for interaction) or deaths from bleeding (P = 0.98) by baseline risk of death. In those treated with tranexamic acid there was a significant reduction in the odds of fatal and non-fatal thrombotic events (odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.89; P = 0.005) and a significant reduction in arterial thrombotic events (0.58, 0.40 to 0.83; P = 0.003) but no significant reduction in venous thrombotic events (0.83, 0.59 to 1.17; P = 0.295). There was no evidence of heterogeneity in the effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of thrombotic events (P = 0.74). If the effect of tranexamic acid is assumed to be the same in all risk strata (< 6%, 6–20%, 21–50%, > 50% risk of death at baseline), the percentage of deaths that could be averted by administration of tranexamic acid within three hours of injury in each group is 17%, 36%, 30%, and 17%, respectively.

Conclusions

Tranexamic acid can be administered safely to a wide spectrum of patients with traumatic bleeding and should not be restricted to the most severely injured.

### Tranexamic acid treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding: a randomized controlled trial [^116ZmAGD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of an oral formulation of tranexamic acid for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding.

Methods

Adult women with heavy menstrual bleeding (mean menstrual blood loss 80 mL or more per cycle) were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. After two pretreatment menstrual cycles, women were randomized to receive tranexamic acid 3.9 g/d or placebo for up to 5 days per menstrual cycle through six cycles. To meet the prespecified three-component primary efficacy end point, mean reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline with tranexamic acid treatment needed to be 1) significantly greater than placebo, 2) greater than 50 mL, and 3) greater than a predetermined meaningful threshold (36 mL or higher). Health-related quality of life was measured using a validated patient-reported outcome instrument.

Results

Women who received tranexamic acid (n = 115) met all three primary efficacy end points: first, a significantly greater reduction in menstrual blood loss of -69.6 mL (40.4%) compared with -12.6 mL (8.2%) in the 72 women who received placebo (P < .001); reduction of menstrual blood loss exceeding a prespecified 50 mL; and last, reduction of menstrual blood loss considered meaningful to women. Compared with women receiving placebo, women treated with tranexamic acid experienced significant improvements in limitations in social or leisure and physical activities, work inside and outside the home, and self-perceived menstrual blood loss (P < .01). The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, and the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events was comparable with placebo.

Conclusion

In this study, a new oral tranexamic acid treatment was well tolerated and significantly improved both menstrual blood loss and health-related quality of life in women with heavy menstrual bleeding.

### A single preoperative dose of tranexamic acid reduces perioperative blood loss: a meta-analysis [^116c2V6t]. Annals of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of a single dose of intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA) given preoperatively.

Summary Background Data

TXA is a synthetic antifibrinolytic that has been used in various surgical disciplines to reduce blood loss, blood transfusions, ecchymosis, and hematoma formation. However, there is no universal standard on the most effective dose and route of TXA administration, limiting its routine use in many centers. This study evaluates the current evidence for the efficacy and safety of a single preoperative dose of TXA on surgical blood loss in all surgical disciplines.

Methods

With the guidance of a research librarian, in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook Medline, Cochrane Central and Embase were searched in November 2018. Search terms included "Tranexamic Acid" AND "Intravenous", with studies limited to randomized controlled trails in adult humans. Two independent reviewers and an arbitrator assessed articles for inclusion. Criteria included a single preoperative bolus dose of intravenous TXA, surgical patients, and intraoperative blood loss measurement or perioperative blood loss up to 24hours postsurgery. Quality assessment was done using the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool by 2 reviewers. Statistical analysis was carried out using Cochrane Review Manager 5.3. The primary outcome was surgical blood loss. Secondary outcomes included venous thromboembolic complications, transfusion requirements, and dosing.

Results

A total of 1906 articles were screened, 57 met inclusion criteria. The majority of included studies were orthopedic (27), followed by obstetric and gynecological (16), oral maxillofacial and otolaryngology (10), cardiac (3), and 1 plastic surgery study focusing on acute burn reconstruction. Across all surgical specialties (n = 5698), the perioperative estimated blood loss was lower in patients receiving TXA, with a standard mean difference of -153.33mL (95% CI = -187.79 to -118.87). Overall, surgical patients with TXA had a 72% reduced odds of transfusion (odds ratio = 0.28 [95% CI = 0.22–0.36]). The most frequently used dose of TXA was 15mg/kg. There was no difference in the incidence of venous thromboembolic events between TXA and control groups.

Conclusions

While there is a growing body of evidence to support benefits of perioperative TXA use, this is the first meta-analysis to identify the efficacy and safety of a single preoperative dose of IV TXA. The potential implications for expanding the use of preoperative TXA for elective day surgery procedures is substantial. Preoperative intravenous TXA reduced perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements in a variety of surgical disciplines without increasing the risk of thromboembolic events. Therefore, it should be considered for prophylactic use in surgery to reduce operative bleeding.

### Association of tranexamic acid administration with mortality and thromboembolic events in patients with traumatic injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111wdsoL]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that tranexamic acid was associated with a 17% decrease in 1-month mortality in patients with traumatic injury compared with a control cohort. Reasonable concerns about potential thromboembolic events with tranexamic acid remain, but a definitive conclusion cannot be reached owing to a lack of homogenous data. Therefore, the use of tranexamic acid, as with any other pharmacological therapy, needs to be balanced against its potential risks. Systematic reviews constitute a complex research tool that can have a powerful impact on future decision making; however, it is essential to fully implement guidelines for systematic reviews to ensure that results are well generated and analyzed. When heterogeneity occurs, it needs to be reported sufficiently while evaluating population characteristics, study interventions, and outcome assessments.

### Tranexamic acid for bleeding: much more than a treatment for postpartum hemorrhage [^115razav]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Medium credibility.

The evidence that early tranexamic acid treatment reduces postpartum hemorrhage deaths has major implications for obstetrical care worldwide. Tranexamic acid may also have a role in the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage, but more evidence is needed on the balance of risks and benefits. Most deaths from postpartum hemorrhage are in low- and middle-income countries where tranexamic acid treatment is often unavailable. Several maternal health organizations including the Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition, Clinton Health Access Initiative, Concept Foundation, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, and Unitaid are working to increase access. However, a wider view of the evidence on tranexamic acid and bleeding shows that it can improve maternal health in many other ways. An appreciation of these other health benefits could facilitate efforts to increase access. By reducing heavy menstrual bleeding, tranexamic acid could reduce the prevalence of maternal anemia, a common and important risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage and other maternal and neonatal outcomes. Further clinical trials of tranexamic acid for the treatment of menstrual bleeding are needed. By reducing surgical bleeding and the need for blood transfusion, tranexamic acid would increase the availability of blood in countries where there is blood shortage so that more blood is available for use in life-threatening bleeding including postpartum hemorrhage. In countries where there is no blood shortage, tranexamic acid use would reduce healthcare costs and prevent transfusion-transmitted infections and reactions. Trauma affects women and men, and violence is a leading cause of death in pregnancy. Increased use of tranexamic acid in trauma would significantly reduce trauma deaths. Efforts to increase the availability and use of tranexamic acid for obstetrical hemorrhage should acknowledge its other health benefits and aim to increase its use across health services more generally.

### Tranexamic acid during prehospital transport in patients at risk for hemorrhage after injury: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial [^114snMVv]. JAMA Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Importance

In-hospital administration of tranexamic acid after injury improves outcomes in patients at risk for hemorrhage. Data demonstrating the benefit and safety of the pragmatic use of tranexamic acid in the prehospital phase of care are lacking for these patients.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness and safety of tranexamic acid administered before hospitalization compared with placebo in injured patients at risk for hemorrhage.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This pragmatic, phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, superiority randomized clinical trial included injured patients with prehospital hypotension (systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mm Hg) or tachycardia (heart rate ≥ 110/min) before arrival at 1 of 4 US level 1 trauma centers, within an estimated 2 hours of injury, from May 1, 2015, through October 31, 2019.

Interventions

Patients received 1 g of tranexamic acid before hospitalization (447 patients) or placebo (456 patients) infused for 10 minutes in 100 mL of saline. The randomization scheme used prehospital and in-hospital phase assignments, and patients administered tranexamic acid were allocated to abbreviated, standard, and repeat bolus dosing regimens on trauma center arrival.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality.

Results

In all, 927 patients (mean [SD] age, 42 [18] years; 686 [74.0%] male) were eligible for prehospital enrollment (460 randomized to tranexamic acid intervention; 467 to placebo intervention). After exclusions, the intention-to-treat study cohort comprised 903 patients: 447 in the tranexamic acid arm and 456 in the placebo arm. Mortality at 30 days was 8.1% in patients receiving tranexamic acid compared with 9.9% in patients receiving placebo (difference, -1.8%; 95% CI, -5.6% to 1.9%; p = 0.17). Results of Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, accounting for site, verified that randomization to tranexamic acid was not associated with a significant reduction in 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59–1.11, P = 0.18). Prespecified dosing regimens and post-hoc subgroup analyses found that prehospital tranexamic acid were associated with significantly lower 30-day mortality. When comparing tranexamic acid effect stratified by time to treatment and qualifying shock severity in a post hoc comparison, 30-day mortality was lower when tranexamic acid was administered within 1 hour of injury (4.6% vs 7.6%; difference, -3.0%; 95% CI, -5.7% to -0.3%; P < .002). Patients with severe shock (systolic blood pressure ≤ 70 mm Hg) who received tranexamic acid demonstrated lower 30-day mortality compared with placebo (18.5% vs 35.5%; difference, -17%; 95% CI, -25.8% to -8.1%; P < .003).

Conclusions and Relevance

In injured patients at risk for hemorrhage, tranexamic acid administered before hospitalization did not result in significantly lower 30-day mortality. The prehospital administration of tranexamic acid after injury did not result in a higher incidence of thrombotic complications or adverse events. Tranexamic acid given to injured patients at risk for hemorrhage in the prehospital setting is safe and associated with survival benefit in specific subgroups of patients.

The study CRASH-2 was published by CRASH- trial collaborators and colleagues in 2010 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Traumatic hemorrhage. In the CRASH-2 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of tranexamic acid in trauma patients with significant hemorrhage? In the CRASH-2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CRASH-2 study, the population was: 20207 patients (3272 female, 16935 male). The inclusion criteria were adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding. The key exclusion criteria were a clear indication for tranexamic acid, or a clear contraindication to tranexamic acid treatment. In the CRASH-2 study, the interventions were: n = 10093 tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 min then infusion of 1 g over 8 h IV) n = 10114 placebo (matching placebo of 0.9% saline IV). In the CRASH-2 study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in all-cause death (14.5% vs. 16%; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97). In the CRASH-2 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death due to bleeding (4.9% vs. 5.7%; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.96) No significant difference in death due to vascular occlusion (0.3% vs. 0.5%; RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.08) No significant difference in vascular occlusive events (1.7% vs. 2%; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.02). In the CRASH-2 study, the conclusion was: in adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding, tranexamic acid was superior to placebo with respect to a all-cause death.

### Tranexamic acid in pediatric trauma: why not? [^1172wLL1]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Trauma is a leading cause of death in pediatrics. Currently, no medical treatment exists to reduce mortality in the setting of pediatric trauma; however, this evidence does exist in adults. Bleeding and coagulopathy after trauma increases mortality in both adults and children. Clinical research has demonstrated a reduction in mortality with early use of tranexamic acid in adult trauma patients in both civilian and military settings. Tranexamic acid used in the perioperative setting safely reduces transfusion requirements in children. This article compares the hematologic response to trauma between children and adults, and explores the potential use of tranexamic acid in pediatric hemorrhagic trauma.

### Tranexamic acid use in the surgical arena: a narrative review [^117JgdaJ]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a potent antifibrinolytic drug that inhibits the activation of plasmin by plasminogen. While not a new medication, TXA has quickly gained traction across a variety of surgical subspecialties to prevent and treat bleeding. Knowledge on the use of this drug is essential for the modern surgeon to continue to provide excellent care to their patients.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the PubMed database was conducted of articles published within the last 10 y (2014–2024) relating to TXA and its use in various surgical subspecialties. Seminal studies regarding the use of TXA older than 10 y were included from the author's archives.

Results

Indications for TXA are not limited to trauma alone, and TXA is utilized across a variety of surgical subspecialties from neurosurgery to hepatic surgery to control hemorrhage. Overall, TXA is well tolerated with common dose-dependent adverse effects, including headache, nasal symptoms, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue. More severe adverse events are rare and easily mitigated by not exceeding a dose of 50 mg/kg.

Conclusions

The administration of TXA as an adjunct to treat trauma saves lives. The ability of TXA to induce seizures is dose dependent with identifiable risk factors, making this serious adverse effect predictable. As for the potential for TXA to cause thrombotic events, uncertainty remains. If this association is proven to be real, the risk will likely be small, since the use of TXA is still advantageous in most situations because of its efficacy for a more common concern, bleeding.

### Tranexamic acid for trauma: optimal timing of administration based on the CRASH-2 and CRASH-3 trials [^111K3T2h]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid reduces bleeding deaths in trauma patients, but the treatment benefit depends on the time from injury. It is recommended that tranexamic acid be administered immediately and only within 3 h of injury; however, the optimal criteria have not been adequately studied.

Methods

We applied machine learning-based causal forest models to investigate heterogeneity in the effects of tranexamic acid on 24-hour mortality rate conditional on covariates (for example age, sex, time from injury, systolic blood pressure, and Glasgow Coma Scale, GCS). We analysed data on 28 448 trauma patients in the CRASH-2 and CRASH-3 randomized trials. We used the policytree algorithm to determine the optimal criteria for tranexamic acid treatment.

Results

The causal forest models showed heterogeneity in the effects of tranexamic acid on 24-hour mortality rate. The relative risk reduction was greatest in patients treated within 2 h of injury but thereafter decreased rapidly. The pattern was similar regardless of age or systolic blood pressure, although with decreasing GCS, the time to treatment effects were weaker, with benefits beyond 3 h. The largest absolute risk reductions were in patients with a low blood pressure and a low GCS when treated soon after injury. The optimal criterion was statistically determined as patients within 2 h of the injury or with GCS < 9.

Conclusions

Tranexamic acid administration was found to be beneficial when given within 2 h of injury. In patients with severe traumatic brain injury, the treatment benefits may persist beyond the 2-hour window.

### Wider use of tranexamic acid to reduce surgical bleeding could benefit patients and health systems [^116zaDD2]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Similar steps would be of benefit outside the UK. Reducing surgical bleeding and the need for transfusion is especially important in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where blood stocks are lower and transfusion risks, notably transmission of HIV and hepatitis viruses, are higher. Unlike in high income settings, tranexamic acid is often unavailable in low and middle income hospitals. Tranexamic acid is heat stable and has a long shelf life, and its use in surgery is cost effective even in low income settings. We believe that the evidence strongly supports its inclusion in the World Health Organization's safe surgery checklist. The inclusion of tranexamic acid into WHO guidelines for the treatment of postpartum haemorrhage has stimulated initiatives to increase the availability of tranexamic acid for this indication. However, a more health systems oriented approach to tranexamic acid availability would have additional health benefits. Efforts to scale up tranexamic acid use for postpartum haemorrhage in low and middle income countries should also recognise the wider health system uses and benefits of tranexamic acid including its use in surgery. Greater use of tranexamic acid will improve surgical outcomes worldwide and at low cost, and we urge surgeons and anaesthetists in the UK and elsewhere to take steps to promote its implementation.

Key messages

Tranexamic acid safely reduces surgical bleeding and the need for blood transfusion
Use of tranexamic acid for adults at risk of moderate blood loss during surgery is low in the UK despite it being a quality standard
Greater use of tranexamic acid in surgery is important, especially in low and middle income settings where blood stocks are lower and transfusion risks are higher
Tranexamic acid should be included on the WHO Safe Surgery checklist

### Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary intraCerebral haemorrhage (TICH-2): an international randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 superiority trial [^113W2UQY]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study TICH-2 was published by Nikola Sprigg and colleagues in 2018 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Intracerebral hemorrhage. In the TICH-2 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of tranexamic acid in patients with stroke due to intracerebral hemorrhage? In the TICH-2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the TICH-2 study, the population was: 2325 patients (1024 female, 1301 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with intracerebral hemorrhage from acute stroke. The key exclusion criteria were intracerebral hemorrhage secondary to anticoagulation, thrombolysis, trauma, or a known underlying structural abnormality; contraindication to tranexamic acid; prestroke dependence; life expectancy < 3 months; and GCS score < 5. In the TICH-2 study, the interventions were: n = 1161 tranexamic acid (1 g intravenous bolus followed by another 1 g infused over 8 hours, within 8 hours of symptom onset) n = 1164 placebo (normal saline 0.9% administered with an identical regimen). In the TICH-2 study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death at 90 days (22% vs. 21%; aHR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.1). In the TICH-2 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in change in volume of hematoma from baseline to 24 hours (3.72 mL vs. 4.9 mL; AD -1.37 mL, 95% CI -2.71 to -0.04) Significant increase in length of stay in hospital (63.12 days vs. 63.73 days; AD 1.09 days, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.24). In the TICH-2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in venous thromboembolic events, arterial occlusions, seizure, nervous system disorders, infections. significant differences in serious adverse events by day 2 (33% vs. 36%), day 7 (39% vs. 43%), 90 days (45% vs. 48%). In the TICH-2 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with intracerebral hemorrhage from acute stroke, tranexamic acid was not superior to placebo with respect to death at 90 days.

### Tranexamic acid timing and mortality impact after trauma [^117EBRqy]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Trauma resuscitation guidelines across the world have incorporated the administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) within 3 hours of injury. The 3-hour window was deduced from the Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH-2) trial and has not been replicated. The aim of this study was to determine whether death within 28 days after trauma varied according to time from injury to the first TXA dose and, if so, precisely determine the therapeutic window.

Methods

This was an exploratory analysis of the Prehospital Tranexamic Acid for Severe Trauma (PATCH-Trauma) trial, which enrolled adults with major trauma and suspected trauma-induced coagulopathy. Eligible patients were randomized to receive either TXA (administered intravenously as a bolus dose of 1 g before hospital admission, followed by a 1 g infusion over a period of 8 hours after arrival at the hospital) or matched placebo. In this analysis, we examined the effect of time from injury to first treatment dose on death within 28 days utilizing a continuous scale with linear, first-degree fractional polynomial, and second-degree fractional polynomial functions of time from injury to first treatment dose. Further log-binomial regression analyses were performed in subgroups based on the information obtained from the previous step.

Results

The intention-to-treat study cohort comprised 1,287 patients, of which 635 had been allocated to the placebo arm and 652 to the TXA arm. The median time from injury to first treatment dose was 79 (interquartile range [IQR] 55 to 112) minutes. Risk of death within 28 days increased as the time to first dose of treatment increased, with benefit most pronounced up to 90 minutes. Beyond 90 minutes, the upper 95% confidence interval (CI) crossed the line of equivalence (risk ratio, 1). Administration of TXA within 90 minutes significantly reduced the risk of death within 28 days (67/393 [17%] in the TXA group versus 91/363 [25%] in placebo group; adjusted risk ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.82), whereas administration beyond 90 minutes did not decrease mortality at 28 days (adjusted risk ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.47).

Conclusion

The optimal therapeutic window for TXA after trauma may be within 90 minutes.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on mortality in patients with traumatic bleeding: prespecified analysis of data from randomised controlled trial [^116cKChc]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Potential biological mechanisms

Tranexamic acid reduces the risk of death from haemorrhage and seems to reduce the risk of arterial thrombotic events. It is possible that by reducing bleeding, tranexamic acid reduces myocardial oxygen demand and increases oxygen supply. It is also possible that the reduction in arterial thrombotic events could be mediated through an anti-inflammatory effect of tranexamic acid.

Implications for patients

These results have important implications for the care of trauma patients. Firstly, they suggest that tranexamic acid can safely be used in all trauma patients with or at risk of severe bleeding, as in the inclusion criteria used in the CRASH-2 trial, and not just in the most severely injured. Secondly, the observed reduction in the risk of arterial events with tranexamic acid suggests that the absolute benefits from administration of tranexamic acid are likely to be greatest in older trauma patients, who at any given level of severity of injury have a higher baseline risk of death from haemorrhage and thrombotic events. Clinical concern about an increased risk of ischaemic cardiac events might be a reason to give rather than to withhold tranexamic acid. It is worth noting that trials of tranexamic acid in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, a group at high risk of cardiac events, provide no evidence of any increased risk. We acknowledge that estimating the risk of severe bleeding is a challenging ongoing process that uses not only physiological variables but other variables such as laboratory measurements and response to treatments. Physicians will use all this information and their clinical judgment when deciding whether to use tranexamic acid. In situations of uncertainty, however, physicians can use the prognostic model to support the decision making process and should certainly consider administering tranexamic acid to patients with a risk of death higher than 5%.

### Mechanism of action of tranexamic acid in bleeding trauma patients: an exploratory analysis of data from the CRASH-2 trial [^112kzTTB]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

To investigate the mechanism of action of tranexamic acid (TXA) in bleeding trauma patients, we examined the timing of its effect on mortality. We hypothesised that if TXA reduces mortality by decreasing blood loss, its effect should be greatest on the day of the injury when bleeding is most profuse. However, if TXA reduces mortality via an anti-inflammatory mechanism its effect should be greater over the subsequent days.

Methods

Exploratory analysis, including per-protocol analyses, of data from the CRASH-2 trial, a randomised placebo controlled trial of the effect of TXA on mortality in 20,211 trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding. We examined hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals for all-cause mortality, deaths due to bleeding and non-bleeding deaths, according to the day since injury. The CRASH-2 trial is registered as ISRCTN86750102 and ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00375258.

Results

The effect of TXA on mortality is greatest for deaths occurring on the day of the injury (HR all-cause mortality = 0.83, 0.73 to 0.93). This survival benefit is only evident in patients in whom treatment is initiated within 3 hours of their injury (HR ≤ 3 hours = 0.78, 0.68 to 0.90; HR > 3 hours = 1.02, 0.76 to 1.36). Initiation of TXA treatment within 3 hours of injury reduced the hazard of death due to bleeding on the day of the injury by 28% (HR = 0.72, 0.60 to 0.86). TXA treatment initiated beyond 3 hours of injury appeared to increase the hazard of death due to bleeding, although the estimates were imprecise.

Conclusions

Early administration of tranexamic acid appears to reduce mortality primarily by preventing exsanguination on the day of the injury.

### Use of tranexamic acid in trauma surgical specialties: a narrative review [^113cjGAB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a well-known antifibrinolytic agent with increasing evidence supporting its use in trauma patients. This review evaluates the current available literature regarding TXA and its potential use to improve patient survival and reduce transfusion needs across multiple trauma surgical subspecialties and contexts.

Methods

A literature review was conducted on the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in trauma surgical specialties using PubMed (MEDLINE) and Google Scholar from database inception to October 2024. Selected articles were written in the English language and encompassed reviews, experimental studies, and basic science articles.

Results

There is conflicting evidence on the mortality benefit of TXA, particularly in the prehospital setting. However, multiple large, high-quality studies have shown that TXA is an effective agent to reduce bleeding after trauma. Extensive evidence exists that TXA is a safe medication, with numerous studies demonstrating no increased risk of thromboembolic events after administration of TXA in trauma settings. Additionally, multiple cost-effectiveness studies conducted in several countries have found TXA to be a highly cost-effective intervention following trauma.

Conclusion

TXA is a safe, effective, and cost-effective medication to reduce bleeding after trauma. Future research on TXA is needed to elucidate the potential benefit of TXA after traumatic brain and spine injury and the optimal dose and route of administration of TXA.

### The cost-effectiveness of tranexamic acid for treatment of postpartum hemorrhage: a systematic review [^113PtGEm]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is responsible for nearly one quarter of maternal deaths. A 2017 multicountry trial found that incorporating tranexamic acid (TXA) into the PPH management package was effective in reducing maternal death due to bleeding.

Objective

To systematically review studies assessing the cost-effectiveness of tranexamic acid for PPH treatment.

Search Strategy

Nine databases were searched using variations of keywords 'tranexamic acid', 'postpartum hemorrhage' and 'cost effectiveness'.

Selection Criteria

Eligible studies were any type of economic or effectiveness evaluation studies on tranexamic acid for treating women with PPH.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently screened citations and extracted data on cost effectiveness measures. Quality was assessed using the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria list.

Main Results

Four studies were included, of which two were abstracts. Three studies concluded that early administration of TXA was cost-saving or cost-effective. One abstract reported TXA was not cost-effective in the United States unless the probability of death due to hemorrhage is higher.

Conclusion

Available evidence (four studies in three countries) suggests that this life-saving intervention may be below willingness to pay thresholds (cost-effective) or cost saving. Further studies conducted in different populations and settings are needed to inform health policy decision-making to reduce PPH-associated morbidity and mortality.

### Tranexamic acid for preventing postpartum haemorrhage after caesarean section [^116gD46u]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is common and potentially life-threatening. The antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid (TXA) is recommended for treating PPH; it reduces the risk of death from haemorrhage by one-third when given soon after bleeding onset, but not overall risk of death. Interest in whether TXA may be effective in preventing PPH is growing. Evidence indicates that TXA given more than three hours after injury to bleeding trauma patients increases mortality. Potential harm becomes critical in prophylactic use of TXA. Reliable evidence of the effect and safety profile of TXA is required before widespread prophylactic use can be considered.

Objectives

To assess the effects of TXA for preventing PPH compared to placebo or no treatment (with or without uterotonic co-treatment) in women during caesarean birth.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and WHO ICTRP to 20 February 2024 and searched reference lists of retrieved studies.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of TXA alone or plus uterotonics during caesarean birth for preventing PPH. Trials needed to be prospectively registered (i.e. before starting recruitment). We applied a trustworthiness checklist.

Outcomes

The critical outcome was blood loss ≥ 1000 mL, measured using estimated or calculated methods. Important outcomes included maternal death, severe morbidity, blood transfusion, the use of additional surgical interventions to control PPH, thromboembolic events, use of additional uterotonics, hysterectomy, maternal satisfaction, and breastfeeding at discharge.

Risk Of Bias

We assessed risk of bias in the included studies using Cochrane's RoB 1 tool.

Synthesis Methods

Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and trial trustworthiness. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analysis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Included Studies

We included six RCTs with 15,981 participants. All 12 trials in the previous version of this review were not included after review of trial registrations and trustworthiness checklists. Most included studies involved women at low risk of PPH and were conducted in high-resource settings.

Synthesis Of Results

Prophylactic TXA in addition to standard care compared to placebo in addition to standard care or standard care alone TXA results in little to no difference in estimated blood loss ≥ 1000 mL (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.11; 4 RCTs; n = 13,042; high certainty evidence), resulting in 8 fewer per 1000 women having estimated blood loss ≥ 1000 mL (from 30 fewer to 16 more). TXA likely results in a slight reduction in calculated blood loss ≥ 1000 mL (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92; 2 RCTs; n = 4327; moderate certainty evidence), resulting in 53 fewer per 1000 having calculated blood loss ≥ 1000 mL (from 75 fewer to 25 fewer). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of TXA on maternal death (one event in placebo group, none in TXA group). No trials measured severe morbidity. TXA likely results in little to no difference in blood transfusion (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.08; 5 RCTs; n = 15,740; moderate certainty evidence), resulting in 4 fewer per 1000 women requiring a blood transfusion (from 10 fewer to 3 more). TXA results in little to no difference in additional surgical interventions to control PPH (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22; 4 RCTs; n = 15,631; high certainty evidence), resulting in 1 more per 1000 women requiring additional surgical intervention (from 4 fewer to 7 more). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of TXA on thromboembolic events (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.22 to 8.90; 4 RCTs; n = 14,480; very low certainty evidence), resulting in 1 more per 1000 women having a thromboembolic event (from 2 fewer to 17 more). TXA results in little to no difference in the need for additional uterotonics (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; 4 RCTs; n = 15,728; high certainty evidence), resulting in 15 fewer per 1000 women requiring additional uterotonics (from 27 fewer to 0 fewer). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of TXA on hysterectomy (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.20 to 3.29; 2 RCTs; n = 4546; very low certainty evidence), resulting in 3 fewer per 10,000 women requiring a hysterectomy (from 11 fewer to 31 more). One trial measuring maternal satisfaction reported no difference between groups at day two postpartum. No data were available on breastfeeding. Overall, studies had low risk of bias. We downgraded the certainty of evidence mainly for imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylactic TXA in addition to standard care during caesarean birth results in little to no difference in estimated blood loss ≥ 1000 mL and likely results in a slight reduction in calculated blood loss ≥ 1000 mL compared to placebo. There were no data for severe morbidity due to PPH. Event rates for further interventions to control PPH were low and similar across groups. Prophylactic TXA thus results in little to no difference between groups for additional surgical interventions (32 versus 31 per 1000), and likely results in little to no difference between groups for blood transfusions (31 versus 36 per 1000) and use of additional uterotonics (107 versus 121 per 1000). There were very few events for the outcomes maternal death (1 in placebo group), thromboembolic events (2 versus 3 per 1000), and hysterectomy (1 per 1000 in each group). Evidence for these serious adverse events is therefore very uncertain. Decisions about implementing routine prophylactic TXA during caesarean birth should not only consider outcomes related to blood loss, but also the relatively low rates of PPH morbidity and uncertainty of serious adverse events. Most studies included women at low risk of PPH, thereby precluding any conclusions about women at high risk of PPH. Cost associated with routine use of an additional drug for all caesarean births needs to be considered.

### The effect of tranexamic acid on functional outcomes: an exploratory analysis of the CRASH-2 randomized controlled trial [^112ydzWw]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Tranexamic acid improves survival in severely injured adults. However, its effectiveness on overall functional outcome is unknown. We hypothesized that tranexamic acid improves overall functional outcome compared with placebo in severely injured adults and conduct an exploratory analysis of the Clinical Randomization of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH-2) data to investigate this hypothesis.

Methods

We included injured adults from the CRASH-2 trial who were randomized 3 hours or less from injury. The primary outcome measure was functional status at hospital discharge or on day 28 if the subject was still in the hospital. Functional status was measured with the modified Oxford Handicap Scale, a 6-category ordinal functional outcome scale. We conducted 3 separate analyses using 3 different outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of tranexamic acid versus placebo on functional outcomes, including the mean utility-weighted modified Oxford Handicap Scale score (overall functional outcome), the area under the curve (based on functional outcome and rate of recovery), and a sliding dichotomy analysis (favorable versus unfavorable functional outcome) stratified by baseline mortality risk (stratified analysis).

Results

There were 13,432 patients (6,679 randomized to placebo and 6,753 to tranexamic acid) included in the study cohort. The mean utility-weighted modified Oxford Handicap Scale score was 0.66 (SD 0.33) for patients randomized to tranexamic acid compared with a mean of 0.64 (SD 0.34) for those randomized to placebo (mean difference 0.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01 to 0.03). The area under the curve analysis demonstrated that patients randomized to tranexamic acid had a higher 28-day mean utility-weighted modified Oxford Handicap Scale score compared with those randomized to placebo (mean score 0.55 [SD 0.30] versus 0.53 [SD 0.31]; mean difference 0.02 [95% CI 0.01 to 0.03]). The sliding dichotomy analysis demonstrated heterogeneity of treatment effects across risk groups. The overall proportion of patients with favorable functional outcomes was higher in the tranexamic acid group (5,360/6,753 [79.4%]; 95% CI 78.4% to 80.3%) compared with the placebo group (5,174/6,679 [77.5%]; 95% CI 76.5% to 78.5%; difference 1.9% [95% CI 0.5% to 3.3%]; number needed to treat = 52). When each risk group was tested separately, only the lowest-risk group (< 6% baseline mortality risk) demonstrated a statistically significant effect of tranexamic acid toward favorable functional outcomes (tranexamic acid versus placebo adjusted odds ratio 0.78; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.90). There were no differences between tranexamic acid and placebo in the other risk groups.

Conclusion

Across 3 exploratory analyses, severely injured adult patients randomized within 3 hours from injury demonstrated better functional outcomes with tranexamic acid compared with placebo. When heterogeneity of treatment effects across risk groups was evaluated, only the lowest-risk group demonstrated a significant effect of tranexamic acid toward favorable outcomes. Given the overall safety and cost-effectiveness of tranexamic acid use in injured adults, our results further support the use of tranexamic acid for this population. Future trauma trials that evaluate tranexamic acid use should also consider functional status as an important outcome.

### Tranexamic acid in orthopaedic trauma surgery: a meta-analysis [^1165hfNX]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

To systematically review and quantify the efficacy of tranexamic acid (TXA) use in reducing the risk of receiving a blood transfusion in patients undergoing orthopaedic trauma surgery, in reducing blood loss, and risk of thromboembolic events.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and conference proceeding abstracts from 2014 to 2016. A minimum of 2 reviewers screened each study and graded quality. The primary outcome measure was the risk of receiving a blood transfusion in the TXA group versus control. A meta-analysis was performed to construct a combined odds ratio (OR) of receiving a blood transfusion, mean difference (MD) of blood loss, and OR of thromboembolic events.

Results

Twelve studies were included in the quantitative analysis (1,333 patients). The risk of blood transfusion was significantly less in patients who were administered TXA compared with controls [OR 0.407; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.278–0.594, I = 34, Q = 17, P ≤ 0.001]. There was significantly less blood loss in the TXA group compared with controls, as the mean difference was 304 mL (95% CI, 142–467 mL) (I = 94, Q value = 103, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in risk of symptomatic thromboembolic events (OR 0.968; 95% CI, 0.530–1.766, I = 0, Q value = 5, P = 0.684).

Conclusions

In patients with orthopaedic trauma, TXA reduces the risk of blood transfusion, reduces perioperative blood loss, and has no significant effect on the risk of symptomatic thromboembolic events. More high-quality studies are needed to ensure the safety of the drug in these patients.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on mortality in patients with traumatic bleeding: prespecified analysis of data from randomised controlled trial [^112vzCr3]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The CRASH-2 trial showed that a short course of tranexamic acid given within three hours of injury to adult patients with traumatic bleeding significantly reduces all cause mortality with no apparent increase in the risk of adverse thrombotic events. As a result, tranexamic acid is now being incorporated into trauma protocols around the world. These protocols generally focus on the care of the most severely injured. Patients with a high risk of death at baseline have the most to gain from the use of life saving treatments because the absolute benefits of an effective treatment tend to increase as the baseline risk increases. On the other hand, there are more low risk trauma patients than high risk patients, and a large number of patients at low risk might contribute more deaths than a smaller number of patients at high risk. We carried out prespecified analyses of the CRASH-2 trial data to examine how effects of treatment with tranexamic acid vary according to the baseline risk of death in patients with traumatic bleeding. We then used data from a large hospital based trauma registry to assess the extent to which current trauma protocols maximise the benefits to patients of treatment with tranexamic acid.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Tranexamic acid in primary total joint arthroplasty (TJA) — Guideline question 1 states that administration of intravenous, topical, and oral tranexamic acid (TXA) compared with placebo are all effective strategies for reducing calculated blood loss and the need for transfusion during a primary TJA, with Strength of recommendation Strong. The rationale cites direct meta-analysis of one moderate-quality and 82 high-quality studies supporting TXA's ability to reduce blood loss and/or transfusion during primary hip and knee arthroplasties. In total hip arthroplasty, intravenous and topical TXA reduced the risk of transfusion compared with placebo by 60% and 71%, respectively, and a network meta-analysis reported that low-dose intravenous, high-dose intravenous, high-dose topical, and combined intravenous/topical TXA reduced the risk for blood loss compared with placebo.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary management of osteoarthritis of the hip [^1119mZKL]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). High credibility.

American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline — tranexamic acid (TXA) in total hip arthroplasty (THA) states that while there is concern that there may be contraindications to the use of TXA, none of the papers cited above demonstrated an increased risk of adverse events related to the perioperative use of TXA for THA. Reducing blood loss and transfusion rates after total hip arthroplasty has a major impact on improving outcomes, reducing complications, and improving value, and reductions in perioperative blood loss and transfusion rates improve perioperative recovery, costs related to transfusion, and utilization of limited resources. Some stakeholders may have concerns regarding the risk/benefit profile of TXA in higher risk patients with vascular disease, coronary stents, and thromboembolic disease; however, prior retrospective studies have found TXA use to be safe in these high-risk patients, and randomized, prospective trials to address these concerns would be beneficial. For future research, randomized, prospective trials comparing IV TXA, topical TXA, and oral TXA are warranted to specifically assess dosing, technique and timing of administration, uniform measures of perioperative blood loss, cost, including impact on blood transfusion, and contraindications, and studies focused on refining dosing recommendations and risks/benefits in higher risk patients may be of particular value.

### The current place of tranexamic acid in the management of bleeding [^114bPvCr]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

There has been an explosion of interest in the ability of tranexamic acid to reduce morbidity and mortality in surgical and traumatic bleeding. Tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce mortality due to traumatic bleeding by a third, without apparent safety issues. It is now clearly established that intravenous tranexamic acid reduces blood loss in patients with surgical bleeding and the need for transfusion. It can also be used topically to reduce bleeding. Its use is being explored further in large pragmatic trials in traumatic head injury, postpartum haemorrhage and in upper gastro-intestinal haemorrhage. There are few side effects from the use of tranexamic acid except when administered in high dose where neurological events have been noted, possibly relating to tranexamic acid interfering with cerebral GABA and glycine receptors. However, clinical studies suggest that there is no increased efficacy in using a higher dose, and that a dose of 1 g intravenously in an adult patient has maximal efficacy, which is not increased by higher doses. The CRASH-2 trauma trial clearly showed no increase in thrombotic events after its use in trauma, indeed there was a significant reduction in myocardial infarction. However, trials of tranexamic acid in surgery have failed to adequately study its effects on the risk of postoperative venous and possible reduction in arterial thrombo-embolism, and this needs to be the subject of future research.

### Tranexamic acid for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^11416vD9]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Postpartum hemorrhage is a leading cause of pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality. Recent data have demonstrated that tranexamic acid reduces death because of bleeding when used as a treatment for postpartum hemorrhage. The World Health Organization now recommends tranexamic acid as a first-line treatment for postpartum hemorrhage; however, data are not yet available on the frequency of use in the United States, where tranexamic acid is currently recognized as an adjunct treatment for postpartum hemorrhage.

Objective

We aimed to strengthen the current evidence that tranexamic acid should be recognized as a first-line treatment for postpartum hemorrhage, even in high-resource countries. Furthermore, we aimed to determine whether early administration of tranexamic acid (within 3 hours of diagnosis) is a cost-effective strategy for reducing maternal morbidity and mortality from postpartum hemorrhage in the United States.

Study Design

A decision-analytical model was designed to compare the outcomes and costs of the administration of tranexamic acid in the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. Moreover, this model was used to compare outcomes for early administration with those of routine use. The interventions compared were 1 g of intravenous tranexamic acid or matching placebo. The risks analyzed in the model were death because of hemorrhage and laparotomy to control bleeding. Probabilities, utilities, and costs were derived from literature. Quality-adjusted life-years were calculated using a discounted life expectancy rate of 3%. Cost-effectiveness was determined on the basis of a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year.

Results

The administration of tranexamic acid to a theoretical cohort of 100,000 women would prevent 11 maternal deaths, 6 postpartum laparotomies after vaginal delivery, and 112 reoperations after cesarean delivery. This would lead to an increase in 329 quality-adjusted life years and a total cost savings of $15.39 million. Furthermore, if tranexamic acid were administered early (within 3 hours of postpartum hemorrhage diagnosis) to the same theoretical cohort, 16 maternal deaths owing to hemorrhage, 9 laparotomies, and 155 reoperations would be prevented. This amounts to an increase in 438 quality-adjusted life years and an annual cost savings of $23.15 million. A sensitivity analysis showed that the administration of tranexamic acid was the dominant strategy at all probabilities of maternal death owing to hemorrhage > 0.00002. When the cost of tranexamic acid was varied, the administration of tranexamic acid remained dominant up to a cost of $267 per administration in the United States if given within the first 3 hours. Furthermore, in a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the early administration of tranexamic acid remained the dominant strategy (both lowered costs and improved outcomes) in 99.8% of models.

Conclusion

Early administration of tranexamic acid was a cost-effective strategy for reducing maternal morbidity and mortality owing to postpartum hemorrhage in the United States.

### Understanding the neuroprotective effect of tranexamic acid: an exploratory analysis of the CRASH-3 randomised trial [^116azPn2]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The acute management of traumatic brain injury (TBI) aims to avoid secondary brain damage and optimise conditions for recovery. The day of the injury is the most hazardous, accounting for one third of in-hospital deaths. Some TBI victims have brain damage that is incompatible with life and die shortly after admission. In many patients, intracranial bleeding starts soon after impact and continues for several hours, with the majority of haematoma expansion occurring within 1–1.5 h of injury. The accumulating blood can increase intracranial pressure, causing cerebral herniation and death. Tranexamic acid reduces bleeding in surgery and reduces death from bleeding in traumatic and post-partum haemorrhage. The therapeutic premise of the CRASH-3 trial was that timely tranexamic acid treatment might curtail intracranial bleeding and prevent some of the early bleeding-related deaths. A 1-g bolus started within 3 h of injury was followed by an infusion of 1 g over 8 h. Tranexamic acid has a half-life of 2 h and by the second day is almost completely eliminated. By this time, the bleeding will have stopped, but other pathological processes, likely unaffected by tranexamic acid, will continue to cause deaths. Those who survive the first day run the risk of cerebral oedema, diffuse axonal injury, organ failure, sepsis, pneumonia and many other threats, some iatrogenic, that make up the remaining two thirds of in-hospital deaths.

The management of TBI is only partly based on results from randomised trials. In practice, doctors draw on pathophysiological knowledge, the available evidence and their clinical experience to identify mechanisms of brain damage and target physiologically based treatment accordingly. Large randomised trials can reduce our therapeutic uncertainty, but to categorise them as positive or negative based on arbitrary p value thresholds is inappropriate. The CRASH-3 trial results have variously been described as 'negative', 'neutral' or 'a win for patients with head injury' that will benefit patients. We argue that randomised trials can deepen our understanding of pathophysiology and that mechanistic insights should inform their interpretation. To explore the mechanism of action of tranexamic acid in TBI patients, we examined the timing of its effect on death. We also set the results of our analysis in the context of other trials of tranexamic acid in TBI and polytrauma patients, taking into consideration current treatment guidelines that exclude patients with isolated TBI.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Before Extraction: Administer 10 mg/kg actual body weight of Tranexamic acid injection intravenously with replacement therapy. (2.1)
After Extraction: Administer 10 mg/kg actual body weight 3 to 4 times daily for 2 to 8 days. Infuse no more than 1 mL/minute to avoid hypotension. (2.1).
Reduce the dosage for patients with renal impairment. (2.2, 8.6)

2.1 Recommended Dosage

The recommended dose of Tranexamic acid is 10 mg/kg actual body weight intravenously administered as a single dose, immediately before tooth extractions. Infuse no more than 1 mL/minute to avoid hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Following tooth extraction, Tranexamic acid may be administered for 2 to 8 days at a dose of 10 mg/kg actual body weight 3 to 4 times daily, intravenously.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

For intravenous infusion, Tranexamic acid Injection may be mixed with most solutions for infusion such as electrolyte solutions, carbohydrate solutions, amino acid solutions, and Dextran solutions. Heparin may be added to Tranexamic acid Injection. Tranexamic acid Injection should NOT be mixed with blood. The drug is a synthetic amino acid and should NOT be mixed with solutions containing penicillin.

Discard any unused portion.

The diluted mixture may be stored for up to 4 hours at room temperature prior to patient administration.

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Patients with Varying Degrees of Renal Impairment*

For patients with moderate to severe impaired renal function, the following dosages are recommended:

* Dose reduction is recommended for all doses, both before and after tooth extraction.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Distribution

The initial volume of distribution is about 9 to 12 liters. The plasma protein binding of tranexamic acid is about 3% at therapeutic plasma levels and seems to be fully accounted for by its binding to plasminogen. Tranexamic acid does not bind to serum albumin.

Elimination

After an intravenous dose of 1 g, the plasma concentration time curve shows a triexponential decay with a half-life of about 2 hours for the terminal elimination phase.

Excretion

Urinary excretion is the main route of elimination via glomerular filtration. Overall renal clearance is equal to overall plasma clearance (110 to 116 mL/min), and more than 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Excretion of tranexamic acid is about 90% at 24 hours after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg body weight.

Specific Populations

Patients with Renal Impairment

The blood levels of tranexamic acid are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary excretion following a single intravenous injection of tranexamic acid declines as renal function decreases. Following a single 10 mg/kg intravenous injection of tranexamic acid, the 24-hour urinary fractions of tranexamic acid with serum creatinine concentrations 1.4–2.8, 2.8–5.7, and greater than 5.7 mg/dL were 51, 39, and 19%, respectively. The 24-hour tranexamic acid plasma concentrations for these patients demonstrated a direct relationship to the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Drug Interaction Studies

No studies of interactions between Tranexamic acid and other drugs have been conducted.

### Prehospital tranexamic acid for severe trauma [^116mAGwJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study PATCH-Trauma was published by PATCH-Trauma Investigators and the ANZICS Clinical Trials Group and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Traumatic hemorrhage. In the PATCH-Trauma study, the trial question was: what is the role of prehospital administration of tranexamic acid in patients with major trauma and suspected trauma-induced coagulopathy? In the PATCH-Trauma study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PATCH-Trauma study, the population was: 1300 patients (382 female, 918 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with major trauma who were at risk for trauma-induced coagulopathy. In the PATCH-Trauma study, the interventions were: n = 657 tranexamic acid (1 g bolus before hospital admission, followed by a 1 g infusion over a period of 8 hours after arrival at the hospital) n = 643 placebo (matching placebo). In the PATCH-Trauma study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in survival with a favorable functional outcome at 6 months after injury (53.7% vs. 53.5%; RR 1, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.12). In the PATCH-Trauma study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death from any cause at day 28 (17.3% vs. 21.8%; RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.99) No significant difference in death from any cause at 6 months (19% vs. 22.9%; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.03) Significant decrease in death from any cause at 24 hours (9.7% vs. 14.1%; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.94). In the PATCH-Trauma study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in vascular occlusive events, other adverse events. In the PATCH-Trauma study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with major trauma who were at risk for trauma-induced coagulopathy, tranexamic acid was not superior to placebo with respect to survival with a favorable functional outcome at 6 months after injury.

### Tranexamic acid for preventing postpartum haemorrhage [^114wFbC9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of labour. Several options for preventing PPH are available, but further advances in this field are important, especially the identification of safe, easy to use and cost-effective regimens. Tranexamic acid (TA), which is an antifibrinolytic agent that is used widely to prevent and treat haemorrhage, merits evaluation to assess whether it meets these criteria.

Objectives

To determine, from the best available evidence, whether TA is effective and safe for preventing PPH in comparison to placebo or no treatment (with or without uterotonic co-treatment), or to uterotonic agents.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 January 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

All published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of TA alone or in addition to uterotonics in the third stage of labour or during caesarean section (CS) to prevent PPH.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all the potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy. We entered the data into Review Manager software and checked for accuracy.

Main Results

Twelve trials involving 3285 healthy women at low risk of excessive bleeding undergoing elective CS (nine trials, 2453 participants) or spontaneous birth (three trials, 832 participants) satisfied inclusion criteria and contributed data to the analysis. All participants received routine prophylactic uterotonics in accordance with the local guideline in addition to TA or placebo or no intervention. Overall, included studies had moderate risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, selective reporting and low risk of bias for incomplete data. The quality of evidence was also as assessed using GRADE. Blood loss greater than 400 mL or 500 mL, and more than 1000 mL was less common in women who received TA versus placebo or no intervention (risk ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 0.63, six trials, 1398 women; moderate quality evidence) and (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.71, six trials, 2093 women; moderate quality evidence), respectively. TA was effective in decreasing the incidence of blood loss greater than 1000 mL in women who had undergone CS (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23, 0.78, four trials, 1534 women), but not vaginal birth (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.06, 1.36, two trials 559 women). The effect of TA on blood loss greater than 500 mL or 400 mL was more pronounced in the group of women having vaginal birth than in women who had CS. Mean blood loss (from delivery until two hours postpartum) was lower in women who received TA versus placebo or no intervention (mean difference MD - 77.79 mL, 95% CI -97.95, -57.64, five trials, 1186 women) and this effect was similar following vaginal birth and CS. Additional medical interventions (moderate quality evidence) and blood transfusions were less frequent in women receiving TA versus placebo or no interventions. Mild side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness were more common with the use of TA (moderate quality evidence). The effect of TA on maternal mortality, severe morbidity and thromboembolic events is uncertain (low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

TA (in addition to uterotonic medications) decreases postpartum blood loss and prevents PPH and blood transfusions following vaginal birth and CS in women at low risk of PPH based on studies of mixed quality. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about serious side effects, but there is an increase in the incidence of minor side effects with the use of TA. Effects of TA on thromboembolic events and mortality as well as its use in high-risk women should be investigated further.

Compared with women in the placebo group, there were fewer deaths within 24 h (pooled OR 0.76 [95% CI 0.62–0.94]; high-quality evidence) and fewer deaths from bleeding (0.81 [0.66–1.00]) among women in the tranexamic acid group. No significant difference was identified between groups with regard to the proportion of women with a shock index of 1.4 or greater (0.97 [0.76–1.24]; high-quality evidence).

No differences were identified between tranexamic acid and placebo groups with regard to surgical interventions (pooled OR 0.79 [95% CI 0.43–1.44]; moderate-quality evidence), hysterectomy when given before diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage (1.08 [0.48–2.45]), or after diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage (1.02 [0.87–1.20]), blood transfusion (1.00 [0.95–1.04]) or transfer to a higher level of care (admission to an intensive care unit in all cases; 1.00 [0.91–1.10]). Fewer women received additional uterotonics in the tranexamic acid group than the placebo group (0.92 [0.86–0.98]), but there was statistical heterogeneity between trials (heterogeneity p = 0.01). The mean peripartum decrease in haemoglobin concentration was smaller in the tranexamic acid group than the placebo group (pooled mean difference 0.64 g/L [95% CI 0.39–0.89]; moderate-quality evidence), but there was significant heterogeneity between trials (heterogeneity p = 0.0002).

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, the authors of this meta-analysis provide evidence that TXA administration is safe and effective at reducing the risk of hematoma risk in body contouring procedures. Systemic administration appears to outperform topical dosing for risk of hematoma and wound-healing issues, whereas topical TXA was more effective in reducing surgical-site infections. Additional high-quality randomized trials are needed to strengthen the evidence base, clarify the optimal treatment regimen, and thoroughly evaluate the safety profile of TXA in body contouring surgery.

### Tranexamic acid (tranexamic acid in sodium chloride) [^1141eDW9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

Available data from published studies, case series and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimester and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are 2 (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors the risk of major birth defects with use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data).

Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times (mouse), 6 times (rat), and 3 times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data).

The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For decisions regarding the use of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection during pregnancy, the potential risk of Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection administration on the fetus should always be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tranexamic Acid in Sodium Chloride Injection; an accurate risk-benefit evaluation should drive the treating physician's decision.

Tranexamic acid

Multiple trauma trials report the benefit of antifibrinolytic use of tranexamic acid (TXA) with early administration in severely injured patients. However, despite its extensive use, administration for severe (isolated) traumatic brain injury and gastrointestinal bleeding is debated due to the potential of increased thromboembolic risk. In trauma patients, there is concern regarding administering TXA in patients who demonstrate fibrinolytic shutdown, a consideration based on observational data reporting the association of TXA with fibrinolytic shutdown and mortality. However, in European guidelines, TXA is routinely administered.

### Risk of venous and arterial thrombosis in non-surgical patients receiving systemic tranexamic acid: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1158g4vg]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Antifibrinolytic agents such as tranexamic acid (TXA) are commonly used as adjunctive therapies to prevent and treat excessive bleeding. In non-surgical settings, TXA is known to reduce bleeding related mortality. However, impact of TXA use on thrombosis is uncertain.

Methods

We systematically searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases from January 1985 to August 2018. Studies with the following characteristics were included: (i) RCT design; (ii) compared systemic (oral or intravenous) TXA for prevention or treatment of bleeding for non-surgical indications and placebo or no TXA, and (iii) reported thrombotic events or mortality. A Mantel-Haenzel, random-effects model was used to calculate risk ratios, and risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

Results

Our search identified 22 studies representing 49,538 patients. Those receiving TXA had a significantly lower risk of death from any cause (RR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.87–0.98; I² = 0%). There was no significant increase in the risk of stroke (RR = 1.10; 95% CI = 0.68–1.78; I² = 31%), myocardial infarction (RR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.43–1.84; I² = 46%), pulmonary embolism (RR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.75–1.26; I² = 0%), or deep vein thrombosis (RR = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.70–1.41; I² = 0%) from use of TXA. The results were similar when restricted to studies at low risk of bias.

Conclusions

In our systematic review and meta-analysis, the use of tranexamic acid reduced all-cause mortality without increased risk of venous or arterial thrombotic complications.

### The importance of early treatment with tranexamic acid in bleeding trauma patients: an exploratory analysis of the CRASH-2 randomised controlled trial [^114JNk6E]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

The aim of the CRASH-2 trial was to assess the effects of early administration of tranexamic acid on death, vascular occlusive events, and blood transfusion in trauma patients with significant haemorrhage. Tranexamic acid significantly reduced all-cause mortality. Because tranexamic acid is thought to exert its effect through inhibition of fibrinolysis, we undertook exploratory analyses of its effect on death due to bleeding.

Methods

The CRASH-2 trial was undertaken in 274 hospitals in 40 countries. 20,211 adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding were randomly assigned within 8 h of injury to either tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 min followed by infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or placebo. Patients were randomly assigned by selection of the lowest numbered treatment pack from a box containing eight numbered packs that were identical apart from the pack number. Both participants and study staff (site investigators and trial coordinating centre staff) were masked to treatment allocation. We examined the effect of tranexamic acid on death due to bleeding according to time to treatment, severity of haemorrhage as assessed by systolic blood pressure, Glasgow coma score (GCS), and type of injury. All analyses were by intention to treat. The trial is registered as ISRCTN86750102, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00375258, and South African Clinical Trial Register/Department of Health DOH-27–0607–1919.

Findings

10,096 patients were allocated to tranexamic acid and 10,115 to placebo, of whom 10,060 and 10,067, respectively, were analysed. 1063 deaths (35%) were due to bleeding. We recorded strong evidence that the effect of tranexamic acid on death due to bleeding varied according to the time from injury to treatment (test for interaction p < 0.0001). Early treatment (≤ 1 h from injury) significantly reduced the risk of death due to bleeding (198/3747 [5.3%] events in tranexamic acid group vs 286/3704 [7.7%] in placebo group; relative risk [RR] 0.68, 95% CI 0.57–0.82; p < 0.0001). Treatment given between 1 and 3 h also reduced the risk of death due to bleeding (147/3037 [4.8%] vs 184/2996 [6.1%]; RR 0.79, 0.64–0.97; p = 0.03). Treatment given after 3 h seemed to increase the risk of death due to bleeding (144/3272 [4.4%] vs 103/3362 [3.1%]; RR 1.44, 1.12–1.84; p = 0.004). We recorded no evidence that the effect of tranexamic acid on death due to bleeding varied by systolic blood pressure, Glasgow coma score, or type of injury.

Interpretation

Tranexamic acid should be given as early as possible to bleeding trauma patients. For trauma patients admitted late after injury, tranexamic acid is less effective and could be harmful.

### Tranexamic acid for preventing postpartum haemorrhage after vaginal birth [^1174eKSU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is common and potentially life-threatening. The antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid (TXA) is thought to be effective for treating PPH. There is growing interest in whether TXA is effective for preventing PPH after vaginal birth. In randomised controlled trials (RCTs), TXA has been associated with increased risk of seizures and unexplained increased mortality when given more than three hours after traumatic bleeding. Reliable evidence on the effects, cost-effectiveness and safety of prophylactic TXA is required before considering widespread use. This review updates one published in 2015.

Objectives

To assess the effects of TXA for preventing PPH compared to placebo or no treatment (with or without uterotonic co-treatment) in women following vaginal birth.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and WHO ICTRP (to 6 September 2024). We also searched reference lists of retrieved studies.

Eligibility Criteria

We included RCTs evaluating TXA alone or in addition to standard care (uterotonics) for preventing PPH following vaginal birth. For this update, we required trials to be prospectively registered (before participant recruitment), and we applied a trustworthiness checklist.

Outcomes

Critical outcomes were blood loss ≥ 500 mL and blood loss ≥ 1000 mL. Important outcomes included maternal death, severe morbidity, blood transfusion, receipt of additional surgical interventions to control PPH, thromboembolic events, receipt of additional uterotonics, hysterectomy, and maternal satisfaction.

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 1) to assess the risk of bias in the studies.

Synthesis Methods

Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and assessed trial trustworthiness. We used random-effects meta-analysis to combine data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Included Studies

We included three RCTs with 18,974 participants in total. The trials were conducted in both high- and low-resource settings and involved participants at both low and high risk of PPH. The trials compared intravenous TXA (1 g) and standard care versus placebo (saline) and standard care. After applying our trustworthiness checklist, we did not include any of the 12 trials in the previous version of this review.

Synthesis Of Results

Prophylactic tranexamic acid in addition to standard care compared to placebo in addition to standard care TXA results in little to no difference in blood loss ≥ 500 mL (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.06; 2 studies, 18,897 participants; 5 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 15 fewer to 5 more; high-certainty evidence). TXA likely results in little to no difference in blood loss ≥ 1000 mL (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.07; 2 studies, 18,897 participants; 3 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 1 more; moderate-certainty evidence). TXA likely results in little to no difference in severe morbidity (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.12; 1 study, 15,066 participants; 2 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 2 more; moderate-certainty evidence). TXA results in little to no difference in receipt of blood transfusion (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06; 3 studies, 18,972 participants; 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 10 fewer to 12 more; high-certainty evidence). TXA may result in little to no difference in receipt of additional surgical interventions to control PPH (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.23; 2 studies, 18,972 participants; 1 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 2 fewer to 1 more; low-certainty evidence). In women with anaemia, TXA results in little to no difference in receipt of additional uterotonics (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.10; 1 study, 15,066 participants; 3 more women per 1000, 95% CI 8 fewer to 24 more; high-certainty evidence). In women with no anaemia, TXA results in a slight reduction in receipt of additional uterotonics (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.92; 1 study, 3891 participants; 24 fewer women per 1000, 95% CI 38 fewer to 8 fewer; high-certainty evidence). TXA likely results in little to no difference in maternal satisfaction. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of TXA on maternal death, thromboembolic events, and hysterectomy (very low-certainty evidence): maternal death (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.49; 2 studies, 15,081 participants; 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 2 more); thromboembolic events (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.24; 3 studies, 18,774 participants; 3 fewer women per 10,000, 95% CI 4 fewer to 5 more); hysterectomy (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.19; 1 study, 15,066 participants; 1 fewer women per 10,000, 95% CI 9 fewer to 16 more).

Authors' Conclusions

Adding prophylactic TXA to standard care of women during vaginal birth makes little to no difference to blood loss ≥ 500 mL and likely makes little to no difference to blood loss ≥ 1000 mL or the risk of severe morbidity, compared to placebo and standard care. TXA may result in little to no difference in additional surgical interventions to control PPH and results in little to no difference in blood transfusions. One trial found that TXA reduced the use of additional uterotonics in women without anaemia, whereas the largest trial found little to no difference in the use of additional uterotonics in women with anaemia. Although there were very few serious adverse events reported, the evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about the effect of TXA on maternal death, thromboembolic events, hysterectomy, or seizures. TXA likely results in little to no difference in maternal satisfaction. These findings are based mainly on two large trials. In the smaller of these, less than 30% of study participants were at high risk of PPH. In the largest trial, all participants had moderate to severe anaemia. Those making decisions about routine administration of prophylactic TXA for all women having vaginal births should consider that current evidence does not show a benefit of TXA for blood loss outcomes and related morbidity, and the evidence is very uncertain about serious adverse events.

### The effect of tranexamic acid on postpartum bleeding in women with moderate and severe anaemia (WOMAN-2): an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111EoMYm]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid, given within 3 h of birth, reduces bleeding deaths in women with postpartum haemorrhage. We examined whether giving tranexamic acid shortly after birth can prevent postpartum haemorrhage in women with moderate or severe anaemia.

Methods

This international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done in 34 hospitals across four countries (Nigeria, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Zambia). We recruited women of any age in active labour with moderate or severe anaemia (haemoglobin < 100 g/L). We randomly assigned women (1:1) who had given birth vaginally to receive 1 g of tranexamic acid or matching placebo by slow intravenous injection (over 10 min) within 15 min of the umbilical cord being cut or clamped. Women were randomly assigned by selection of the lowest numbered treatment pack from a box containing 20 packs that were identical apart from the pack number. Participants, care givers, and those assessing outcomes were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was a clinical diagnosis of primary postpartum haemorrhage, which might be an estimated blood loss of more than 500 mL or any blood loss sufficient to compromise haemodynamic stability within 24 h of randomisation, analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Safety analyses were performed in all participants included in the intention-to-treat population. This trial was registered on ISRCTN (ISRCTN62396133), ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03475342), and the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR201909735842379) and is closed to recruitment.

Findings

From Aug 24, 2019, to Sept 19, 2023, 16586 women aged 14–50 years were invited to take part and 1518 were excluded. 7580 women were randomly assigned to receive tranexamic acid and 7488 to receive placebo. Primary outcome data were unavailable for one woman in each group. The median time interval from the start of the administration of the trial treatment to the diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage was 18.5 min (IQR 5–58); 20 min (8–64) in women with moderate anaemia and 13 min (7–44) in women with severe anaemia. 358 (35%) of 1024 with postpartum haemorrhage for whom time data were available were diagnosed before the trial treatment had been fully administered. Clinically diagnosed postpartum haemorrhage occurred in 530 (7.0%) of 7579 in the tranexamic acid group and in 497 (6.6%) of 7487 in the placebo group (risk ratio [RR] 1.05, 95% CI 0.94–1.19). There was no strong evidence against the null hypothesis of homogeneity of effects for any of the prespecified subgroup analyses: severity of anaemia (p = 0.44), antepartum haemorrhage (p = 0.044), birth canal trauma (p = 0.37), use of pain control (p = 0.37), and baseline risk of postpartum haemorrhage (p = 0.31). There were no vascular occlusive events (pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, stroke, and myocardial infarction) reported in either group. There were no adverse events related to the treatment and no treatment-related deaths.

Interpretation

In women with moderate and severe anaemia, giving tranexamic acid within 15 min of the umbilical cord being clamped did not reduce the risk of clinically diagnosed postpartum haemorrhage.

### Post-partum haemorrhage and tranexamic acid: a global issue [^114sngJJ]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Post-partum haemorrhage (PPH) remains the major cause of maternal death worldwide, with the overwhelming majority of bleeding deaths occurring in low income countries. These bleeding deaths occur due to a complex network of biological and socioeconomic factors, including changes to haemostasis and fibrinolysis during pregnancy. Tranexamic acid (TxA) has been shown to reduce death in bleeding trauma patients safely and is effective in reducing bleeding in surgical patients, however its role in PPH has been less well established. We discuss the impact of the recently published World Maternal Antifibrinolytic (WOMAN) trial, which demonstrated a significant reduction in bleeding deaths (Risk ratio 0.81) in women with PPH who received intravenous TxA compared to those receiving placebo. There were no increases in post-partum thrombotic rates in mothers or breast-fed babies. This trial has shown that intravenous TxA can be used safely and effectively to treat PPH, and should be implemented widely to reduce death due to PPH. However, for the full benefit of TxA to be fully realised in resource-constrained settings, the effectiveness of oral or topical administration and/or pre-emptive dosing need to be investigated.

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^115tcgqk]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic anti-fibrinolytic amino acid derivative of lysine that acts by competitively blocking the lysine binding sites on plasminogen, thereby inhibiting its interaction with formed plasmin and fibrin. Inhibition of plasminogen activation results in the stabilization of the preformed fibrin mesh-work produced by the coagulation cascade. Thanks to its ability to inhibit fibrinolysis and clot degradation TXA, which is approved for intravenous, oral and topical applications, has been successfully employed to prevent or decrease blood loss in a variety of clinical conditions characterized by excessive bleeding. There is indeed consistent evidence that the early administration of TXA confers a survival benefit in the setting of severe trauma, and post-partum hemorrhage without an increase in thromboembolic events. In addition, this agent has been successfully used to decrease blood loss in numerous surgical specialties, especially in the frame of cardiac and major orthopedic surgery. – For this reason, TXA is currently considered a fundamental pillar of the Patient Blood Management (PBM) programs of transfusion medicine, aimed at minimizing blood loss and thus exposure of patients undergoing elective surgery to allogeneic blood. – In this narrative review we summarize the most recent clinical evidence on the use of TXA for prevention or treatment of bleeding.

### Tranexamic acid [^113PbLWx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure.

The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains 4 to 5 lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 μmol/L) and 1 with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 μmol/L). The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Tranexamic acid, in concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours, and in the serum, up to 7 or 8 hours.

Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects.

Strength of recommendation Strong. Supporting evidence includes direct meta-analysis of six high-quality studies in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) showing no additional benefit from multiple doses, network meta-analysis showing no additional benefit for multiple doses of intravenous TXA compared with a single dose, and primary TKA results supporting no benefit for multiple doses of intravenous or oral TXA compared with a single dose.

### Optimizing tranexamic acid use in adult cardiac surgery: from rationale to clinical practice [^1147pH76]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) has emerged as a cornerstone in blood conservation strategies for cardiac surgery. This comprehensive review synthesizes current evidence on TXA's efficacy, safety, and optimal use in various cardiac surgical procedures. We examine the pharmacological properties of TXA, its historical development as an antifibrinolytic agent, and its evolution in cardiac surgical practice. The review critically evaluates key clinical trials and meta-analyses demonstrating TXA's efficacy in reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements across a spectrum of cardiac surgeries, including coronary artery bypass grafting, valve procedures, and aortic surgery. Special consideration is given to its use in pediatric cardiac surgery. We address ongoing debates surrounding optimal dosing strategies, timing of administration, and integration with other hemostatic interventions. The safety profile of TXA is thoroughly examined, with particular focus on the risk of seizures and thromboembolic events. The review also explores practical aspects of TXA implementation in clinical practice, including its role in comprehensive blood management protocols and potential cost-effectiveness. Emerging research areas, such as pharmacokinetic-guided dosing and topical TXA application, are discussed. Finally, we outline future directions and research priorities, including the need for long-term outcome studies and refinement of patient-specific protocols. This review provides a balanced assessment of TXA's role in modern cardiac surgery, offering clinicians and researchers a comprehensive resource for optimizing its use to improve patient outcomes while minimizing potential risks.

Guideline Question 3 — Dose amount of tranexamic acid (TXA) in primary total joint arthroplasty (TJA): Within the context of the TXA doses used in primary TJA, the dose amount of TXA was not found to significantly affect its reduction of calculated blood loss or the need for transfusion during the perioperative episode of a primary TJA. The strength of recommendation is Strong. Supporting details note that network meta-analysis demonstrates no additional reduction in blood loss with high-dose intravenous (IV) TXA compared to low-dose IV TXA and that analyses of topical TXA reported no statistical difference between low-dose and high-dose regimens. Reported dose ranges in the network meta-analysis include IV TXA at 10 mg/kg and 3 doses of 15 mg/kg, and topical TXA between 0.5 g and 3 g.

### Tranexamic acid for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage [^115UX9sL]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal mortality, accounting for one-quarter of all maternal deaths worldwide. Uterotonics after birth are the only intervention that has been shown to be effective for PPH prevention. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic agent, has therefore been investigated as a potentially useful complement to this for both prevention and treatment because its hypothesized mechanism of action in PPH supplements that of uterotonics and because it has been proved to reduce blood loss in elective surgery, bleeding in trauma patients, and menstrual blood loss. This review covers evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for PPH prevention after caesarean (n = 10) and vaginal (n = 2) deliveries and for PPH treatment after vaginal delivery (n = 1). It discusses its efficacy and side effects overall and in relation to the various doses studied for both indications. TXA appears to be a promising drug for the prevention and treatment of PPH after both vaginal and caesarean delivery. Nevertheless, the current level of evidence supporting its efficacy is insufficient, as are the data about its benefit:harm ratio. Large, adequately powered multicentre RCTs are required before its widespread use for preventing and treating PPH can be recommended.

### Oral modified-release tranexamic acid for heavy menstrual bleeding [^115EEs4y]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety profile of an oral modified-release (MR) formulation of tranexamic acid.

Data Sources

Literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1966-July 2012), Iowa Drug Information Service (1997-July 2012), and bibliographies of pertinent articles. Search terms included tranexamic acid, Lysteda, menorrhagia, menstrual blood loss, and heavy menstrual bleeding.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All available English-language abstracts and human studies were identified for review. Data provided by the manufacturer and the Food and Drug Administration were also evaluated. Efficacy was evaluated in 2 clinical trials, change in quality of life was evaluated in 3 clinical trials, and safety was evaluated in 4 clinical trials.

Data Synthesis

Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine analogue with antifibrinolytic activity. It interferes with the binding of plasminogen to fibrin, resulting in enhanced fibrin clot integrity. A novel MR formulation of oral tranexamic acid is approved for treatment of cyclic heavy menstrual bleeding. MR tranexamic acid is initiated at the beginning of heavy menstrual bleeding and can be taken for up to 5 days per cycle. Clinical trials show it to be safe and effective. Dosage adjustments are needed for women with renal insufficiency. Adverse effects are considered mild to moderate, with the most common being menstrual discomfort, headache, and back pain. The most significant safety concerns relate to the risk of thromboembolism.

Conclusions

MR tranexamic acid offers a new first-line therapy for patients with cyclic heavy menstrual bleeding. It is reported to be safe and effective. There are no labeled equivalents to MR tranexamic acid for cyclic heavy menstrual bleeding.

### Tranexamic acid for preventing postpartum haemorrhage after caesarean section [^116q3pTk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Rationale

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is common and potentially life‐threatening. The antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid (TXA) is recommended for treating PPH; it reduces the risk of death from haemorrhage by one‐third when given soon after bleeding onset, but not overall risk of death. Interest in whether TXA may be effective in preventing PPH is growing. Evidence indicates that TXA given more than three hours after injury to bleeding trauma patients increases mortality. Potential harm becomes critical in prophylactic use of TXA. Reliable evidence of the effect and safety profile of TXA is required before widespread prophylactic use can be considered.

Objectives

To assess the effects of TXA for preventing PPH compared to placebo or no treatment (with or without uterotonic co‐treatment) in women during caesarean birth.

Search methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and WHO ICTRP to 20 February 2024 and searched reference lists of retrieved studies.

Eligibility criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of TXA alone or plus uterotonics during caesarean birth for preventing PPH. Trials needed to be prospectively registered (i.e. before starting recruitment). We applied a trustworthiness checklist.

Outcomes

The critical outcome was blood loss ≥ 1000 mL, measured using estimated or calculated methods.

Important outcomes included maternal death, severe morbidity, blood transfusion, the use of additional surgical interventions to control PPH, thromboembolic events, use of additional uterotonics, hysterectomy, maternal satisfaction, and breastfeeding at discharge.

Risk of bias

We assessed risk of bias in the included studies using Cochrane's RoB 1 tool.

Synthesis methods

Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and trial trustworthiness. We pooled data using random‐effects meta‐analysis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Included studies

We included six RCTs with 15,981 participants. All 12 trials in the previous version of this review were not included after review of trial registrations and trustworthiness checklists. Most included studies involved women at low risk of PPH and were conducted in high‐resource settings.

Synthesis of results

Prophylactic TXA in addition to standard care compared to placebo in addition to standard care or standard care alone

TXA results in little to no difference in estimated blood loss ≥ 1000 mL (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.11; 4 RCTs; n = 13,042; high certainty evidence), resulting in 8 fewer per 1000 women having estimated blood loss ≥ 1000 mL (from 30 fewer to 16 more). TXA likely results in a slight reduction in calculated blood loss ≥ 1000 mL (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92; 2 RCTs; n = 4327; moderate certainty evidence), resulting in 53 fewer per 1000 having calculated blood loss ≥ 1000 mL (from 75 fewer to 25 fewer).

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of TXA on maternal death (one event in placebo group, none in TXA group). No trials measured severe morbidity.

TXA likely results in little to no difference in blood transfusion (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.08; 5 RCTs; n = 15,740; moderate certainty evidence), resulting in 4 fewer per 1000 women requiring a blood transfusion (from 10 fewer to 3 more).

TXA results in little to no difference in additional surgical interventions to control PPH (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22; 4 RCTs; n = 15,631; high certainty evidence), resulting in 1 more per 1000 women requiring additional surgical intervention (from 4 fewer to 7 more).

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of TXA on thromboembolic events (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.22 to 8.90; 4 RCTs; n = 14,480; very low certainty evidence), resulting in 1 more per 1000 women having a thromboembolic event (from 2 fewer to 17 more).

TXA results in little to no difference in the need for additional uterotonics (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; 4 RCTs; n = 15,728; high certainty evidence), resulting in 15 fewer per 1000 women requiring additional uterotonics (from 27 fewer to 0 fewer).

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of TXA on hysterectomy (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.20 to 3.29; 2 RCTs; n = 4546; very low certainty evidence), resulting in 3 fewer per 10,000 women requiring a hysterectomy (from 11 fewer to 31 more).

One trial measuring maternal satisfaction reported no difference between groups at day two postpartum.

No data were available on breastfeeding.

Overall, studies had low risk of bias. We downgraded the certainty of evidence mainly for imprecision.

Authors' conclusions

Prophylactic TXA in addition to standard care during caesarean birth results in little to no difference in estimated blood loss ≥ 1000 mL and likely results in a slight reduction in calculated blood loss ≥ 1000 mL compared to placebo.

There were no data for severe morbidity due to PPH. Event rates for further interventions to control PPH were low and similar across groups. Prophylactic TXA thus results in little to no difference between groups for additional surgical interventions (32 versus 31 per 1000), and likely results in little to no difference between groups for blood transfusions (31 versus 36 per 1000) and use of additional uterotonics (107 versus 121 per 1000).

There were very few events for the outcomes maternal death (1 in placebo group), thromboembolic events (2 versus 3 per 1000), and hysterectomy (1 per 1000 in each group). Evidence for these serious adverse events is therefore very uncertain.

Decisions about implementing routine prophylactic TXA during caesarean birth should not only consider outcomes related to blood loss, but also the relatively low rates of PPH morbidity and uncertainty of serious adverse events.

Most studies included women at low risk of PPH, thereby precluding any conclusions about women at high risk of PPH.

Cost associated with routine use of an additional drug for all caesarean births needs to be considered.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) in primary TJA — arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) — There is a paucity of randomized, clinical trials on the risk of ATE due to the administration of TXA intravenously, topically, and orally; however, the existing evidence does not suggest that TXA increases the risk of developing an ATE compared to placebo during the perioperative episode of a primary TJA. Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. The rationale notes that ATE following primary hip or knee arthroplasty are exceptionally infrequent complications and are rarely reported in randomized clinical trials.

### Tranexamic acid in the routine treatment of postpartum hemorrhage in the United States: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^113M9Jq4]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The World Maternal Antifibrinolytic trial demonstrated that tranexamic acid administered during postpartum hemorrhage reduces hemorrhage-related mortality and laparotomies. The World Health Organization has thus recommended early use of tranexamic acid in the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. This recommendation has not been universally adopted in the United States, in part because of concerns about cost-effectiveness.

Objective

We aim to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of routine tranexamic acid administration in the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage in the United States, where the rate of hemorrhage-related mortality is lower than that described in the World Maternal Antifibrinolytic trial.

Study Design

We constructed a decision tree comparing 3 strategies in women with a clinical diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage: no tranexamic acid, tranexamic acid given at any time, and ideal use of tranexamic acid given within 3 hours of delivery. The study was performed from a health care institution perspective with a time horizon of delivery until 6 weeks postpartum. We included interventions that differed by arm in the World Maternal Antifibrinolytic trial (hemorrhage-related mortality, laparotomies, and brace or compression sutures) and incorporated probabilities and costs based on available data for a population of women with postpartum hemorrhage in the United States. In our base case, the rate of postpartum hemorrhage-related mortality was 0.0388%, and the cost of tranexamic acid was $37.80. We assumed that the relative risk reduction in death and laparotomy with tranexamic acid would be similar to the World Maternal Antifibrinolytic trial (19% and 36%, respectively). The primary outcome was incremental cost per hemorrhage-related death averted, and a main secondary outcome was incremental cost per laparotomy avoided under each strategy. Another planned secondary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life-year. We anticipated that the risk reduction (benefit) because of tranexamic acid in the United States may be less than in the World Maternal Antifibrinolytic trial; thus, we performed 1-way and 2-way sensitivity analyses to explore the parameter uncertainty across a wide range of data-supported estimates. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses with Monte Carlo simulation were performed.

Results

Tranexamic acid strategies were dominant (more effective and cost saving) compared with no tranexamic acid for patients with postpartum hemorrhage in the United States. One-way analyses showed that tranexamic acid is cost saving as long as the relative risk reduction of death with tranexamic acid is greater than 4.7%; the model was not sensitive to any other variables. Threshold analyses outside the bounds defined in the model showed that tranexamic acid is cost saving as long as the relative risk reduction of laparotomy with tranexamic acid is greater than 7% or the cost of tranexamic acid is less than $194. A 2-way sensitivity analysis of the risk reduction of death because of tranexamic acid and the baseline risk of postpartum hemorrhage-related death confirmed that tranexamic acid is cost saving across a wide range of plausible estimates. Furthermore, probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the tranexamic acid strategies are cost saving in > 99.9% of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. Despite the initial cost of administration, the annual net cost savings expected from routine use of tranexamic acid for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage in the United States is $11.3 million, and we estimate that 9 maternal deaths would be averted in 1 year with this strategy. Giving tranexamic acid within 3 hours would almost triple the cost savings and improve maternal outcomes much further.

Conclusion

A policy of routine tranexamic acid early in the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage is likely to be cost saving in the United States. This conclusion holds true even when the relative risk reduction with tranexamic acid is significantly less than reported in the World Maternal Antifibrinolytic trial and when tranexamic acid is significantly more expensive than currently reported.

### Tranexamic acid for preventing postpartum haemorrhage after caesarean section [^115nFsYd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic drug that inhibits fibrinolysis by blocking the interaction between plasmin and fibrin. Since it was first identified in the early 1960s, TXA has primarily been used for heavy menstrual bleeding and for reducing bleeding during surgical procedures in high‐risk patients. More recently, early treatment with TXA has been shown to be effective in patients with life‐threatening haemorrhage caused by trauma and childbirth. In the CRASH 2 Trial, TXA given within one hour reduced mortality by 32%; given between one and three hours, by 21%; and beyond three hours TXA increased mortality by 44% (P = 0.004). The mechanism for this increase in mortality is unclear. TXA has multiple pharmacological effects. A pharmacovigilance study found a 32.6‐fold increase in adverse renal vascular and ischaemic conditions in women of childbearing age. The World Maternal Antifibrinolytic (WOMAN) trial assessed the effects of intravenous TXA in 20,060 participants with a clinical diagnosis of PPH. The results showed that TXA reduces the risk of bleeding to death after PPH by one‐third (risk ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.52 to 0.91; P = 0.008) when given within three hours of birth, with no apparent increase in adverse events. As a result, the WHO recommends early intravenous TXA as a treatment for established PPH. However, neither the overall risk of death, nor the risk of hysterectomy, nor both (the predefined primary outcome) was reduced.

Many deaths from PPH occur on the day of birth, most within the first few hours after. Thus, for many women who suffer a PPH, treatment is too late. This, coupled with the knowledge that TXA is most effective when given shortly after the onset of bleeding, provides reason to believe that prophylactic TXA could reduce the risk of PPH. The growing interest in prophylactic TXA has led to a growth in the number of randomised trials exploring its effects in the obstetric population. However, the quality of many of these trials has been questioned, and uncertainties around the effects of TXA remain unresolved.

### Tranexamic acid injection, usp… [^116feJ9x]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and Precautions, Risk of Medication Errors Due to Incorrect Route of Administration. 12/2020 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tranexamic acid injection is an antifibrinolytic indicated in patients with hemophilia for short-term use to reduce or prevent hemorrhage and reduce the need for replacement therapy during and following tooth extraction.
13. 1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
13. 2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology 16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Sections or subsections omitted from the full prescribing information are not listed. Tranexamic acid injection is indicated in patients with hemophilia for short-term use to reduce or prevent hemorrhage and reduce the need for replacement therapy during and following tooth extraction. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration.

Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to 3 times, 6 times, and 3 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively. Tranexamic acid is trans-4-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent. Tranexamic acid USP is a white or almost white, crystalline powder. The structural formula is Molecular Formula: C8H15NO2 Molecular Weight:

157.
2. Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative, which diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, preventing binding to fibrin monomers, thus preserving and stabilizing fibrin's matrix structure.

The high affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited.

### FDA alerts healthcare professionals about the risk of medication error… [^11786PKE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

FDA continues to receive reports of tranexamic acid injection being erroneously administered intrathecally instead of the intended intrathecal anesthetic for neuraxial anesthesia. These medication errors have resulted in severe outcomes, including death, disability, and prolonged hospitalization. FDA is conducting a safety evaluation and is investigating the issue. After the evaluation is complete, FDA will communicate any findings or additional actions that will help mitigate these medication errors. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration is alerting health care professionals about the risk of inadvertent intrathecal administration of tranexamic acid injection. Intrathecal administration of tranexamic acid injection may result in serious life-threatening injuries, including seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, paraplegia, permanent neurological injury, and death.

In most of the cases reported to FDA, tranexamic acid injection was erroneously administered instead of the intended intrathecal anesthetic for neuraxial anesthesia. Tranexamic acid injection is an antifibrinolytic indicated in patients with hemophilia for short-term use to reduce or prevent hemorrhage and reduce the need for replacement therapy during and following tooth extraction. Health care professionals should administer tranexamic acid injection by the intravenous route. It is supplied in single-dose ampules and single-dose vials containing 1, 000 mg tranexamic acid in 10 mL and is available as a generic drug product and under the proprietary name, Cyklokapron. The FDA is taking action to address tranexamic acid injection medication errors.

This includes revising the tranexamic acid injection container labels and carton labeling to highlight the recommended intravenous route of administration; and strengthening the warnings in the tranexamic acid prescribing information to include the risk of medication errors due to incorrect route of administration.
