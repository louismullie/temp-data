## Question

Any reported case of acute hep c, if not why it cannot present as acute and present as chronic case

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether acute hepatitis C exists and, if so, why it is often missed clinically, and how to reconcile this with the observation that many cases are diagnosed as chronic. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of acute versus chronic hepatitis C. Then, I should verify whether acute hepatitis C is a recognized entity with documented cases. Next, I will examine why acute cases are frequently missed, including diagnostic timing and test performance. After that, I should review the natural history and transition to chronicity. Finally, I will synthesize the clinical implications for diagnosis and treatment, including guideline-based recommendations for testing and when to treat acute infection [^114j1D6y].

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate terms. Acute hepatitis C is defined as the first 6 months following HCV exposure, whereas chronic hepatitis C is persistence of HCV RNA beyond 6 months; this 6‑month threshold is an operational convention used in guidelines and epidemiologic case definitions, not a biological discontinuity, but it is the standard framework for classification and management decisions [^114j1D6y].

> Wait, let me verify whether acute hepatitis C is a real, documented entity rather than a theoretical construct. Multiple high‑quality sources confirm that acute hepatitis C occurs and is clinically recognized: the AASLD/IDSA guidance explicitly addresses diagnosis and management of acute HCV infection, CDC surveillance documents enumerate reported acute cases, and peer‑reviewed series describe cohorts with seroconversion and early infection; moreover, case reports illustrate delayed seroconversion and spontaneous clearance, confirming bona fide acute presentations [^114j1D6y] [^113DT3su] [^113qFRzu] [^115LTcJJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about why it "can't present as acute". The apparent paradox arises because acute hepatitis C is frequently asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, and even when symptoms occur, they are nonspecific; jaundice occurs in a minority, and fulminant hepatic failure is exceedingly rare, so many acute infections are clinically silent and never come to medical attention during the acute window [^113qFRzu] [^112ZvPQv] [^116TSUJ8].

> I need to check the diagnostic challenges next, because missing the acute phase often reflects testing strategy rather than absence of disease. HCV RNA becomes detectable 1–2 weeks after exposure, whereas HCV antibodies typically appear 6–8 weeks or later, creating a serologic window during which antibody tests are falsely negative; thus, reliance on antibody testing alone in suspected acute infection will miss cases, and guidelines recommend concurrent or RNA‑first strategies in appropriate contexts to mitigate this gap [^112ZvPQv] [^114Q45zf] [^113qm2ZT] [^112fLM8J].

> Let me consider the populations at risk and ascertainment bias. Many new infections occur in people who inject drugs and in HIV‑positive men who have sex with men, groups with variable engagement in care and routine labs; acute infections are often uncovered incidentally during ALT surveillance or seroconversion studies rather than through symptom‑driven presentations, which further depresses recognition of bona fide acute cases in routine practice [^113DT3su] [^113qFRzu] [^115obvhd].

> Next, I should review the natural history to understand why many cases are ultimately labeled chronic. Approximately 20–50% of acutely infected individuals clear spontaneously within 6 months, but the majority persist beyond 6 months and are then classified as chronic; importantly, once viremia persists beyond roughly 12 weeks, the likelihood of spontaneous clearance declines, so many individuals who are finally diagnosed have already transitioned into chronic infection by the time they are evaluated [^113SmYqG] [^114j1D6y] [^11188Aea].

> I should double‑check the clinical implications for diagnosis so I don't overstate the window problem. In patients with suspected acute infection or recent exposure, guidelines recommend HCV RNA testing with or before antibody testing, and if initial tests are negative but suspicion remains high, repeat RNA and antibody testing over the ensuing weeks to months; reflex RNA after a reactive antibody is standard to confirm active infection and to distinguish resolved from current infection, which is crucial for case classification and linkage to care [^112fLM8J] [^112QFQYt] [^112TCXHv].

> Now, regarding treatment, I need to ensure I align with current guidance. Historically, some clinicians deferred therapy for 12 weeks to observe for spontaneous clearance, but contemporary AASLD/IDSA guidance recommends initiating DAA therapy at diagnosis of acute HCV with quantifiable viremia without waiting, using the same pangenotypic regimens and durations as for chronic infection; this test‑and‑treat approach reduces transmission and averts progression, and is echoed in HIV OI guidance for persons with HIV [^112YNodr] [^111TJtNb] [^111NW47T].

> But wait, what if someone argues that "most cases are chronic, so acute doesn't really exist"? That inference is incorrect; the high chronicity proportion reflects the biology and epidemiology of HCV, not the absence of an acute phase. The existence of acute hepatitis C is well established, but its silent presentation, diagnostic window, and delayed case finding explain why many individuals are first labeled as chronic when they finally enter care, which should motivate earlier RNA‑based testing in at‑risk populations and timely treatment to interrupt transmission and prevent progression [^113qFRzu] [^114j1D6y] [^113DT3su].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly: acute hepatitis C is a real and well‑documented clinical entity, but it is frequently asymptomatic, diagnostically challenging due to the antibody window, and under‑recognized in high‑risk populations; as a result, many cases are not identified until they have persisted beyond 6 months and are classified as chronic, which explains the apparent predominance of chronic diagnoses despite the existence of true acute infections [^113qFRzu] [^111JH1PH] [^114j1D6y].

Yes, acute hepatitis C (HCV) is a recognized clinical entity [^113qFRzu] and is reported in the literature and surveillance systems [^113DT3su]. It is defined as the first 6 months after infection [^114j1D6y] and is often asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic [^112ZvPQv], so many cases are missed or misclassified as chronic [^116VewdS]. Diagnosis requires **HCV RNA testing** [^113qFRzu] because antibodies can be delayed or absent early in infection [^113qm2ZT]. Most acute infections progress to chronicity if untreated [^114j1D6y], but early **DAA therapy** achieves high cure rates [^111seJrS] and is recommended without waiting for spontaneous clearance [^114ZYqxm].

---

## Evidence of reported acute hepatitis C cases

Multiple sources document **acute HCV infection**:

- **Surveillance data**: The CDC reports thousands of acute HCV cases annually in the US [^114vcovB], with 3,621 reported in 2018 and an estimated 50,300 cases after adjustment [^114vcovB].

- **Clinical literature**: Numerous studies and case reports describe acute HCV, including symptomatic and asymptomatic cases [^113qFRzu] [^111xubEH].

- **International reports**: Acute HCV is documented globally, including in Italy [^1139kvPL] and Germany [^116d959U].

---

## Clinical presentation of acute hepatitis C

Acute HCV is often silent or nonspecific, which contributes to underdiagnosis [^1158mqGp]:

- **Asymptomatic cases**: Most are asymptomatic or have mild, nonspecific symptoms (anorexia, fatigue, abdominal pain) [^112ZvPQv].

- **Symptomatic cases**: About 15–30% develop jaundice or more pronounced symptoms [^112ZvPQv].

- **Rare severe outcomes**: Fulminant hepatic failure is very rare (< 1%) [^116woNm2].

---

## Diagnostic challenges

Diagnosing acute HCV is difficult because of **silent presentation** and testing limitations:

- **Asymptomatic course**: Most cases are asymptomatic, so patients do not seek care [^113qFRzu].

- **Testing window**: HCV RNA is detectable 1–2 weeks after exposure, but antibodies can take 6–8 weeks or longer to appear, causing false negatives if only antibody testing is used [^113qm2ZT] [^112ZvPQv].

- **Fluctuating viremia**: RNA levels can fluctuate early in infection, complicating diagnosis [^111xubEH].

---

## Progression to chronic infection

Most acute HCV infections become chronic if untreated [^111xubEH]. The **chronicity rate** is about 75–85% [^115Z2dyG], and **risk factors** include asymptomatic infection, older age, male sex, HIV coinfection, and certain genotypes [^113SmYqG].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Early detection and treatment of acute HCV are critical to prevent chronic infection and complications [^116VewdS]. Current guidelines recommend **immediate treatment** with DAAs for acute HCV without waiting for spontaneous clearance [^114ZYqxm], which achieves high cure rates (> 95%) [^1149r6H4] and reduces transmission [^114j1D6y].

## Summary of evidence

| **Aspect** | **Evidence** |
|-|-|
| Existence of acute HCV | - Documented in surveillance [^113DT3su] <br/> - Clinical literature [^113qFRzu] <br/> - Case reports [^115LTcJJ] |
| Clinical presentation | - Often asymptomatic [^112ZvPQv] <br/> - Mild symptoms [^112ZvPQv] <br/> - Rare severe outcomes [^112ZvPQv] |
| Diagnostic challenges | - Asymptomatic course [^113qFRzu] <br/> - Testing window [^113qm2ZT] <br/> - Fluctuating viremia [^111xubEH] |
| Progression to chronicity | - 75–85% if untreated [^114j1D6y] [^112ZvPQv] |
| Management | Immediate DAA treatment recommended [^112YNodr] [^114ZYqxm] |

Acute hepatitis C is a **well-documented clinical entity** [^113qFRzu] that is frequently underdiagnosed due to its silent course and diagnostic challenges [^111xubEH]. Early detection and treatment are essential to prevent chronic infection and its complications [^111NW47T].

Introduction

The annual incidence of acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) has fallen in recent years, primarily because of effective blood screening efforts and increased education on the dangers of needle sharing. However, hepatitis C infection is still relatively frequent in certain populations. Most patients infected with HCV are unaware of their exposure and remain asymptomatic during the initial stages of the infection, making early diagnosis during the acute phase (first 6 months after infection) unlikely. While some of those infections will have a spontaneous resolution, the majority will progress to chronic HCV. We scanned the literature for predictors of spontaneous resolution and treatment during the acute stage of HCV to identify factors that would assist in treatment decision making.

Methods

A medical literature search through MEDLINE was conducted using the keyword "acute hepatitis C" with a variety of keywords focused on (a) epidemiology, (b) natural history and outcome, (c) diagnosis, (d) mode of transmission, and (e) treatment.

Results

There are no reliable predictors for spontaneous resolution of HCV infection and a significant percentage of individuals exposed to HCV develop persistent infections that progress to chronic liver disease. An intriguing approach is to treat acute HCV and prevent the development of chronic hepatitis. Several clinical trials showed that treatment of hepatitis C infection during the acute phase is associated with high sustained virological response (SVR) rates ranging between 75% and 100%. Although there is a prevailing consensus that intervention during the acute phase is associated with improved viral eradication, relevant clinical questions have remained unanswered by clinical trials. Optimization of therapy for acute hepatitis C infection and identification of predictors of SVR represent a real challenge.

Conclusion

With more than 170 million chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide and an increase in the related morbidity and mortality projected for the next decade, an improvement in our ability to diagnose and treat patients with acute hepatitis C would have a significant impact on the prevalence of chronic hepatitis and its associated complications particularly in countries with a high endemic background of the infection.

### Acute hepatitis C: current status and remaining challenges [^1158mqGp]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

The acute phase of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection represents a key point in the evolution of hepatitis C. In some patients, the infection resolves spontaneously, whereas in others it develops into chronic disease. However, because acute hepatitis C is often asymptomatic, detection and diagnosis are usually difficult. What is more, there are no established treatment guidelines, leaving physicians to make several challenging decisions, such as whether to treat, when to treat and what treatment regimen to use. Pegylated interferon alfa monotherapy is most commonly used to treat patients with acute hepatitis C; the role of ribavirin has yet to be established. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of acute hepatitis C, its risk factors and routes of transmission and current treatment practices. We also discuss data from published clinical studies and focus on unresolved issues for which additional studies are needed in order to establish standardized treatment guidelines for the management of acute hepatitis C.

### Distinct features in natural history and outcomes of acute hepatitis C [^111xubEH]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Although the incidence of acute hepatitis C (AHCV) has been declining in recent years, such cases continue to occur in the community in the setting of injection drug use (IDU), health care–associated (HCA) procedures, and/or sexual exposures as well as unknown risk factors.–While most untreated AHC progresses to chronicity, antiviral therapy–based on interferon α (IFNα) has been more effective when initiated during AHCV rather than with established chronic hepatitis C.–Thus, a timely diagnosis and therapy of AHCV can prevent liver disease progression while limiting further spread of HCV infection.

However, diagnosis of AHCV can be challenging due to a wide spectrum of clinical presentation from completely asymptomatic to acute icteric and symptomatic hepatitis as well as fluctuating course of viremia and transaminase elevation. Diagnostic criteria for AHCV can include documented anti-HCV seroconversion (77%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation (68%), and HCV-RNA detection (63%). It remains unclear as to when anti-HCV seroconversion occurs relative to the timing of clinical presentation and laboratory testing.HCV seroconversion may not even occur with low-level exposures. In this regard, > 1 log viremic fluctuations and low-titer HCV-RNA (uncommon in established chronic hepatitis C) support the diagnosis of AHCV.

Acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection — definition, epidemiology, and interim management are outlined as follows: Acute HCV infection is arbitrarily defined as the first 6 months of infection, with jaundice in a minority of patients (< 25%). In the United States, the CDC estimates that 44,300 acute HCV infections occurred in 2017 with the upper limit of the confidence interval being 151,000 cases, and an estimated 75% of persons acutely infected with HCV progress to chronic infection. Treatment as prevention has been observed in cohorts of HIV-positive men who have sex with men when unrestricted access to direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy resulted in an approximately 50% decrease in acute HCV infections. In the interim, current guidance is to treat with regimens and durations as recommended for chronic HCV infection until additional data on abbreviated treatment regimens become available.

Introduction

Hepatitis C is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality from liver disease, costing the U.S. health care system billions of dollars annually. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is primarily transmitted through direct percutaneous exposure to blood through injection drug use, but can also be transmitted sexually or from an infected mother to her infant during pregnancy or childbirth. HCV can cause an acute infection (acute hepatitis C), followed in some cases by chronic infection (chronic hepatitis C). Persons with acute hepatitis C are typically asymptomatic or have only a mild clinical illness. Acute hepatitis C infection might clear completely without any treatment, but > 50% of infections will progress to chronic hepatitis C, which is also typically asymptomatic until liver damage is severe enough to cause symptoms. Left untreated, chronic hepatitis C can be life-threatening.

Despite availability of accurate diagnostic tests and highly effective curative treatment, approximately 2.4 million adults in the United States (i.e. approximately 1.0% of all U.S. adults) were living with hepatitis C during 2013–2016. Because HCV infection is most often asymptomatic, only 55.6% of these adults reported having ever been told that they had hepatitis C during 2013–2016. Being unaware of an HCV infection can have serious health consequences and increase risk for transmission to others. In 2018, ≥ 15,713 death certificates listed hepatitis C as the underlying or contributing cause of death.

Historically, the highest prevalence of chronic hepatitis C in the United States has been among persons born during 1945–1965 (baby boomers). Concurrent with the nation's opioid crisis, in more recent years, new HCV infections have occurred primarily among young adults, including persons of reproductive age. Compared with 2005 when reported acute hepatitis C cases were at a low point this century (0.2 per 100,000 population), by 2017 the rate had increased approximately fourfold, to 1.0 per 100,000, mostly among persons aged 20–39 years *. Further, a recent study of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project showed that U.S. rates of maternal HCV infection at delivery increased from 0.8 per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 4.1 in 2015, with the highest increases among women with opioid use disorder.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^113qm2ZT]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV — Interpretation of blood tests notes that the HCV antibody test may be negative during the first 6 weeks after exposure, seroconversion may be delayed or absent in immunosuppressed individuals, and presence of HCV antibody alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; HCV RNA may be transiently negative during acute HCV infection and presence of HCV RNA alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; and ALT findings include that fluctuating ALT peaks suggest acute infection, ALT may be normal during acute HCV infection, and ALT may be elevated due to other liver insults, such as alcohol consumption. If HCV antibody is positive but HCV RNA is undetectable, repeat HCV-RNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) testing is recommended to identify acute reinfection. Acute infection should be suspected if there is a rise in the ALT level without an alternative cause and also when there are low (especially < 10^4 IU/mL) or fluctuating (> 1 log10 IU/mL) HCV-RNA levels or spontaneous clearance during follow-up.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2023 update: AASLD-IDSA recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^114ZYqxm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

AASLD-IDSA hepatitis C guidance — acute HCV infection reiterates the recommendation that persons with confirmed acute HCV infection (HCV RNA–positive) should be treated the same as those with chronic HCV infection without awaiting possible spontaneous clearance (ie, a test-and-treat approach), noting that the incidence of acute hepatitis C in the United States increased 124% from 2013 through 2020 and that treatment of this key population is critical to both HCV prevention and elimination.

### Difficulty of acute hepatitis C diagnosis in a hospitalised patient [^115LTcJJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

The hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes acute hepatitis C and is commonly detected via HCV antibody testing. However, delayed seroconversion of HCV antibodies and non-specific symptoms may hinder the diagnosis of this disease. A 71-year-old woman developed acute hepatitis while hospitalised for back pain. An HCV antibody test was negative, and she had no risk factors for hepatitis C. She was referred to our hospital for further evaluation. The HCV antibody test was repeated 16 days after the initial test; owing to a positive result, she was diagnosed with acute hepatitis C. Several months thereafter, the HCV spontaneously cleared. When diagnosing an HCV infection, the time at which the testing is performed needs to coincide with the time at which HCV antibody seroconversion occurs. Timely diagnosis of an HCV infection allows appropriate treatment during the acute phase which may prevent disease progression to the chronic phase.

### Acute hepatitis C [^113qFRzu]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Symptomatic acute hepatitis C occurs in only about 15% of patients who are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Acute hepatitis C is most often diagnosed in the setting of post-exposure surveillance, or seroconversion in high-risk individuals (eg, health-care professionals or injecting drug users) previously known to be seronegative. Although transmission via transfusion and injecting drug use has declined in developed countries, unsafe blood products and medical practices continue to increase transmission of HCV in many developing countries. Clinically, acute hepatitis C can increase concentrations of alanine aminotransferase to ten times the upper limit of normal but almost never causes fulminant hepatic failure. Diagnosis of HCV infection in the acute phase is difficult since production of antibodies against HCV can be delayed by up to 12 weeks, and about a third of infected individuals might not have detectable antibody at the onset of symptoms. Therefore, testing for HCV RNA by PCR is the only reliable test for the diagnosis of acute infection. Symptomatic patients with jaundice have a higher likelihood of spontaneous viral clearance than do asymptomatic patients, and thus should be monitored for at least 12 weeks before initiating antiviral therapy. By contrast, asymptomatic patients have a much lower chance of spontaneous clearance, and might benefit from early antiviral therapy. Antiviral therapy for 12 weeks is generally effective in treating patients who are HCV RNA negative after 4 weeks of treatment; lengthier courses could be needed for those who relapse or fail to show early virological clearance.

AASLD–IDSA hepatitis C virus (HCV) exposure testing algorithm — For a discrete, recognized exposure, baseline testing should be performed within 48 hours of exposure using HCV RNA, HCV antibody (Ab), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Initial result pairs map to outcomes: HCV Antibody (Ab negative, HCV RNA negative leads to NO HCV infection; HCV Ab positive, HCV RNA negative indicates Prior resolved infection; HCV Ab negative, HCV RNA positive indicates Acute HCV infection already present; and HCV Ab positive HCV RNA positive indicates Prior chronic infection. Follow-up specifies Repeat testing for 6 months to assess new infection and to Test HCV RNA and HCV Ab; if HCV RNA positive or seroconversion, classify as Acute HCV infection and note that HCV treatment recommended for HCV RNA positive. If HCV RNA negative and HCV Ab negative, or no seroconversion for 6 months: NO HCV infection, and for prior resolved infection, if HCV RNA remains negative: NO HCV infection; additionally, implement Counsel on risk reduction and Annual testing for high-risk patients.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^111JH1PH]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV infection — testing recommendations and timing: HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing are recommended when acute HCV infection is suspected due to known exposure, clinical presentation, or elevated aminotransferase levels. HCV RNA typically becomes reliably detectable within 2–3 weeks after exposure, whereas HCV antibody typically occurs 2–3 months after exposure, on average; therefore, the best laboratory evidence is a positive HCV-RNA test in the setting of a negative HCV-antibody test or a positive HCV-antibody test after a prior negative anti-HCV test. When there has been a discrete, known, or suspected exposure, baseline HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing should be performed within 48 hours of the exposure; if baseline testing is negative, repeat testing for HCV antibody and HCV RNA is recommended, with frequency tailored to objectives (e.g., monthly testing to identify and treat acute infection).

### Vital signs: newly reported acute and chronic hepatitis C cases-United States, 2009–2018 [^115b7YKB]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

These findings highlight the need for immediate implementation of the new CDC universal hepatitis C screening recommendations for all adults and pregnant women. Following a decade of sharp increases in acute hepatitis C infections, particularly among young adults, the rates of newly reported chronic infections among baby boomers and millennials are now equal, demonstrating that even younger generations are at risk. Diagnosing HCV infection is a necessary first step to linking persons to cure to prevent life-threatening consequences of long-term chronic infections and transmission to others.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute hepatitis C virus infection [^1124bvYq]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The first 6 months after exposure to hepatitis C virus (HCV) are regarded as acute hepatitis C (AHC). Two patient populations worldwide share the highest prevalence of AHC virus infection: injection drug users and HIV-positive men who have sex with men. Diagnosis of AHC is often difficult in both patient populations as the acute inflammatory phase can be clinically asymptomatic and patients at highest risk for acquiring AHC (injection drug users) tend to evade regular medical care. This article addresses similarities and differences in the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of AHC monoinfection and coinfection.

### Population-based surveillance for hepatitis C virus, United States, 2006–2007 [^115QtUQW]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a serious public health problem in the United States and throughout the world. At least 80% of acute infections become chronic; an estimated 3.2 million persons in the United States alone have chronic HCV infection. In 2004, an HCV diagnosis was made in 936 of 100,000 outpatient visits for healthcare and in 143 of 100,000 hospital discharges. This is a chronic infection in which complications are manifested decades after the initial infection. Complications and costs associated with chronic HCV infection are anticipated to increase during 2010–2019, because the incidence of new infections peaked from the late 1960s to early 1980s.

Although identifying persons with HCV infection, including asymptomatic persons, is challenging, the benefits for overall public health make it worthwhile. Infected persons can be referred to care, treated (if appropriate), and counseled to prevent complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists recognized these benefits, and in 2003, recommended that past or present infections with HCV (hereafter referred to as HCV infection because most of these cases likely represent chronic rather than acute or resolved HCV infections) become a nationally reportable condition. Surveillance for acute non-A, non-B hepatitis, which was mostly HCV infection, has been performed in the United States since 1982, but in 2007, a total of 33 states also conducted surveillance for HCV infection and reported 133,520 cases to CDC; however, these data remain unpublished.

### Update on chronic hepatitis C [^112EFuer]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

The burden of chronic hepatitis C infection remains significant in the United States and worldwide. Increased knowledge regarding the natural history of acute and chronic infection and the key factors responsible for disease progression, risk for cirrhosis, and risk for hepatocellular carcinoma are critical in guiding secondary and tertiary prevention measures. The past decade has seen substantial improvement of antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus with an increasing number of individuals achieving viral eradication. Decisions regarding whom, when, and how to use antiviral therapy have become more complex and change as new studies become available. This review focuses on the current status of hepatitis C virus patient management and future treatment directions.

### Natural course of acute hepatitis C: a long-term prospective study [^11188Aea]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Acute hepatitis C has a high chronicity rate which appears to be significantly reduced by early antiviral treatment. However, it is unclear if all acutely infected patients should be treated, and when. In this prospective study, patients with a well-documented diagnosis of acute hepatitis C were evaluated to define the natural course, the rate of chronicity, and host and virus-related factors which might predict a self-limiting or chronic evolution requiring early antiviral treatment.

Methods

From 1995 to 2000, 40 consecutive patients with a community-acquired AHC were enrolled. Liver tests, anti-hepatitis C virus antibodies and hepatitis C virus RNA levels were monitored. Median follow-up was 35 months (range 12–68).

Results

A total of 24/40 patients had symptomatic disease including 20 with jaundice; 13/40 patients had prompt serum hepatitis C virus RNA clearance and ALT normalisation within 12 weeks; in 12/13 patients this pattern remained unchanged during follow-up. Overall, 27/40 patients remained hepatitis C virus RNA positive with fluctuating ALT levels. Older age and jaundice were predictive of resolution whereas there was no correlation with other host factors, viral genotype or viral load.

Conclusions

Our data demonstrate that spontaneous resolution can occur in about 30% of AHC patients. This favourable outcome rarely occurs in patients with anicteric AHC or in those with jaundice but with persistent viremia for more than 12 weeks from onset; early antiviral treatment for these patients may avoid or reduce chronicity.

### Natural history of hepatitis C [^114km1hX]. Journal of Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

There has long been evidence that hepatitis C can lead to persistent infection in a high proportion of infected individuals, and can progress to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The transition from acute to chronic hepatitis C is usually sub-clinical. Accurate studies of the time course for clearance of acute hepatitis C are difficult to carry out because of the silent onset of the acute disease. The likelihood of spontaneous HCV resolution is associated with several genetic factors, including IL28B inheritance and the DQB1*0301 allele of the major histocompatibility complex class II. Most data suggest that resolution in the acute phase without progression to chronic disease is not accompanied by significant disease, but minor histological lesions have been observed in anti-HCV positive, HCV RNA negative individuals. The risk of reinfection remains a possibility after clearance of acute hepatitis C. High rates of sexually-transmitted infection are being reported in HIV positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Chronic infection with HCV is the leading cause of end-stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver related death in the Western world. The natural history of the chronic disease remains incompletely defined. It is generally a slowly progressive disease characterized by persistent hepatic inflammation, leading to the development of cirrhosis in approximately 10–20% of patients over 20–30 years of HCV infection. However, the published data indicate varying progression rates to cirrhosis. Overall, once cirrhosis has developed there is a 1–5% annual risk of HCC and a 3–6% annual risk of hepatic decompensation. Following an episode of decompensation the risk of death in the following year is between 15% and 20%. The high number of chronically infected individuals, the burden of disease, and the absence of a vaccine indicates that treatment will form part of the disease control but the impact, effectiveness and outcomes of treatment in various groups remain uncertain. Several studies and meta-analysis have concluded that eradication of HCV with antiviral therapy reduces the risk of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis C, independent of fibrosis stage, but the risk is not eliminated.

AASLD–IDSA Hepatitis C guidance — medical management and transmission prevention in acute HCV infection states that after the initial diagnosis of acute HCV with viremia (defined as quantifiable RNA), HCV treatment should be initiated without awaiting spontaneous resolution (I, B). Counseling is recommended for patients with acute HCV infection to avoid hepatotoxic insults, including hepatotoxic drugs (e.g., acetaminophen) and alcohol consumption, and to reduce the risk of HCV transmission to others (I, C). Referral to an addiction medicine specialist is recommended for patients with acute HCV infection related to substance use (I, B).

### Acute hepatitis C virus infection [^111xkh8C]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Acute infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a frequent but underrecognized problem among substance users, because it produces few symptoms. Despite this fact, a good deal has been learned recently from studies of cohorts of persons with acute HCV infection. Intensive study of these cohorts has suggested that there is a higher frequency of spontaneous clearance among persons with symptomatic infection and persons with vigorous adaptive immune responses. Similarly, polymorphisms for genes involved in innate immunity also appear to influence the outcome of acute HCV infection. Data on injection drug users with repeated exposures to HCV reveal the presence of partially protective immunity, which suggests that vaccine-based approaches may be feasible. Finally, antiviral therapy with interferon-based regimens for acute HCV infection produces significantly higher sustained virological responses than observed for chronic infection. Further work is needed to develop more-accurate assays for acute HCV infection, to define host and viral factors that predict outcome and to define the optimal duration and regimen of therapy.

Clinical Features and Natural History

Persons with acute HCV infection are typically either asymptomatic or have a mild clinical illness like that of other types of viral hepatitis. Jaundice might occur in 20%–30% of persons, and nonspecific symptoms (e.g. anorexia, malaise, or abdominal pain) might be present in 10%–20% of persons. Fulminant hepatic failure following acute hepatitis C is rare. The average time from exposure to symptom onset is 2–12 weeks (range: 2–26 weeks). HCV antibodies (anti-HCV) can be detected 4–10 weeks after infection and are present in approximately 97% of persons by 6 months after exposure. HCV RNA can be detected as early as 1–2 weeks after exposure. The presence of HCV RNA indicates current infection.

Historically, approximately 15%–25% of persons were believed to resolve their acute infection without sequelae; however, more recent data suggest that spontaneous clearance might be as high as 46%, varying by age at the time of infection. Spontaneous clearance is lower among persons co-infected with HIV. Predictors of spontaneous clearance include jaundice; elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level; hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity; female sex; younger age; HCV genotype 1; and host genetic polymorphisms, most notably those near the IL28B gene. Chronic HCV infection develops when viral replication evades the host immune response. The course of chronic liver disease is usually insidious, progressing slowly without symptoms or physical signs in most persons during the first 20 years or more following infection. Approximately 5%–25% of persons with chronic hepatitis C will develop cirrhosis over 10–20 years. Those with cirrhosis experience a 1%–4% annual risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. Persons who are male, aged > 50 years, use alcohol, have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, have hepatitis B virus (HBV) or HIV coinfection, and who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy have increased rates of progression to cirrhosis. Extrahepatic manifestations of chronic HCV infection might occur and include membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, porphyria cutanea tarda, and lymphoma.

### Role of serologic and molecular diagnostic assays in identification and management of hepatitis C virus infection [^115cph2A]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

ROLE OF TESTING IN DIAGNOSIS OF ACUTE HCV INFECTION

The diagnostic methods associated with treatment are different from those designed to screen and protect the blood supply. As treatments of HCV have improved dramatically in recent years, the diagnostic paradigm has also evolved to meet the changing clinical needs. Approximately 15% to 30% of patients spontaneously clear HCV within 6 to 12 months of initial exposure. Such individuals remain anti-HCV antibody positive but have no detectable viremia and are truly cured of the infection, without long-term sequelae. Prior to placing a patient on therapy, a physician must differentiate those people who have been exposed to HCV but who have, after acute and usually asymptomatic infection, resolved their infection without sequelae from those who have been exposed and have progressed to a chronic and potentially lifelong infection. Traditionally, the RIBA was used to confirm HCV infection by demonstrating reactivity of antibodies in the serum with specific HCV proteins, increasing the specificity of the initial antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, this test has been discontinued and is consequently no longer available. The presence of HCV RNA in the peripheral blood is a reliable marker of HCV replication and is the main marker used today to confirm an active infection. Two technologies are routinely used for the qualitative HCV RNA test, PCR and transcription-mediated amplification (TMA).

### Distinct features in natural history and outcomes of acute hepatitis C [^117J7Hid]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The virological outcome of AHCV is associated with various host and viral factors including age, gender, presence of symptoms and/or jaundice, antiviral T-cell responsiveness, immunogenetic polymorphisms, and viral coinfections. Typically, patients with self-limited AHCV have sustained viral clearance within the first 12 weeks of disease onset, whereas viremia beyond 6 months generally indicate chronic evolution (CE). If viremia is not spontaneously resolved within 12 weeks, IFNα-based treatment can achieve excellent sustained virological response (SVR) rate above 80% regardless of treatment regimen (monotherapy combined with ribavirin) or duration (typically 12 to 48 wk). However, up to 30% of the patients are not treated due to comorbidities that may present challenges to IFNα-based therapy. Chronic hepatitis C therapy is rapidly evolving into an IFN-free and directly acting antiviral regimens, with or without ribavirin, for as short a duration as 8 to 12 weeks and with high response rates. Although such regimens have not yet been fully evaluated in AHCV, they can be used in such cases as reported by Fierer et aland possibly even prophylactically after HCV exposure although the latter is contentious.

In our center, we have been prospectively enrolling AHCV patients since 2000 to examine the role of cellular immunity in HCV infection. In this study, we analyzed the clinical and demographic findings in our patient cohort recruited over a decade of IFNα-based therapeutics to highlight their natural history and outcomes.

### High rate of spontaneous clearance of acute hepatitis C virus genotype 3 infection [^116d959U]. Journal of Medical Virology (2004). Low credibility.

Treating acute hepatitis C with interferon alpha prevents chronicity in nearly all cases when therapy is initiated within 3 months after infection. However, 15–50% of untreated patients may clear the hepatitis C virus (HCV) spontaneously. Therefore, factors are needed to identify patients prior to therapy who have a higher or lower risk for developing a chronic course to avoid unnecessary treatment. The role of the HCV genotype for spontaneous recovery from acute hepatitis C has been discussed controversially. In the year 2002, all 1,176 new incoming prisoners in a Northern German prison for young men (age 16–24) were screened for anti-HCV antibodies and 92 tested positive. Ninety eight percent of these reported i.v.-drug abuse for a median of 32 months prior to imprisonment. HCV-RNA negative individuals (21%) were serotyped and HCV-RNA positive patients were genotyped. The prevalence of HCV genotype 3 was significantly higher among individuals who had cleared HCV spontaneously as compared to chronically infected patients (86% vs. 38%; P = 0.002). Ninety three percent of individuals exposed to HCV genotype 1 but only 63% of individuals exposed to genotype 3 experienced a chronic course of the infection (P = 0.006). Thus, acute infection in young Caucasian men with HCV genotype 3 leads more often to spontaneous clearance than infection with HCV genotype-1. Considering also the high chance of successful treatment of chronic HCV genotype 3 infection with pegylated-interferon in combination with ribavirin, we suggest not to treat acute hepatitis C genotype 3 infection early but rather to wait at least 3 months after the onset of symptoms when chronicity becomes likely.

### Laboratory diagnostics for hepatitis C virus infection [^111mHi5g]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Identification of prevalent infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV) is based serologically on detecting anti-HCV immunoglobulin G, using immunoassays, immunoblot assays, and, more recently, immunochromatography-based rapid tests. None discriminate between active and resolved HCV infection. Tests for detecting HCV RNA identify active HCV infection but are costly. Serologic assays for HCV antigens have been developed and show potential for diagnosis of active HCV infection, and their performance characteristics are undergoing evaluation. The diagnosis of acute HCV infection without the demonstration of seroconversion remains elusive.

### Projecting future complications of chronic hepatitis C in the United States [^11794W5M]. Liver Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common and often results in slowly progressive liver disease. Although acute hepatitis C is now uncommon, most patients with acute infection have developed chronic hepatitis, and, therefore, the pool of infected patients is large. We used a modification of a previously described natural history model for HCV infection to project the number of cases of HCV infection, cirrhosis, and liver failure over the next 40 years. The model estimated the prevalence of HCV infection in the United States was 3.07 x 10(6) in 1993 (compared with an adjusted National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey (NHANES) III estimate of 2.8 to 3.5 x 10(6)). A gradual decline in the prevalence of infection should occur by year 2040 because of aging and natural deaths among the infected pool. However, as the duration of infection increases in the surviving cohort, the proportion with cirrhosis will increase from 16% to 32% by 2020 in an untreated population. Complications of cirrhosis also will increase dramatically over the next 20 years: hepatic decompensation (up 106%), hepatocellular carcinoma (up 81%), and liver-related deaths (up 180%). Although current treatment regimens eradicate HCV in over 50% of cases, many more patients would need to be treated to significantly impact disease progression. Identification and treatment of every case of HCV infection (with or without cirrhosis) would reduce the number of cases of decompensated cirrhosis by almost half after 20 years. Despite the declining incidence of acute HCV infection, chronic hepatitis C is common. The prevalence of cirrhosis and the incidence of its complications will increase over the next 10 to 20 years, because the duration of infection increases among those with chronic hepatitis C. These data emphasize the need for greater access to transplantation by expansion of the donor pool, increasing use of split livers and living donors, and novel options such as xenotransplantation.

### Hepatitis C: a review [^116cYD7P]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus is an RNA virus in the Flavivirus family that was identified in 1989. Since then, blood donor screening has reduced the incidence of acute infections; however, because this virus frequently leads to asymptomatic chronic infection, the prevalence of infection remains high. Chronic infection leads to increased risks of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as extrahepatic manifestations. Guidelines for widespread screening continue to evolve, and early diagnosis is likely to become more important with the development of more effective treatments. Current recommendations regarding screening are reviewed.

AASLD–IDSA Hepatitis C guidance — spontaneous clearance and follow-up for acute HCV reports that HCV infection spontaneously clears in 20%–50% of patients within 6 months time of infection, and only 11%–14% of those who remain viremic at 6 months spontaneously clear later. Predictors of spontaneous clearance include presentation with jaundice, elevated ALT, HBsAg positivity, female sex, younger age, genotype 1 infection, and host genetic polymorphisms near the IL28B gene. Patients who experience spontaneous clearance do not require antiviral therapy but do require counseling about the risk of reinfection and testing at least annually; transient suppression of viremia can occur, so a single undetectable HCV-RNA test result is insufficient to declare spontaneous clearance.

### Does chronic hepatitis B infection affect the clinical course of acute hepatitis A? [^113rXgHD]. Journal of Medical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

The impact of chronic hepatitis B on the clinical outcome of acute hepatitis A remains controversial. The aim of present study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics of acute hepatitis A in cases with underlying chronic hepatitis B compared to cases of acute hepatitis A alone. Data on 758 patients with acute hepatitis A admitted at two university-affiliated hospitals were reviewed. Patients were classified into three groups: group A, patients with both acute hepatitis A and underlying chronic hepatitis B (n = 27); group B, patients infected by acute hepatitis A alone whose sexes and ages were matched with patients in group A (n = 54); and group C, patients with acute hepatitis A alone (n = 731). None of the demographic features of group A were significantly different from those of group B or C, except for the proportion of males and body weight, which differed from group C. When comparing to group B, clinical symptoms were more frequent, and higher total bilirubin and lower albumin levels were observed in group A. When comparing to group C, the albumin levels were lower in group A. There were no differences in the duration of hospital stay, occurrence of acute kidney injury, acute liver failure, prolonged cholestasis, or relapsing hepatitis. This study revealed that clinical symptoms and laboratory findings were less favorable for patients with acute hepatitis A and chronic hepatitis B compared to those with acute hepatitis A alone. However, there were no differences in fatal outcomes or serious complications.

### Clinical consequences of hepatitis C virus infection [^1174NZiC]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive strand RNA virus that belongs to the Hepacivirinae genus within the Flaviviridae family. HCV infection has a wide spectrum of cellular tropism and clinical presentations. This has major impacts in terms of pathogenesis and diagnosis. Consequently, a wide range of clinical consequences characterises this viral infection, including asymptomatic chronic carriage, acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and extrahepatic manifestations. The latter are commonly observed and may represent the first sign of the disease. A better knowledge of the pathobiology of HCV and its clinical consequences will be important for developing better treatment strategies to cure HCV infection and extrahepatic manifestations.

### Distinct features in natural history and outcomes of acute hepatitis C [^113HjeCQ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute hepatitis C (AHCV) provides a diagnostic challenge with diverse clinical presentations.

Goals

This study was aimed to examine the clinical and demographic features as well as outcomes in AHCV patients identified from inpatient and outpatient hospital settings.

Study

Patients with suspected AHCV were recruited from Philadelphia VA Medical Center, Hospital of University of Pennsylvania and Brooklyn VA Medical Center between 2000 and 2010. AHCV was diagnosed by acute serum alanine aminotransferase elevation with anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) seroconversion, HCV-RNA fluctuations above 1 log, and/or recent high-risk exposure without prior HCV infection, excluding those with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Clinical and therapeutic outcomes were monitored for at least 6 months.

Results

A total of 40 AHCV patients were enrolled with a median follow-up of 129 weeks. They were mostly men (68%) and whites (73%) with median age of 43 years, diverse risk factors (33% injection drugs, 20% health care-associated, 3% sexual, and 45% unknown), and wide variations in peak alanine aminotransferase (143 to 3435 U/L) and total bilirubin levels (0.4 to 19.3 mg/dL). Viremia resolved spontaneously in 23% and persisted without therapy in 27%, whereas 50% received interferon α-based therapy with 90% cure (18/20). Distinct clinical scenarios included: (1) wide viremic fluctuations > 1 log (65%) and intermittent HCV-RNA negativity; (2) autoantibodies (25% antinuclear antibodies, 69% antismooth muscle antibodies) or autoimmune features; (3) delayed spontaneous viral clearance in 2 patients; (4) rapid cirrhosis progression in 2 patients.

Conclusions

AHCV is a heterogenous disease that requires careful monitoring. The lack of apparent risk factor in high proportion of patients and its diverse presentations warrant diagnostic vigilance.

### Improving adherence to hepatitis C screening guidelines [^114u7ZC2]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

HCV is an RNA virus which can cause chronic infection leading to hepatic cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure requiring transplantation — yet the vast majority of patients are asymptomatic following acute infection. The CDC estimates that 2.7–3.9 million Americans are living with HCV infection, with 45%–85% unaware they were ever infected. Traditionally, HCV screening targeted only those patients with documented risk factors for HCV infection, yet data from the National Hepatitis Screening Survey show that targeted screening misses 31%–47% of cases of HCV in the United States. Screening has become particularly important with the advent of highly effective direct-acting antiviral agents, which can prevent development of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or need for transplantation.

Epidemiologists identified a particular birth cohort, those born between 1945 and 1965, which carries the majority of the HCV burden in the United States with 67% of all cases. As a result, both the CDC and USPSTF recommend HCV screening for all those born between 1945 and 1965, in addition to those at increased risk based on traditional risk factors. Screening consists of an initial HCV antibody test followed by confirmatory PCR if positive. The release of the updated CDC and USPSTF guidelines on HCV screening presented an opportunity to evaluate the adoption of new guidelines within an academic primary care clinic.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnostic algorithm for current infection or reinfection — For diagnosis of current initial HCV infection, begin with HCV-antibody testing and for recurrent HCV infection, begin with HCV-RNA testing; ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing. Persons who have a reactive HCV-antibody test and a negative (not detected) HCV-RNA test should be informed that they do not have evidence of current HCV infection, with terminal pathways labeled "No Current HCV Infection" or "Additional Testing as Appropriate", whereas when infection is present the pathway labels "Current HCV Infection" and "Link to Care for Treatment or Retreatment". HCV-RNA testing is required to detect reinfection, and for persons who might have been exposed to HCV within the past 6 months or who are immunocompromised, testing for HCV RNA should be performed; repeat HCV-RNA testing if the person tested is suspected to have had HCV exposure within the past 6 months or has clinical evidence of HCV disease or if there is concern regarding the handling or storage of the test specimen.

### Occult hepatitis C virus infection: a narrative review [^1114QgsY]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections occur worldwide. Approximately 75% of these acute infections lead to chronic hepatitis C with few symptoms, at least during the initial phase of infection. Occult hepatitis C develops in some infected patients. These infections are defined by the presence of HCV RNA in hepatocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) but not in the serum. Some of these patients have negative tests for anti-HCV antibodies, which make them very difficult to detect. These patients have been identified throughout the world. Occult infections have been found more frequently in patients with hepatitis B infection, HIV infection, cryptogenic liver disease/cirrhosis, renal failure on haemodialysis and lymphoproliferative disorders. These infections have also been identified in blood donors who have negative HCV antibodies. Low-level viral replication in the liver likely contributes to ongoing liver damage and the release of infectious virions that potentially infect adjacent hepatocytes and extrahepatic sites, such as PBMCs. Studies indicate that occult HCV infection may contribute to the pathogenesis of cryptogenic liver disease, steatotic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and could cause relapses following either a spontaneous clearance of the virus or treatment-induced clearance of the virus. These infections present diagnostic difficulties. This virus is present in the liver; however, that would require a liver biopsy to demonstrate this. It is also present in PBMCs, but these cells are not usually used during routine patient evaluation. The development of quasispecies, which can be identified in PBMCs by specialised labs, helps explain ineffective host defence responses and antiviral drug treatment in some patients. There is no specific therapy for the treatment of this sub-group of HCV-infected patients, and treatment should start with direct-acting antiviral drugs with careful follow-up and serial testing for viral clearance. In summary, patients with occult HCV need more study to determine the role of these infections in the progression of liver disease, to improve diagnostic algorithms and to determine treatment protocols that can eliminate these low-level infections.

### Vital signs: newly reported acute and chronic hepatitis C cases-United States, 2009–2018 [^114vcovB]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

During 2018, a total of 3,621 cases of acute hepatitis C were reported, representing an estimated 50,300 cases (95% CI = 39,800–171,600), after adjusting for underascertainment and underreporting. During 2009–2018, the number of reported acute hepatitis C cases per 100,000 population increased threefold, from 0.3 in 2009 to 1.2 in 2018. During 2018, the highest rate of reported acute hepatitis C cases was in persons aged 20–29 years (3.1 per 100,000), followed by persons aged 30–39 years (2.6), 40–49 years (1.3), 50–59 years (0.9) and ≥ 60 years (0.4); the lowest rate (0.1) was in persons aged < 20 years (Figure 1). This age pattern was consistent throughout 2009–2018, but the absolute increase in the annual case counts per 100,000 was highest for persons aged 20–39 years; among those aged 20–29 years, rates increased approximately 300%, from 0.7 in 2009 to 3.1 in 2018, and among those aged 30–39 years, rates increased approximately 400%, from 0.5 in 2009 to 2.6 in 2018.

### Management of acute HCV infection in the era of direct-acting antiviral therapy [^114Gwcuh]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

The management of acute HCV infection has not been standardized following the availability of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for chronic HCV infection, and substantial uncertainty exists regarding the optimal treatment regimen and duration. Despite the lack of direct evidence, the 2016 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)-Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines supported "the same regimens for acute HCV as recommended for chronic HCV infection… owing to high efficacy and safety", whereas the 2016 European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines recommended sofosbuvir-ledipasvir, sofosbuvir-velpatasvir or sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir for 8 weeks in acute HCV infection, with a longer duration of 12 weeks recommended for those infected with HIV and/or baseline HCV RNA levels > 1,000,000 IU/ml. This Review outlines the epidemiology, natural history and diagnosis of acute HCV infection and provides contemporary information on DAAs for acute and recent HCV infection. The Review also discusses the 2016 AASLD-IDSA and EASL recommendations for acute HCV infection management in light of available evidence and highlights key differences in study populations and design that influence interpretation. We focus on populations at high risk of HCV transmission and acquisition, including people who inject drugs and HIV-positive men who have sex with men, and highlight the potential effects of diagnosis and treatment of acute HCV infection in contributing to HCV elimination.

### Risk factors and outcome among a large patient cohort with community-acquired acute hepatitis C in Italy [^1139kvPL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The epidemiology of acute hepatitis C has changed during the past decade in Western countries. Acute HCV infection has a high rate of chronicity, but it is unclear when patients with acute infection should be treated.

Methods

To evaluate current sources of hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission in Italy and to assess the rate of and factors associated with chronic infection, we enrolled 214 consecutive patients with newly acquired hepatitis C during 1999–2004. The patients were from 12 health care centers throughout the country, and they were followed up for a mean (± SD) period of 14 ± 15.8 months. Biochemical liver tests were performed, and HCV RNA levels were monitored.

Results

A total of 146 patients (68%) had symptomatic disease. The most common risk factors for acquiring hepatitis C that were reported were intravenous drug use and medical procedures. The proportion of subjects with spontaneous resolution of infection was 36%. The average timespan from disease onset to HCV RNA clearance was 71 days (range, 27–173 days). In fact, 58 (80%) of 73 patients with self-limiting hepatitis experienced HCV RNA clearance within 3 months of disease onset. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that none of the variables considered (including asymptomatic disease) were associated with increased risk of developing chronic hepatitis C.

Conclusions

These findings underscore the importance of medical procedures as risk factors in the current spread of HCV infection in Italy. Because nearly all patients with acute, self-limiting hepatitis C — both symptomatic and asymptomatic — have spontaneous viral clearance within 3 months of disease onset, it seems reasonable to start treatment after this time period ends to avoid costly and useless treatment.

### Natural history of initially mild chronic hepatitis C [^113yrgMy]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2004). Low credibility.

The hepatitis C virus is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in western countries. Chronic hepatitis C is highly heterogeneous and many patients present with a mild form of liver disease. Population-based studies have indeed demonstrated that around 50% of hepatitis C virus carriers have persistently normal ALT and two-third have mild histological liver lesions. Studies on the natural history of initially mild chronic disease indicate that the short-term outcome is always benign. However, progression of liver fibrosis can be observed at long-term (> 5–7 years) follow-up, particularly in those cases who have elevated and/or fluctuating transaminase levels. Observational prospective studies and outcome modelling projections indicate that the risk of liver disease progression towards severe fibrosis/cirrhosis is minimal at 10–15 years in hepatitis C virus carriers with persistently normal ALT, around 5–10% in patients with elevated ALT and F0 (no fibrosis) in the initial biopsy but > 30–40% in chronic carriers with elevated ALT and F1 (portal fibrosis) in the initial biopsy. Cofactors like age at infection, alcohol, coinfections and liver steatosis accelerate disease progression. On the basis of these findings, patients with initially mild chronic hepatitis C and elevated ALT should be proposed for antiviral therapy in the absence of contraindications.

### Use and interpretation of virological tests for hepatitis C [^117BJh3H]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Four virological markers of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are used clinically for management of patients with hepatitis C, namely the HCV genotype, HCV RNA, HCV core antigen, and antibody to HCV (anti-HCV). The diagnosis of acute and chronic hepatitis C is based on both anti-HCV detection using enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and HCV RNA detection using a sensitive molecular biology-based technique. Other virological tools, including HCV genotype determination and HCV RNA quantification, are now used to tailor treatment to the individual patient and to determine its efficacy. This article reviews the kinetics of HCV markers during acute and chronic HCV infection, together with current assays and their practical use in the management of HCV-infected patients.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Q45zf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening and diagnostic testing include population screening, test performance, and confirmatory steps. Approximately 4.1 million Americans are positive for anti-bodies against hepatitis C, and an estimated 3.0 million harbor chronic infection on the basis of positive hepatitis C RNA in the serum. The screening test for chronic hepatitis C is the hepatitis C antibody, which has a sensitivity of 92–97%, but the positive predictive value is highest with risk factors, and false positives may be observed in 5% of cases, and as high as 30% among individuals without reported risk factors. Confirmation of chronic infection is established by a highly sensitive HCV RNA PCR assay, and individuals confirmed to have positive RNA should be referred to a specialist for further characterization and assessment of liver fibrosis to guide therapy decisions. As recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), individuals born within the 1945–1965 birth cohort should be considered for universal HCV antibody testing independent of abnormalities in AST/ALT levels, which may be normal in chronic infection. For suspected acute infection, testing includes anti-HCV, which is typically positive 6–8 weeks after exposure, with confirmation by measuring HCV RNA by PCR testing which must be done to confirm acute hepatitis or chronic hepatitis C.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patient Recruitment and Diagnosis

Patients with suspected AHCV were recruited between 2000 and 2010 at the Philadelphia VA Medical Center, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and Brooklyn VA Medical Center with written informed consent approved by the respective Institutional Review Boards. All patients underwent detailed qualitative interview and review of medical record by the clinical research coordinator and/or physicians for risk factor history including HCA procedures (eg, transfusion, surgical/medical procedures), piercing, tattooing, IDU, recreational drug use, and sexual exposures within a year of clinical onset as well as other history relevant for liver disease. Laboratory parameters included standard liver function parameters as well as serology for hepatitis A/B and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). All patients were enrolled within 1 year of clinical onset and monitored for at least 6 months. Serum HCV-RNA, HCV genotype, and anti-HCV status were determined by standard commercial assays through the clinical laboratory (see Supplementary document for details, Supplemental Digital Content 1).

AHCV was diagnosed by acute serum ALT elevation with documented HCV seroconversion, spontaneous serum HCV-RNA fluctuations over 10-fold, and/or risk history within 1 year of clinical onset without a history of prior HCV infection or other causes of liver disease.HIV-coinfected patients were excluded. Among 50 AHCV patients initially identified, 10 were excluded for HIV coinfection or follow-up duration of < 6 months, resulting in 40 AHCV patients with documented seroconversion (70%) and/or viremic fluctuations above 10-fold (65%) (Fig. 1). As the timing of HCV exposure was difficult to define, the clinical onset was operationally defined as the time of first documented ALT elevation. Among those with HCV seroconversion (70%), the median time from a negative HCV Ab test to clinical onset of AHCV was 16 weeks, although some may have been "recent" rather than "acute" hepatitis C.

### What hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnostic tools are needed to advance diagnosis of current HCV infection in outreach settings and in a nonclinical setting? [^116KzQkf]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

In the US, the most commonly used HCV POC test is the rapid anti-HCV test. Although HCV core antigen and rapid HCV RNA test platforms have been developed and have good performance characteristics, core antigen testing is not available in the US and only laboratory-based RNA testing is currently available. The advantages of the rapid anti-HCV test, including speed, convenience, and accessibility, are greatly outweighed by the inability to distinguish persistent HCV infection from previous resolution of infection, nor does it distinguish acute infection from chronic disease. While the anti-HCV POC test facilitates screening for exposure to HCV, it is not helpful for treatment decisions without additional testing. Also, as the window period for detection of anti-HCV is long, this approach does not identify acute or recent infection, when transmission risk may be high. The value of HCV antigen tests and rapid HCV RNA testing is the actionable results they provide, which is especially important when dealing with populations for whom a follow-up visit for confirmatory testing is far from assured. While antigen testing is more likely than antibody testing to detect HCV in the early stages of infection, cost and limited sensitivity impact its utility. These tests are especially useful in settings where molecular testing is not available, but antigen detection is not likely to be further developed as a diagnostic tool in the US given US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance. Rapid HCV RNA tests, which detect HCV genetic material, offer the greatest advantage for diagnosis and rapid initiation of treatment as the presence of HCV RNA confirms current infection. HCV RNA testing in the US is conducted in laboratories using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing on serum or plasma obtained by venipuncture following receipt of a reactive anti-HCV test. RT-PCR, a highly sensitive and specific method for detecting and quantifying viral RNA in blood samples, is considered the gold standard for HCV RNA detection. The lack of a POC option for HCV RNA testing in the US is a significant impediment to the rapid diagnosis and swift initiation of treatment — especially in nontraditional settings — impacting the ability to address the HCV epidemic in the highest risk groups and, eventually, to eliminating HCV.

### Epidemiology and natural history of HCV infection [^115Z2dyG]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Worldwide, an estimated 130–170 million people have HCV infection. HCV prevalence is highest in Egypt at > 10% of the general population and China has the most people with HCV (29.8 million). Differences in past HCV incidence and current HCV prevalence, together with the generally protracted nature of HCV disease progression, has led to considerable diversity in the burden of advanced liver disease in different countries. Countries with a high incidence of HCV or peak incidence in the recent past will have further escalations in HCV-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) over the next two decades. Acute HCV infection is difficult to detect because of the generally asymptomatic nature of the disease and the marginalization of at-risk populations. Around 25% of patients with acute HCV infection undergo spontaneous clearance, with increased rates among those with favourable IL28B genotypes, acute symptoms and in women. The remaining 75% of patients progress to chronic HCV infection and are subsequently at risk of progression to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and HCC. Chronic hepatitis C generally progresses slowly in the initial two decades, but can be accelerated during this time as a result of advancing age and co-factors such as heavy alcohol intake and HIV co-infection.

Simplified HCV treatment for treatment-naive adults — The Guidance Panel continues to strongly recommend universal DAA treatment for all people with acute or chronic HCV infection (except those with a short life expectancy that cannot be remediated by HCV therapy, liver transplantation, or another directed therapy). A key aspect of facilitating the implementation of this recommendation/goal is expanding the pool of clinicians who provide HCV treatment, thereby boosting accessibility and delivery of care. Accordingly and coincident with the accumulation of real-world data and experience with the pangenotypic DAA regimens, the HCV guidance first introduced the simplified treatment algorithms for treatment-naive persons (without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis) in 2019.

### Immune responses and immunopathology in acute and chronic viral hepatitis [^111i2q5J]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are responsible for most cases of viral hepatitis. Infection by each type of virus results in a different typical natural disease course and clinical outcome that are determined by virological and immunological factors. HCV tends to establish a chronic persistent infection, whereas HAV does not. HBV is effectively controlled in adults, although it persists for a lifetime after neonatal infection. In this Review, we discuss the similarities and differences in immune responses to and immunopathogenesis of HAV, HBV and HCV infections, which may explain the distinct courses and outcomes of each hepatitis virus infection.

AASLD–IDSA Hepatitis C guidance — monitoring and safety in acute HCV infection notes that monitoring with hepatic panels (ALT, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], bilirubin, and INR in the setting of an increasing bilirubin level) is recommended at 2-week to 4-week intervals until resolution of acute hepatitis, and acetaminophen and alcohol consumption should be avoided during acute HCV infection. Patients with acute HCV infection rarely require hospitalization unless nausea and vomiting are severe; although acute liver failure is very rare (< 1%), patients with an INR > 1.5 and those with signs of acute liver failure (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy) should be immediately referred to a liver transplant center, and use of HCV antiviral regimens in acute liver failure should be managed by a clinician experienced in HCV treatment, ideally in consultation with a liver transplant specialist.

### Late presentation of chronic viral hepatitis for medical care: a consensus definition [^1155YtXN]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Over 13 million adults are living with hepatitis B, and 15 million with hepatitis C, in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region. The prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (commonly defined as the persistence of hepatitis B surface antigen for six months or more) and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (as determined by the persistence of hepatitis C nucleic acid or HCV core antigen for more than six or 12 1 months) ranges from 0.1% to 6% across Europe, with major differences between countries and population subgroups. Chronic HBV and HCV infections may remain clinically silent for decades, and symptoms do occur at a late stage. Diagnosis in the absence of widespread screening programmes may therefore be based on signs of late stage liver disease such as hepatic decompensation, variceal bleeding or hepatocellular carcinoma.

Many people with chronic HBV and/or HCV infection are go undiagnosed. Of those already diagnosed, many are not necessarily linked to parts of the healthcare system that are able to provide comprehensive care (e.g. to accurately classify the extent of liver disease and provide treatment when indicated). Consequently, a large (but undetermined) proportion of the chronically infected population enters comprehensive care only after developing liver disease-related clinical symptoms.

Effective and well tolerated treatments for both HBV and HCV infection have greatly improved our ability treat patients successfully, especially if they are diagnosed early. In asymptomatic individuals, treatment is indicated for those at increased risk of symptomatic chronic liver disease, and those at risk of transmitting the infection. All patients with symptomatic disease should be treated. For many, treatment can prevent further progression of liver disease to liver cirrhosis, and can even revert existing liver fibrosis.

In most European countries, it remains unknown as to what extent testing policies and strategies succeed in identifying the undiagnosed population during the course of their disease. The extent to which diagnosed patients are linked to and retained in sections of the healthcare system that are able to provide comprehensive care is also unknown.

To fully exploit the strategic use of treatment and to optimise its benefit, infected persons in need of treatment must enter comprehensive care before their liver disease progresses to considerable liver damage. Patients with advanced liver fibrosis may be considered as "late presenters". Of these, a subgroup of individuals with "late stage liver disease", such as decompensated liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension or hepatocellular carcinoma, can be further defined as a subgroup where there is indisputable evidence that earlier initiation of treatment would have provided significant benefit. These definitions will help quantify the proportion of cases missing timely diagnosis and treatment.

Surveillance case definitions are developed by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists in collaboration with CDC. In all but a few jurisdictions, positive results from HCV antibody and HCV RNA testing that are indicative of acute, or past or present HCV infection, are reportable.

### Hepatitis C viral genotype influences the clinical outcome of patients with acute posttransfusion hepatitis C [^114d8Mmi]. Journal of Medical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

Most patients with an acute infection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) will develop chronic hepatitis, and only about 15–20% of the cases will resolve spontaneously. The mechanism for the different outcomes in patients with acute HCV infection remains unclear. HCV genotype has been recognized as an important factor affecting the clinical course and outcome of chronic hepatitis C patients. In order to evaluate the role of HCV genotype in the clinical course and outcome of acute posttransfusion hepatitis C, 67 patients with acute posttransfusion hepatitis C from a prospective study of posttransfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis were enrolled. Thirty-nine patients (58.2%) were HCV genotype 1b. Among the 67 patients with acute posttransfusion hepatitis C, 53 (79.1%) progressed to chronic hepatitis. Significantly more patients with genotype 1b than non-1b genotypes developed chronic hepatitis (89.7% vs. 64.3%; P = 0.019). There was no significant difference in gender, mean age, amount of transfused blood, hepatitis symptoms, jaundice, incubation period, peak serum alanine transaminase, or serum HCV RNA titer between patients with HCV genotype 1b and non-1b infections. Patients who developed chronic hepatitis had a significantly greater incidence of genotype 1b infection (66.0% vs. 28.6%; P = 0.013) and a longer incubation period (7.3 weeks vs. 5.4 weeks; P = 0.052) than patients whose infection was resolved. Patients with a genotype 1b infection that resolved itself spontaneously all had an incubation period of less than 6 weeks. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that genotype 1b and an incubation period ≥ 6 weeks were significant predictive factors for the development of chronic hepatitis. Therefore, the HCV genotype can influence the outcome of patients with acute HCV infection.

### Hepatitis C virus infection [^117RS9Xh]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hepatitis C virus infection:

- **Definition**: Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by HCV that is characterized by progressive liver damage and polymorphous extrahepatic manifestations.
- **Pathophysiology**: HCV, an RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family, infects hepatocytes and evades the immune system, causing oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, HCC, and death.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hepatitis C in the US adult population is estimated at 1.0% (current infection) and 1.7% (current or past infection).
- **Disease course**: Approximately 15–20% of patients who are infected will progress to cirrhosis over a 20-year period. The risk of HCC in cirrhotic patients (without successful treatment) is 3% per year.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The mortality rate ratio of patients with HCV infection, as compared with the general population, is estimated at 2.3 (95% CI, 2.2–2.5). Cure rates with modern antiviral therapy are > 90% for chronic HCV infection.

### NASPGHAN practice guidelines: diagnosis and management of hepatitis C infection in infants, children, and adolescents [^115rXf6X]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Medium credibility.

Pediatric hepatitis C — case definitions for acute, neonatal, and chronic infection — symptomatic acute hepatitis C (AHC) is defined as the onset of acute hepatitis (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] ≥ 10× normal) in an individual without previously known liver disease, associated with detectable HCV RNA in the first serum sample and the development of anti-HCV antibody. Neonatal hepatitis C infection is defined as detectable HCV RNA in an infant's blood in the first 1 to 6 months of life, and resolution of neonatal HCV infection frequently occurs; neonatal HCV infection must be distinguished from perinatal transient viremia in which HCV RNA is detected in peripheral blood within 0 to 5 days of birth, and detection of HCV RNA in cord blood is irrelevant. Chronic HCV infection is evidence of active viral infection with detectable HCV RNA for at least 6 months, and spontaneous resolution of chronic HCV infection is when an individual who had CHC loses detectable serum HCV RNA without any treatment with 2 negative HCV RNA tests at least 6 months apart.

### Natural history of chronic hepatitis C [^116x1Bnx]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Much controversy surrounds the issue of the natural history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Many authorities view the disease as inexorably progressive with a high probability of advancing over time to cirrhosis and occasionally hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and, therefore, likely to be responsible for causing death. Others regard chronic hepatitis C as having a variable outcome, the majority of infected persons not dying from the disease, but more likely from the comorbid conditions that so often accompany infection by this agent, or from more common medical conditions. Disagreements probably derive from the manner of conduct of the study and the populations studied. Efforts to determine natural history are handicapped by the primary characteristics of the disease, namely that its onset rarely is recognized and its course is prolonged exceedingly. Thus, different outcomes have come from retrospective rather than from prospective studies, but both have concluded that at least 20% of chronically infected adults develop cirrhosis within 20 years. More recent studies that used a retrospective/prospective approach, focusing largely on young infected individuals, have produced different results. Among these young people, particularly young women, spontaneous resolution of the viral infection is more common than previously thought and cirrhosis has been identified in 5% or fewer of them. The major failing for all groups studied, young and old, is that natural history studies have rarely exceeded the first 2 decades, so that outcome beyond this time is not known, other than through modeling. Several host-related and extraneous factors probably affect the natural history.

Algorithm for the use of HCV Antigen assay in conjunction with the HCV RNA test for the accurate identification of actively replicating HCV based on the findings of this review and previously published work. *, for persons who might have been exposed to HCV within the past 6 months, testing for HCV RNA for follow-up testing for HCV antibody is recommended. For persons who are immunocompromised, testing for HCV RNA can be considered. †, to differentiate past, resolved HCV infection from biologic false positivity for HCV antibody, testing with another HCV antibody assay can be considered. Repeat HCV RNA testing if the person tested is suspected to have had HCV exposure within the past 6 months or has clinical evidence of HCV disease or if there is concern regarding the handling or storage of the test specimen.

Generally, three separate populations are at risk for acute HCV infection: PWID (representing the major transmission risk in developed nations), patients at risk for nosocomial acquisition (usually in developing nations), and HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). With regard to MSM and, in particular, HIV-infected MSM, acute HCV infection is considered a sexually transmitted disease.

### Distinct features in natural history and outcomes of acute hepatitis C [^112HWsvX]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we examined AHCV patients identified from inpatient and outpatient hospital settings by clinical symptoms, exposure history, and/or clinical laboratory abnormalities. Our cohort is characterized by predominantly white ethnicity, male gender, HCV genotype 1 infection, and wide viremic fluctuations as well as relatively high levels of ALT and total bilirubin. HCV infection spontaneously resolved in 23%, resolved with therapy in 90% of those treated, and persisted regardless of therapy in 33% with several distinct demographic and clinical features. AHCV identified in the context of clinical suspicion may differ in natural history and outcome, with a greater likelihood for SR when compared with clinically silent cases, although SR was observed in only 23% of our cohort.

HCV risk factors in our cohort were diverse with several notable features. First, we were struck by the lack of defined HCV-associated risk factors in 18/40 (45%) patients. Moreover, among 8 subjects with HCA risk factors, exposure was only presumed without a clear source in 5 with recent medical, surgical, and/or dental interventions. This ultimately resulted in 23/40 without a clear route of HCV transmission (58%). Our findings contrast from the MMWR surveillance summary listing PWID as the highest risk factor (48%), followed by multiple sexual partners (42%) and unknown (35%). These differences reflect different data collection methodologies and populations examined. For example, we did not collect explicit information on sexual exposures or non-IDU (eg, methamphetamine), as described in HIV-infected men who have sex with men in the New York City epidemic. Nevertheless, a lack of identifiable risk factor, as was noted in our AHCV cohort, can result in psychological distress for the patients (and their families) while limiting preventative strategies. Second, our findings suggest that AHCV should be considered in all persons presenting with acute hepatitis, even without apparent risk factors. Indeed, 2 patients in our cohort were over 70 years old and AHCV may not have been considered given their age. Recent hospitalizations with presumably an exposure to HCV infection may have been the mode of acquisition in one of these patients. Of note, risk factors for AHCV may differ between HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients with rising incidence of AHCV observed among HIV-positive men who have sex with men.–Third, CE was more frequent in PWID compared with others (46% vs. 19%, P = 0.13). Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, this could reflect reinfection or superinfection previously reported among recently HCV-infected patients with ongoing IDU.

### Acute-on-chronic liver failure [^116bXzRk]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Acute-on-chronic liver failure combines an acute deterioration in liver function in an individual with pre-existing chronic liver disease and hepatic and extrahepatic organ failures, and is associated with substantial short-term mortality. Common precipitants include bacterial and viral infections, alcoholic hepatitis, and surgery, but in more than 40% of patients, no precipitating event is identified. Systemic inflammation and susceptibility to infection are characteristic pathophysiological features. A new diagnostic score, the Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C) organ failure score, has been developed for classification and prognostic assessment of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. Disease can be reversed in many patients, and thus clinical management focuses upon the identification and treatment of the precipitant while providing multiorgan-supportive care that addresses the complex pattern of physiological disturbance in critically ill patients with liver disease. Liver transplantation is a highly effective intervention in some specific cases, but recipient identification, organ availability, timing of transplantation, and high resource use are barriers to more widespread application. Recognition of acute-on-chronic liver failure as a clinically and pathophysiologically distinct syndrome with defined diagnostic and prognostic criteria will help to encourage the development of new management pathways and interventions to address the unacceptably high mortality.

### Acute hepatitis C in a contemporary US cohort: modes of acquisition and factors influencing viral clearance [^115Xfxb4]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is often asymptomatic; thus, its epidemiology and natural history are difficult to define.

Methods

Acute HCV infection was identified on the basis of HCV seroconversion within 1 year (n = 45), new anti-HCV seropositivity with clinical acute hepatitis (n = 21), or HCV strain sequencing after an iatrogenic exposure (n = 1). Risk factors were assessed with a baseline questionnaire, and participants were followed up prospectively with serial measurement of viral loads.

Results

Of 67 persons with acute HCV infection, most were asymptomatic (64%) and injection drug users (66%). Thirteen had an unknown mode of transmission; of these, 11 reported high-risk sexual behavior. Ten acquired acute HCV infection within 3 months of an iatrogenic exposure; 3 had confirmed iatrogenic infection, and 4 had no other risk factors identified. The spontaneous viral clearance rate after 6 months of infection was 18% (95% confidence interval, 11%-31%). The rate of viral clearance varied significantly by sex (34% vs. 3% for women vs. men; P < .001).

Conclusions

High-risk sexual or iatrogenic exposures may be important contemporary risk factors for HCV infection. The spontaneous viral clearance rate (18%) in this contemporary study was similar to that reported for past studies of transfusion-associated HCV infection. Women were more likely to clear acute HCV infection than men.

### Treatment of acute HCV infection [^111wsZ3q]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

In developed nations, the majority of new HCV infections are acquired by injection drug users. Acute HCV infection is generally asymptomatic and is followed by spontaneous viral clearance in approximately 25% of individuals. However, given the asymptomatic nature of infection and difficulties in identifying and following those at risk of acquiring infection, our knowledge of treatment for acute HCV infection has been hampered. Much of what is known about the timing, optimal regimen and duration of therapy comes from small, prospective, observational studies and randomized, controlled trials in selected populations. Furthermore, data on the treatment of acute HCV infection among injection drug users and patients co-infected with HCV and HIV are limited. Genetic testing for variations in IL28B may provide an additional diagnostic tool for the optimal management and treatment of acute HCV infection. This Review highlights current knowledge of the epidemiology, diagnosis, natural history and treatment of acute HCV infection, including proposed recommendations for the assessment and treatment of this infection.

### Prospective evaluation of community-acquired acute-phase hepatitis C virus infection [^114yqEU1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

More than two-thirds of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in Western countries are caused by injection drug use, but prospective clinical data regarding the most common mode of HCV acquisition are rare, in part because acute-phase HCV infection is usually asymptomatic.

Methods

To characterize acute-phase HCV infection, 179 HCV antibody-negative injection drug users were prospectively evaluated; 62 (34%) of these patients had seroconverted. Twenty of the participants who seroconverted had long-term follow-up with consistent monthly sampling before and after seroconversion, allowing detailed study.

Results

The first indication of HCV infection was the presence of HCV RNA in serum, which preceded elevation of alanine transaminase levels and total bilirubin levels to ≥ 2 times baseline in 45% and 77% of patients, respectively. No subjects had jaundice. The median time from initial viremia to seroconversion was 36 days (range, 32–46 days). In one instance, viremia was detected 434 days before seroconversion. However, in no other case was HCV RNA detected > 63 days before seroconversion. In subjects with viral persistence, a stable level of HCV RNA in the blood was noted in some subjects within 60 days after the initial detection of viremia, but in others, it was not apparent until > 1 year later. In subjects with long-term viral clearance, HCV became persistently undetectable as early as 94 and as late as 620 days after initial viremia.

Conclusions

These data underscore the importance of nucleic acid screening of blood donations to prevent HCV transmission and of long-term follow-up to ascertain whether there is viral persistence, at least among injection drug users.

### Long-lasting imprint in the soluble inflammatory milieu despite early treatment of acute symptomatic hepatitis C [^111seJrS]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute HCV was associated with distinct profiles of SIMs. Mediators were upregulated and correlated positively with biochemical disease. Approximately 6 SIM kinetics were observed during and after DAA treatment. Early treatment does not lead to reversal of soluble immune milieu.

Symptomatic acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) occurs in only approximately 15%–30% of patients who are infected with HCV. The incidence of acute hepatitis C has declined in recent years; however, new infections do still occur in high-risk populations. In the absence of an HCV vaccine, it is imperative to focus on the available treatment options and their durations to prevent the spread of HCV. Historically, acute and chronic HCV infections were treated with interferon (IFN)-alpha or pegylated-IFN-alfa. Over the years, the treatment for chronic hepatitis C with the administration of IFN in combination with ribavirin raised sustained virological response (SVR) rates from 30% to 90% depending on the HCV genotype and the stage of liver disease. On the other hand, for acute HCV infection, higher cure rates (89%–95%) were observed with IFN without coadministration of ribavirin. Albeit more than 90% of patients could be cured with IFN, treatment caused side effects, and many patients could not be treated due to contraindications. Since 2013, antiviral treatment options improved dramatically with the introduction of potent direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). Direct-acting antiviral agents have been used in patients with acute and chronic HCV infections with high efficacy and safety.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^115hiNvk]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing of perinatally exposed children and siblings — recommendations state that all children born to women with acute or chronic hepatitis C should be tested for HCV infection, with antibody-based testing recommended at or after 18 months of age (I, A). Testing with an HCV-RNA assay can be considered in the first year of life, but the optimal timing of such testing is unknown (IIa, C), and testing with an HCV-RNA assay can be considered as early as 2 months of age (IIa, B). Repetitive HCV-RNA testing prior to 18 months of age is not recommended (III, A). Children who are anti-HCV-positive after 18 months of age should be tested with an HCV-RNA assay after age 3 to confirm chronic hepatitis C (I, B). The siblings of children with vertically acquired chronic hepatitis C should be tested for HCV infection if born from the same mother (I, C).

Diagnosis

Diagnosis of acute or chronic HBV infection requires serologic testing (Table 5). Because HBsAg is present in both acute and chronic infection, presence of IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) is diagnostic of acute or recently acquired HBV infection. Antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) is produced after a resolved infection and is the only HBV antibody marker present after vaccination. The presence of HBsAg and anti-HBc, with a negative test for IgM anti-HBc, indicates chronic HBV infection. The presence of total anti-HBc alone might indicate acute, resolved, or chronic infection or a false-positive result.

Abbreviations: anti-HBc = antibody to hepatitis B core antigen; anti-HBs = antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen; HBIG = hepatitis B immune globulin; HBsAg = hepatitis B surface antigen; IgM = immunoglobulin M.

* - = negative test result; + = positive test result.

† To ensure that an HBsAg-positive test result is not false positive, samples with repeatedly reactive HBsAg results should be tested with a neutralizing confirmatory test cleared by the Food and Drug Administration.

§ Persons positive for only anti-HBc are unlikely to be infectious, except under unusual circumstances involving direct percutaneous exposure to large quantities of blood (e.g. blood transfusion or organ transplantation) or mutant HBsAg-related infection.

Treatment

No specific therapy is available for persons with acute HBV infection; treatment is supportive. Persons with chronic HBV infection should be referred for evaluation to a provider experienced in managing such infections. Therapeutic agents approved by FDA for treatment of chronic HBV infection can achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liver disease.

### Late presentation of chronic viral hepatitis for medical care: a consensus definition [^114SJDca]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

It is important that viral hepatitis surveillance systems capture the public health consequences of these infections by focusing on the proportion of patients referred to a specialised medical site who present late and/or with advanced liver disease. In the past, this was demonstrated by the introduction of a comparable definition of late presentation with HIV. The broad acceptance of this definition (defined as individuals newly presenting for HIV care with a CD4 count below 350 cells/μl, or with an AIDS-defining event) has allowed the percentages of late presenters in various countries and regions to be compared, and also allows changes in the numbers of late presenters to be monitored after implementing improved testing strategies.

Using this definition has been particularly instrumental in identifying risk factors for late presentation, and therefore has had an impact on new testing strategies. Indeed, a recent Swiss cohort analysis showed that patients outside established HIV risk groups are most likely to be late presenters. Provider-initiated testing must therefore be improved to reach these groups, which include heterosexual men and women, and older patients.

The late presenter definition has also been used to characterize a specific group of HIV patients with prolonged low CD4-positive cell counts, who behave very differently to other HIV-infected patient groups. More recently, a study on non-infectious comorbidities revealed that these were also far more prevalent in late presenters. In summary, the definition of late presentation has been instrumental in better understanding clinical presentation, course and epidemiology of HIV in various regions of the world.

The two definitions presented here for liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C can be used for different purposes. Firstly, they will unify methods of monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of testing and referral services. For example, if a large percentage of patients are "late presenters", it implies that intervention testing needs improvement to ensure earlier diagnosis. As such, the definitions can be used to monitor the effect of interventions that aim to reduce the number of late presenters. Secondly, their use will enable future studies across Europe to determine the size of the population at risk, and to identify vulnerable groups and risk factors for late presentation. They will also increase understanding of the social and medical barriers that limit access to healthcare in different European countries, and may initiate studies on access to treatment for late presenters across the region. It would therefore be beneficial if all national health agencies, institutions and researchers could implement these consensus definitions when reporting surveillance or research data on late presentation of chronic hepatitis B or C.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111NW47T]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevention after exposure — adults and adolescents with HIV: There is no available vaccine or recommended post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HCV infection. Following acute HCV infection, chronic infection can be prevented within the first 6 to 12 months after infection through antiviral treatment; high rates of viral clearance have been observed with HCV treatment during the acute phase of infection. Because most patients with acute HCV infection may transmit to others and are at risk for loss to follow-up, immediate treatment with the same regimens recommended for chronic HCV should be offered (AIII), and specific treatment regimens in acute infection are the same as those recommended for chronic HCV infection.

### Predicting spontaneous clearance of acute hepatitis C virus in a large cohort of HIV-1-infected men [^115obvhd]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Very little is known about early HCV in HIV-infected individuals, in whom HCV is emerging as a major concern, with liver disease now a major cause of mortality in patients with access to highly active antiretroviral therapy. Globally, 4–5 million people are infected with both viruses, due to shared routes of transmission. An emerging epidemic of acute HCV infection in HIV-positive men in urban centres in Europe, Australiaand the United Stateshas provided a rare opportunity to study the progression of early disease prospectively in a large number of individuals. Patients are identified early in infection, despite lack of symptoms, due to the detection of abnormal liver function tests at routine clinic follow-up.

The majority of patients infected acutely with HCV progress to chronic infection (55–90%). A number of mechanisms may be responsible for the persistence of virus in these individuals. The virus has an extremely rapid generation time — producing on average, a trillion viral particles every day. Furthermore, the viral genome is copied imperfectly due to the lack of proofreading function of the viral RNA polymerase. The result is the production of a swarm of related, but genetically different viral sequences that circulate at any given time; the quasispecies. The ability of the host immune system to recognise and eliminate each variant strain is highly likely to influence the final outcome. In a small, well-characterised cohort (n = 12) of HIV-negative individuals, it has been shown that those who progress to chronicity have higher viral diversity than those who clear the virus spontaneously. Evolution of the hypervariable region-1 (HVR-1) of the viral envelope-2 (E2) protein, which contains both B and T cell epitopes, is associated with progressive disease, while a narrowed quasispecies repertoire occurs in patients who subsequently spontaneously clear infection. Spontaneous clearance (SC) of virus in HIV-negative individuals is accompanied by the emergence of strong multispecific CD8+ and CD4+ cell responses targeting a broad range of viral epitopes. Less is known about the natural history of early HCV infection in HIV-positive individuals despite the fact that dual infection is commonplace due to shared routes of transmission.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116bgNYr]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) clinical manifestations and progression in people with HIV indicate that both acute and chronic HCV infections are usually minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic, and elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels may be the only laboratory finding during acute and chronic infection; recognition of acute HCV with new-onset liver enzyme elevations is clinically important because early initiation of HCV treatment can lower the likelihood of poorer outcomes and prevent transmission to others; cirrhosis develops in 20 to 40% of patients with chronic HCV infection within 20 years after infection, and HIV coinfection adversely affects the course of HCV with significantly accelerated progression, particularly in those with advanced immunodeficiency (CD4 T lymphocyte [CD4] count < 200 cells/mm3).

### Viral infections in critical care: a narrative review [^113dG1Wo]. Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis viruses

Viral hepatitis may present to ICU as acute infection that requires urgent anti‐viral treatment. Treatment guidelines are available from the European Association for the Study of the Liver. Reactivation of hepatitis B can occur in patients receiving immunosuppressive medications, where again, anti‐viral treatment is indicated. However, the most common presentation is with decompensated chronic liver failure secondary to established cirrhosis from chronic infection. In this latter context, management should be as per guidelines for the management of decompensated chronic liver disease and acute‐on‐chronic liver failure, with expert gastroenterology or hepatology advice. Anti‐viral therapy is used in an attempt to promote viral clearance even when there is established cirrhosis, and patients may present to ICU due to complications of these treatments. Hepatitis C is treated with direct acting anti‐viral therapy, which is usually well tolerated. Hepatitis B treatment is dependent on various factors including the stage of disease; viral load and degree of hepatocellular damage. When pegylated interferon alpha 2 is used, complications may, rarely, lead to ICU admission.

### Hepatitis B and C in Europe: an update from the global burden of disease study 2019 [^114pZMev]. The Lancet: Public Health (2023). High credibility.

We acknowledge several limitations to our study. The main limitation of GBD estimates is the low quality and availability of data in some countries; however, robust statistical methods were used to reduce these limitations in countries with low data availability. In these locations, a combination of predictive covariates and trends in neighbouring countries was applied. The variation in the availability of high-quality data across locations influences the uncertainty associated with all estimates and is reflected in our results by wide 95% UIs for some estimates. Moreover, although GBD statistical modelling is designed to capture uncertainty related to multiple sources of bias (such as selection, measurement, and model specification), there is still some uncertainty not included in the UIs. Defining the proportions of acute hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer due to HBV and HCV is difficult because the aetiological models are informed by small amounts of data. To overcome this issue, models rely on covariates and space–time extrapolation. This methodological issue could be improved with the support of more longitudinal studies and better ascertainment of HBV-related and HCV-related diseases. Furthermore, seroprevalence data can frequently overestimate the number of people with active chronic infection, leading to misclassification of chronic hepatitis due to the absence of specific markers for acute hepatitis. Estimates of chronic hepatitis C do not account for virus-clearing treatments in many countries, and future GBD estimation must include more data related to this aspect. However, in GBD 2019, we changed the strategy of modelling deaths for acute hepatitis B and C from a natural history model relying on inpatient case fatality rates, to CODEm models after predicting type-specific acute hepatitis deaths from vital registration data with specified hepatitis type. Additionally, DisMod-MR was used to determine the proportions of deaths by underlying causes of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Furthermore, the contribution of immigration to hepatitis mortality estimates is not captured by this study. This issue could make it difficult to evaluate the effect of interventions on domestic populations, particularly if immigration is from countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis. Finally, other specific conditions could be associated with issues related to poor outcomes, and, particularly, to death classification, in people infected with HBV and HCV. Although the methods used within GBD, as far as aetiology is concerned, were developed to ascribe the whole burden of a specific condition to the underlying cause, the clinical complexity of liver disease could make these estimates subject to certain limitations and uncertainties, considering the pathogenesis and clinical aspects of HBV-attributable and HCV-attributable disease.

### Hepatitis B and C in Europe: an update from the global burden of disease study 2019 [^114JB5Jn]. The Lancet: Public Health (2023). High credibility.

Although viral infection is a significant factor in the development of acute hepatitis, the severity and clinical outcomes of the disease are influenced by a range of other factors. Age, sex, lifestyle factors (eg, alcohol consumption or substance use), genetic predisposition, and the immune system's ability to control viral replication and limit inflammation can substantially affect the morbidity and mortality associated with viral hepatitis. The presence of co-infections (eg, HIV or hepatitis delta virus) or underlying comorbidities, such as liver disease, obesity, or diabetes, also worsens the clinical outcomes associated with HBV-related or HCV-related liver injury.

GBD considers the contributions of HBV and HCV to the overall burden of chronic liver disease, including chronic liver injury, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and deaths attributed to hepatitis-related complications. By analysing the available evidence, GBD estimates the probability of developing these conditions after being infected with HBV or HCV based on available attributable-fraction studies, accounting for comorbidities and adjusting the estimates accordingly. However, as for acute hepatitis, the viral origin cannot fully provide a comprehensive explanation of clinical outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease. In addition to factors that can influence the clinical course of acute hepatitis, progression to chronic liver disease can vary between individuals due to factors that contribute to liver inflammation and fibrosis, including NAFLD and NASH, and environmental factors (eg, some medications or industrial chemicals).HCV and HBV are also associated with several extrahepatic manifestations, including mixed cryoglobulinaemia, diabetes, cardiocerebrovascular disease, lymphoma, and autoimmune diseases. These non-liver-related complications increase the complexity of liver disease and the roles of HCV or HBV infection in its burden, morbidity, and mortality.

### Diagnosis of hepatitis C virus related acute hepatitis By serial determination of IgM anti-HCV titres [^114uWdp8]. Journal of Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

We investigated whether serial determination of IgM to HCV core protein (HCV IgM) may be useful to identify acute hepatitis C (AHC) and to distinguish this disease from reactivation of chronic hepatitis C (r-CHC).

Methods

We enrolled 35 consecutive patients with AHC identified by seroconversion to anti-HCV and 31 consecutive patients who had been anti-HCV positive for at least six months at the time of reactivation. Titres of HCV IgM were calculated as Index values by a commercially available enzyme immunoassay.

Results

During the early phase of the illness we observed a wide variation in the HCV IgM Index values in all patients in the AHC group and consistent values in all cases in the r-CHC group. The HCV viral load determined soon after the onset of symptoms was of no use in identifying AHC. Twenty-three patients in the AHC group were observed as outpatients for 6–30 months; of these, 10 became plasma HCV-RNA negative within the third month of observation, but three showed a subsequent reactivation of HCV infection.

Conclusions

Our data indicate that the detection of high and variable titres of HCV IgM in the early phase of the illness may identify acute hepatitis C and allow early antiviral treatment.

### Acute hepatitis A and B in patients with chronic liver disease: prevention through vaccination [^111eYtkj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated that the occurrence of acute hepatitis A in patients with chronic liver disease is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality than in previously healthy individuals with acute hepatitis A. The mortality associated with acute hepatitis A may be particularly high in patients with preexisting chronic hepatitis C. Although acute hepatitis B in patients with preexisting chronic liver disease is less well studied, worse outcomes than in previously healthy individuals are apparent. However, numerous studies convincingly demonstrate that chronic hepatitis B virus coinfection with hepatitis C virus (or hepatitis D virus) is associated with an accelerated natural history of liver disease and worse outcomes. These observations led to studies that demonstrated the safety and efficacy of hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination in patients with mild-to-moderate chronic liver disease. Hepatitis A and B vaccination is less effective in patients with advanced liver disease, especially after decompensation, such as in patients awaiting liver transplantation, and in liver transplant recipients. The emerging lower rates of inherent immunity in younger individuals, higher morbidity and mortality of acute hepatitis A or B superimposed on chronic liver disease, and greater vaccine efficacy in milder forms of chronic liver disease suggest that it is a reasonable policy to recommend hepatitis A and B vaccination in patients early in the natural history of chronic liver disease.

Hepatitis C (HCV) and hepatitis B (HBV), are blood-borne viruses that can cause acute hepatitis; but are clinically relevant because chronic infection is associated with development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Both these viruses are becoming more common in the older population, due to the ageing of generations exposed to the risk factors associated with infection; intravenous drug use, multiple sexual partners and men who have sex with men. This review will cover the natural history and epidemiology of these infections as well as the revolution in drug therapy that now allows cure of HCV infection and complete control of HBV infection.

### Long-lasting imprint in the soluble inflammatory milieu despite early treatment of acute symptomatic hepatitis C [^117S2CnX]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus mainly infects hepatocytes, but hepatic inflammation causes systemic changes in blood cytokine and chemokine levels. Most of the studies so far have focused on the chronic phase and only measured very few SIMs. Several studies have independently shown an association between virological response and baseline CXCL-10 concentrations in chronic HCV patients, and it has been proposed that plasma levels of CXCL-10 can predict the risk of fibrosis progression. CXCL-10 is also increased in patients with acute HCV infection who do not spontaneously clear the infection. Others have observed that not just CXCL-10 but also MIP-1β, IL-12p40, and MIG levels are increased, suggesting that their role in HCV immunopathogenesis starts early in acute HCV. In line with these studies, we also observed high CXCL-10 levels in patients with acute hepatitis C and a positive correlation of this SIM with viral load. This confirms that CXCL-10 is a good prognostic marker. Furthermore, when the expression of all measured 65 markers was correlated to the clinical parameters, more positive correlations were observed in acute as opposed to chronic HCV patients. In most cases, viral load correlated positively with SIMs, suggesting that the infection, per se, triggers immune responses. It further implies that there is general activation of the immune system but no immune exhaustion, which is different from chronic HCV infection where it has been shown to be exhausted. The association of SIMs with ALT in acute HCV was as expected. Of note, high ALT levels in acute HCV are associated with a higher chance to clear HCV, as shown in very early studies.

Initial HCV testing and follow-up — For initial screening, HCV-antibody testing with reflex HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction testing is recommended (I, A), and HCV-antibody testing using a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved assay (laboratory-based or point-of-care) is recommended. Among persons with a negative HCV-antibody test who were exposed to HCV within the prior 6 months, HCV-RNA or follow-up HCV-antibody testing 6 months or longer after exposure is recommended; HCV-RNA testing can also be considered for immunocompromised persons (I, C). Among persons at risk for reinfection after previous spontaneous or treatment-related viral clearance, HCV-RNA testing is recommended because a positive HCV-antibody test is expected (I, C). Persons with a positive HCV-antibody test and negative results for HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction should be informed that they do not have evidence of current (active) HCV infection but are not protected from reinfection (I, A). Quantitative HCV-RNA testing is recommended prior to initiation of antiviral therapy to document the baseline level of viremia (i.e., baseline viral load) (I, A). HCV genotype testing may be considered for those in whom it may alter treatment recommendations (I, A).

### Molecular diagnostics of hepatitis C virus infection: a systematic review [^1144bWL8]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a common blood-borne pathogen that relies heavily on nucleic acid testing for confirmation of infection. Nucleic acid tests are invaluable for the diagnosis of HCV infection and provide critical prognostic information for guiding treatment and measuring the response to antiviral therapy.

Objective

To review the currently available molecular diagnostic tests for HCV, their clinical applications, and how these tests shed light on the natural history of HCV.

Evidence Acquisition

Search of MEDLINE (1966 to July 2006), article reference lists, and national meeting abstracts for the diagnosis and applications of molecular diagnostic tests for HCV. Studies were selected on the basis of clinical relevance.

Evidence Synthesis

Qualitative nucleic acid tests have low limits of detection (< 50 IU HCV RNA/mL) and are used for confirmation of HCV infection and for screening blood donations. Hepatitis C virus genotype test results provide important prognostic information related to therapeutic response and are routinely used for selecting treatment regimens. Quantitative HCV RNA testing provides prognostic information regarding likelihood of treatment response and plays an important role in monitoring the antiviral response to treatment. Sustained virological response is defined as testing negative for HCV RNA 6 months after cessation of therapy. Recent studies suggest that the rate of response to therapy is also important. For example, conversion to an HCV RNA negative test result after 4 weeks of therapy constitutes a rapid virological response and is a strong predictor of treatment success. Patients who have not had an early virological response, defined as at least a 2-log decline in HCV RNA after 12 weeks of therapy, are unlikely to respond with an additional 36 weeks of therapy, and should stop therapy.

Conclusions

A sensitive nucleic acid test should be used to confirm all cases of acute or chronic HCV infection. A genotype test and quantitative HCV RNA test should be performed on all patients prior to therapy to best assess probability of response and to aid in selection of appropriate therapeutic regimen. Monitoring HCV RNA during treatment provides important information on likelihood of sustained virological response. The same type of quantitative HCV RNA test should be used throughout a patient's treatment course.

### Distinct features in natural history and outcomes of acute hepatitis C [^1139Kb39]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Overall, SVR was achieved in 80% upon initial therapy and in an additional 2/2 patients with repeat therapy (overall 90% in treated patients) regardless of IL28B genotype. All 4 patients with initial treatment failure received early therapy within 6 months of clinical onset, contrasting with a superior therapeutic response associated with early therapy in some but not all studies.–The rate of SVR was similar among patients who acquired AHCV through injection drugs and other routes (75% vs. 81%, P = 1.0) as reported previously. Of note, 90% SVR in our AHCV cohort is higher than the 50% SVR rates reported for patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection. Among 2 patients who failed IFN therapy, IFN02 showed primary IFN resistance, whereas IFN08 was intolerant. Limited initial treatment duration may have been a factor in IFN01 and IFN08 who relapsed but achieved SVR with retreatment. However, short-term therapy can be effective for AHCV, as IFN05 and IFN15 achieved SVR with only 2 and 14 weeks of therapy, respectively. Thus, virological response to IFN-based therapy was generally excellent in AHCV regardless of timing and duration of therapy, IDU, or IL28B genotype.

### Clinical overview of hepatitis C… [^1149r6H4]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Hepatitis C is transmitted through exposure to infectious blood.
- Most people with hepatitis C virus infection do not have symptoms.
- The best way to prevent hepatitis C is by avoiding behaviors that can spread the disease.
- Testing and treatment can prevent complications related to hepatitis C infection and interrupt transmission.
- Simple, well-tolerated treatments can cure more than 95% of hepatitis C cases. Overview Hepatitis C is a disease of the liver caused by infection from the hepatitis C virus. The virus is primarily transmitted through exposure to infectious blood or body fluids that contain blood. HCV infection can lead to both acute and chronic liver disease. Curative treatments are available, so early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent severe liver damage and prevent ongoing transmission. For EveryoneHepatitis C Basics. Types Acute hepatitis C occurs within the first 6 months after someone is exposed to HCV.

Hepatitis C can be a short-term illness, but for most people, acute infection leads to chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis C can be a lifelong infection if left untreated. More than half of people who become infected with HCV will develop chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis C can cause serious health problems, including liver damage, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and even death. Clinical features Many people with acute or chronic hepatitis C do not look or feel sick and don't know they are infected. If the patient does present with symptoms, they are usually mild and vague. Learn more about signs and symptoms of HCV infection. Prevention There is no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C. Therefore, the best way to prevent hepatitis C is by avoiding behaviors that can spread the disease. If you suspect a patient has been exposed, testing and treatment can prevent complications and interrupt transmission.

Some people with chronic HCV infection develop medical conditions unrelated to the liver. Such conditions can include:

- Diabetes mellitus
- Glomerulonephritis
- Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia
- Porphyria cutanea tarda
- Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Case definitions CDC, in collaboration with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, has developed case definitions to provide uniform clinical and laboratory-testing criteria for identifying and reporting nationally notifiable infectious diseases. Case definitions for acute hepatitis C and chronic hepatitis C are available.

- with elevated ALT or total bilirubin levels;
- with current or recent IDU history;
- who were tested at locations where people at high risk for acute infection are typically seen; or
- who were in a residential facility or custodial care for ≥ 6 months prior to the onset of clinical signs. §If the HCV RNA result is indeterminate, consider provider follow-up to discuss interpretation of result and re-testing strategy. Most people with chronic hepatitis C are asymptomatic; however, approximately 10%–20% of people living with chronic hepatitis C who have persistent liver inflammation will develop cirrhosis over the course of 20 years, and people with cirrhosis are at risk for developing liver cancer and other serious consequences.

Those with hepatitis C who do not develop liver-related complications can still suffer from extrahepatic manifestations of chronic hepatitis C. Additionally, those living with chronic hepatitis C can continue to transmit the infection to others, and antibodies to HCV are not protective against reinfection. Downloads of this table: PDF | PPT People who test positive for anti-HCV and have a negative HCV detection test received before the data closes for that reporting year should be classified as "not a case" and should not be notified to CDC. People who test positive for anti-HCV and HCV RNA are still considered confirmed cases even if they later clear their infection. The critical differentiation for the case definition between acute cases and chronic cases is the presence of clinical criteria in the absence of a more likely diagnosis. To be classified as a probable acute case, provider reports of jaundice or laboratory reports of elevated total bilirubin or ALT must have been received within the reporting year prior to data close-out. Additionally, if HCV RNA is detectable and anti-HCV is undetectable on the same specimen, this could indicate laboratory evidence of early acute hepatitis C when anti-HCV testing was performed during the window period. See Section 5.
