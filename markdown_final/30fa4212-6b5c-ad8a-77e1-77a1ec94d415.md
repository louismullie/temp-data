## Question

A 15-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because of abdominal pain and constipation for the past several weeks. Her mother says, "She is getting almost all A's in school and she is on the track team". You ask the patient about her diet and she responds, "I'm kind of a picky eater". She requests a laxative to help with her constipation. She is 158 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 43 kg (95 lb); BMI is 18 kg/m². Pulse is 65/min. Specific additional history should be obtained regarding which of the following?

Answer Choices:
A. Color, caliber, and frequency of bowel movements
B. Exposure to sexually transmitted diseases
C. Family history of irritable bowel syndrome
D. Menstrual history

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which additional history element is most important to obtain for a 15-year-old girl with abdominal pain and constipation, who is a high-achieving student and track athlete, has a BMI of 18 kg/m², and describes herself as a "picky eater". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the red flags in the vignette that point toward energy deficiency and the female athlete triad. Then, I should verify which history element best screens for that condition and its reproductive consequences. Next, I will consider the other answer choices and why they are less critical right now. Finally, I will confirm the guideline-backed rationale for treating the menstrual cycle as a vital sign in adolescents and outline the immediate next steps if menstrual irregularity is identified.

> Let me first confirm the red flags: a BMI of 18 kg/m² sits at the lower end of normal and, in the context of a picky eater and high-volume athletic training, raises concern for low energy availability. Track is a leanness-emphasizing sport, and amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea in this setting is a known risk factor for bone stress injury and signals the female athlete triad, so I need to ensure I screen for menstrual dysfunction explicitly [^22626db6].

> Wait, let me verify the most impactful next question. The menstrual history is the highest-yield element here because menstrual irregularity is a core manifestation of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea due to low energy availability, and ACOG advises treating the menstrual cycle as a vital sign in adolescents, with specific thresholds for evaluation such as absence of menses by 15 years, cycles more frequent than every 21 days or less frequent than every 45 days, or 90-day gaps, all of which would be clinically meaningful in this case [^9fc860c3] [^c39cc034].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the other options. I initially thought bowel movement caliber and frequency might be the next best thing because constipation is the chief complaint, but wait, I should double-check whether that would change management today. While stool characteristics are relevant, they are less likely to reveal a systemic, high-consequence condition like the female athlete triad in this context, and they can be deferred while I prioritize the menstrual history that could pivot evaluation toward bone health, nutrition, and endocrine issues [^22626db6].

> I need to check the relevance of STD exposure. Sexual history is important in adolescent care, but there is no indication of sexual activity or symptoms suggesting STDs here, and asking about STDs now would not address the immediate physiologic concern of low energy availability and its reproductive consequences, so this is not the most pressing addition today [^notfound].

> Let me consider family history of IBS. While IBS can present with constipation and abdominal pain, there is no family history provided and no clear IBS phenotype in this vignette, and this would not uncover the endocrine–nutritional problem that the vitals and context suggest, so it is lower priority than menstrual history in this case [^notfound].

> I should confirm the guideline basis one more time. ACOG's Committee Opinion explicitly recommends obtaining a detailed menstrual history in adolescents, especially when eating or exercise patterns raise concern, and sports medicine guidance similarly flags menstrual irregularity as a key screening marker for low energy availability and bone stress injury risk, reinforcing that menstrual history is the essential next step here [^9fc860c3] [^22626db6].

> Next, I should review what to do if menstrual irregularity is identified. If she reports amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, or cycles outside normal adolescent ranges, I would screen for disordered eating, assess calcium and vitamin D intake, and consider bone health evaluation, because functional hypothalamic amenorrhea carries risks of low BMD and stress fractures. Management focuses on restoring energy availability, nutrition, and sometimes menstrual suppression or bone-protective strategies depending on severity and goals [^74fa5308] [^479f8652] [^22626db6].

> Final answer: D. Menstrual history, because it is the most sensitive screen for functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and the female athlete triad in this adolescent with low BMI, picky eating, and high-volume athletics, and it is endorsed as a vital sign in adolescent girls by ACOG and sports medicine guidance [^9fc860c3] [^22626db6].

---

The most important additional history to obtain is **menstrual history** [^13685e69] because the patient's low BMI, picky eating, and participation in track raise concern for **functional hypothalamic amenorrhea** [^7a44b674] and the female athlete triad [^22626db6], which can present with constipation and abdominal pain. Menstrual irregularity or amenorrhea in this context signals low energy availability and hypothalamic dysfunction, guiding evaluation and management [^74fa5308]. While bowel movement details, STD exposure, and family history of IBS are relevant, they are less likely to reveal the underlying cause in this scenario.

---

## Clinical significance of menstrual history

Menstrual history is a **vital sign** [^13685e69] in adolescent girls, providing critical information about hormonal health, nutritional status, and potential underlying medical conditions. In this patient, obtaining a detailed menstrual history is essential to assess for functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) [^7a44b674], a condition characterized by menstrual irregularity or absence due to low energy availability, often associated with excessive exercise, restrictive eating, or low body weight [^74fa5308].

---

## Connection between menstrual history and current symptoms

The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and constipation, combined with her low BMI, picky eating, and participation in track, are highly suggestive of **low energy availability** [^22626db6] and FHA. FHA results from a disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, leading to decreased gonadotropin secretion, estrogen deficiency, and menstrual irregularities [^479f8652]. Estrogen deficiency can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, including constipation and abdominal discomfort, due to altered gut motility and visceral sensitivity [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) emphasizes the importance of menstrual history in adolescent girls, particularly in the context of eating disorders, excessive exercise, and low body weight [^74fa5308]. ACOG recommends routine documentation of menstrual history, including age at menarche, cycle regularity, duration, and flow, as well as associated symptoms such as dysmenorrhea and premenstrual symptoms [^13685e69]. In patients with suspected FHA, further evaluation includes assessing nutritional intake, exercise patterns, and psychological factors [^7a44b674].

---

## Comparison with other answer choices

While the other answer choices are clinically relevant, they are less likely to provide the critical information needed to identify the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms:

- **Color, caliber, and frequency of bowel movements**: Although important in evaluating constipation, these details alone do not address the potential underlying hormonal and nutritional factors contributing to the patient's symptoms.

- **Exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)**: STDs are unlikely given the patient's age, presentation, and lack of reported sexual activity or symptoms suggestive of STDs.

- **Family history of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)**: While family history can be relevant, it does not directly address the patient's nutritional status, exercise patterns, or hormonal health, which are more likely to be the primary drivers of her symptoms.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's clinical presentation, the most important additional history to obtain is her **menstrual history** [^13685e69]. This will provide critical information to assess for functional hypothalamic amenorrhea [^7a44b674] and related conditions, guiding appropriate evaluation and management. Clinicians should inquire about age at menarche, cycle regularity, duration, flow, and associated symptoms, as well as nutritional intake, exercise patterns, and psychological factors [^74fa5308].

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 651 — evaluation and menstrual history tracking in adolescents emphasizes early preventive visits and routine cycle documentation. Preventive health visits should begin during adolescence, and once adolescent girls begin menstruating, clinicians should ask at every preventive care or comprehensive visit for the patient's first day of her last menstrual period and the pattern of menses; asking the patient to chart her menses may be beneficial. Clinicians should explain that cycle length is counted from the first day of a menstrual period to the first day of the next menses and may vary by cycle, and use of technology can facilitate charting.

Family medicine clinicians and menstrual health

Family medicine clinicians care for people of all ages and life stages. They are on the front lines of preventative medicine and can be a great resource for patients trying to improve their quality of life through medical and lifestyle means. By caring for people across their lifespans, family medicine clinicians are well poised to address menstrual health with patients who menstruate. They may see their patients who menstruate when they first begin menstruating in adolescence, when they become sexually active, when they are trying to become pregnant, when they are trying not to become pregnant, when their periods begin to slow at perimenopause, and at all other times in between. Family medicine clinicians are trained to provide comprehensive women's health services and should include menstrual history as a vital sign to be addressed at routine visits. The scope of menstruation and menstrual wellness is expansive, with connections to family planning, sexual wellness, diet and exercise habits, and mental health. Patients can feel more in control of their bodies by understanding their menstrual cycle and its full-body impacts overall.

### Lifelong menstrual histories are typically erratic and trending: a taxonomy [^fb81f9a8]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Menstrual cycles are composites of complex events; the data describing them are correspondingly rich. We seek to quantitatively represent menstrual histories from menarche to menopause and to evaluate the clinical belief that regular and stable cycle lengths are the most normative histories.

Design

Using prospective data from the Tremin Trust, we classified the menstrual histories of 628 women as very stable (type I), stable but with greater variability in cycle lengths (type II), oscillating and erratic with a downward trend in cycle length (type III), oscillating and erratic with no downward trend in cycle length (type IV), or highly erratic and variable (type V). Classification criteria were created by examining basic summary statistics of menstrual cycle lengths. Specifically, we identified key features describing variability of median cycle length, the mean of the interquartile range, the consistency of the interquartile range, the slope of median cycle lengths, and the number of stable 5-year intervals between ages 15 and 45+.

Results

We present the first characterization of full menstrual histories. Our taxonomy captures the essential features of menstrual bleeding patterns for a heterogeneous population. Persistently stable histories (types I and II) were seen in only 28% of the women; erratic histories (types III through V) characterized 72%. When examining all participants, significant differences were seen in age at menarche (P < 0.05), age at menopause (P < 0.01), and number of births (P < 0.01) between these stable and erratic groups.

Conclusions

Although clinicians have traditionally thought of "normal" menstrual histories as being regular and stable, the distribution of women in our five categories suggest that variable histories are most common. Clinically, these results may suggest the need for a paradigm shift in what gynecologists view as normal and abnormal menstrual cycle histories.

### The normal menstrual cycle [^c39cc034]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The normal ovulatory menstrual cycle requires the presence of a mature hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and highly coordinated hormonal feedback loops. Consisting of three phases (follicular, ovulatory, and luteal), the normal menstrual cycle results in the formation of a mature follicle and release of an oocyte during each cycle, with menses occurring in the absence of fertilization. While adolescents may initially experience anovulatory cycles following menarche, the vast majority of cycles will be fairly regular, lasting 21 to 45 days in length with an average of three to seven days of bleeding. Absence of menarche by age 15, absence of menses for three consecutive months, and menses lasting eight days or longer with or without associated heavy bleeding are among the menstrual abnormalities that warrant further evaluation. Obtaining the menstrual history in adolescents with the knowledge of expected menstrual patterns allows the pediatric practitioner to provide appropriate counseling and education to adolescents and their families, and to identify menstrual abnormalities when they arise. Treating the menstrual cycle as a "vital sign" highlights the importance of normal menses as an indicator of an individual's overall health and enables timely identification of any concerning findings.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^046be0d1]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea — definitions and thresholds for evaluation — Amenorrhea is the absence or abnormal cessation of menses, with primary amenorrhea evaluated when there is failure to menstruate by the age of 15 in the presence of normal secondary sexual development (2 standard deviations above the mean of 13 years), or within 5 years after breast development if that occurs before the age of 10; failure to initiate breast development by the age of 13 (2 standard deviations above the mean of 10 years) also requires investigation. In women with regular menstrual cycles, a delay of menses for as little as 1 week may require the exclusion of pregnancy. Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses for > 3 months in those with previously regular cycles or 6 months in those with irregular menses, and requires investigation.

### The association between menstrual cycle characteristics and cardiometabolic outcomes in later life: a retrospective matched cohort study of 704, 743 women from the UK [^63bb169a]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Implications for public health and research

Findings from the present study support calls for the inclusion of menstrual cycle history as an additional vital sign in the assessment of the overall health status of young women. Specifically, abnormal menstruation may act as a window into the future cardiometabolic health of women. Therefore, women with history of irregular menstrual cycles or frequent or infrequent menstrual cycles may benefit from periodic evaluation of their cardiometabolic health. Current UK guidelines should consider incorporating reproductive factors including menstrual cycle characteristics as risk enhancing factors for cardiometabolic disease given the low awareness about these factors among UK physicians. Future research should determine the pathophysiological mechanisms linking menstrual cycle complications and adverse cardiometabolic health and the factors behind the differential impact of different menstrual cycle characteristics and poor cardiometabolic outcomes.

### Patterns of menstrual disturbance in eating disorders [^b7a561a3]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe menstrual disturbance in eating disorders (ED).

Method

We describe menstrual history in 1,705 women and compare eating, weight, and psychopathological traits across menstrual groups.

Results

Menstrual dysfunction occurred across all eating disorder subtypes. Individuals with normal menstrual history and primary amenorrhea reported the highest and lowest lifetime body mass index (BMI), respectively. Normal menstruation and oligomenorrhea groups reported greater binge eating, vomiting, and appetite suppressant use. Amenorrhea was associated with lower caloric intake and higher exercise. Harm avoidance, novelty seeking, perfectionism, and obsessionality discriminated among menstrual status groups. No differences in comorbid Axis I and II disorders were observed.

Conclusion

Menstrual dysfunction is not limited to any eating disorder subtype. BMI, caloric intake, and exercise were strongly associated with menstrual function. Menstrual status is not associated with comorbidity. Menstrual irregularity is an associated feature of all ED rather than being restricted to AN only.

### Menstrual technology innovations and the implications for heavy menstrual bleeding [^da0077cc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Menstruation is a personal and cultural experience with financial and health implications. Menstruation historically has been managed with disposable commodities, including tampons and pads. New technologies, including underwear and menstrual cups and discs, have emerged to address diverse menstrual needs such as prioritization of sustainability, discretion, and inclusivity. New technologies are not routinely integrated into history taking or validated questionnaires, which currently rely on traditional tampon and pad use for identifying individuals with heavy menstrual bleeding. Review of menstrual technologies and accessories provides insight to empower gynecologists and other clinicians to take comprehensive menstrual histories, including strategies for identification of heavy menstrual bleeding and troubleshooting menstrual disturbances, within the context of new menstrual technologies.

Standardizing data collection in research, clinical care, and mobile health technologies to promote consistency and optimize comparative effectiveness research

A shift in research to focus on measuring patient experiences with symptoms and chronic health problems, including reproductive health and menstrual health issues, represents significant progress in the arena of women's health. However, although there are several validated PROMs for AUB, there is no single high-quality PROM that is considered "standard of care" or "standard for use across studies". This translates into hundreds of outcome measures, of varying quality, used across studies and an inability to combine data across studies to summarize patient experience. In a systematic review of patient-reported outcomes used across studies of AUB, authors found 80 studies that used at least 1 PROM and 77 different PROMs were used across studies. The Society of Gynecologic Surgeons, in a systematic review comparing treatments for HMB, identified that 114 different outcomes were collected and reported across 79 distinct clinical trials. The end result was that, because the method of assessing outcomes differed from study to study, data could not be combined or summarized for these outcomes (such as quality of life and bleeding-related quality of life), which prohibited the group from generating consensus on treatment effectiveness relative to patient-reported outcomes. Researchers across disciplines of menstrual health research have expressed challenges describing the menstrual symptom phenotype of patients involved in clinical research because of a lack of standardized structured menstrual history data elements. Finally, discussions at this meeting also highlighted the importance of a broader view of menstrual health that goes beyond bleeding to include other associated symptoms, which will need additional research and standardized data elements.

The research community can collaborate to address this challenge and standardize outcomes and data elements for research and quality assessments. For example, the Core Outcomes in Women's and Newborn Health, an international initiative led by journal editors and is endorsed by more than 80 peer-reviewed journals in women's health, is working to stimulate the development of outcome sets that can be used across studies to ensure consistent outcome reporting, thereby improving the interpretability of study results and the feasibility of combining data across studies. Efforts to standardize data elements from a structured menstrual history describing frequency, regularity, duration, and patient-quantified volume of bleeding along with other associated menstrual symptoms are needed to facilitate consistent descriptions of populations in studies on menstrual health, AUB, uterine fibroids, and other reproductive health issues.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^18e81a57]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Secondary amenorrhea — approach to evaluation emphasizes first excluding pregnancy and then using a stepwise workup: The possibility of pregnancy must be at the forefront of differential diagnoses for secondary amenorrhea, and once pregnancy has been ruled out, a stepwise approach to evaluation is recommended, as outlined in Figure 2; in contrast to primary amenorrhea, the diagnostic yield of physical examination alone is less; a thorough history and reproductive hormone profile constitute the backbone of diagnostic evaluation, and pelvic ultrasound, if accessible and available, can help streamline evaluation early in the process; in many cases, only a few of the tests listed in Figure 2 are necessary, and the temporal pattern of menses since the onset of menarche is informative.

### Standardising health history and injury surveillance of participants in endurance events: a modified Delphi consensus statement from the AMSSM runner health consortium [^d250d3f6]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Menstrual and reproductive history

Based on panel responses to item options for the biological sex of females or transgender men, each should be asked about menstrual status. Those who report having menstruated should complete further detailed menstrual history to capture the age of menarche, number of menstrual periods in the past 12 months, missing ≥ 3 consecutive menstrual periods and current menstrual cycle status. The items on menstrual status are recommended given that changes in menstrual status may result from low energy availability and contribute to overuse injuries and impaired skeletal health. To account for the role of hormonal contraception on menstrual status, the panel recommends asking about current use.

While many women and transgender men may run during pregnancy, limited reports are available to define the influence of pregnancy and breast feeding on the health of runners. Additional items include current pregnancy, most recent pregnancy birth date and breastfeeding history. These items are proposed to understand the influence of endurance participation on health in this population.

Mental health

While exercise can improve mood, the influence of mental health on running-related injury risk and changes in mental health due to injury are not well described. The dynamic biopsychosocial model of health supports the need to quantify psychological aspects of health and measure changes over time. Many published and validated questionnaires measure mental health including depression and anxiety. The voting members recommend the use of Patient Health Questionnaire 2-item for a measure of depressionand Generalised Anxiety Disorder 2-item for anxiety. The panel recommends the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global 10 which can generate normative values for physical and mental health. Other questionnaires were not selected due to concerns about a larger number of items needed to generate scores.

Footwear

A series of items are recommended to understand footwear use by participants of endurance events who walk and/or run. While typical footwear use has not been conclusively shown to prevent or contribute to running-related injuries, acute changes in footwear have been suggested to influence injury risk, such as changing to minimalist shoesand technologically advanced running shoes with carbon fibre plates. The panel recommends items on types of shoes used for training and racing, changes to a new running shoe and specific inquiry on technologically advanced running shoes using terminology more familiar to the general population: use of shoes with a carbon fibre plate, commonly referred to as 'supershoes'. s foot orthoses are commonly used, the panel recommends inquiring about the use and type of foot orthoses in running shoes.

### Review of the confusion in current and historical terminology and definitions for disturbances of menstrual bleeding [^dad51de0]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

There has been increasing recent recognition of the worldwide confusion in the terminology and definitions for abnormalities of menstrual and uterine bleeding. The present review was undertaken to objectively explore some of the origins and current uses of terms for symptoms, signs, and causes of abnormal uterine bleeding and to demonstrate the international lack of uniformity.

Design

A detailed, but not systematic, search of the huge current and historical literature across the range of menstrual terminology, definitions, and some causes, with an emphasis on "menorrhagia" and "dysfunctional uterine bleeding".

Setting

An international collaboration to study ways of reaching worldwide agreement on descriptive terms and definitions for abnormal bleeding.

Result(S)

A large number of synonyms and overlapping terms for heavy menstrual bleeding have been identified, as well as smaller numbers of terms for other symptoms and causes of abnormal uterine bleeding. The origins and meanings of several of these terms have been explored in detail and wide variations in meaning demonstrated.

Conclusion(S)

There is great confusion in the way these terminologies are used and there is an urgent need for international agreement on consistent use of terms and definitions for symptoms, signs, and causes of abnormal uterine bleeding.

### Eating behaviours, menstrual history and the athletic career: a retrospective survey from adolescence to adulthood in female endurance athletes [^a43941d8]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Associations of menstrual history and history of DE behaviours with a sports career

No differences were found between athletes with and without primary or secondary amenorrhoea in sports career length or participation level or between those with and without DE at ages 13–15, 16–18 or 19–21 in participation level. Athletes with DE at age 16–18 had a shorter career than those without DE at that age (10.5 years vs 14.0 years, p = 0.020), while no differences in career length were found between those with and without DE at ages 13–15 and 19–21.

The GEE models for the associations of menstrual history and eating behaviours during the sports career with sports career-related factors among athletes are presented in table 4. EDE-QS scores were associated with sports career length, with one point in the EDE-QS score being associated with a 0.15-year shorter career. Those reporting secondary amenorrhoea during their sports career had 0.5 times lower odds of being competed at the international level (vs national level), 4.0 times higher odds of reporting that injuries/pain negatively affected their sports career and 1.9 times higher odds of reporting that an injury had affected their sports career termination. The secondary analysis, where EDE-QS scores at ages 13–15, 16–18 and 19–21 from all athletes were used, is presented in online supplemental file 1.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 740: gynecologic care for adolescents and young women with eating disorders [^74fa5308]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 740 — Menstrual cycle disturbances in adolescents and young women with eating disorders — Although menstrual disturbance is no longer part of the DSM-V diagnostic criteria for any eating disorder, the menstrual cycle is considered a vital sign when evaluating young women and adolescents with eating disorders, and a detailed history of pubertal development and of the menstrual cycle is critical and should be part of an assessment of overall health status for all adolescents and young adult women; delayed puberty, amenorrhea, and oligomenorrhea may be presenting symptoms of a previously undiagnosed eating disorder, the etiology of menstrual dysfunction is related to the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis, and in anorexia nervosa energy and fat mass depletion combined with low levels of leptin and insulin-like growth factor 1 affect luteinizing hormone pulsatility.

Menstrual disorders in hospitalized adolescents — if evidence of a menstrual disorder is revealed, it can be addressed during the hospitalization, and an adolescent with a history of heavy periods, particularly if anemic, should be evaluated for the etiology of this menstrual concern with consultation from adolescent medicine or gynecology and possibly hematology, with empirical anemia treatment considered. Adolescents with irregular menses with no anemia could have the evaluation begin in the hospital and be scheduled for follow-up with their PCP, an adolescent medicine specialist, or a gynecologist. If an adolescent admitted for another medical or surgical concern is found to be anemic and is currently menstruating, treatment to stop menses or address menorrhagia can be considered during the hospitalization, and adolescent medicine or gynecology could be consulted to initiate medical treatment to stop menses, if warranted. Menstrual suppression can be addressed and initiated in the inpatient setting for those who with IDDs, those who will undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), or those who have thrombocytopenia or a functional platelet disorder or another clotting disorder.

### Menstruation: choosing whether… and when [^7d338257]. Contraception (2000). Low credibility.

For many women in the United States, menstruation is a major health concern because menstrual disorders and other conditions that may be aggravated during menses (e.g., migraine headaches, epilepsy) carry substantial morbidity. Women today menstruate nearly 3 times as often as in primitive societies, and evidence suggests that frequent, repetitive menstrual cycles may increase health risks. Because the conventional 21/7 combination oral contraceptive (OC) regimen provides only limited relief for women with menstrual disorders, alternative OC regimens that reduce menstrual frequency have been proposed. A new OC formulation specifically designed to decrease menstrual bleeding to 4 times per year is currently under investigation. Most women welcome less frequent menses or even amenorrhea. Women who may derive particular benefit from reduced menstrual frequency include not only those with medical conditions directly caused or aggravated by menses, but also those serving in the military, female athletes, mentally-retarded women with menstrual hygiene problems, young teens, and perimenopausal women.

### Measure do not guess: a call to action to end assumed and estimated menstrual cycle phases in research [^23e9cc8e]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The solution

The way to establish menstrual cycle phases in research (ie, laboratory and field-based studies) is clear: in addition to noting regular bleeding, investigators need to measure ovulation and progesterone, noting that the ideal frequency and modality of these measurements are still to be determined. Studies using this approach date back to the early 2000sand guidance on this approach has been produced several times within the last 5 years. Although this approach may be challenging in field-based studies, it is certainly not impossible.

### Management of premenstrual disorders: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 7 [^17804fef]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Premenstrual disorders — evaluation and diagnosis — are based on a retrospective history that symptoms have been present most cycles in the preceding year plus 2 months of prospective symptom recording; experts generally recommend recording symptoms for two consecutive cycles using a validated tool such as the Daily Record of Severity of Problems, which is aligned with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders diagnostic criteria for PMDD, or a simple diary with a daily severity score of 1–5, and if a diary is inconclusive a 3-month trial of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy may help confirm the diagnosis; prospective recording helps discern premenstrual disorders from underlying conditions, with cyclic symptoms limited to the premenstrual phase and the first few days of menses associated with PMS and PMDD, whereas intermittent symptoms across the cycle or chronic symptoms that worsen premenstrually suggest other medical or mood disorders; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria require a minimum of five symptoms, including at least one of four key affective symptoms, for PMDD, and PMDD symptoms are predominantly affective and severe enough to interfere with the ability to function.

### Menstruation: science and society [^69dc36e2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Twenty-five years have passed since the National Institutes of Health (NIH) mandated that women and minorities be included in all government-funded clinical studies unless their exclusion could be justified. Clearly, this policy has led to numerous women's health research programs. However, women and women's health concerns continue to be underrepresented in research. Most recently, the 2019–2023 Trans-NIH Strategic Plan for Women's Health Research was initiated to improve the health of women by advancing rigorous research relevant to advancing women's health, including sexual and reproductive health (SRH). Despite focused initiatives such as these, diagnostic development for improving women's reproductive health has been hampered by a lack of understanding of basic uterine and menstrual physiology. A PubMed search of the term "menstruation" yielded less the 1000 publications between 1941 and 1950, followed by a peak of more than 6000 publications between 1971 and 1980 (note: Our Bodies, Ourselves, a book addressing women's health topics, including menstruation and birth control, was published in 1973), and then a stable trough with less the 4000 publications per decade over the past 3 decades spanning 1991 through 2019 (Figure 1, A). By contrast, a PubMed search of the term "menstrual blood" yielded 1 publication during 1941–1950, followed by a steady increase over time to more than 400 publications in the last decade (Figure 1, B). For reference, PubMed searches of "peripheral blood" and "semen" yielded almost 100,000 and 15,000 publications, respectively, over the past decade.

### Rates of menstrual history-taking and counseling with anticancer treatments are low: people who menstruate deserve gender-specific cancer care [^929b7180]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chemotherapy predisposes people who menstruate to abnormal uterine bleeding that can be life-threatening and may also damage ovaries, resulting in premature menopause. The purpose of this study was to explore the incidence of menstrual history documentation and counseling before, during, and after cancer treatment.

Patients and Methods

The medical charts of 137 consecutive females (self-reported) aged 18 to 49 years receiving anticancer treatment at a major tertiary metropolitan hospital in Australia between 2017 and 2020 were reviewed. Data collected included primary diagnosis, stage of cancer, treatment(s) received, rates of remission or progression, documentation of involvement of a specialist gynecologist, reproductive history, menstrual disturbances, menstruation counseling or intervention offered, and diagnosis of early ovarian failure.

Results

Only 16.1% of patients had their menstrual history documented at the initial consult, and 49.6% had their menstrual history documented at a subsequent consult with their treating oncologist or hematologist. Most (82.4%) patients with a menstrual history documented experienced menstrual disturbance posttreatment, most commonly amenorrhea (48.0%), followed by menopause or menopause symptoms (20.6%), irregular menstrual bleeding (16.7%), menorrhagia (13.7%), dysmenorrhea (3.9%), and iron deficiency from bleeding (2.9%). Menopause/Menopausal symptoms and iron deficiency were more likely to be treated than other disturbances.

Conclusions

Menstruation disturbance is a common side effect of cancer treatment. Menstrual care should be integral to cancer care for people who menstruate, and higher engagement could be achieved through education of medical and allied health staff, information technology systems automating prompts and referral pathways, regular audits to ensure compliance, better alliances between cancer and fertility specialists, and the creation of accessible patient information to promote awareness and facilitate discussion.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^2938c267]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Menstrual suppression in transgender and gender diverse youth involves history-taking, contraception counseling, option selection, and monitoring. When testosterone is not used, menstrual suppression can be achieved via a progestin, and to exclude any underlying menstrual disorders it is important to obtain a detailed menstrual history and evaluation prior to implementing menstrual-suppressing therapy; as part of the discussion, the need for contraception and information regarding the effectiveness of menstrual-suppressing medications as methods of contraception also need to be addressed. Progestin-only hormonal medications include oral progestins, depo-medroxyprogesterone injection, etonogestrel implant, and levonorgestrel IUD, and these options vary in efficacy for menstrual suppression and have lower rates of achieving amenorrhea than combined oral contraception; some patients may opt for combined oral contraception that includes different combinations of ethinyl estradiol and different generations of progestins, with lower dose ethinyl estradiol components associated with increased breakthrough uterine bleeding. Continuous combined oral contraceptives may be used to allow for continuous menstrual suppression and can be delivered as transdermal or vaginal rings, and HCPs should not make assumptions regarding the individual's preferred method of administration as some trans masculine youth may prefer vaginal rings or IUD implants. The use of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues may also result in menstrual suppression; however, it is recommended gender diverse youth meet the eligibility criteria before this medication is considered solely for this purpose. When exogenous testosterone is employed as a gender-affirming hormone, menstrual suppression is typically achieved in the first six months of therapy, but it is vital adolescents be counseled ovulation and pregnancy can still occur in the setting of amenorrhea. Although hormonal medications require monitoring for potential mood lability, depressive effects, or both, the benefits and risks of untreated menstrual suppression in the setting of gender dysphoria should be evaluated on an individual basis.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^ed99f5e7]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

4 SYSTEM 1

4.1 Normal and abnormal uterine bleeding definitions and terminology

FIGO System 1 was developed to formalize the nomenclature and definitions of normal and abnormal menstrual bleeding, allowing clinicians, investigators, and patients to align on the description of the bleeding patterns of those complaining of AUB (Figure 1). Each element is considered in the context of a structured history and defines normal and, therefore, abnormal features generally based on the fifth to 95th percentiles from large‐scale clinical studies. System 1 was the product of a rigorous Delphi process that was used to develop simple and translatable definitions while identifying and removing the need for obsolete terminologies such as menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

FIGURE 1
FIGO Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB) System 1, defining the nomenclature and definition of AUB (30). *The normal range is age dependent, with shortest to longest days for 18–25 years at ≤ 9 days, 26–41 years at ≤ 7 days, and 42–45 years at ≤ 9 days.

As seen in Figure 1, application of FIGO System 1 in a clinical scenario requires a structured history that allows a description of the four parameters of frequency, duration, regularity, and subjective flow volume, as well as the presence or absence of IMB and unscheduled bleeding for those on progestin‐based gonadal steroid formulations. Of course, cyclical administration of estrogen and progestin‐containing agents, typically for contraception, is expected to result in cyclical withdrawal bleeding from the endometrium. All the metrics are based on the previous 6 months, provided there has been no pregnancy or puerperium.

Frequency

The number of days in an average menstrual cycle from the first day of bleeding in one cycle to the first day of the next cycle. The normal length of a menstrual cycle ranges from 24 to 38 days, whereas abnormal frequency of menstruation is less than 24 days (frequent menses) or more than 38 days (infrequent menses). The absence of menstrual bleeding, without an iatrogenic cause, should be characterized as amenorrhea, as this too is abnormal.

Duration

The number of consecutive bleeding days in each cycle, where the count begins with the onset of bleeding and ends on the last day of blood flow, including the light bleeding, often called spotting. It is normal for women to bleed for up to eight consecutive days, whereas longer than this would be considered prolonged and abnormal.

### Assessment of menstrual health status and evolution through mobile apps for fertility awareness [^ad43f5c1]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The long term and yet very precise recordings presented in this study support the idea that the menstrual cycle, like other biological rhythms, is a vital sign whose variations inform about overall health status. The digital epidemiology approach, where patients collect data themselves through digital means, can in this context represent a powerful method to investigate menstrual health and its connection to women's health at the population levelin a field that has historically been severely understudied.

We foresee that future studies will use self-tracked data to quantify infertility or daily pregnancy chances based on reported FAM body signs and user's history. Models could also be established to investigate potential sub-fertility causes (anovulation, recurrent early pregnancy losses, etc.) based on the fertility signs and user's sexual behavior. More generally, such data and tracking apps, combined with tracking of other coexisting symptoms, health indicators or behavioral markers, enable the exploration of the menstrual dimension of the course of chronic diseases. Such studies would highly benefit from additional, sometimes already existing, tracking options in the apps such as pregnancy validation (for example reports of pregnancy tests results) or a prompt to the user to label a tracking pause such that it can reliably be differentiated from a pregnancy. Many menstrual symptoms associated with the pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS), such as mastalgia (breast pain), or disease, like migraine that can exist in a menstrual or non-menstrual form, have been shown to be associated with steroid hormones although the exact causes have not been elucidated yet. – Future studies using self-reported occurrence, severity and frequency of such symptoms in large population and in relationship to menstrual health might allow for the investigation of associations or specific phenotypes, i.e. distinct forms of symptom expression in the population.

It is likely that users of such applications already have an increased awareness of their cycles, and this study suggests that these digitally self-tracked observations potentially present an opportunity to facilitate the dialog between patients and their clinicians, helping them to make informed decisions based on quantified indicators. The current and future development of evidence-based digital tools for menstrual health monitoring could positively impact women's health.

### Eating behaviours, menstrual history and the athletic career: a retrospective survey from adolescence to adulthood in female endurance athletes [^c395f511]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Aim

To evaluate differences in menstrual and pubertal history and trends in eating behaviours among women with and without a competitive sports background. Additionally, we investigated if menstrual history and eating behaviours are associated with sports career-related factors.

Methods

This retrospective study was conducted on 100 women with a competitive endurance sports background and their age-matched, gender-matched and municipality-matched controls (n = 98). Data were collected using a questionnaire using previously validated instruments. Generalised estimating equations were used to calculate associations of menstrual history and eating behaviours with outcome variables (career length, participation level, injury-related harms and career termination due to injury).

Results

Athletes reported higher rates of delayed puberty and menstrual dysfunction than controls. No differences between the groups were observed in the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire short form (EDE-QS) scores at any age. Previous disordered eating (DE) was associated with current DE in both groups. Among athletes, higher EDE-QS scores during the sports career were associated with a shorter career (B = −0.15, 95% CI −0.26 to –0.05). Secondary amenorrhoea was associated with lower participation level (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.95), injury-related harms during the career (OR 4.00, 95% CI 1.88 to 8.48) and career termination due to injury (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.51).

Conclusion

The findings indicate that DE behaviours and menstrual dysfunction, specifically secondary amenorrhoea, have a disadvantageous relationship with a sports career in women competing in endurance sports. DE during the sports career is associated with DE after the career.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 194 summary: polycystic ovary syndrome [^51aede67]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) includes other causes of androgen excess and relies on focused history and examination. The history should assess the onset and duration of signs of androgen excess, menstrual history, and concomitant medications including exogenous androgens, and should document family history of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, especially first-degree relatives with premature cardiovascular disease (male younger than 55 years and female younger than 65 years). The physical examination should evaluate balding, acne, clitoromegaly, and body hair distribution.

### Menstruation and the menopausal transition [^cee2d24a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

This paper characterizes changes in menstrual bleeding during perimenopause, including bleeding changes that represent markers of the menopausal transition. Recent results from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation and other cohort studies are reviewed. Emerging data describing subpopulation differences in the transition experience are highlighted. When treating women in the midlife, clinicians should pay careful attention to medical factors, including both conditions and treatments, that may increase menstrual blood loss or alter menstrual cycle characteristics sufficiently to obscure the onset of the menopausal transition or the final menstrual period.

### Dysmenorrhea [^a013b88d]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dysmenorrhea:

- **Definition**: Dysmenorrhea refers to painful menstruation, characterized by cramping lower abdominal pain that occurs before or during menstruation, and is classified as either primary or secondary based on underlying etiology.
- **Pathophysiology**: Primary dysmenorrhea occurs in the absence of identifiable pelvic pathology and is associated with increased endometrial production of prostaglandins, particularly prostaglandin F2α, and leukotrienes, which induce intense uterine contractions, ischemia, and pain. In contrast, secondary dysmenorrhea results from structural or inflammatory pelvic disorders that contribute to pain through mechanisms such as nerve infiltration, chronic inflammation, or distortion of pelvic anatomy. Symptom severity in both forms often correlates with prostaglandin levels and other local inflammatory mediators.
- **Epidemiology**: Dysmenorrhea is highly prevalent and commonly undertreated, affecting 50–90% of adolescent girls and women of reproductive age. It is a leading cause of school and work absenteeism and significantly impacts QoL.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for primary dysmenorrhea include early menarche, long or heavy menstrual cycles, smoking, alcohol use, high stress levels, nulliparity, premenstrual syndrome, a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, and a family history of dysmenorrhea. Increasing age and increasing parity are protective factors. Secondary dysmenorrhea is associated with identifiable pelvic pathology such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, ovarian cysts, Müllerian anomalies, pelvic adhesions, or pelvic inflammatory disease.
- **Disease course**: Symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea typically begin within a few years of menarche, presenting as cramping suprapubic pain that peaks during the first 1–2 days of menstruation and is often accompanied by nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, dizziness, and headache. Severe cases may also cause sleep disturbances. Secondary dysmenorrhea tends to present later in reproductive life with progressive or atypical pain patterns and is generally less responsive to first-line therapies. Both forms can become chronic and significantly impact QoL, academic performance, and work productivity.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Primary dysmenorrhea often improves with age, childbirth, or hormonal therapy and generally responds well to NSAIDs or hormonal contraceptives. Secondary dysmenorrhea may persist or worsen without appropriate treatment, especially in conditions like endometriosis or adenomyosis. Unless adequately treated and followed, dysmenorrhea may progress to a chronic pain syndrome with significant long-term consequences.

### Menstruation: science and society [^50915ba0]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

I. Introduction

According to the World Health Organization, "health" is "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity". For women, menstrual health is an integral part of overall health because, between menarche and menopause, most women menstruate and menstruation can have a significant impact on the physical, mental, and social well-being. Normal menstruation is currently defined as cyclic bleeding that occurs from the uterine corpus between menarche and menopause. It can be described in terms of 4 simple domains: how frequently the woman has episodes of bleeding, the regularity or predictability of these episodes, the duration of bleeding episodes, and the volume or heaviness of bleeding. Not all women experience "normal" menstrual bleeding; up to 30% of women will experience alterations in the volume or pattern of menstrual blood flow, which is defined as the symptom of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), which in turn can be caused by multiple etiologies and sometimes more than 1 etiology at the same time. In addition, many women will have other symptoms such as pain, dysmenorrhea, anxiety, depression, and fatigue associated with their menstrual cycle that require attention for them to achieve early diagnosis of reproductive health issues such as endometriosis, premenstrual syndrome, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder and attain optimal health. In research and in clinical care, a better understanding of what the norms of menstrual health are and how a "lack" of menstrual health affects women's quality of life is needed. Furthermore, for positive health and well-being outcomes, everyone — men and women, as well as clinicians — need to understand menstrual cycles and menstrual health, which can be achieved through menstrual health literacy initiatives and improved health communication.

Menstrual health and menstrual health literacy are extremely broad topics with multiple stakeholders and diverse areas of active investigation and contributors. Adapted from the broader health literacy definition, menstrual health literacy refers to the level of capacity a person has to obtain, process, and understand basic information about menstruation so they can make appropriate health decisions. This section of the manuscript summarizes the presentations and discussion that took place related to menstrual health and menstrual health literacy at the 2018 "Menstruation: Science and Society" meeting hosted by the GHDB of the NICHD. We summarize only areas of menstrual health and literacy that were part of the presentations and active discussions at the NICHD GHDB meeting, which were largely focused on the bleeding aspect of menstrual health.

### Prolongation of the menstrual cycle after receipt of the primary series and booster doses of mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination [^20d2e220]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

The primary outcomes were within-individual changes in the menstrual cycle length of each postvaccination cycle compared with the prevaccination cycle. The secondary outcomes were within-individual changes in the menstrual cycle length stratified by variables to investigate the background characteristics predisposing patients to menstrual abnormalities.

The sociodemographic characteristics and medical histories of participants who received the first, second, and third doses are described. For each vaccine, we observed within-individual changes in menstrual cycle length by comparing the mean and SD using paired t tests and reported estimated changes in length with 95% CIs. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of having a longer postvaccination cycle (more than 38 days) than a prevaccination cycle based on the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics definition of infrequent menstruation. Third, regression analyses adjusted for age, BMI, parity, marital status, education level, household income, occupation, and smoking status were used to calculate the adjusted within-individual changes in menstrual cycle length and how these changes differed with participant characteristics. In the sensitivity analyses, participants who used emergency contraceptives after COVID-19 vaccination and those with a medical history of menstrual irregularity were excluded to eliminate the influence of these conditions on our findings. An additional analysis of participants without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed to eliminate any bias attributable to previous SARS-CoV-2 infections. Stata SE 14 was used for statistical analysis, and P < .05 was considered statistically significant.

### Almotriptan 12.5 mg in menstrually related migraine: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^8625bb8b]. Cephalalgia (2011). Low credibility.

Patients

Patients were almotriptan-naive women aged 18–50 years, from any ethnic group, who experienced MRM, as defined according to the criteria of the International Headache Society. Patients were required to have regular menstrual cycles, with at least a one-year history of migraine and a six-month history of regularly occurring MRM (migraine attacks without aura, occurring on days −2 to +3 of menstruation in at least two of three menstrual cycles, with or without additional attacks at other times of the cycle). Participants were required to be in good general health, and women of childbearing potential were required to use an adequate form of contraception. Key exclusion criteria included: any other type of headache that would confound diagnosis of MRM; migraine headaches that did not typically have a mild pain phase, that were typically associated with vomiting, or hemiplegic or basilar migraines; chronic daily headache (≥ 15 headache days per month for the previous six months) or ≥ 6 migraines per month for the previous three months; use of more than one medication (for any reason) known to be effective in migraine prophylaxis; use of sustained-release opioids, or semisynthetic or long-acting opioids, within seven days before study entry; use of systemic or injectable corticosteroids within 30 days before study entry; previous overuse (> 2 days per week) of analgesics, benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics, antiemetics, triptans, opioids or ergotamine-type medications; significant unstable medical disease or a history of a significant mental disorder; or a current or recent history, or suspected history, of substance dependence or abuse. Lactating women were also excluded from the study.

At baseline, patients were also required to provide a verifiable diary of their migraine history covering at least their preceding two menstrual cycles, their medical history in general and their latest medication history.

### Early life menstrual characteristics and pregnancy experiences among women with and without major depression: the harvard study of moods and cycles [^efab5578]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Other than premenstrual dysphoria, few studies have examined the extent to which basic characteristics of the menstrual cycle and the occurrence of other reproductive landmarks impact on the risk of major depression.

Methods

From a population-based sample of 4161 premenopausal women 36–45 years of age, we identified 332 women who met DSM criteria for past or current major depression and a sample of 644 women with no such history. In person interviews included a detailed assessment of menstrual cycle characteristics from age at menarche through study enrollment as well as other reproductive landmarks.

Results

Risk of depression increased significantly with decreasing age at menarche (P < 0.001). The risk of depression was also higher in women with heavier menstrual flow and cycle irregularity during the first 5 years of menstruation. Women with a history of multiple abortions were 2-3-times more likely to develop major depression (95% CI 1.6–4.1). Increasing months of breastfeeding was associated with a decreased risk of depression after adjustment for education, marital status, and number of livebirths (P-value, test of trend = 0.012). This association was largely confined to depression during the postpartum period.

Limitations

Menstrual and pregnancy history exposures were self-reported and retrospectively assessed. However, women with and without a HISTORY of depression were subject to similar recall requirements that likely resulted in an underestimate of most risk estimates.

Conclusions

Clinicians involved in routine obstetrical and gynecological care of women need to recognize that menstrual and pregnancy history events may serve as potential markers for subsequent psychiatric sequelae.

### Menstrual history-taking at annual well visits for adolescent Girls [^9b1ba001]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To determine the rates at which primary care providers elicit menstrual histories from adolescent girls at well visits.

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

The departments of Pediatrics, Adolescent Medicine, and Family Medicine of Cooper University Healthcare from January 1, 2010 to June 1, 2016.

Participants

Women aged 12–21 years who were seen for a well visit in the described setting.

Interventions

None.

Main Outcome Measures

We searched physician well visit notes for documentation of the following aspects of menstrual history: menarche, last menstrual period, usual length of cycle, and the presence or absence of associated symptoms (such as pain and cramps). The presence or absence of each aspect was recorded in a binary fashion in a deidentified data set.

Results

A total of 954 unique charts were analyzed: 415 from Adolescent Medicine, 289 from Family Medicine, and 250 from General Pediatrics at Cooper University Healthcare. Adolescent Medicine was 6.44 times more likely to take a complete menstrual history than Family Medicine (P < .0001) and 5.80 times more likely than Pediatrics (P < .0001). There was no statistical difference between Pediatrics and Family Medicine (odds ratio, 0.55; P = 0.3150).

Conclusion

Menstrual history-taking is often incomplete and can vary between departments, even within the same institution. These results indicate opportunities to raise awareness about the importance of a complete menstrual history and to develop quality improvement initiatives to increase documentation of the complete menstrual history.

### Challenges in diagnosis and understanding of natural history of polycystic ovary syndrome [^79fc8b4f]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

3.1 Ovulatory dysfunction

Women with PCOS commonly present with irregular menstrual cycles and anovulation, although neither of the criteria are mandatory for the diagnosis of PCOS according to the Rotterdam consensus. As follicle development is slowed down by low action of follicle‐stimulating hormone partly due to high anti‐Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels, menstrual cycles tend to be longer in women with PCOS, thus resulting in oligomenorrhea. In cases with a more severe PCOS phenotype, women may also experience amenorrhoea. Indeed, a previous study showed that women with anovulation present more often with amenorrhoea (23.6%) compared to women with oligoovulation (10.3%). The cycle length on average is 60 days for women with anovulation and 43 days for women with oligoovulation. The women with anovulation and amenorrhoea also have higher androgen levels and waist circumference. In line with this, another study reported cycle length reflects the severity of the syndrome, with the women with amenorrhoea representing a more severe phenotype. Even though longer cycle length seems to predict anovulation, normal cycles may also present with anovulation. Interestingly, a study with over 3700 spontaneously menstruating women, aged 20–49.9 years and regular cycles, showed that as high as 26%–37% of cycles were anovulatory when validated against serum progesterone < 3 ng/ml during the luteal phase. In clinical practice, measuring luteinizing hormone surge that occurs one to one and a half days before expected ovulation (ovulation occurring 14 days before expected menses) or luteal phase serum progesterone (≥ 3 ng/ml 7 days prior expected menses and ± 3 days) can assist in cases where ovulation is uncertain despite normal cycle length. Moreover, a previously published clinical review suggests cycle length > 35 days being indicative for chronic anovulation, whereas in cases of cycle length that is slightly longer than normal (32–35 days) or slightly irregular (32 to 35–36 days), assessment for OD should be evaluated if only one other signs of the syndrome is present. It has to be noted though, that when establishing the diagnosis, ovulation assessments are quite rarely needed as usually other characteristics (PCOM and HA) are present (Phenotype C). There are also some challenges in diagnosing anovulation and irregular menses especially in adolescents and young women as OD may persist long after menarche. The international guideline, therefore, calls for caution in diagnosing PCOS in young women less than 8 years from menarche. It has to be noted also that affected women gain regular cycles with ageing. Whether this results in more frequent ovulation or increased likelihood of spontaneous pregnancies is unclear and needs to be determined in future studies. The international PCOS EBG supports retrospective diagnosis if the woman has a history of irregular cycles in the presence of other diagnostic PCOS features (e.g. clinical/biochemical HA, PCOM). Considering this, regular cycles in an older woman may not prevent establishing the diagnosis.

### Elagolix (Orilissa) [^1db0f0fd]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Bone Loss

ORILISSA causes a dose-dependent decrease in bone mineral density (BMD). BMD loss is greater with increasing duration of use and may not be completely reversible after stopping treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The impact of these BMD decreases on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown.

ORILISSA is contraindicated in women with known osteoporosis [see Contraindications (4)]. Consider assessment of BMD in patients with a history of a low-trauma fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Limit the duration of use to reduce the extent of bone loss [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial for all patients.

5.2 Change in Menstrual Bleeding Pattern and Reduced Ability to Recognize Pregnancy

Women who take ORILISSA may experience a reduction in the amount, intensity or duration of menstrual bleeding, which may reduce the ability to recognize the occurrence of a pregnancy in a timely manner [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Perform pregnancy testing if pregnancy is suspected, and discontinue ORILISSA if pregnancy is confirmed.

5.3 Suicidal Ideation, Suicidal Behavior, and Exacerbation of Mood Disorders

Suicidal ideation and behavior, including one completed suicide, occurred in subjects treated with ORILISSA in the endometriosis clinical trials. ORILISSA subjects had a higher incidence of depression and mood changes compared to placebo, and ORILISSA subjects with a history of suicidality or depression had a higher incidence of depression compared to subjects without such a history [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Promptly evaluate patients with depressive symptoms to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with new or worsening depression, anxiety or other mood changes should be referred to a mental health professional, as appropriate. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention for suicidal ideation and behavior. Reevaluate the benefits and risks of continuing ORILISSA if such events occur.

### Menstrual blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells: women's attitudes, willingness, and barriers to donation of menstrual blood [^0e7df4cb]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: Menstrual blood contains mesenchymal stem cells (MenSC), considered a potential "off-the-shelf" treatment for a range of diseases and medical conditions. Samples of menstrual blood can be collected painlessly, inexpensively, and as frequently as every month for cell therapy. While there has been considerable previous research into the clinical advantages of MenSC, there is currently little understanding of potential donors' attitudes regarding menstrual blood donation and MenSC. Methods: One hundred women 18 years of age or over were surveyed to understand attitudes and potential barriers to menstrual blood donation. The questionnaire assessed participant age and brief medical history (giving birth, donating blood, donating stem cells), menstrual experience (period rating, preferred menstrual hygiene products), and whether participants would donate MenSC or accept MenSC therapy. Results: MenSC was met with a generally positive response, with 78% of menstruating women willing to donate menstrual blood. No significant relationship was recognized between willingness to donate menstrual blood with age, history of childbirth or blood donation, menstruation perception, and preferred menstrual hygiene product. Women rated their period experience better after being made aware of the ability to donate menstrual blood, meaning MenSC therapy can be beneficial for donors as well as patients. Conclusions: Considering women's attitudes to MenSC and donation of menstrual blood, the future of MenSC therapy is positive; women are generally willing to donate menstrual blood, independent of age, perception of periods, and history of childbirth and blood donation.

### Menstruation: science and society [^49b95893]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Earlier than 2004–2005

Before 2005, multiple efforts were underway exploring or addressing menstruation within global health. The population of interest included adult women of reproductive age, and in high-income countries, an interest in the declining age of menarche among girls. Interventions addressing adult women's menstruation-related needs were primarily within the clinical realm, such as a focus on reproductive health and disorders, and the promotion of family planning. Although the latter did not address menstruation as a life course issue, there was attention to the challenges of unscheduled, breakthrough bleeding among other contributors to contraceptive discontinuation. There also existed a rich literature on menstruation within the social sciences, primarily derived from anthropologists documenting menstrual traditions and rituals, and its relationship to girls' and women's roles within society. In the 1980s and 1990s, in high-income countries in particular, researchers explored girls' maturation experiences, examining the psychological effects of menarche, and the associations of early menarche with girls' engagement in risky behaviors, such as increased vulnerability to early sexual initiation, depression, and substance use. Overall, the focus in high-income countries remained on the individual and the clinical aspects of menstruation.

In contrast, in low- and middle-income countries, there began to emerge a public health lens on menstruation. Alongside the family planning agenda, there were burgeoning efforts within the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) field to address menstruation as a challenge faced by girls in school. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) hosted a roundtable event in Oxford aimed at bringing attention to "menstrual hygiene management" (MHM), a newly coined concept focused on addressing menstrual management within WASH, and the Rockefeller Foundation supported a series of case studies on sexual maturation in schools in Africa. In humanitarian contexts, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recognized the provision of sanitary pads to refugees as part of one of its core mandates, providing important recognition of menstruation as a key response aspect.

Table 1
Baseline Characteristics of Women According to Menstrual Cycle Regularity and Length

During 678 625 person‐years of follow‐up, a total of 1623 CVD events were observed, including 827 incident CHD events, 199 myocardial infarctions, 271 strokes, 174 heart failure events, and 393 atrial fibrillations. The cumulative incidence of CVD was higher among women with irregular menstrual cycles than those with regular menstrual cycles (adjusted HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.07–1.31]) (Table 2). Similarly, women with menstrual cycle length ≤ 21 days or ≥ 35 days had higher risk of CVD than those with cycle length between 28 and 34 days (HR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.11–1.50]; and HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.98–1.56], respectively) (Table 3). These associations remained statistically significant after further adjustment for education level, race and ethnicity, history of hypertension and diabetes, baseline total cholesterol, triglycerides, and baseline SHBG levels, age at menarche, parity, family history of CVD and stroke, history of oral contraceptive use, history of HRT, history of depression and severe stress, BMI, smoking status, drinking status, and physical activity among women with short cycle length (HR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.11–1.50]). Furthermore, subgroup analyses in participants with follow‐up menstrual cycle characteristics showed that women who maintained menstrual cycle irregularity during follow‐up were significant associated with increased risk of CVD (adjusted HR, 2.32 [95% CI, 1.16–4.61]) (Figure S1). However, no significant associations of change in menstrual cycle regularity with CHD and atrial fibrillation were observed (Table S2).

### Menstrual cycle differences between women with type 1 diabetes and women without diabetes [^a1b47244]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate menstrual cycle histories among women with type 1 diabetes, their sisters, and unrelated control subjects without diabetes across all reproductive ages.

Research Design and Methods

Menstrual and reproductive histories were obtained by questionnaire from 143 women with type 1 diabetes, 186 sisters without diabetes, and 158 unrelated control subjects without diabetes participating in the Familial Autoimmune and Diabetes study.

Results

Women with type 1 diabetes had more menstrual problems (long cycles, long menstruation, and heavy menstruation) before age 30 years than sisters and control subjects. These differences were all statistically significant, except for heavy menstruation at age < 20 years. No differences were observed after age 30 years. Women with type 1 diabetes experienced later menarche, earlier natural menopause, fewer pregnancies, and more stillbirths than women without diabetes. Multiple regression analyses revealed that type 1 diabetes caused an approximate twofold increased risk of any menstrual problem before age 30 years. These were primarily related to long cycles and long menstruation in women aged < 20 and 20–29 years, as well as with heavy menstruation from 20 to 29 years. Oral contraceptives were protective for any menstrual problem and heavy menstruation from 30 to 39 years of age. With history of pregnancy from 20 to 40 years of age, any menstrual problem and long menstruation were more likely.

Conclusions

The results suggest that type 1 diabetes is an independent risk factor for menstrual disturbances in young adults. Future studies may determine whether addressing menstrual disturbances improves quality of life and health for these women.

### Menstruation: science and society [^5df01c8e]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Several current forces support using menstrual effluent for diagnostics. Women are more comfortable with various forms of hygiene products, including menstrual cups, which are becoming more mainstream for managing menstruation, potentially allowing for more reproducible collections. At the same time, women are gravitating toward consumer health and digital recruitment platforms, creating new opportunities for research and diagnostic development. Greater awareness of menstrual disorders and gynecologic diseases is promoted by widespread reporting of personal suffering by celebrities, along with an explosion of social media platforms engaging patients, thus priming women and adolescents to seek answers for debilitating gynecology problems. Finally, the growing awareness of the shortcomings of blood-based biomarkers in the diagnosis of complex, chronic diseases is driving increased interest in proximal tissue–based approaches.

Endometriosis affects 6% to 10% of reproductive-age women and is estimated to cost more than $20 billion per year in the United States. Endometriosis offers a particularly compelling case for development of minimally invasive menstrual effluent–based diagnostics. Endometriosis is characterized by lesions of endometrial-like glands and stromal cells growing outside of the uterus, which are often associated with debilitating pain and infertility. Although several theories for its etiology involve developmental origins, Sampson's theory of reflux menstruation into the peritoneal cavity remains a plausible explanation in light of the clinical presentation observed in most cases of endometriosis.

Numerous factors likely contribute to a diagnostic delay for endometriosis of up to 7 to 10 years. Some women and adolescents experience vague symptoms that overlap with other conditions, whereas other women and adolescents have few or no symptoms and are not diagnosed until they present with infertility. In addition, women often experience minimization or dismissal of pain symptoms, more frequent misdiagnoses related to pain, and gender-related disparities in the treatment of pain when compared with men. Although standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound imaging can suggest the presence of endometriomas and a limited number of lesions in other locations, most patients display no detectable lesions on imaging, thus motivating more invasive investigation of symptoms The definitive diagnosis of endometriosis requires invasive surgery, a procedure many women and adolescents delay, avoid, or cannot afford. None of the peripheral blood biomarkers proposed for diagnosing endometriosis exhibit the accuracy required for clinical use.

Remembering to take tablets according to schedule is stressed because of its importance in providing you the greatest degree of protection.

MISSED MENSTRUAL PERIODS FOR BOTH DOSAGE REGIMENS

At times there may be no menstrual period after a cycle of pills. Therefore, if you miss one menstrual period but have taken the pills exactly as you were supposed to, continue as usual into the next cycle. If you have not taken the pills correctly and miss a menstrual period, you may be pregnant and should stop taking oral contraceptives until your doctor or healthcare provider determines whether or not you are pregnant. Until you can get to your doctor or healthcare provider, use another form of contraception. If two consecutive menstrual periods are missed, you should stop taking pills until it is determined whether or not you are pregnant. Although there does not appear to be any increase in birth defects in newborn babies if you become pregnant while using oral contraceptives, you should discuss the situation with your doctor or healthcare provider.

Periodic Examination

Your doctor or healthcare provider will take a complete medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives. At that time and about once a year thereafter, he or she will generally examine your blood pressure, breasts, abdomen, and pelvic organs (including a Papanicolaou smear, i.e., test for cancer).

### Female reproductive health after childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers: guidelines for the assessment and management of female reproductive complications [^2c05ae54]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Medium credibility.

Assessment — COG-LTFU screening and evaluation: The COG-LTFU Guidelines recommend regular screening of patients at risk of hypogonadism to identify gonadotropin deficiency, delayed or arrested puberty, AOF, or POF. In prepubertal survivors, onset and tempo of puberty, menstrual history, and Tanner stage are evaluated annually until sexual maturity, and baseline LH, FSH, and estradiol levels should be assessed at age 13 years. In sexually mature patients, evaluation should include menstrual and pregnancy history and history of sexual difficulties or changes, and those with delayed puberty, irregular menses, primary or secondary amenorrhea, and/or clinical signs and symptoms of estrogen deficiency should have LH, FSH, and estradiol levels screened. Bone mineral density tests should be considered for hypogonadal patients, and referral to an endocrinologist or gynecologist is warranted by signs and symptoms of ovarian dysfunction and/or abnormal hormone levels; it is vital to counsel women who received gonadotoxic therapy regarding their risk of POF.

### The association between menstrual cycle characteristics and cardiometabolic outcomes in later life: a retrospective matched cohort study of 704, 743 women from the UK [^5001219d]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

In this nationwide cohort study of more than 700 thousand women from the UK, history of both irregular menstrual cycles and frequent or infrequent menstrual cycles were associated with an increased risk of several cardiometabolic outcomes. The associations were strongest for women with abnormal patterns in the frequency of their menstrual cycles with frequent or infrequent cycles being associated with a significant increase in hazard of composite CVD. History of menstrual cycle irregularity was associated with a borderline increase in the hazard of composite CVD. On examination by subtypes of CVD, menstrual cycle irregularity was associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease and heart failure but not cerebrovascular disease. Frequent or infrequent cycles were associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease but not ischemic heart disease or heart failure. On examination by subtype of menstrual cycle frequency, frequent menstrual cycles were associated with an elevated risk of composite CVD and cerebrovascular disease but not ischemic heart disease or heart failure. No association was observed between infrequent menstrual cycles and composite CVD or any of the CVD subtypes. Both irregular menstrual cycles and frequent or infrequent cycles were linked with an increased risk of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) bleeding irregularities — counseling and management include that during contraceptive counseling and before placement of the Cu-IUD, information about common side effects such as spotting or light bleeding or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed; if the patient desires Cu-IUD removal at any time, remove the Cu-IUD, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired; and if the patient wants treatment, the following treatment option may be considered during days of bleeding, depending on the patient's preferences, treatment goals, and medical history: NSAIDs for short-term treatment, 5–7 days. Evidence summarized on-page states that a systematic review identified 11 studies, that all but one NSAID study demonstrated statistically significant or notable reductions in mean total menstrual blood loss with NSAID use, and that one study among 19 Cu-IUD users with heavy bleeding suggested oral tranexamic acid can significantly reduce mean blood loss but a FDA warning states that tranexamic acid is contraindicated in women with active thromboembolic disease or with a history or intrinsic risk for thrombosis or thromboembolism; treatment with aspirin showed no statistically significant change in mean blood loss among women whose pretreatment menstrual blood loss was > 80 mL or 60–80 mL and a significant increase when pretreatment menstrual blood loss was < 60 mL; one study of intranasal desmopressin (300 μg/day) for the first 5 days of menses for three treatment cycles found a significant reduction in mean blood loss compared with baseline; and one small study did not observe improvements in spotting with three separate NSAIDs.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (jolessa) [^633b118b]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Be sure to discuss any medical condition you may have with your healthcare
provider. Your healthcare provider will take a medical and family history before
prescribing oral contraceptives and will examine you. The physical examination
may be delayed to another time if you request it and the healthcare provider
believes that it is appropriate to postpone it. You should be reexamined at
least once a year while taking oral contraceptives. The detailed patient
information leaflet gives you further information which you should read and
discuss with your healthcare provider.

What You Should Know About Your Menstrual Cycle When Taking
Jolessa

When you take Jolessa™, which has a 91-day treatment
cycle, you should expect to have 4 menstrual periods per year (bleeding when you
are taking the 7 white pills). However, you also should expect to have more
bleeding or spotting between your menstrual periods than if you were taking an
oral contraceptive with a 28-day treatment cycle. During the first Jolessa™treatment cycle, about 1 in 3 women may have 20 or more days
of unplanned bleeding or spotting (bleeding when you are taking pink pills).
This bleeding or spotting tends to decrease during later cycles. Do not stop
Jolessa™because of the bleeding. If the spotting
continues for more than 7 consecutive days or if the bleeding is heavy, call
your healthcare provider.

### Hormone therapy for postmenopausal women [^5af0e508]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on premenstrual syndrome:

- **Definition**: PMS is a collection of physical and emotional symptoms occurring in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and disappearing within a few days of menstruation. PMDD is a more severe form of PMS characterized by intense mood symptoms.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of PMS and PMDD is not fully understood, but hormonal changes that occur with the natural menstrual cycle, specifically the progesterone produced following ovulation, and serotonin deficits have been implicated. An aberrant response to these hormonal fluctuations is thought to underlie the symptoms of these conditions.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of PMS and premenopausal dysphoric disorder in women of reproductive age is estimated at 12.2% and 5.8%, respectively.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for developing PMS and PMDD include a history of mood disorders, genetic predisposition, and high stress levels. Intensive physical activity before the first menstruation and consumption of alcohol and coffee have also been identified as risk factors.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of PMS and PMDD is characterized by a cyclical pattern of symptoms that recur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Symptoms include mood swings, irritability, depression, anxiety, bloating, breast tenderness, and fatigue. Symptoms of PMDD can be debilitating and significantly impair daily life activities.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: PMS and PMDD are chronic conditions, but their symptoms can be managed with appropriate treatment.

### Documentation of sexual and menstrual histories for adolescent patients in the inpatient setting [^4d0adfcb]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

In this study, we aimed to determine the frequency of menstrual history and sexual history documentation in the inpatient setting.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective chart review was conducted for 307 female patients ages 11–18 years admitted from the emergency department at a single institution within a 7-month period. These charts were reviewed for documentation of menstrual and sexual history.

Interventions and Main Outcome Measures

Rates of menstrual and sexual history documentation were compared according to patient age, chief complaint, admitting specialty, and medical complexity.

Results

Sexual history documentation was noted in 158 (45.9%) of the 344 reviewed charts. Sexual history documentation rates were higher for patients with mental health symptoms (62.9%; 61 of 98 charts; P = 0.02) and lower for patients admitted to surgical services (30.6%; 19 of 62 charts; P = 0.04). At least 1 aspect of menses was documented in 113 (32.8%) of the 344 reviewed charts. Last menstrual period was the most commonly documented aspect of menstrual history, appearing in 100 (29.1%) of the 344 reviewed charts. Menarche (4.4%; 15/344), menses frequency (7.0%; 24/344), menses duration (2.6%; 9/344), flow quantity (4.9%; 17/344), and dysmenorrhea (4.4%; 15/344) were rarely documented, regardless of chief complaint or admitting service. Menstrual history documentation rates were significantly higher for patients requiring a gynecology consultation (73.3%; 11 of 15 charts; P < .01).

Conclusion

Menstrual and sexual history documentation rates for adolescent patients requiring inpatient admission were low, with fewer than half of patients having a documented menstrual or sexual history.

### Associations of menstrual cycle regularity and length with cardiovascular diseases: a prospective study from UK biobank [^1e77bf80]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Continuous variables are presented as mean ± SD or median/interquartile range (IQR), and categorial variables are presented as percentages. Baseline characteristics of study participants were compared according to menstrual cycle regularity and length using general linear models for continuous variables and χ² test for categorical variables. Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) models were used to estimate the HRs and 95% CIs for the associations of menstrual cycle regularity and length with the risk of incident CVD and other cardiovascular outcomes; we checked the proportional hazards assumption by the Kolmogorov‐type supremum test, and no violation of proportional hazards function assumptions was found (P values were all > 0.05). The multivariable model (model 1) was adjusted for age; model 2 was additionally adjusted for education level (university or college degree/others), race and ethnicity (White/others), history of hypertension (yes or no), history of diabetes (yes or no), baseline total cholesterol level, baseline triglyceride level, baseline SHBG level, age at menarche (≤ 10, 11, 12, 13, or ≥ 14 years), parity (0, 1, or ≥ 2), family history of CVD and stroke (yes or no), history of contraceptive use (yes or no), history of HRT (yes or no), and history of depression and severe stress (yes or no). Model 3 was further adjusted for BMI (< 25 or ≥ 25 kg/m²), smoking status (never, past, or current), drinking status (never, past, or current), and physical activity (low, moderate, or high).

### Current understanding of hypothalamic amenorrhoea [^479f8652]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Subjects with HA have normal/low circulating gonadotrophins and low oestradiol levels. This reproductive hormone profile may be within the normal range for the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and therefore needs to be interpreted by someone aware of the clinical history. The endometrial lining may be thin on transvaginal ultrasound scan, but may be normal. In a healthy premenopausal woman, the endometrial lining normally progressively thickens during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. It is thinnest during menstruation, with a peak thickness of up to 10 mm in the late follicular phase. In women with HA, this variability in endometrial thickness may not be observed and there is evidence to suggest that if the lining is < 1.5 mm, the patient is more likely to be hypo-oestrogenic.HA and PCOS are the two most common causes of secondary amenorrhoea, other than pregnancy. Some women with HA may have a coexistent history of symptoms associated with PCOS, such as oligomenorrhoea, hirsutism and acne. Up to 50% of women with a nonhyperandrogenic PCOS phenotype may have FHA. Transvaginal ultrasound scan may therefore reveal either normal ovarian appearance or morphologically polycystic ovaries.

In patients with amenorrhoea lasting for over 6 months, or in those who have additional risk factors for low BMD, such as severe nutritional deficiency or an eating disorder, a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan is advisable to indicate baseline BMD and to help guide and monitor treatment.

A prolonged hypogonadal state during a woman's reproductive years has potentially wide-ranging negative impacts on health. Amenorrhoea has obvious reproductive consequences by causing infertility, but the long-term effects of oestrogen deficiency extend beyond reproduction. A longitudinal study investigating the effects of amenorrhoea and amenorrhoea plus exercise on BMD of young women over 2 years found that low BMD occurs in young women with amenorrhoea and delayed menarche, regardless of exercise status, and compromises crucial bone mass accretion. Women with FHA experience more sexual function problems (caused by issues such as dyspareunia and low libido) and significantly higher depression and anxiety compared with women without menstrual dysfunction. Furthermore, women with FHA have potential increases in cardiovascular diseaseand exhibit impaired endothelial function, which may contribute to impaired vascular function.

### Irregular menses: an independent risk factor for gestational diabetes mellitus [^735fcb52]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Our purpose was to determine whether a history of irregular menses predicts gestational diabetes mellitus independently of traditional risk factors.

Study Design

We analyzed demographic characteristics, body mass index, and menstrual history of 85 pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus and compared them with 85 systematically selected control subjects who were matched for age, race, and delivery year. Subjects with pregestational diabetes mellitus, previous gestational diabetes mellitus, family history of diabetes mellitus, weight > 200 pounds, previous macrosomic infants, or previous stillbirth were excluded.

Results

Demographic characteristics between case and control groups were similar. Mean body mass index was higher among cases (26.5 kg/m(2)) versus control subjects (24.5 kg/m(2), P = 0.004). Irregular cycles were more prevalent in the cases (24% vs 7%, P = 0.006). With the use of body mass index as a stratification factor, menstrual irregularity maintained a strong association with gestational diabetes mellitus (P = 0.014).

Conclusion

A history of irregular menstrual cycles was a significant independent predictor of gestational diabetes mellitus. If selective screening is implemented for gestational diabetes mellitus, such history should be considered in the decision of whom to test.

### Associations of menstrual cycle regularity and length with cardiovascular diseases: a prospective study from UK biobank [^27b225f0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large‐scale prospective study with a median 11.8‐year follow‐up time, we found that irregular menstrual cycles were associated with increased risks of CVD independent of risk factors, including age, race and ethnicity, BMI, smoking status, drinking status, physical activity, history of oral contraceptive use, history of HRT, age at menarche, parity, baseline cholesterol levels, history of hypertension and diabetes, family history of CVD and stroke, and other confounding factors. Furthermore, long menstrual cycle length was associated with increased risks of atrial fibrillation but not myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke. Short menstrual cycle length was associated with a greater risk of CHD and myocardial infarction. In addition, we found the significant interaction on risk of CVD between irregular menstrual cycles and lower HDL‐C levels and smoking status. These findings have important public health implications for the prevention of CVD in women.

Several prospective studies assessed the associations between menstrual cycle regularity and risk of CVD and mortality. The NHS (Nurses' Health Study) reported that women who reported irregular cycles had an increased risk for CVD during 14 years of follow‐up compared with those with regular menstrual cycles. Another prospective study of 13 534 female participants found that women with irregular menstrual cycles had 20% higher risk of heart disease. In contrast, a cohort study of 15 005 pregnant women found no significant association between menstrual cycle regularity and CVD risk. To our knowledge, prospective high‐quality evidence on the relationships between menstrual cycle characteristics and CVD and subsequent CVD in women's reproductive life is scarce. A previous study reported that women who reported irregular cycles or menstrual cycle length of ≥ 32 days at the age of 29 to 46 years had an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. In this large prospective study using a nationally representative sample of women from UK Biobank, we found that irregular menstrual cycle was associated with higher risk of cardiovascular outcome. Our data indicated that women with cycle length ≤ 21 days or cycle length ≥ 35 days were significantly associated with increased risks of CVD events.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^ffc6b277]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — initial history, examination, and laboratory assessment: Physical examination should include measurement of blood pressure and a genitourinary examination; clinicians should perform a probative history and physical examination, obtain a menstrual and gynecological history, and note that a catheterized UA may be helpful to confirm MH; symptoms and signs of UTI such as fever and dysuria should be elicited; patients should be asked about flank pain and obstructive urinary symptoms; hypertension, history of kidney disease, dysmorphic red blood cells (RBCs), and proteinuria may indicate glomerular disease; the initial evaluation should also include measurement of serum creatinine and an estimate of glomerular filtration rate; and patients should be asked about recent perineal trauma or genitourinary instrumentation.

### Heavy menstrual bleeding in women on oral anticoagulants [^1b9c92f9]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a known complication of anticoagulant therapy, rates of HMB in users of the direct oral anticoagulants (OACs) apixaban and rivaroxaban are largely unknown.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of menstruating women prescribed rivaroxaban, apixaban and warfarin over a six-year period (2012–2018). The primary outcome was HMB requiring medical or surgical intervention. We used descriptive statistics and logistic regression to evaluate associations between OAC type, age, history of HMB, and the primary outcome.

Results

We identified 195 women of reproductive-age with a new therapeutic OAC prescription (62 on rivaroxaban, 54 on apixaban, 79 on warfarin). A minority (26/195, 13.3%) had a documented history of HMB, including 9 rivaroxaban users, 7 apixaban users and 10 warfarin users but most women (117/195, 60%) had no menstrual history documented. One third of subjects (64/195) required treatment for HMB within 6 months of starting OAC therapy. After controlling for a history of HMB, rivaroxaban users were 1.4 times more likely to require treatment as compared to users of other OACs.

Discussion

We found an association between rates of HMB necessitating medical or surgical intervention and rivaroxaban use. We also found that the majority of women did not have a documented menstrual history, suggesting that many providers do not inquire about menstrual bleeding when starting OAC therapy. Menstruating women, particularly those with a history of HMB, may be at increased risk for HMB necessitating medical treatment depending on the type of OAC used.

### Long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers [^6981414b]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Surgery — Oophorectomy (unilateral) (female) lists potential late effects of Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR) and infertility, with periodic evaluation including History (menstrual and pregnancy history; hormonal therapy) yearly and Physical (Tanner staging until sexually mature) yearly. Counseling highlights potential for shorter period of fertility in family planning, and those with DOR should consider discussing reproductive health options with a reproductive endocrinologist or fertility specialist, with review of previous fertility preservation counseling/interventions and need for contraception. Potential considerations for further testing and intervention include FSH and estradiol for patients with menstrual cycle dysfunction suggestive of premature ovarian insufficiency or those who desire information about potential for future fertility, AMH to assess for DOR, and reproductive endocrinology referral for antral follicle count, ovarian reserve evaluation, and consultation regarding assisted reproductive technologies in at‑risk patients. Additional information notes that AMH may be low in the presence of normal FSH and should be interpreted relative to age‑specific reference ranges, and that FSH is lowered and AMH may be lowered by concurrent hormonal contraceptive use; risk may be increased by combination with pelvic radiation, TBI, or alkylating agents and by smoking. System classification is stated as SYSTEM = Reproductive (Female) SCORE = 2A.

### Are oral contraceptive use and menstrual cycle phase related to anterior cruciate ligament injury risk in female recreational skiers? [^162ef67d]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Oral contraceptive use and menstrual cycle phase are suggested to influence the risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in female athletes. However, only few data are available for recreational sports. Therefore, female recreational skiers with a non-contact ACL injury and age-matched controls completed a self-reported questionnaire relating to menstrual history, oral contraceptive use and previous knee injuries. Menstrual history data were used to group subjects into either preovulatory or postovulatory phases of menstrual cycle. Our findings suggest that oral contraceptive use did not show any protective effect against ACL injuries nor did self-reported previous knee injuries show any association with ACL injury rate in recreational alpine skiing. Analysis of menstrual history data revealed that recreational skiers in the preovulatory phase were significantly more likely to sustain an ACL injury than were skiers in the postovulatory phase.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^db6fd019]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Fertility awareness–based (FAB) methods — after abortion (spontaneous or induced), the category is Caution for symptoms-based methods and Delay for calendar-based methods. After abortion, it is possible for ovarian function to produce detectable fertility signs, with likelihood increasing with time; calendar-based methods can be used following at least one postabortion menses, and persons who before the pregnancy typically had cycles of 26–32 days can then use the standard days method; methods appropriate for the postabortion period should be offered before that time.

### Are health promoting lifestyles associated with pain intensity and menstrual distress among Iranian adolescent girls? [^3a6d3609]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Measures

Data were collected using a Demographic and Menstrual Information Checklist, the Visual Analogue Scale, the Andresh Milsom Scale, the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire, and the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile.

Demographic and Menstrual Information Checklist (DMIC): The DMIC was used to collect information concerning demographic and fertility characteristics including age, menarche age, level of education, field of study, relationship status, characteristics of the menstrual cycle (length of menstrual period, length of bleeding period), history of analgesic use and its amount, drug addiction, height, weight, body mass index, history of dysmenorrhea or menstrual distress in mother and sister, history of secondary dysmenorrhea, and underlying diseases. The checklist was compiled based on the objectives of the study. Its validity was checked using qualitative content validity and the opinion of the academic members affiliated to Midwifery and Obstetric departments of Qazvin University of Medical Sciences.

Visual analogue scale (VAS): The VAS was used to assess the intensity of menstrual pain. The VAS comprises a 10 cm line that has zero at one end indicating "complete painlessness" and 10 at the other end indicating the "most severe pain imaginable". Due to its simplicity and ease of use, the VAS is frequently used in study of pain. The validity and reliability of this tool have been confirmed to evaluate the severity of dysmenorrhea pain.

Andresh Milsom Scale (AMS): The AMS was used to assess the severity of menstrual pain. In this scale, dysmenorrhea pain comprises four subgroups: no pain, mild pain without the need for painkillers, moderate pain that can be relieved by taking painkillers, and severe pain that does not go away with painkillers. The validity and reliability of this scale had been assessed and confirmed.

PREGNANCY DUE TO PILL FAILURE

Combined Oral Contraceptives

The incidence of pill failure resulting in pregnancy is approximately one percent (i.e., one pregnancy per 100 women per year) if taken every day as directed, but more typical failure rates are 5%. If failure does occur, the risk to the fetus is minimal.

PREGNANCY AFTER STOPPING THE PILL

There may be some delay in becoming pregnant after you stop using oral contraceptives, especially if you had irregular menstrual cycles before you used oral contraceptives. It may be advisable to postpone conception until you begin menstruating regularly once you have stopped taking the pill and desire pregnancy.

There does not appear to be any increase in birth defects in newborn babies when pregnancy occurs soon after stopping the pill.

OVERDOSAGE

Serious ill effects have not been reported following ingestion of large doses of oral contraceptives by young children. Overdosage may cause nausea and withdrawal bleeding in females. In case of overdosage, contact your healthcare professional or pharmacist.

OTHER INFORMATION

Your healthcare professional will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and the healthcare professional believes that it is a good medical practice to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year. Be sure to inform your healthcare professional if there is a family history of any of the conditions listed previously in this leaflet. Be sure to keep all appointments with your healthcare professional, because this is a time to determine if there are early signs of side effects of oral contraceptive use.

### Ultrasound and menstrual history in predicting endometrial hyperplasia in polycystic ovary syndrome [^e06557c3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the role of endometrial thickness on vaginal ultrasound assessment and menstrual history in predicting endometrial hyperplasia in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who presented with infertility due to anovulation.

Methods

This was a prospective study in a university referral-based fertility and endocrine clinic. Fifty-six women with PCOS presenting with infertility due to anovulation underwent both vaginal ultrasound assessments and endometrial biopsies. The main outcome measures were the predictive value of sonographic endometrial thickness (primary objective) and the menstrual history with other clinical characteristics (secondary objective) for proliferative endometrium and endometrial hyperplasia in logistic regression analysis. Their predictive value was further examined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.

Results

Thirty-six PCOS patients (64.3%) had proliferative endometrium and 20 (35.7%) had endometrial hyperplasia. Five of the latter (25%) had cytologic atypia. Endometrial thickness less than 7 mm or intermenstrual interval less than 3 months (corresponding to more than four menstrual periods yearly) was associated with proliferative endometrium only. The endometrial thickness correlated positively with endometrial hyperplasia (P = 0.018) and, together with the average intermenstrual interval, were significant predictors of endometrial hyperplasia (P < .001).

Conclusion

These findings point to the usefulness of obtaining a detailed menstrual history in women with PCOS by identifying those at increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and who require an endometrial biopsy. The endometrial thickness corroborates this clinical impression and is particularly useful when the menstrual history is uncertain. Endometrial hyperplasia in this population is effectively excluded when the endometrial thickness is less than 7 mm.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^a4396e01]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Fertility awareness–based (FAB) methods — postpartum nonbreastfeeding categories designate < 4 weeks as Delay for both methods and ≥ 4 weeks as Accept for symptoms-based and Delay for calendar-based. Nonbreastfeeding persons are not likely to have detectable fertility signs or hormonal changes before 4 weeks postpartum, and ovulation before first menses is common; therefore, a method appropriate for the postpartum period should be offered. At ≥ 4 weeks, ovarian function sufficient to produce detectable fertility signs is likely, and calendar-based methods can be used as soon as three postpartum menses have been completed; methods appropriate for the postpartum period should be offered before that time.

### Pitfalls and strategies for measuring menopausal stage in eating disorder studies of women in midlife [^e2dbdca0]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Another group of women was categorized as Unclear because of contraceptive use. Hormonal contraceptives often induce regular menses, and many IUDs cause menses to stop; consequently, the use of these medications/devices can complicate assessing natural changes in menstrual cycles. While we expected a larger proportion of premenopausal women using these medications/devices, nearly 20% of women self‐identifying as perimenopausal also used these medications/devices. Anecdotally, women in our current data collections are reporting that doctors are prescribing hormonal contraceptives to help with vasomotor and menopausal symptoms rather than MHT. Importantly, in the current study, none of the Unclear perimenopausal cases were taking MHT.

A history of surgeries or medical conditions/medications (e.g. PCOS, hysterectomy with removal of both ovaries) were the final reasons why women were categorized in the Unclear category. The presence of these conditions made staging very difficult due to the loss of menses that commonly occurs and our inability to assess timelines of surgeries/medical conditions and changes in menstrual cycles. For example, in some cases, a natural menopausal transition seemed to precede the medical condition/treatment, but the lack of historical contextual information in the questionnaire (and inability to ask follow‐up questions) made this difficult to determine.

INFORMATION FOR THE PATIENT

See " Detailed Patient Labeling " for detailed information.
Counseling Issues

The following points should be discussed with prospective users before prescribing progestin-only oral contraceptives:

The necessity of taking pills at the same time every day, including throughout all bleeding episodes.
The need to use a backup method such as a condom and spermicide for the next 48 hours whenever a progestin-only oral contraceptive is taken 3 or more hours late.
The potential side effects of progestin-only oral contraceptives, particularly menstrual irregularities.
The need to inform the healthcare professional of prolonged episodes of bleeding, amenorrhea or severe abdominal pain.
The importance of using a barrier method in addition to progestin-only oral contraceptives if a woman is at risk of contracting or transmitting STDs/HIV.
