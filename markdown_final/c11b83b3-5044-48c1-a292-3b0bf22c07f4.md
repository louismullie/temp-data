## Question

does leukocyte esterase 2+ require treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a urine dipstick result of leukocyte esterase 2+ requires treatment and how to make that decision clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what leukocyte esterase 2+ actually signifies analytically and clinically. Then, I should distinguish asymptomatic bacteriuria from symptomatic urinary tract infection because that drives treatment. Next, I need to check guideline recommendations about when to treat and when to observe. After that, I will review the diagnostic accuracy and limitations of dipsticks, including scenarios where negative tests do not exclude UTI. Finally, I will outline clear indications and non-indications for treatment, highlight high-risk exceptions, and synthesize a practical decision framework that avoids overtreatment while protecting high-risk patients [^112gtP1T] [^114AHHdU].

> Let me first confirm what leukocyte esterase 2+ means conceptually: it is a semiquantitative signal of pyuria due to leukocyte enzymes in urine, so it suggests inflammation but not necessarily infection, and its performance varies with patient population and test conditions, which means I should not jump straight from "2+" to "treat" without context [^1173eXVD] [^1161SvQk] [^115jggxv] [^11146mKo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — treatment hinges on differentiating asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) from symptomatic UTI; ASB is common, often transient, and treating it generally does not improve outcomes in most groups, whereas symptomatic UTI requires compatible symptoms plus microbiologic support, so I need to ensure symptoms are present before considering antibiotics [^114AHHdU] [^115QNZYr].

> Wait, I should verify current guidance on when to initiate antibiotics; IDSA's cUTI recommendations emphasize moving to targeted therapy based on culture and susceptibility promptly rather than continuing empiric broad-spectrum therapy, and primary care guidance favors obtaining culture in selected scenarios to guide therapy rather than treating based on dipstick grade alone, especially in older adults; moreover, in febrile infants, if starting antibiotics, a urine culture should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and guide therapy, which underscores that LE 2+ is not by itself a treatment trigger [^112gtP1T] [^116RajvE] [^113ujYMg].

> I will now examine test performance to avoid misclassification; leukocyte esterase has reasonably high sensitivity but limited specificity for bacteriuria in older adults, leading to many false positives, whereas in young infants the overall dipstick (LE or nitrite) can be sensitive, yet even high sensitivity does not equate to clinical necessity to treat without symptoms, and importantly, symptomatic women with negative dipsticks still benefited from antibiotics, so a negative test does not rule out clinically meaningful infection either; taken together, LE 2+ cannot by itself establish a need for antibiotics, and absence of LE cannot reliably exclude UTI when classic symptoms are present [^115jggxv] [^115WLzwX] [^1173eXVD] [^1161SvQk] [^116MibYa].

> Let me consider when treatment is indicated despite uncertainty; I should confirm that antibiotics are warranted when compatible urinary symptoms are present (for example new dysuria, frequency/urgency, suprapubic tenderness, costovertebral angle pain, or fever) together with supportive testing, and in certain high-risk settings even without classic symptoms — pregnancy with bacteriuria merits treatment to prevent adverse outcomes, high-risk urologic procedures typically warrant peri-procedural prophylaxis, and in urosepsis or obstructed infected systems immediate antibiotics with appropriate cultures are required; these are exceptions where the threshold to treat is intentionally lower [^114AHHdU] [^113Kjw3p] [^111MLMWT] [^117933nm] [^111TCshy].

> But wait, I should also delineate when treatment is not indicated even with LE 2+; in asymptomatic nonpregnant adults, including many older nursing home residents and patients with catheters but no systemic signs, antibiotics for ASB provide no clinical benefit and drive harm, so best practice is to withhold antibiotics, avoid reflex cultures when inappropriate, and focus on clinical assessment while minimizing unnecessary antimicrobial exposure [^114AHHdU] [^115QNZYr] [^114ak9qa] [^111mDhRb].

> I need to check stewardship pitfalls because LE positivity often triggers unnecessary prescribing; observational and stewardship studies show that a positive LE strongly predicts overtreatment of ASB and that pharmacist or order-panel interventions can reduce inappropriate antibiotics and cultures without harming patients, which reinforces that we should treat the patient, not the dipstick [^114ak9qa] [^113ZWzWM] [^115sD6RY] [^112T8sDP].

> Hmm, wait a minute — could a clinician reasonably infer that "2+" means a higher bacterial burden that mandates empiric therapy; I should double-check that assumption and correct it: while higher LE grades correlate with pyuria intensity, LE is a screening marker with limited specificity and potential interferences, and guidance consistently prioritizes symptoms and culture-directed therapy over dipstick grade alone, meaning LE 2+ should prompt clinical correlation and, if indicated, urine culture, rather than automatic antibiotics [^11146mKo] [^1161SvQk] [^112gtP1T] [^116RajvE].

> Next, I should review practical steps; if the patient is symptomatic, obtain a urine culture prior to antibiotics when feasible, start empiric first-line therapy guided by local resistance patterns, and narrow or stop based on culture and clinical response; if asymptomatic and not pregnant or otherwise high risk, avoid antibiotics despite LE 2+, consider deferring culture, reassess for alternative diagnoses, and address modifiable factors such as catheter management; if procedural prophylaxis is planned or systemic infection suspected, follow guideline-driven prophylaxis or sepsis protocols with appropriate microbiologic sampling [^116RajvE] [^112gtP1T] [^114dEX5z] [^111MLMWT].

> Bottom line, after thinking this through and verifying against the evidence and guidelines, leukocyte esterase 2+ alone does not require treatment; clinical decision-making should hinge on the presence of compatible symptoms, patient risk status, and culture results, reserving antibiotics for symptomatic infection or defined high-risk exceptions such as pregnancy, specific urologic procedures, or systemic infection, and otherwise avoiding unnecessary antibiotics to prevent harm and resistance [^114AHHdU] [^112gtP1T] [^113Kjw3p] [^117933nm] [^114ak9qa].

---

Leukocyte esterase 2+ alone does not require treatment [^114AHHdU]. Management should be based on the presence of **clinical symptoms** and **urine culture results** [^116RajvE]. Treat only if the patient is **symptomatic** or if **asymptomatic bacteriuria** is present in pregnancy or before urologic procedures [^111MLMWT] [^113Kjw3p]. In asymptomatic, non-pregnant adults, do not treat based on leukocyte esterase alone to avoid unnecessary antibiotics and resistance [^115QNZYr] [^114ak9qa].

---

## Clinical significance of leukocyte esterase 2+

Leukocyte esterase is an enzyme produced by neutrophils [^1173eXVD]; a 2+ result indicates moderate pyuria and suggests inflammation or infection but is **not specific for UTI** and can result from contamination or noninfectious causes [^115jggxv].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy and limitations

Leukocyte esterase testing has moderate sensitivity and specificity [^1173eXVD], and false positives and negatives are common; results must be **interpreted in clinical context** and alongside culture [^115WLzwX].

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: Moderate accuracy; false positives/negatives occur [^11146mKo].
- **False positives**: Contamination, vaginal discharge, or non-infectious inflammation [^1161SvQk].
- **False negatives**: Dilute urine, early infection, or leukocyte lysis [^117Qwkiu].

---

## Clinical guidelines for management

Treatment should be **guided by symptoms, culture, and patient factors** [^116RajvE].

---

### Symptomatic patients

In symptomatic patients, **symptomatic UTI** should be treated empirically and confirmed with culture [^114AHHdU], whereas **complicated UTI** warrants culture and tailoring antibiotics to susceptibilities [^112gtP1T].

---

### Asymptomatic patients

- **Asymptomatic bacteriuria**: Do not treat in non-pregnant adults [^114ak9qa] [^115QNZYr].
- **Pregnancy**: Treat asymptomatic bacteriuria to prevent complications [^113Kjw3p].
- **Urologic procedures**: Treat asymptomatic bacteriuria before procedures with mucosal bleeding risk.

---

## Risks of unnecessary antibiotic treatment

Treatment based on leukocyte esterase alone **can cause harm**:

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Inappropriate use drives resistance [^114ak9qa] [^1147GDA7].
- **Adverse effects**: Unnecessary antibiotics cause side effects and C. difficile [^115QNZYr].
- **Increased costs**: Unnecessary treatment increases healthcare costs [^115sD6RY].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

A structured approach **improves accuracy and reduces overtreatment** [^115sD6RY]:

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Assess symptoms (dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, fever) [^116RajvE] |
| 2 | Perform urinalysis (leukocyte esterase, nitrite, WBC count) [^1173eXVD] |
| 3 | Obtain urine culture if symptomatic or if asymptomatic bacteriuria is suspected in pregnancy or before procedures |
| 4 | Interpret results with clinical context [^1161SvQk] |
| 5 | Treat only if symptomatic or if asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy or before procedures |

---

## Special considerations

Pregnancy warrants treatment of **asymptomatic bacteriuria** to prevent pyelonephritis and preterm birth. In elderly patients, asymptomatic bacteriuria is common and should not be treated unless symptoms are present [^115jggxv]. In immunocompromised individuals, consider a lower threshold for treatment given the higher risk of complications.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Leukocyte esterase 2+ alone **does not require treatment**; base decisions on **symptoms** and **culture** [^116RajvE]. Treat symptomatic UTIs, and treat asymptomatic bacteriuria only in pregnancy or before urologic procedures. Avoid unnecessary antibiotics to reduce resistance and adverse effects [^115QNZYr].

### Urinary tract infections in older women: A clinical review [^114AHHdU]. JAMA (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) in older women are commonly encountered in outpatient practice. The objective of this review is to discuss the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic UTIs, as well as the prevention of recurrent UTIs (reUTIs) in older community-dwelling women.

The evidence review involved a search of Ovid (Medline, PsycINFO, Embase) for English-language human studies conducted among adults aged 65 years and older, published in peer-reviewed journals from 1946 to November 20, 2013.

The results indicate that the clinical spectrum of UTIs ranges from asymptomatic bacteriuria to symptomatic and recurrent UTIs, and even to sepsis associated with UTIs requiring hospitalization. Recent evidence assists in differentiating asymptomatic bacteriuria from symptomatic UTI. Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older women is often transient, resolves without treatment, and is not linked with morbidity or mortality.

The diagnosis of symptomatic UTI is confirmed when a patient presents with clinical features and laboratory evidence of a urinary infection. In the absence of other causes, patients meeting any two of the following clinical diagnostic criteria are considered to have a symptomatic UTI: fever, worsened urinary urgency or frequency, acute dysuria, suprapubic tenderness, or costovertebral angle pain or tenderness. A positive urine culture (≥ 105 CFU/mL) with no more than two uropathogens and pyuria confirms the diagnosis of UTI.

Risk factors for symptomatic recurrent UTI include diabetes, functional disability, recent sexual intercourse, prior history of urogynecologic surgery, urinary retention, and urinary…

### Treatment for positive urine cultures in hospitalized adults: A survey of prevalence and risk factors in 3 medical centers [^114ak9qa]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

Antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is prevalent but often contrary to published guidelines. The objective of this retrospective observational study was to evaluate risk factors for the treatment of ASB.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted in a tertiary academic hospital, a county hospital, and a community hospital.
- **Patients**: Hospitalized adults with bacteriuria were included in the study.
- **Methods**: Patients without documented symptoms of urinary tract infection, according to Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) criteria, were classified as ASB. The study examined risk factors for ASB treatment, broad-spectrum antibiotic usage, and quantified diagnostic concordance between IDSA and National Healthcare Safety Network criteria.

- **Results**: Among 300 patients with bacteriuria, ASB was present in 71% by IDSA criteria. Similarly, 71% of patients had ASB by National Healthcare Safety Network criteria, with moderate diagnostic concordance within patients (kappa, 0.52). After excluding those given antibiotics for non-urinary indications, antibiotics were administered to 38% (62/164) with ASB. Factors significantly associated with ASB treatment included elevated urine white cell count (65 vs. 24 white blood cells per high-powered field, P < .01), hospital identity (hospital C vs. A, odds ratio, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.14–0.80], P = 0.01), presence of leukocyte esterase (5.48 [2.35–12.79], P < .01), presence of nitrites (2.45 [1.11–5.41], P = 0.03), and Escherichia coli on culture (2.4 [1.2–4.7], P = 0.01). Of the patients treated for ASB, broad-spectrum antibiotics were used in 84%.

In conclusion, ASB treatment was prevalent across the settings and contributed to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

### What is the optimal timing for reading the leukocyte esterase strip for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection [^1138eZVT]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Low credibility.

The leukocyte esterase (LE) strip test is frequently utilized to diagnose periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). According to the manufacturer's directions, the LE strip test result should be read 3 minutes after exposing it to joint fluid. However, this timing lacks support from robust research. Additionally, observed results suggest that the LE strip test results may change over time, and previous studies have demonstrated that centrifugation can degrade these results. Currently, there is no evidence-based recommendation for the optimal timing to read the LE strip test for maximum diagnostic accuracy, necessitating separate determination of the best reading times for the LE strip test before and after centrifugation.

- **Questions/purposes**:
	- What is the optimal timing for reading LE strip test results before centrifugation to diagnose PJI?
	- What is the optimal timing for reading LE strip test results after centrifugation to diagnose PJI?

- **Methods**: This study was a prospective diagnostic trial. In total, 120 patients scheduled for revision arthroplasty and showing signs of infection underwent joint aspiration in the outpatient operating room between July 2018 and July 2019. These patients were enrolled in a single-center study. To be included, patients had to have a diagnosis of PJI or non-PJI, provide valid synovial fluid samples, and not have received antibiotics within 2 weeks before arthrocentesis. Based on these criteria, 36 patients were excluded, resulting in 84 patients included for analysis. All 84 patients agreed to participate. The 2018 International Consensus criteria were utilized.

### No. 250-recurrent urinary tract infection [^114rAos1]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2017). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for recurrent urinary tract infections in women, specifically concerning antibiotic prophylaxis, the SOGC 2017 guidelines recommend offering continuous daily antibiotic prophylaxis. This includes using co-trimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a quinolone for a duration of 6–12 months in patients with a history of 2 UTIs in 6 months or 3 UTIs in 12 months.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of single-dose levofloxacin with single-dose fosfomycin pre-urodynamic study related to the incidence of urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^116UG6yp]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

A urine test that shows leukocyturia (more than five white blood cells per field of vision), a positive result for bacteria, nitrite, and/or leukocyte esterase, or any combination of these, is used to diagnose a urinary tract infection. Urine cultures were taken from individuals who had been diagnosed with UTIs after the results of the urinalysis were obtained and the clinical symptoms had been evaluated.

The study employed descriptive statistics to assess various subject characteristics, including age, gender, and indication for urodynamic testing. To evaluate the association between treatment groups and the occurrence of UTI, chi-square analysis was used. Data were processed using SPSS version 24, and p < 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.

### Urine dipstick for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection in febrile infants aged 2 to 6 months [^115WLzwX]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Urine dipsticks can be performed at the point of care, whereas urinalysis requires laboratory analysis. We compared the accuracy of urine dipstick with urinalysis for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile infants aged 2 to 6 months.

- **Methods**: We performed a cross-sectional study of previously healthy infants aged 2 to 6 months who presented to one of 5 emergency departments with a temperature greater than or equal to 38.0 °C and had a catheterized urine culture obtained. We defined a UTI with a urine culture growing greater than or equal to 50,000 colony-forming units (CFUs) per milliliter of a single bacterial uropathogen. Using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to select the optimal urine white blood cell (WBC) cut point, we compared positive urine dipstick (≥ 1+ leukocyte esterase or positive nitrite) to dichotomized urine WBC count for the diagnosis of UTI.

- **Results**: Of 9,387 febrile infants who had a urine culture performed, 1,044 (11%) had a UTI. Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen identified (923; 88.4%). The optimal urine WBC cut point was greater than or equal to 7 cells per high-power field (HPF). When compared with urine WBC count of greater than or equal to 7 cells per HPF, urine dipstick had a higher sensitivity (831/921 [90.2%] dipstick vs. 738/880 [83.9%] urine WBC; difference 6.4%, 95% CI 3.8%-8.9%) and specificity (6,352/6,862 [92.6%] dipstick vs. 3,679/4,231 [87.0%] urine WBC; difference 5.6%, 95% CI 4.7%-6.6%).

- **Conclusion**: Urine dipstick is an accurate diagnostic test for UTI in febrile infants aged 2 to 6 months.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^113noQG3]. MMWR. Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute epididymitis, particularly concerning urine tests, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining any of the following point-of-care tests in all patients with suspected acute epididymitis:

- **Gram, methylene blue, or gentian violet stain of urethral secretions**: Use to demonstrate ≥ 2 WBCs/oil immersion field. This is preferred for evaluating urethritis to document both urethral inflammation and the presence or absence of gonococcal infection. Establish gonococcal infection by documenting the presence of WBC-containing intracellular Gram-negative or purple diplococci on urethral Gram, methylene blue, or gentian violet stain, respectively.

- **Leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine**.

- **Microscopic examination of sediment from spun first-void urine**: Use to demonstrate ≥ 10 WBC/hpf.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline [^114nRxTD]. The Journal of Urology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for recurrent urinary tract infections in women, specifically concerning antibiotic prophylaxis, the AUA/CUA/SUFU 2019 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of antibiotic prophylaxis. This should be done after discussing the risks, benefits, and alternatives, to decrease the risk of future UTIs in patients of all ages who have previously been diagnosed with UTIs.

### Comparison of test characteristics of urine dipstick and urinalysis at various test cutoff points [^1173eXVD]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The study objective was to compare the test characteristics of urine dipstick and urinalysis at various test cutoff points in women presenting to emergency departments and an intermediate care center with symptoms of urinary tract infection.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, observational study of adult women who reported to one of two community hospital emergency departments (EDs) or an intermediate care center with symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, or urinary frequency, or with signs of suprapubic or costovertebral angle tenderness. Patients were excluded if they had taken antibiotics in the past 72 hours, had indwelling Foley catheters, symptomatic vaginal discharge, diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiency disorders, or were unable to provide a reliable history.

The patient's clean-catch or catheterized urine specimen was immediately tested by a nurse using a Multistix 9 SG reagent strip. Within one hour of collection, a second aliquot was sent to the hospital laboratory for semiautomated microscopic urinalysis and urine culture. A positive urine culture was defined as more than 100,000 colonies of one or two uropathogenic bacteria per mL of urine at 48 hours. Dipstick and urinalysis data were compared with urine culture results. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated at various definitions of a positive test, referred to as "test cutoff points", for combinations of leukocyte esterase, nitrite, and blood on dipstick, as well as for RBCs and WBCs on urinalyses. The probability of an erroneous decision to withhold treatment based on a negative test result was defined as "undertreatment".

### The alpha-defensin test for periprosthetic joint infection outperforms the leukocyte esterase test strip [^112Ljp3F]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). High credibility.

The leukocyte esterase reaction (LER) test was developed for, and cleared for regulatory approval for, urinalysis. Its performance and interpretation are based on the assumption that urine is being tested. The high viscosity and varied chemical properties of synovial fluid do not parallel those of urine. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the subjective interpretations made by trained personnel in larger academic studies would translate to all surgeons when using synovial fluid. Furthermore, because the LER test pad causes lysis of leukocytes, the test is not measuring secreted esterase activity. Instead, it measures total intracellular and extracellular activity, effectively serving as a proxy for the leukocyte count. If the LER test performs in synovial fluid as intended for urine, its diagnostic characteristics should be reasonably equivalent but not superior to those of a synovial fluid leukocyte count. It is important to note that the LER test carries a warning of potential interference from elevated protein, elevated glucose, and several antibiotics, which may be present in synovial fluid.

The α-defensin test used in this study is based on an immunoassay platform, a common technology currently used in medicine. The α-defensin immunoassay was developed and optimized specifically for use in synovial fluid, minimizing chemical and viscosity effects resulting from variations in synovial fluid. Finally, the α-defensin immunoassay only measures extracellular levels of α-defensin, potentially avoiding falsely elevated results from intracellular sources.

### Dropping the urine culture: Sustained CAUTI reduction using a UTI order panel [^115sD6RY]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). High credibility.

In the pre-panel period, urinalysis with reflex microscopy (microscopy performed if leukocyte esterase or nitrites were detected) and a separate UC order were available without restriction or clinical decision support (CDS). UC could be ordered without other urine studies, and no reflex UC were performed during this period.

In late 2014 and early 2015, a multifaceted CAUTI prevention effort was implemented, including required nursing competencies for catheter insertion and maintenance, required indication documentation at catheter insertion, in-depth review of all CAUTI with unit feedback, education on appropriate catheter use and timing of removal, and nurse-driven protocols for catheter maintenance and removal (see Supplemental Material for additional activities).

As part of this initiative, in April 2015, we removed the ability to order inpatient UC, replacing this order with a UTI order panel within our electronic health record. Changes were restricted to the inpatient setting (Emergency Department (ED) and outpatient excluded). An inpatient UC was available only via the UTI panel, and responses were not clinically validated. The panel included an order for urinalysis with reflex microscopy followed by possible UC if specified criteria were met. It required documentation of UTI symptoms and criteria justifying potential UC performance in the absence of symptoms or pyuria. Documentation of the presence of certain conditions resulted in a UC even if no symptoms or urine abnormalities were present (neutropenia, kidney/pancreas transplant, pregnancy).

### Evaluation of the nitrite and leukocyte esterase activity tests for the diagnosis of acute symptomatic urinary tract infection in men [^116C12Hu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

For 422 male patients with symptoms indicative of a urinary tract infection, nitrite and leukocyte esterase activity dipstick test results were compared with urine culture results. The positive predictive value of a positive nitrite test result was 96%. The addition of leukocyte esterase test results did not improve the diagnostic accuracy of the nitrite test.

### EAU guidelines on urolithiasis [^111TCshy]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for nephrolithiasis, specifically with respect to urgent decompression, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining urine for an antibiogram test following decompression. Initiate antibiotics immediately and provide intensive care if necessary. Reevaluate the antibiotic regimen following the antibiogram findings.

### Unnecessary antibiotics in older female patients with recurrent urinary tract infections [^116B6A4m]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Demographic, symptoms, and antibiotic data were extracted for up to three UTI episodes closest to the time of diagnosis of recurrent UTI. Demographic data included age at the time of diagnosis, race, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), primary insurance, caregiver involvement in telephone/electronic messages, and concurrent diagnoses.

Symptoms were classified as UTI-specific symptoms, specifically referable to UTI, such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, urinary odor, worsening incontinence, suprapubic/lower abdominal pain, hematuria, fever, and flank pain; or nonspecific symptoms often attributed to UTI in clinical practice, such as fatigue, mental changes, back pain not documented as flank pain, and other poorly characterized symptoms like "patient currently having symptoms".

Data on standard urine culture, performed using standard laboratory practices in the United States, were extracted. Positive urine culture was defined as > 100,000 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml for at least one organism. Negative cultures included growth up to 10,000 cfu/ml in the absence of the UTI-specific symptoms listed above.

An unnecessary antibiotic was defined as an antibiotic prescribed when any one of the following was present:

- **Asymptomatic bacteriuria**
- **Absence of UTI-specific symptoms**: irrespective of urine test results
- **Negative urine culture**
- **Negative pyuria**: defined as < 10 white blood cells per high power field on urine microscopy.

### The use of urinary dipstick tests to exclude urinary tract infection: a systematic review of the literature [^1161SvQk]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Several systematic reviews have examined the use of dipstick tests to diagnose or rule in urinary tract infection (UTI). We examined the evidence relating to the use of urine leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests in adults to exclude or rule out UTI. A search of the literature from 1966 to 2003 revealed 30 studies as containing relevant and suitable information, and 23 of these, which used a cut-off of 10⁸ colony-forming units per liter, were combined in a meta-analysis.

The leukocyte esterase or nitrite test combination, with one or the other test positive, was used in 14 studies and showed the highest sensitivity and the lowest negative likelihood ratio. While there was significant heterogeneity between the studies, 7 of 14 demonstrated significant decreases in pretest to posttest probability, with a pooled posttest probability of 5% for the negative result. In certain circumstances, there is evidence for the use of urinalysis as a rule-out test for UTI.

### Rapid diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis by use of reagent strips [^113cacCN]. Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

We studied the use of reagent strips for diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhotic patients with ascites. A reagent strip for leukocyte esterase designed for testing urine with a colorimetric 5-grade scale (0 to 4) was used to evaluate ascitic fluid in 228 nonselected paracentesis performed in 128 cirrhotic patients. We diagnosed 52 SBP and 5 secondary bacterial peritonitis by means of polymorphonuclear cell count and classical criteria.

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: When we considered a reagent strip result of 3 or 4 as positive, sensitivity was 89% (51 of 57), specificity was 99% (170 of 171), and positive predictive value was 98%. When we considered a result of 2 or more as positive, sensitivity was 96% (55 of 57), specificity was 89% (152 of 171), and negative predictive value was 99%.

In conclusion, the use of reagent strips is a rapid, easy-to-use, and inexpensive tool for diagnosis of ascitic fluid infection. A positive result should be an indication for empirical antibiotic therapy, and a negative result may be useful as a screening test to exclude SBP.

### 2016 European guideline on the management of non-gonococcal urethritis [^111EET79]. International Journal of STD & AIDS (2016). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for non-gonococcal urethritis, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, the IUSTI 2016 guidelines recommend confirming urethritis by demonstrating polymorphonuclear leukocytes from the anterior urethra. A Gram or methylene-blue stained urethral smear should contain an average of 5 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per high-power field (hpf) across 5 fields with the greatest concentration of these leukocytes.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: Randomised controlled trial [^115tJ7Au]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

The upper confidence intervals for the main outcome (frequency symptoms) suggest that alternative strategies are unlikely to result in poor symptom control (around 18% worsening for the midstream urine or delayed groups, and 2% in dipstick and symptom score groups). There was some evidence that if women waited more than 48 hours, they reconsulted less but had poorer control of symptoms, particularly for the midstream urine group. The finding of worse symptoms in such patients is in agreement with evidence of the effect of antibiotics from observational studies and trials.

Why the delayed group who waited a similar time did not have increased symptoms, however, is unclear. This might be a chance finding, but it might be because women in the midstream urine group find passively waiting for a laboratory result to be more distressing than being given the freedom to choose when to stop the delay according to their symptoms (the empirical delayed group). A previous study treated women negative for nitrite and leucocyte esterase with antibiotics and found symptomatic benefit. However, as about a third of women who have negative results for all important dipstick tests (that is, not only nitrite and leucocyte but also blood) still have urinary tract infections based on rigorous laboratory confirmation, the finding of a benefit in women with negative dipstick results might be expected. The poor negative predictive value of dipsticks suggests that the offer of some kind of antibiotic safety net — such as delayed prescribing — to women with negative dipstick results is reasonable.

### Cefaclor [^1147GDA7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Prescribing cefaclor in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to benefit the patient and increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria. Prolonged use of cefaclor may lead to the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, necessitating careful patient observation. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.

Positive direct Coombs' tests have been reported during treatment with cephalosporin antibiotics. It should be acknowledged that a positive Coombs' test may be due to the drug, such as in hematologic studies or transfusion cross-matching procedures when antiglobulin tests are performed on the minor side, or in Coombs' testing of newborns whose mothers have received cephalosporin antibiotics before parturition.

Cefaclor should be administered cautiously in patients with markedly impaired renal function. As the half-life of cefaclor in anuria is 2.3 to 2.8 hours, dosage adjustments for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment are usually not required. However, clinical experience with cefaclor under such conditions is limited; therefore, careful clinical observation and laboratory studies are advised.

As with other β-lactam antibiotics, the renal excretion of cefaclor is inhibited by probenecid. Antibiotics, including cephalosporins, should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.

### Routine tests and automated urinalysis in patients with suspected urinary tract infection at the ED [^11146mKo]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequently encountered in the emergency department. The diagnostics of UTIs, such as urine dipstick, Gram stain, and urine culture, lack proven accuracy and precision. The utility of automated urinalysis shows promise for UTI diagnosis but has not been validated.

- **Methods**: A total of 381 cases presenting with fever and/or clinically suspected UTI were analyzed based on clinical presentation, urine culture and/or blood culture, and successful treatment. The performance of standard diagnostics and automated urinalysis (Sysmex UF-1000i) was analyzed at various cutoff values, and diagnostic algorithms were tested.

- **Results**: One hundred forty-three (37.5%) cases were diagnosed with UTI. The sensitivity of urine dipstick nitrite was 32.9% and specificity was 93.7%. The sensitivity of urine dipstick leukocyte esterase (3+) was 80.4% and specificity was 82.8%. Receiver operating characteristic curves of automated bacterial and leukocyte count showed areas under the curve of 0.851 and 0.872, respectively. Cutoff values of 133 bacteria/μL and 48 leukocytes/μL resulted in > 90% sensitivity. Diagnostic values for complicated cases (e.g. antibiotics, catheters) were inferior to uncomplicated cases. Algorithms combining dipstick and automated counts did not improve accuracy, except for a 5.2% increase in uncomplicated cases (n = 247).

- **Conclusions**: Automated leukocyte and bacterial counts can be used in the emergency department setting with comparable accuracy to standard dipstick analysis, with minor improvement when combined.

### Accuracy of screening tests for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections in young children [^117Qwkiu]. Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy of available tests for pyuria, including newer automated tests, and to examine the implications of requiring them for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs).

- **Methods**: We included children between 1 and 36 months of age undergoing bladder catheterization for suspected UTIs who presented to 1 of 3 pediatric centers. Using a positive urine culture result as the reference standard, we compared the sensitivity of five modalities for assessing pyuria at the cutoffs most often used clinically for detecting children with a positive culture result: leukocyte esterase on a dipstick, white blood cell (WBC) count on manual microscopy with and without using a hemocytometer, automated WBC enumeration using flow cytometry, and automated WBC enumeration using digital imaging with particle recognition.

- **Results**: A total of 4188 children were included. Among febrile children, the sensitivity of the two most widely available modalities, the leukocyte esterase test and WBC enumeration using digital imaging, had sensitivity values of 84% (95% confidence interval, 0.80–0.87) and 75% (95% confidence interval, 0.66–0.83), respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that for febrile children under 36 months of age undergoing bladder catheterization for suspected UTI, pyuria will be absent in approximately 20% of children who are eventually shown to have pure growth of a pathogen on a culture. This raises questions about the appropriateness of requiring pyuria for the diagnosis of UTIs.

### Predictors of empiric antibiotic use in the emergency department in children without urinary tract infections [^111MwKuW]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common diagnosis within the pediatric emergency department (ED). Because of the necessary delay in obtaining urine culture results, clinicians must decide whether to prescribe antibiotics for a suspected UTI before urine culture results. The primary objective of this study was to identify the proportion of children given empiric antibiotics who subsequently did not meet the consensus definition of a UTI. The secondary objective was to identify factors associated with return visits to the ED after an index visit for UTI. We also attempted to identify predictors of prescription of empiric antibiotics for children who did not have a UTI.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective chart review of all patients between the ages of 2 months and 18 years diagnosed with a UTI between July 2016 and June 2017 in the ED of a single urban quaternary care center. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: use of bag for urine collection, subsequent admission to the hospital, receipt of antibiotics within the previous 3 days, use of antibiotics for an indication other than a UTI, and urine culture obtained at an outside facility.

- **Results**: Of 404 included patients, 389 (96.2%) were discharged on antibiotics, and 243 (62.4%) did not have a UTI. On the multivariate analysis, age ≥ 36 months was associated with increased odds of receiving antibiotics and not having a UTI, while both ≥ 1+ leukocyte esterase and ≥ 1+ nitrites on urinalysis were associated with decreased odds of receiving antibiotics and not meeting UTI criteria.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnancy in a rural population of Bangladesh: Population-based prevalence, risk factors, etiology, and antibiotic resistance [^113Kjw3p]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

In the results, the overall rate of urine culture contamination was observed to be 4.9% (208/4242). These specimens were excluded from the reported results, which focus on the first adequate, non-contaminated urine specimens (n = 4034).

- **Prevalence of UTI**: In the initial screening of urine samples from the general pregnancy population (n = 4034), 230 women (5.7%) had a high burden (> 100,000 CFU/mL) of bacteriuria. Among these, 47 (20.4%) reported clinical signs of UTI, whereas 183 (79.6%) exhibited no symptoms. Furthermore, 599 women (14.9%) at the initial screening had intermediate-level bacteriuria (> 1000 - < 100,000 CFU/mL), with 130 (21.7%) of them reporting UTI symptoms, which were treated with antibiotics.

- **Treatment and outcomes**: Overall, 360 women (8.9%) required treatment for UTI, with 308 (86%) starting antibiotics, and of those, 284 (92%) completed the full course. Among women with positive screening urine cultures, test of cure specimens were obtained from 276 out of 360 women. Of these, 56 women (20.3%) had a persistent UTI on the second urine culture, necessitating a second course of antibiotics, selected based on antimicrobial resistance.

### A lipidomics-based method to eliminate negative urine culture in general population [^114vEnoX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Many patients with uncomplicated UTIs present clinically as straightforward cases that may not require additional testing beyond urinalysis. Because of the time-consuming nature of urine culture, many clinical laboratories have instituted reflexive workflows, such as urine culture only after dipstick analysis has demonstrated positive findings. However, urine dipstick analysis for blood, nitrites, and leukocyte esterase can be prone to positive interferences, leading to unnecessary urine culture investigations. Hence, it is clinically and operationally beneficial to develop a rapid alternative urine screening test in a culture-free manner with minimal human intervention.

Currently, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) protein fingerprinting tests, such as the Bruker Biotyper, are standard microbial identification (ID) methods. These methods involve the use of MALDI-TOF MS to analyze the protein profiles of bacterial samples selected after culture. By comparing detected protein profiles to previously recorded protein profiles for various bacterial species in a library, bacteria can be identified. The protein-based methods mostly require microbial growth to produce a pure colony, which often requires at least 18–48 hours. However, a study by Kitagawa et al. investigated a modification to the standard method for bacterial identification that allowed direct analysis from urine. Their modified method involved the addition of ultrasonication and centrifugation prior to placing the sample on a MALDI plate.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^112nLmed]. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Below, we describe the findings for tests assessed in four or more studies, which include variations in blood cell counts and other biochemical markers, as follows:

- **Blood cell count changes**:
	- **White blood cell count**: increase and decrease
	- **Neutrophil count**: increase and decrease
	- **Monocyte count**: increase
	- **Lymphocyte count**: decrease
	- **Platelets**: decrease

- **Liver function markers**:
	- **Alanine aminotransferase**: increase
	- **Aspartate aminotransferase**: increase
	- **Albumin**: decrease
	- **Total bilirubin**: measured

- **Inflammatory markers**:
	- **CRP**: increase
	- **Procalcitonin**: increase
	- **IL‐6**: increase

- **Other biochemical markers**:
	- **Creatine kinase**: increase
	- **Serum creatinine**: measured
	- **Lactate dehydrogenase**: increase

See Table 4 for an overview of tests and cut-off values per study. Table 1 shows the summary of findings for the individual tests, including sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios (DORs). All HSROC curves were close to the non-informative diagonal, with DORs varying between 0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.78) and 4.53 (95% CI 1.89 to 10.88). As an indication, a test with a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 70% has a DOR of 5.0.

### Leucocyte esterase reagent strips for the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: A systematic review [^117BwhXU]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

The reported incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) ranges from 7% to 30% per annum in cirrhotic patients. Timely diagnosis and treatment are crucial to reduce mortality associated with this infection. Recently, leucocyte esterase reagent strips have been tested in the diagnosis of infection in the ascitic fluid. The objective was to evaluate the diagnostic value of leucocyte esterase reagent strips in SBP in cirrhotic patients with ascites by systematically reviewing the evidence from prospective clinical studies.

A comprehensive literature search was performed in Medline up to July 2007 for adult human prospective clinical studies. Two reviewers independently checked all identified studies for fulfillment of predefined inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality of included studies. It was decided a priori to pool the studies via meta-analysis only if statistical heterogeneity was found to be nonsignificant (P > 0.10). Seventeen studies were included, but statistical heterogeneity among studies was found to be highly significant (P < 0.001) in all analyses, precluding the pooling of data for meta-analysis.

Compared with the manual polymorphonuclear count ('gold standard'), leucocyte esterase reagent strips were found to have a sensitivity ranging from 45% to 100%, a specificity ranging from 81% to 100%, a positive predictive value ranging from 42% to 100%, and a negative predictive value ranging from 87% to 100%. Despite the wide variation in sensitivity and positive predictive value between studies, the consistently high negative predictive value of leucocyte esterase reagent strips suggests their potential utility in excluding SBP in cirrhotic patients.

### Urine culture guided antibiotic interventions: A pharmacist driven antimicrobial stewardship effort in the ED [^113ZWzWM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are frequently overprescribed for abnormal urine tests, including asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB), which contributes to rising antimicrobial resistance rates. Pharmacists conducted daily reviews of urine cultures from emergency department (ED) encounters to evaluate the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions. This study examined antibiotic prescribing practices, compliance with national guidelines, correlations with urine analysis components, and opportunities for antimicrobial stewardship in the ED.

- **Methods**: This quality improvement project (QIP) was a prospective cohort study at a community hospital ED, using data collected from finalized urine cultures between October 30, 2014, and January 5, 2015. Analyses were performed using Chi-squared and Fisher Exact tests, as well as stepwise multiple logistic regression.

- **Results**: Urine cultures from 457 encounters were reviewed, with 136 meeting the inclusion criteria of being non-pregnant and asymptomatic for urinary tract infection (UTI). Of these, 43% were treated with antibiotics, accounting for a total of 426 antibiotic days. Pharmacist interventions resulted in 122 out of 426 (29%) potential antibiotic days saved. Factors significantly increasing the likelihood of antibiotic prescribing in asymptomatic patients included the presence of leukocyte esterase (OR = 4.5, 95% CI: 1.2–17.2; p = 0.03), nitrites (OR = 10.8, 95% CI: 1.7–68.1; p = 0.01) in urine, and age ≥ 75 (OR = 3.5, 95% CI: 1.2–9.6, p = 0.02).

- **Discussion**: Pharmacist interventions in discontinuing or modifying antibiotics for asymptomatic patients with urine cultures effectively reduced unnecessary antibiotic use.

### The alpha-defensin test for periprosthetic joint infection outperforms the leukocyte esterase test strip [^113VLs8S]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a devastating complication that may occur after joint arthroplasty, with major health and economic consequences. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of PJI, which is critical to timely diagnosis and surgical decision-making, remains a confusing and difficult task. The Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) has recognized this shortcoming in diagnosis and has offered a definition for PJI that considers clinical findings, several laboratory tests, and tissue histology.

Recent efforts to identify simpler and more accurate tools for diagnosing PJI have focused on biomarkers in the synovial fluid. In diagnostics, the term "biomarker" generally refers to a biologically relevant molecule that can be objectively evaluated to indicate a disease or biologic state. Both cytokines and proteins with antimicrobial function have been observed to be elevated in the synovial fluid of patients with an infected joint arthroplasty. Many biomarkers have demonstrated diagnostic capabilities better than those of currently used tests. In a recent evaluation of 16 promising synovial fluid biomarkers for PJI, five antimicrobial protein biomarkers were demonstrated to match the MSIS definition of PJI in all 95 study patients.

The α-defensin test is an immunoassay that measures the concentration of the α-defensin peptide in human synovial fluid. α-Defensin is an antimicrobial peptide secreted into the synovial fluid by human cells in response to pathogenic presence. It then integrates into the pathogen's cell membrane.

### Leukocyte esterase strip test: matched for musculoskeletal infection society criteria [^114QXKZg]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2014). Low credibility.

The presence of leukocyte esterase in synovial fluid has recently been proposed as a marker for periprosthetic joint infection. However, the sensitivity and specificity of leukocyte esterase have not been determined when matched with the current, most inclusive Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria for periprosthetic joint infection.

- **Methods**: The presence of leukocyte esterase was prospectively evaluated in synovial joint aspirates from hips and knees from May 2009 to May 2013. The cohort consisted of 189 hip and knee aspirations, with fifty-two positive and 137 negative for infection. If the aspirate was bloody, a centrifuge was used to precipitate red blood cells and obtain clear synovial fluid. A standard chemical test strip (graded as negative, trace, +, or ++) was used to detect the presence of leukocyte esterase. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the leukocyte esterase strip test were calculated using ++ and ++/+ as two positive strip result scenarios.

- **Results**: Synovial fluid was obtained from 221 joints that underwent revision total hip or total knee arthroplasty for either mechanical failure or periprosthetic infection. Due to the lack of adequate criteria for MSIS classification, thirty-two joints were excluded. The leukocyte esterase test, with a threshold of +/++, demonstrated a sensitivity of 79.2% (95% confidence interval, 65.9% to 89.2%), specificity of 80.8% (95% CI, 73.3% to 87.1%), positive predictive value of 61.8% (95% CI, 49.2% to 73.3%), and a negative predictive value of 90.

The findings of tests assessed in four or more studies are described below. A total of 47 laboratory tests were included for meta-analyses, with 16 for mortality, 26 for deterioration, and five for the combined outcome. The following laboratory tests were assessed for different target conditions:

- **Increase in specific markers**:
	- Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
	- Bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase (CK), creatinine
	- C-reactive protein (CRP), d-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
	- Neutrophils absolute count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), procalcitonin
	- Prothrombin time (PT), troponin I, troponin, white blood cell count

- **Decrease in specific markers**:
	- Eosinophile count, haemoglobin, lymphocyte absolute count
	- Sodium, potassium

- **Both increase and decrease in**:
	- Platelet count, lymphocyte absolute count

An overview of tests and cut-off values is provided in Figures 4 and 5. Summary findings, including the number of studies, median prevalence, fixed specificity, and corresponding summary sensitivity, can be found in Table 1 (featuring, amongst others, hyperinflammatory markers) and Table 2 (including, amongst others, hypercoagulability markers).

### Correlation of leukocyte esterase detection by reagent strips and the presence of neutrophils: A study in BAL fluid [^112YxTcH]. Chest (2000). High credibility.

In the present study, we evaluated the leukocyte esterase (LE) area of a reagent strip designed for urinalysis for the semiquantitative measurement of the percentage of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in BAL fluid.

- **Design**: Prospective. The relative PMN counts (obtained by conventional microscopy and expressed as a percentage of a 500 cell count) of consecutive BAL fluid samples were compared with the corresponding LE categories as read with a urine chemistry reader. LE categories were graded as follows: negative, trace, +, ++, and +++.

- **Results**: A total of 153 BAL fluid samples were included. The mean PMN counts of the negative LE category (4.1 ± 4.3%; n = 43) and the +++ category (81.8 ± 16.3%; n = 37) differed significantly from each other and from the mean PMN counts of the other categories. Within the trace, +, and ++ categories, a considerable overlap of PMN counts was noted. Assignment of a BAL fluid to the negative LE category consistently predicted a PMN count < 50% with a sensitivity of 70.8% and a specificity of 97.1%.

- **Conclusions**: The reagent strips proved to be useful as a rapid test for semiquantitative measurement of the relative PMN counts in BAL fluid. However, the low predictive value for the exclusion of a high PMN count may limit their application.

### Accuracy of leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests for diagnosing bacteriuria in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115jggxv]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). High credibility.

Urine dipsticks are commonly used for the diagnosis of bacteriuria and/or urinary tract infections (UTIs).

- **Objectives**: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the accuracy of positive leukocyte esterase and/or nitrite results from dipsticks (index test) for diagnosing bacteriuria in older individuals, using urine culture as the reference standard.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception up to April 2025. The reference lists of all identified studies were also examined.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: Both prospective observational cohort and case-control diagnostic studies were included. No language restriction was applied.

- **Participants**: Individuals aged 60 or more, with or without symptoms of UTI in the community, nursing homes, or hospitalized settings.

- **Assessment of risk of bias**: We used the Quality Assessment tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool for assessing risk of bias.

- **Methods of data synthesis**: A random-effect meta-analysis was performed to determine the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of leukocyte esterase and/or nitrites for the detection of bacteriuria. PROSPERO identifier: CRD42024561882.

- **Results**: Of 1,933 articles screened, 16 met the inclusion criteria and had a moderate risk of bias. Ten studies were hospital-based; six were in nursing homes. Pooled urine dipstick sensitivity and specificity for bacteriuria were 90% (95% CI, 84–94%), and 56% (43–68%), respectively (diagnostic odds ratio [DOR] 11.4; 10.4–12.7).

### Leukocyte esterase reagent strips for the rapid diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection [^112UUjYG]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2012). High credibility.

A total of 223 consecutive total hip or total knee arthroplasties were evaluated for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) using leukocyte esterase reagent (LER) strips. Fifty-two LER strips were read as positive (23.3%), 106 were read as negative (47.5%), and 65 strips (29.2%) were unable to be read due to debris or blood in the aspiration. Using a synovial fluid white blood cell count of more than 3000 white blood cells per microliter as an indicator of PJI, the sensitivity and specificity were 92.9% and 88.8%, respectively. When using positive cultures for the diagnosis of PJI, sensitivity and specificity were 93.3% and 77.0%. For cases where a reoperation was performed and a combination of factors was used to define PJI, the sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 86.8%. Leukocyte esterase reagent strips represent a rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive tool for the diagnosis of PJI. Their utility is limited, however, by blood or debris in the synovial fluid, rendering them unreadable in one-third of cases.

### Risk factors and outcomes associated with treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in hospitalized patients [^115QNZYr]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) with antibiotics is a common factor in inappropriate antibiotic use. However, the risk factors and outcomes associated with the treatment of ASB in hospitalized patients are not well defined.

The objective of this study is to evaluate factors associated with the treatment of ASB among hospitalized patients and the possible association between treatment and clinical outcomes.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2016, through February 1, 2018, at 46 hospitals participating in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium. A total of 2733 hospitalized medical patients with ASB, defined as a positive urine culture without any documented signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection, were included in the analysis.

- **Exposures**: One or more antibiotic doses for the treatment of ASB.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Estimators of antibiotic treatment of ASB. Secondary outcomes included 30-day mortality, 30-day hospital readmission, 30-day emergency department visit, discharge to post-acute care settings, Clostridioides difficile infection (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) at 30 days, and duration of hospitalization after urine testing.

- **Results**: Of 2733 patients with ASB, 2138 were women (78.2%), and the median age was 77 years (interquartile range [IQR], 66–86 years). A total of 2259 patients (82.7%) were treated with antibiotics for a median of 7 days (IQR, 4–9 days). Factors associated with ASB treatment included older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.10 per 10-year increase; 95% CI, 1.02–1.18), dementia.

### Response to antibiotics of women with symptoms of urinary tract infection but negative dipstick urine test results: double blind randomised controlled trial [^116MibYa]. BMJ (2005). High credibility.

To assess the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in women with symptoms of urinary tract infection but negative urine dipstick testing, a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. The trial took place in primary care settings among a randomly selected group of general practitioners in Christchurch, New Zealand.

- **Participants**: 59 women aged 16–50 years presenting with a history of dysuria and frequency, all tested negative for both nitrites and leukocytes in a dipstick test of midstream urine. Participants with complicated urinary tract infection were excluded.

- **Intervention**: Participants received either trimethoprim 300 mg daily for three days or a placebo.

- **Main outcome measures**: A self-reported diary of symptoms was maintained for seven days to record the presence or absence of individual symptoms daily. This was followed by a structured telephone questionnaire after seven days. The main clinical outcome measured was the resolution of dysuria at three and seven days and the median time to resolution. Secondary outcomes included the resolution of other symptoms.

- **Results**: The median time for resolution of dysuria was three days for the trimethoprim group compared to five days for the placebo group (P = 0.002). At day 3, ongoing dysuria was observed in five (24%) patients in the treatment group compared to 20 (74%) in the placebo group (P = 0.005). This difference persisted until day 7, where two patients (10%) in the treatment group experienced ongoing dysuria compared to 11 (41%) in the placebo group (P = 0.02). The number needed to treat was 4. Additionally, the median duration of constitutional symptoms (feverishness, shivers) was reduced by four days in the treatment group.

### Reassessment of routine midstream culture in diagnosis of urinary tract infection [^115Ji3rC]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

In addition to observing the presence and absence of symptoms, we also calculated a symptom score to determine the magnitude of LUTS within each patient group. The number of symptoms was summed for each of the four categories to provide a score and compared across the groups using Mood's median test. The median symptom scores for UUI, SUI, voiding, and pain symptom categories differed across the three study groups. Post hoc analysis revealed higher median UUI, SUI, and voiding scores for new patients than relapsed patients. However, both patient cohorts had similar pain scores and total symptom scores (Table 1). Statistical comparison of the respective frequencies for each assessed LUTS between new and relapsed patient groups is provided within the supplemental material (Table S2).

- **Urinary microscopy and dipstick analysis**: We performed urinary leukocyte counts to determine whether patient urine manifested evidence of infection independent of the bacterial assessment. As shown in Table 2, there was a significant difference in the log₁₀ leukocyte counts among the three study groups (χ² = 6.2, df = 2, P < 0.05). Post hoc analysis using Bonferroni's correction identified significant differences between controls and new patients and between controls and relapsed patients. No significant difference in the log₁₀ leukocyte counts was identified between new patients and relapsed patients.

Table 2 provides descriptive measures of in-house (clinic) microscopic leukocyte counts and reported routine hospital MSU culture results for each study group.

### Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^113JE5o9]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of the novel biomarker, urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL), in diagnosing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in febrile infants and young children.

Methods involved a prospective cross-sectional study of febrile infants younger than 3 months (≥ 38.0°C) and children aged 3 to 24 months (≥ 39.0°C) who were evaluated for UTIs. uNGAL levels, urinalysis, Gram stain, and culture were obtained, with UTI defined by colony counts.

Results showed that of 260 patients, 35 (13.5%) had UTIs. Median uNGAL levels were 215.1 ng/mL (interquartile range: 100.3–917.8) in those with UTIs and 4.4 ng/mL (interquartile range: 1.6–11.8) in those without. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for uNGAL was 0.978 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.948–1.000). At a threshold uNGAL level of 39.1 ng/mL, sensitivity was 97.1% (95% CI: 83.4–99.9) and specificity was 95.6% (95% CI: 91.7–97.7). uNGAL demonstrated higher sensitivity than the combination of leukocyte esterase (trace or greater amounts) or nitrite (+) (97.1%, 95% CI: 83.4–99.9 vs. 74.3%, 95% CI: 56.4–86.9), with similar specificity (95.6%, 95% CI: 91.7–97.7 vs. 97.3%, 95% CI: 94.0–98.9). uNGAL had higher sensitivity than Gram stain (97.1%, 95% CI: 83.4–99.9 vs. 74.3%, 95% CI: 56.4–86.9), with similar specificity (95.6%, 95% CI: 91.7–97.7 vs. 100.0%, 95% CI: 97.9–100.0).

In conclusion, uNGAL has substantial accuracy in identifying UTIs in infants and young children. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine if uNGAL is a more cost-effective test than standard methods.

### Acute uncomplicated UTIs in adults: Rapid evidence review [^116RajvE]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cystitis, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a urine culture with susceptibility testing in females with recurrent UTIs, treatment failure with first-line antibiotics, history of resistant urinary isolates, atypical presentation, or if they are ≥ 65 years of age. Similar recommendations apply to males, aiming to guide the antibiotic choice effectively.

### Preliminary results of a new test for rapid diagnosis of septic arthritis with use of leukocyte esterase and glucose reagent strips [^111taekX]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2014). Low credibility.

Most currently used tools to diagnose septic arthritis are either not readily available or fail to provide real-time results. Reagent strip tests have identified infections in various body fluids. We hypothesized that combined leukocyte esterase and glucose strip tests can aid in diagnosing septic arthritis in native synovial fluid because (1) leukocyte esterase concentrations would be elevated at the infection site due to secretion by recruited neutrophils, and (2) glucose concentrations would be reduced because of bacterial metabolism.

- **Methods**: We prospectively investigated synovial fluid from consecutive patients with an atraumatic joint effusion who underwent arthrocentesis in our emergency department during a one-year period. Leukocyte esterase and glucose strip tests were performed on the synovial fluid. Synovial fluid leukocyte count, crystal analysis, Gram staining, culture, and glucose concentration results were also assessed.

- **Results**: Nineteen fluids were classified as septic and 127 as aseptic. Considering septic arthritis to be present when the leukocyte esterase reading was positive (++ or +++) and the glucose reading was negative (-) yielded a sensitivity of 89.5% (95% confidence interval, 66.9% to 98.7%), specificity of 99.2% (95% CI, 95.7% to 99.9%), positive predictive value of 94.4% (95% CI, 72.7% to 99.9%), negative predictive value of 98.4% (95% CI, 94.5% to 99.8%), positive likelihood ratio of 114, and negative likelihood ratio of 0.11. The synovial leukocyte counts and polymorphonuclear cell percentages were consistent with the septic diagnosis.

### Decreasing urine culture rates in hospitalized internal medicine patients [^112T8sDP]. American Journal of Infection Control (2020). Low credibility.

There are no previous studies on decreasing urine cultures in hospitalized internal medicine patients by a combination of physician education and reflex cancellation of urine cultures in those with a negative dipstick urinalysis.

- **Methods**: We compared urine culture rates in all hospitalized internal medicine patients 18 years or older before intervening (2016), during medical education efforts (2017), and after reflex cancellation of urine cultures in patients with a negative dipstick (negative leukocyte esterase and nitrites) (2018, 2019).

- **Results**: Compared to the preintervention period (2016), urine cultures decreased from a baseline of 32.7% (95% confidence intervals [95% CI]-31.7–33.6) to 26.6% (95% CI-25.8%-27.4%) after medical education efforts, and to 18.2% (95% CI-17.4%-19.0%) and 15.2% (95% CI-14.5%-15.9%) during the two years after reflex cancellation of the urine cultures. There were no physician complaints, and there were no urine cultures ordered after reflex cancellation.

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that physician education and cancellation of urine cultures in those with negative dipsticks resulted in a persistent decrease in urine cultures of around 50%. Extrapolation to other settings requires caution since the results are dependent on patient selection, physician behavior, and methods of urine testing.

### Accuracy of routine laboratory tests to predict mortality and deterioration to severe or critical COVID-19 in people with SARS-CoV-2 [^115kXKmL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

White blood cell count decrease was assessed for the target conditions of mortality and deterioration.

For mortality (5 studies), four studies used a cut-off value of 4 × 10⁹ cells/L, and one study used 5.025 × 10⁹ cells/L as the cut-off value. Sensitivity ranged from 0% to 40%, and specificity from 39% to 97%. At a fixed specificity of 68% (Q1), 83% (median), and 87% (Q3), the summary estimates of sensitivity were 9% (95% CI 6% to 14%), 9% (95% CI 6% to 14%), and 9% (95% CI 6% to 14%), respectively.

For deterioration (6 studies), the cut-off values ranged from 3.5 to 4 × 10⁹ cells/L. Sensitivity ranged from 0% to 43%, with two studies reporting a sensitivity of 0%. Specificity ranged from 37% to 91%. Meta-analysis yielded a sensitivity of 15% (95% CI 6% to 33%), 12% (95% CI 5% to 26%), and 8% (95% CI) at a fixed specificity of 83% (Q1), 85% (median), and 88% (Q3), respectively.

For the assessment of neutrophil count increase pertaining to deterioration (5 studies), cut-off values ranged between 4.7 and 10 × 10⁹ cells/L. Sensitivity ranged from 17% to 62%, and specificity from 70% to 93%. The median specificity in these studies was 89%, with an interquartile range from 88% to 93%. The summary estimates of sensitivity corresponding to these numbers were: 62% (95% CI 46% to 75%) at a specificity of 88%, 49% (95% CI 37% to 62%) at a specificity of 89%, and 41% (95% CI 28% to 55%) at a specificity of 93%.

### Leukocyte counts in urine reflect the risk of concomitant sepsis in bacteriuric infants: A retrospective cohort study [^113hnp1a]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Our findings corroborate those by other investigators who have also reported differences in clinical outcomes between infants and children with urinary tract infections after stratification by the leukocyte count in urine. Of particular interest are studies that report lower levels of acute phase reactants in blood, fewer structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and a lower incidence of renal scarring, suggesting milder disease in children less than 24 months of age with few leukocytes in urine. The specific reasons are unclear for the outcomes noted in these studies and ours between young infants with low and high urine leukocyte counts.

It is conceivable, however, that few urine leukocytes in infants diagnosed with urinary tract infections reflect low virulence of pathogens, indicate mere colonization or contamination of urine, suggest infection confined to the lower urinary tract, or point to urine infections of insufficient duration or severity to induce an inflammatory response. The lower concentration, observed in our study, of bacteria isolated from urine of infants with normal urinalysis supports a number of these hypotheses. Unfortunately, there is currently no timely way to differentiate between these possibilities in a way that is accurate enough to have clinical utility at the initial visit.

To inform initial management decisions, therefore, it seems to us more pragmatic to identify, in operational terms, as done in this study, febrile well-appearing infants at risk of bacteriuric sepsis. Risk-stratification for sepsis that is based on the urine leukocyte count remains crucial.

### Bedside leukocyte esterase testing to aid in diagnosing bacterial conjunctivitis in children [^111b1YPX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Conjunctivitis is a frequent symptom in pediatric emergency departments; however, the etiology of conjunctivitis is difficult to clinically differentiate.

- **Objective**: Our study aimed to evaluate the test performance characteristics of leukocyte esterase (LE) test strips in diagnosing bacterial conjunctivitis.

- **Methods**: Patients aged from 3 months to 21 years presenting to an emergency department with symptoms of conjunctivitis were prospectively enrolled from September 2018 to March 2020. A swab of the affected eye was applied to the LE test strip, and another swab was sent for culture processing. The primary outcome was the association between LE test results and eye culture results.

- **Results**: We enrolled 189 patients. Overall, 117 eye cultures (62%) were positive. The sensitivity and specificity of LE testing were 96% (95% CI 90–98%) and 14% (95% CI 7–25%), respectively. The positive predictive value was 64% (95% CI 57–71%) and the negative predictive value was 67% (95% CI 39–87%).

- **Conclusions**: The LE test strip had limited ability to differentiate bacterial conjunctivitis from other etiologies.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline [^115fXgm6]. The Journal of Urology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for recurrent urinary tract infections in women, more specifically with respect to the choice of antibiotics, the AUA/CUA/SUFU 2019 guidelines recommend administering nitrofurantoin, TMP/SMX, or fosfomycin. The choice should depend on the local antibiogram data as first-line therapy in symptomatic patients with recurrent urinary tract infections.

### Nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infections: a diagnostic accuracy study [^111c2ts7]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

We combined the nitrite and leukocyte esterase dipstick test results because studies showed that the urine dipstick test seems most useful in all populations, including older adults, to exclude the presence of infection if the results of both nitrites and leukocyte esterase are negative.

In the absence of formal cut-off values for CRP, we used the most common cut-offs, i.e. < 5 mg/L (normal range) and ≥ 5 mg/L (elevated values). In real-life practice, general practitioners are most likely to apply these cut-offs that are also stated in the manufacturer's instructions. NH staff could report the CRP test result to the resident's general practitioner, but we do not know whether this was always done and if this influenced UTI management.

One study found that a serum CRP cut-off value of 60 mg/L was the best predictor for early detection of bacterial infections, including UTIs, in an older hospitalized population. The mean CRP value in their non-infection control group was, however, 21.3 mg/L, suggesting that aging and frailty can increase serum inflammation protein levels. In our study, we did not explore CRP levels in residents without UTI suspicions.

We identified one similar study that explored the sensitivity of POCT CRP and procalcitonin to diagnose UTIs in Dutch NH residents. They used the same POCT device but applied a more stringent definition of a confirmed ('true') UTI, namely a positive urine leucocyte esterase test and symptom resolution in the course of adequate antibiotic treatment (i.e. proven susceptibility of isolated uropathogens to the administered antibiotic).

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): Clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^1158sxbc]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, specifically concerning empiric antibiotics selection, the IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend avoiding antibiotics for patients with complicated UTIs, including acute pyelonephritis, if a resistant pathogen has been previously isolated from the urine. Utilize more recent urine cultures as a better guide than more distant cultures.

### The urine dipstick test useful to rule out infections. A meta-analysis of the accuracy [^117R7Uff]. BMC Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Many studies have evaluated the accuracy of dipstick tests as rapid detectors of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections (UTI). The lack of an adequate explanation for the heterogeneity of the dipstick accuracy stimulates an ongoing debate. The objective of the present meta-analysis was to summarize the available evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of the urine dipstick test, taking into account various pre-defined potential sources of heterogeneity.

- **Methods**: Literature from 1990 through 1999 was searched in Medline and Embase, and through reference tracking. Selected publications should be concerned with the diagnosis of bacteriuria or urinary tract infections, investigate the use of dipstick tests for nitrites and/or leukocyte esterase, and present empirical data. A checklist was used to assess methodological quality.

- **Results**: Seventy publications were included. The accuracy of nitrites was high in pregnant women (Diagnostic Odds Ratio = 165) and elderly people (DOR = 108). Positive predictive values were ≥ 80% in the elderly and in family medicine. The accuracy of leukocyte esterase was high in studies on urology patients (DOR = 276). Sensitivities were highest in family medicine (86%). Negative predictive values were high in both tests across all patient groups and settings, except in family medicine. The combination of both test results showed a significant increase in sensitivity. Accuracy was high in studies on urology patients (DOR = 52), children (DOR = 46), and when clinical information was present (DOR = 28). Sensitivity was highest in studies carried out in family medicine.

### Utility of bedside leucocyte esterase testing to rule out septic arthritis [^115Mkjx6]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Suspected septic arthritis is a common presentation to emergency departments (EDs). The underlying diagnosis often involves non-infective pathology, making differentiation between etiologies challenging. A bedside test with a high negative predictive value (NPV) may enable the safe discharge of patients, reducing time spent in the ED, hospital admissions, and associated costs. This study aims to evaluate the NPV of bedside leucocyte esterase (LE) testing in assessing these patients.

- **Methods**: A prospective multicenter observational study was conducted on ED adult patients referred to orthopedics with suspected native joint septic arthritis between October 2015 and April 2016. The study took place at three hospital sites in the Bristol region. The results of the LE test, exposed to aspirated synovial fluid, were recorded alongside Gram stain, culture, hematinics, and length of stay. A positive LE test was defined as 2+ or 3+ leucocytes based on the test strip color. Data were analyzed to determine sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and positive predictive value (PPV) against the gold standard 48-hour culture. The potential number of inpatient bed-days avoidable by using this bedside test was also assessed.

- **Results**: Eighty patients underwent joint aspiration. Five cases had positive 48-hour cultures. All of the infected cases (5/5) showed ≥ 2+ LE, resulting in a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 47.8% to 100%), while the Gram stain was positive in only one case, showing a sensitivity of 20% (95% CI 0.51% to 71.6%). Twenty-three LE tests were read as negative or 1+, all with negative 48-hour culture results, yielding an NPV of 100% (95% CI 82.1% to 1.00%) for a negative LE test. Specificity was established based on these findings.

### Effect of 5-day nitrofurantoin vs single-dose fosfomycin on clinical resolution of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection in women: A randomized clinical trial [^115GiqJ8]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Use of nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin has increased since guidelines began recommending them as first-line therapy for lower urinary tract infections (UTI). This study compares the clinical and microbiologic efficacy of nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin in women with uncomplicated cystitis.

This multinational, open-label, analyst-blinded, randomized clinical trial included 513 nonpregnant women aged 18 years and older. Participants had symptoms of lower UTI, such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, or suprapubic tenderness, a positive urine dipstick result (detection of nitrites or leukocyte esterase), and no known colonization or previous infection with uropathogens resistant to the study antibiotics. Recruitment took place from October 2013 through April 2017 at hospital units and outpatient clinics in Geneva, Switzerland; Lodz, Poland; and Petah-Tiqva, Israel.

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral nitrofurantoin, 100 mg three times a day for 5 days (n = 255), or a single 3-g dose of oral fosfomycin (n = 258). They returned 14 and 28 days after therapy completion for clinical evaluation and urine culture collection.

The primary outcome measured was clinical response within the 28 days following therapy completion. Clinical response was defined as clinical resolution (complete resolution of symptoms and signs of UTI without prior failure), failure (need for additional or change in antibiotic treatment due to UTI or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy), or indeterminate (persistence of symptoms without objective evidence).

### Current pyuria cutoffs promote inappropriate urinary tract infection diagnosis in older women [^113NHRKG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

The majority of UTI studies investigating the discriminative ability of automated microscopy and urine flowcytometry are limited by the absence of a reference standard for UTI. As a consequence, these studies choose a positive urine culture as the reference test, while this does not discriminate between UTI and ASB. Instead, Foudraine et al. defined UTI with an expert panel, taking symptoms and urine culture results into account. They found that automated microscopy had a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 82% at a cutoff value of 74 leukocytes/µL. As their study population was younger and antibiotic pretreatment was common, possibly explaining lower pyuria levels, results may not be directly comparable to our study. Diagnostic accuracy parameters are influenced by the studied population — more specifically, how cases and controls are defined. Our control group did not only consist of asymptomatic women with negative urine cultures but rather represents the distribution of urine culture results in asymptomatic older women. For example, the prevalence of ASB in our control group (18%) is very similar to the prevalence of ASB in community-dwelling older women.

- **Leukocyte counts in symptomatic patients with mixed flora**: Our case group only consisted of patients with clear-cut UTI fulfilling our stringent criteria. However, urine leukocyte levels were also determined in the patients with "suspected UTI" who had new-onset LUTS but were excluded from the primary analysis because they did not meet our culture criteria.

### Interleukin-6 concentrations in the urine and dipstick analyses were related to bacteriuria but not symptoms in the elderly: A cross sectional study of 421 nursing home residents [^111mDhRb]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Urine dipsticks were analyzed for nitrite and leukocyte esterase in urine specimens from 408 out of 421 residents. Urine dipstick analyses were not performed in 13 out of 421 residents, mostly due to insufficient urine volume. Among all residents, regardless of bacteriuria, 26% (106/408) of nitrite dipsticks were positive and 22% (90/408) of leukocyte esterase dipsticks were ≥ 3+.

Leukocyte esterase dipsticks ≥ 3+ were more common (p = < 10⁻⁶) among residents with significant growth of bacteria in the urine; 46% (61/132) versus 11% (29/276) in residents with negative urine cultures. Positive nitrite dipsticks were more common (p = < 10⁻⁶) among residents with positive urine cultures; 64% (84/132) versus 8.0% (22/276) in residents with negative urine cultures.

- **Symptoms, bacteriuria, and antibiotic treatments**: The prevalence of new or increased symptoms, occurring during the last month and still present when urine specimens were obtained, are presented in Table 1. There were no significant differences in the proportion of positive urine cultures among those with or without nonspecific symptoms; however, there were fewer positive urine cultures among residents with urinary frequency. Residents with some of the symptoms had a higher prevalence of antibiotic treatments during the last month.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: A review by the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases [^1174tKiQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Patient history and clinical review underpin the diagnosis of UTI and assessment of complicating features at presentation (GRADE D). Urine collection should be done by clean catch, catheterization, or suprapubic aspiration, and urine analysis, culture, and susceptibility testing should be undertaken for all children (GRADE C). Additional blood investigations for complicated UTI (cUTI) may include inflammatory markers, full blood count, blood culture, urea, creatinine, and electrolytes (GRADE C). An acute ultrasound scan is helpful in some clinical situations (GRADE D). All children with cUTI should be reassessed for treatment response at 48 hours. If progress is atypical, consider complications and/or differential diagnosis (GRADE D). Repeat urine testing is only needed if there is inadequate treatment response (GRADE D).

All children, irrespective of uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) or cUTI, need urinary investigations to confirm UTI diagnosis. Key investigations and their interpretation are given below.

As with uncomplicated UTI, clean catch urine collection is preferred due to its noninvasive nature, with catheterization or suprapubic aspiration being the gold standards if collection is difficult or diagnosis is uncertain. In infants under 2 months, clean catch methods are challenging and can result in up to 38% contaminated samples, so catheterization or suprapubic aspiration is advised. Up to 88% of specimens collected via a urine bag can be contaminated, making catheterization or suprapubic aspiration preferable for accuracy.

### Prevalence of urinary tract infections and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of bacterial isolates in first-time ANC attendees at a secondary health facility in Ghana: a cross-sectional study [^115HefSF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Physical and biochemical analysis of urine samples reveals that 82.5% (165) of the urine samples from the participants were yellowish in color, and 95.5% (190) had no glucose. Almost 40% (77) of the samples had no proteins, with 36.0% (72) having some traces of proteins, and 25.5% (51) having proteinuria. Almost all the urine samples, 99.0% (198), had no nitrite, with half (102) having no leukocytes, 30.0% (60) having leukocytes, and 19.0% (38) having traces of leukocytes. When stratified by culture outcome, positive samples had a higher percentage of 51.7% (31/60) of leukocytes. The presence of leukocytes in urine samples was marginally significantly associated with culture outcomes.

- **Prevalence of UTI-causing organisms among the study participants**: A 39.0% (78/200) positive culture growth of all the urine samples was noted, with bacteria species responsible for the culture growth in 21.5% (43/200) of the total urine samples. Ninety-one organisms were isolated from the 78 positive culture growths, of which 61.5% (56/91) were bacteria species. The most predominantly isolated organisms were yeast-like cells, 38.5% (35/91); Escherichia coli, 31.9% (29/91); Pseudomonas spp, 8.8% (8); and Klebsiella spp, 7.7% (7). Mixed microbial organisms were identified in the samples of nine respondents. Out of these, two microbial organisms were identified in eight samples, and three organisms were identified in one sample.

### Leukocyte esterase versus ICM 2018 criteria in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection [^115FjWJH]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Low credibility.

A leukocyte esterase (LE) test is inexpensive and provides real-time information about patients suspected of periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs). The 2018 International Consensus Meeting (ICM) recommends it as a diagnostic tool with a 2+ cutoff. There is still a lack of data revealing LE utility versus the ICM 2018 criteria for PJI.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective study of patients who underwent revision total hip and total knee arthroplasty at a single institution between March 2009 and December 2019. All patients underwent joint aspiration before the arthrotomy, and the LE strip test was performed on aspirated joint fluid. PJI was defined using the 2018 ICM criteria.

- **Results**: As per the 2018 ICM criteria, 78 patients were diagnosed with chronic PJI and 181 were not infected. An LE test with a cutoff of ≥ 1+ had a sensitivity of 0.744, a specificity of 0.906, a positive predictive value of 0.773, an accuracy of 0.825 (95% confidence interval 0.772–0.878), and a negative predictive value of 0.891. The positive likelihood ratio (LR+) was 7.917. Using an LE cutoff of 2+ had a sensitivity of 0.513, a specificity of 1.000, and an accuracy of 0.756 (95% confidence interval 0.812).

- **Conclusion**: LE is a rapid and inexpensive test which can be performed at the bedside. Its performance is valuable as per ICM criteria. Based on the findings of this study and the given cohort, we suggest using the cutoff of LE 1+ (result = negative or trace) as a point-of-care test to exclude infection, whereas LE at a 2+ threshold has near absolute specificity for the diagnosis.
