## Question

Clabsi vs crabsi

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the difference between CLABSI and CRBSI, including definitions, diagnostic criteria, clinical implications, and how to use each term in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definitions and the organizations behind them. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria and how they differ in specificity. Next, I will examine why CLABSI and CRBSI diverge in clinical and surveillance contexts. After that, I should review the evidence on misclassification and surrogate validity. Finally, I will synthesize practical implications for clinicians, researchers, and quality leaders, and close with a concise, clinically actionable distinction.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate surveillance with clinical diagnosis. CLABSI is a surveillance construct from the CDC/NHSN: a primary bloodstream infection in a patient with a central line in place for more than 48 hours, with no other identifiable source, using standardized criteria and organism rules, including how commensals are handled [^111a5CKJ] [^111a5CKJ]. CRBSI is a clinical diagnosis from IDSA: microbiologic proof that the catheter is the source, typically via paired blood cultures showing a colony count ratio of at least 3:1 (catheter vs peripheral) or differential time to positivity of at least 2 hours, or concordant growth from the catheter tip and blood, which makes CRBSI more specific but harder to prove in routine care [^117XW4Z5] [^113oNpjF].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic thresholds so I don't misstate them. The 3:1 colony ratio and the ≥ 2-hour differential time to positivity are classic IDSA CRBSI criteria, and they require paired cultures from the catheter and a peripheral site or a catheter tip culture matching the blood isolate; this is stricter than NHSN's CLABSI definition, which accepts a primary BSI with a central line present and no other source, and has specific rules for common skin commensals requiring at least two positive cultures with clinical features [^117XW4Z5] [^113oNpjF]. Hold on, I should also note that quantitative cultures and DTP are not universally available, which limits CRBSI ascertainment in many hospitals and explains why CLABSI is often used as a pragmatic endpoint [^117XW4Z5].

> I need to check why CLABSI and CRBSI diverge in practice. CLABSI is designed for surveillance and benchmarking across facilities, so it trades specificity for feasibility; it can capture infections attributable to the catheter but also overcalls contamination or non-catheter sources, especially in high-risk populations like oncology or immunocompromised patients with mucosal barrier injury, where gut translocation can mimic catheter infection [^112eK6By] [^114Ab6qa]. CRBSI, being clinically oriented, is more specific but underdetects true catheter infections because it requires paired cultures or tip data that are often not obtained, leading to false negatives and missed opportunities for source control [^117XW4Z5].

> Next, I should review the evidence on misclassification and surrogate validity to quantify the gap. A systematic review of diagnostic reliability found that CLABSI rates are frequently underestimated in public reporting, with sensitivity ranging from 0.42 to 0.88 and specificity from 0.70 to 0.99, indicating both under- and over-calling depending on context and reviewer expertise [^116eCHe8]. But wait, what if CLABSI still tracks catheter-related risk reasonably well at the study level? Individual- and study-level analyses show CLABSI has poor agreement with CRBSI and is a weak surrogate for CRBSI treatment effects, whereas catheter-associated infection (CAI) performs better as a surrogate, reinforcing that CLABSI is better suited for surveillance than for evaluating interventions targeting true catheter infection [^111qvvne].

> Let me consider concrete clinical scenarios where the distinction matters. In oncology or transplant patients with mucosal barrier injury, CLABSI overattributes bloodstream infections to catheters; only about half of CLABSIs meet CRBSI criteria in such cohorts, so relying on CLABSI alone risks unnecessary catheter removals and missed GI sources [^114Ab6qa]. In hemodialysis, KDOQI emphasizes strict CRBSI definitions and achievable benchmarks around 1.5 per 1,000 catheter-days, reflecting the need for precise attribution and targeted prevention in this high-risk group [^111o57zD]. Conversely, in ICUs focused on quality improvement, CLABSI remains a useful metric for driving bundle adherence and tracking trends, but I should double-check that we interpret CLABSI signals alongside process measures and local epidemiology to avoid misattribution [^112eK6By] [^114FqBNV].

> I should confirm how this translates into practice. For clinicians facing a patient with fever and a central line, I need to ensure paired cultures are obtained from the catheter and a peripheral vein whenever feasible, consider DTP if available, and assess for alternative sources before labeling a BSI as catheter-related; this aligns with IDSA guidance and improves diagnostic accuracy for CRBSI, which should guide decisions on catheter management and duration of therapy [^117XW4Z5] [^113r1wAa]. For infection prevention programs, CLABSI surveillance remains essential for benchmarking and detecting outbreaks, but I need to ensure consistent NHSN application, audit for misclassification, and, when appropriate, supplement with CRBSI-focused reviews in high-risk units to better target interventions [^112eK6By] [^116eCHe8]. For researchers, I should avoid using CLABSI as a surrogate for CRBSI in efficacy trials and instead prespecify CRBSI or validated composites to avoid dilution of treatment effects and misinterpretation [^111qvvne].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential pitfall in my own framing. I initially implied that CLABSI is simply "less accurate" than CRBSI; that's too simplistic. CLABSI is accurate for its intended surveillance purpose, but it is not designed to prove catheter causation, whereas CRBSI is designed to prove causation but is harder to diagnose and therefore less sensitive in routine practice, so the two are complementary rather than interchangeable [^112eK6By] [^117XW4Z5]. Let me reconsider and emphasize that the choice depends on whether the goal is surveillance, quality improvement, or clinical decision-making, and that both should be interpreted in context [^112eK6By].

> In summary, I need to ensure the distinction is crisp and actionable. CLABSI is a surveillance definition that flags primary BSIs temporally associated with a central line, enabling benchmarking and prevention tracking, but it can overcall catheter infection in complex patients. CRBSI is a clinical diagnosis requiring microbiologic proof that the catheter is the source, making it more specific for guiding catheter management but harder to document routinely. Using the right term in the right context prevents misclassification, optimizes patient care, and sharpens our quality and research signals [^1112Q6ng] [^117XW4Z5] [^111qvvne].

CLABSI and CRBSI are related but distinct concepts. CLABSI is a **surveillance definition** for primary bloodstream infection in a patient with a central line present for > 48 hours, without another source, and is used for benchmarking and public reporting [^1112Q6ng] [^1145as47]. CRBSI is a **clinical diagnosis** that requires microbiologic proof the catheter is the source, such as differential time to positivity or concordant catheter tip cultures, and is used to guide management and source control [^117XW4Z5] [^113oNpjF]. CLABSI is broader and may include contamination or non-catheter sources, whereas CRBSI is more specific but harder to prove; both are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost, and prevention relies on evidence-based bundles and diagnostic stewardship [^111qvvne] [^115T7PnV] [^112eK6By].

## Definitions and diagnostic criteria

| **Aspect** | **CLABSI** | **CRBSI** |
|-|-|-|
| Definition | A primary bloodstream infection in a patient with a central line in place for > 48 hours, without another identifiable source [^1112Q6ng] | A bloodstream infection proven to originate from an intravascular catheter, confirmed microbiologically [^117XW4Z5] |
| Diagnostic criteria | - Positive blood culture from a central line or peripheral vein <br/> - Clinical signs (fever, chills, hypotension) <br/> - No other source identified [^1112Q6ng] | - Differential time to positivity (DTP) ≥ 2 hours earlier for catheter-drawn blood vs peripheral blood [^117XW4Z5] <br/> - Or quantitative catheter tip culture with ≥ 10² CFU/mL of the same organism as blood [^117XW4Z5] <br/> - Or paired blood cultures with a catheter-to-peripheral colony count ratio ≥ 3:1 [^113oNpjF] |
| Purpose | Surveillance, benchmarking, and public reporting of healthcare-associated infections [^1145as47] | Clinical diagnosis to guide management, including catheter removal and targeted therapy [^113r1wAa] |

---

## Clinical implications and outcomes

Both CLABSI and CRBSI are associated with **significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs** [^115T7PnV]. CLABSI increases length of stay and costs by approximately $32,000 per case, and mortality ranges from 12% to 25% [^115T7PnV] [^113sr334]. CRBSI carries similar or higher risks, particularly when caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Candida species, and often necessitates catheter removal and prolonged antibiotic therapy [^113r1wAa].

---

## Prevention strategies

Effective prevention of CLABSI and CRBSI relies on **evidence-based bundles and best practices**:

- **Insertion bundles**: Maximal sterile barrier precautions, chlorhexidine skin antisepsis, and ultrasound guidance reduce infection risk [^114ZNTcE] [^114tZc7K].
- **Maintenance bundles**: Chlorhexidine-containing dressings, aseptic hub care, and prompt catheter removal when no longer needed are essential [^115yrrYb].
- **Antimicrobial-impregnated catheters**: Recommended in high-risk patients or units with elevated CLABSI rates despite best practices [^115vUs2Q].
- **Antimicrobial lock solutions**: Effective for long-term catheters, particularly in hemodialysis patients [^115vUs2Q] [^11543YEW].

---

## Challenges and controversies

- **Misclassification**: CLABSI may overestimate true catheter-related infections due to contamination or non-catheter sources, especially in high-risk populations [^111qvvne] [^114Ab6mA].
- **Diagnostic complexity**: CRBSI requires specific microbiologic testing that may not be routinely available, leading to underdiagnosis [^117XW4Z5].
- **Public reporting**: CLABSI rates are publicly reported and tied to reimbursement, creating incentives to underreport or manipulate data [^1159ATum] [^113LPgNG].

## Summary of key differences

| **Parameter** | **CLABSI** | **CRBSI** |
|-|-|-|
| Definition | Surveillance definition of primary BSI with central line | Clinical diagnosis of catheter-source BSI |
| Diagnostic criteria | Positive blood culture + central line + no other source | Microbiologic proof of catheter source (DTP, tip culture, paired cultures) |
| Purpose | Surveillance, benchmarking, public reporting | Clinical management, source control |
| Specificity | Lower (includes contamination) | Higher (proves catheter source) |
| Clinical use | Quality improvement, policy | Treatment decisions, catheter management |

---

CLABSI and CRBSI are complementary concepts: CLABSI supports surveillance and quality improvement, while CRBSI guides clinical management. Accurate diagnosis and prevention require **standardized definitions**, **diagnostic stewardship**, and **evidence-based bundles** to reduce morbidity, mortality, and costs [^112eK6By] [^116xq1Zp] [^114gHoSZ].

Section 2: Background on detection of CLABSI

Surveillance methods and definitions for CLABSI

Use consistent surveillance methods and definitions to allow comparison to benchmark data.
Refer to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Patient Safety Component Manual for information on the appropriate surveillance methodology, including information about blood specimen collection and surveillance definitions of CLABSIs. The relevant chapter of the manual is "Chapter 4: Bloodstream Infection Event (Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection and Non-Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection)". Recent data suggest that interrater reliability using NHSN definitions is lower than expected. – This may also affect the reliability of public reporting. The NHSN surveillance definition for CLABSI is different than the clinical definition for catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). The latter is subject to various factors (eg, laboratory capabilities, catheter removal, and submitting the catheter tip for culture). The evidence presented here includes studies that used either CLABSI or CRBSI as an outcome measure and the lesser accuracy of CLABSI may impact the validity of the evidence.

Materials and methods

Literature search

We conducted a systematic literature search to identify all studies focused on SDM strategies in AYA with chronic diseases or cancer for choosing the CVC implantation site and reducing possible CVC associated bacteremia (CLABSI and CRBSI). We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Tri (2019, Issue 7; 31 December 2019); PubMed (from 1966 to 31 December 2019); Embase (Elsevier, from 1974 to 31 December 2019); CINAHL (EBSCO HOST; from 1982 to 31 December 2019); SCOPUS (from 1970 to 31 December 2019); Web of Science (from 1990 to 31 December 2019). No language limitation. See Appendix 1 for the full search strategies for each database. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) group guidelines.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Intervention types and comparison groups: SDM approaches with AYA suffering from chronic diseases or cancer allowing them to share decisions in choosing the implantation CVC site for complex therapies or parenteral nutrition. Outcome types: reduction in CLABSI and CRBSI. The review included all study designs except abstracts, unpublished studies, conference presentations, and editorials.

A protocol for this systematic review has been registered prospectively in the PROSPERO database [CRD42020162886].

Discussion

This systematic review, meta-analysis, trial sequential analysis and meta-regression, which included both RCTs and NRSI, demonstrated that US-guided CVC is associated with a statistically significant reduction of catheter-related infections, compared with the AL puncture technique (RR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.53–0.88). The preplanned subgroup analysis showed that US-guided CVC significantly reduced catheter-related infections when the procedures were performed by experienced operators (RR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.41–0.89), whereas no significant benefit was observed in inexperienced operators. The secondary outcomes further supported our primary findings. While individual analyses of studies measuring CRBSI or CLABSI alone did not reach statistical significance, the pooled analysis of these outcomes (composite secondary outcome) demonstrated a significant reduction of CLABSI or CRBSI with US-guided CVC (RR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.48–0.87). This suggests that US guidance consistently reduces the risk of serious catheter-related infections, although individual studies may be underpowered to detect these differences independently.

All of these findings provide important insights into the ongoing debate surrounding the optimal method of CVC placement. They are consistent with prior studies suggesting that the US guidance minimizes the risk of catheter-related infections, due to fewer skin punctures, fewer risk of hematoma and reduced procedure time, which likely decrease the opportunity for microbial contamination. However, a previous meta-analysis of Takeshita et al. (2022) showed no statistically significant difference in CRBSIs between US-guided and AL puncture in CVC. It should be noted that there were several important differences between their study and the present study. The selection process of the present meta-analysis was much wider, including an additional third database, and not restrict to the English language in the selection of articles, as recommended in PRISMA guidelines. Furthermore, as the number of studies included in their systematic review and meta-analysis was low (four RCTs), we decided to expand the included studies to prospective NRSI. The inclusion of NRSI, following to strict guidelines, can provide very valuable information, particularly concerning rare events or adverse effects.

### Economic evaluation of quality improvement interventions for bloodstream infections related to central catheters: a systematic review [^112kqhWY]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Although quality improvement (QI) interventions can reduce central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), their economic value is uncertain.

Objective

To systematically review economic evaluations of QI interventions designed to prevent CLABSI and/or CRBSI in acute care hospitals.

Evidence Review

A search of Ovid MEDLINE, Econlit, Centre for Reviews & Dissemination, New York Academy of Medicine's Grey Literature Report, Worldcat, prior systematic reviews (January 2004 to July 2016), and IDWeek conference abstracts (2013–2016), was conducted from 2013 to 2016. We included English-language studies of any design that evaluated organizational or structural changes to prevent CLABSI or CRBSI, and reported program and infection-related costs. Dual reviewers assessed study design, effectiveness, costs, and study quality. For each eligible study, we performed a cost-consequences analysis from the hospital perspective, estimating the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and incremental net savings. Unadjusted weighted regression analyses tested predictors of these measures, weighted by catheter-days per study per year.

Findings

Of 505 articles, 15 unique studies were eligible, together representing data from 113 hospitals. Thirteen studies compared Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality-recommended practices with usual care, including 7 testing insertion checklists. Eleven studies were based on uncontrolled before-after designs, 1 on a randomized controlled trial, 1 on a time-series analysis, and 2 on modeled estimates. Overall, the weighted mean IRR was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.35–0.51) and incremental net savings were $1.85 million (95% CI, $1.30 million to $2.40 million) per hospital over 3 years (2015 US dollars). Each $100 000-increase in program cost was associated with $315 000 greater savings (95% CI, $166 000-$464 000; P < .001). Infections and net costs declined when hospitals already used checklists or had baseline infection rates of 1.7 to 3.7 per 1000 catheter-days. Study quality was not associated with effectiveness or costs.

Conclusions and Relevance

Interventions related to central venous catheters were, on average, associated with 57% fewer bloodstream infections and substantial savings to hospitals. Larger initial investments may be associated with greater savings. Although checklists are now widely used and infections have started to decline, additional improvements and savings can occur at hospitals that have not yet attained very low infection rates.

### Mindful organizing as a healthcare strategy to decrease catheter-associated infections in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units. A systematic review and grading recommendations (GRADE) system [^112zXWDQ]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To explore the clinical evidence available on mindful organizing (MO) that will improve teamwork for positioning and managing central venous catheters in patients admitted to neonatal intensive care and other pediatric intensive care units to decrease central-line-associated and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CLABSI and CRBSI).

Methods

We searched several databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, SCOPUS, and Web of Science) up to June 2018. We included studies investigating the effectiveness of MO teamwork in reducing CLABSI and CRBSI. The systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. We used validated appraisal checklists to assess quality.

Results

Seven studies were included: only one was a non-randomized case-controlled trial (CCT). All the others had a pre-post intervention design, one a time-series design and one an interrupted time-series design. The methodological heterogeneity precluded a meta-analysis. Despite the low certainty of evidence with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system, three studies including thousands of participants provided numerical data for calculating risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) comparing MO with no intervention for decreasing the CLABSI rate in neonatal and pediatric ICUs. The one CCT disclosed no significant difference in the CLABSI rate decrease between groups (RR = 0.96; 95%CI 0.47–1.97). Nor did the pre- and post-intervention interrupted time-series design disclose a significant decrease (RR = 0.80; 95%CI 0.361.77). In the study using a before-after study design, the GRADE system found that the CLABSI rate decrease differed significantly in favor of post-intervention (RR = 0.13; 95%CI 0.030.57; p = 0.007).

Conclusions

Despite the decreased CLABSI rate, the available evidence is low in quality. To reduce the unduly high CLABSI rates in neonatal and pediatric intensive care settings, custom-designed clinical trials should further define the clinical efficacy of MO to include it in care bundles as a new international standard.

### Does letting adolescent and young adult inpatients share decisions in choosing the central-line insertion site reduce central-line-associated bloodstream infections? An empty systematic review [^1145JSSB]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2024). Medium credibility.

Another barrier to engaging AYA in sharing decisions on the CVC insertion site, is the failure to refer them in healthcare bundles for surgical evaluation, and explain alternative insertion sites. Whereas healthcare strategies enabling patients to choose CVC implantation sites showed that patients preferred one site over another because they perceived a lower infection risk and better associated hygiene, clinical prejudices, and interests might decide differently. To reduce CLABSI and CRBSI rates, healthcare teams need to overcome clinical technical interests, and focus on engaging AYA in choosing CVC insertion sites by considering crucial AYA assets, attitudes, and perspectives.

### Treatment of central line-associated bloodstream infections [^115ZgqNN]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The treatment of CLABSIs in 2018 is still based on expert opinions and cohort studies rather than robust scientific evidence. Such infections continue to increase complications and mortality and are quite costly. Large-scale studies are warranted to further clarify the nature and duration of treatment. In the meantime, physicians are encouraged to use algorithms such as the one proposed here (Fig. 1).

### Does letting adolescent and young adult inpatients share decisions in choosing the central-line insertion site reduce central-line-associated bloodstream infections? An empty systematic review [^1157tJ2T]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2024). Medium credibility.

To study whether allowing adolescents and young adults (AYA) with chronic or oncologic diseases admitted to tertiary or intensive care units to share decisions in choosing the insertion site for central-venous catheters (CVC) implanted for intravenous therapies or parenteral nutrition reduces central-line-associated and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CLABSI and CRBSI). Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed the literature by searching MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science up to December 2019. According to our aims, the review identified no study that could be included. This empty systematic review on healthcare teams allowing AYA with chronic or oncologic diseases admitted in tertiary or intensive care units to share decisions in choosing the site for implanting CVC prompts further research on clinical pathways on this hot-topic. By considering purportedly risk-taking behaviors in youngsters thus reducing CLABSI and CRBSI, healthcare teams should test specific strategies by engaging AYA empathetically in sharing decisions on the site for implanting CVC to improve quality in health care bundles.

### Central venous catheter-related infections: a systematic review, meta-analysis, trial sequential analysis and meta-regression comparing ultrasound guidance and landmark technique for insertion [^114tZc7K]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

During central venous catheterization (CVC), ultrasound (US) guidance has been shown to reduce mechanical complications and increase success rates compared to the anatomical landmark (AL) technique. However, the impact of US guidance on catheter-related infections remains controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the risk of catheter-related infection with US-guided CVC versus AL technique.

Methods

A systematic search on MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science databases was conducted until July 31, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies of intervention (NRSI) comparing US-guided versus AL-guided CVC placement were included. The primary outcome was a composite outcome including all types of catheter-related infection: catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs), central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), catheter colonization, or any other type of reported infection. The secondary outcomes included individual infection types and mortality at day-28. Subgroup analyses based on study type and operator experience were also performed.

Results

Pooling twelve studies (8 RCTs and 4 NRSI), with a total of 5,092 CVC procedures (2072 US-guided and 3020 AL-guided), US-guided CVC was associated with a significant reduction in catheter-related infections compared with the AL technique (risk ratio (RR) = 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53–0.88). In the RCT subgroup, the pooled RR was 0.65 (95% CI 0.49–0.87). This effect was more pronounced in procedures performed by experienced operators (RR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.41–0.89). In inexperienced operators, the infection risk reduction was not statistically significant. The pooled analysis of CRBSIs and CLABSIs also favored US guidance (RR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.48–0.87).

Conclusion

US-guided CVC placement significantly reduces the risk of catheter-related infections compared to the AL technique, particularly when performed by experienced operators.

### Validity of surrogate endpoints assessing central venous catheter-related infection: evidence from individual-and study-level analyses [^111qvvne]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) has been an area of intense research, but the heterogeneity of endpoints used to define catheter infection makes the interpretation of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) problematic. The aim of this study was to determine the validity of different endpoints for central venous catheter infections.

Data Sources

(a) Individual-catheter data were collected from 9428 catheters from four large RCTs; (b) study-level data from 70 RCTs were identified with a systematic search. Eligible studies were RCTs published between January 1987 and October 2018 investigating various interventions to reduce infections from short-term central venous catheters or short-term dialysis catheters. For each RCT the prevalence rates of CRBSI, quantitative catheter tip colonization, catheter-associated infection (CAI) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) were extracted for each randomized study arm.

Methods

CRBSI was used as the gold-standard endpoint, for which colonization, CAI and CLABSI were evaluated as surrogate endpoints. Surrogate validity was assessed as (1) the individual partial coefficient of determination (individual-pR²) using individual catheter data; (2) the coefficient of determination (study-R²) from mixed-effect models regressing the therapeutic effect size of the surrogates on the effect size of CRBSI, using study-level data.

Results

Colonization showed poor agreement with CRBSI at the individual-patient level (pR² = 0.33 95% CI 0.28–0.38) and poor capture at the study level (R² = 0.42, 95% CI 0.21–0.58). CAI showed good agreement with CRBSI at the individual-patient level (pR² = 0.80, 95% CI 0.76–0.83) and moderate capture at the study level (R² = 0.71, 95% CI 0.51–0.85). CLABSI showed poor agreement with CRBSI at the individual patient level (pR² = 0.34, 95% CI 0.23–0.46) and poor capture at the study level (R² = 0.28, 95% CI 0.07–0.76).

Conclusions

CAI is a moderate to good surrogate endpoint for CRBSI. Colonization and CLABSI do not reliably reflect treatment effects on CRBSI and are consequently more suitable for surveillance than for clinical effectiveness research.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^114FqBNV]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

CLABSI prevention evaluation — process and outcome measurement — states that evaluation involves process and outcome measurement; multidisciplinary teams should set clear goals and identify the key factors to be measured; it is important for providers and the healthcare team to receive feedback on performance; feedback should include periodic (eg, monthly, quarterly) communication of process measurement data with graphs showing cumulative compliance with process measures; differences between age groups should be considered; the standardized utilization ratio (SUR) provides a method for hospital units to compare themselves to others; and CLABSI events are important to discuss with team members to clarify gaps and mitigation strategies.

### Guidelines for the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections: recommendations relevant to interventional radiology for venous catheter placement and maintenance [^1112Q6ng]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Intravascular catheter-related infection definitions — catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and midline catheter — are clarified as follows: Catheter-related bloodstream infection is a clinical definition requiring specific laboratory testing to identify the catheter as the source of bloodstream infection. Central line–associated BSI is defined as a primary bloodstream infection in a patient who had a central catheter within the 48-hour period before BSI development and that is not related to another infection site. A midline catheter is inserted via the antecubital fossa into the proximal basilic or cephalic veins and does not enter the central veins.

### Prevention of catheter-related infection: toward zero risk? [^112Mf8Ux]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review identifies important findings in the recent literature related to the prevention of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).

Recent Findings

CLABSI rates obtained through surveillance programs have decreased in recent years. Reasons for this are multifactorial: bundle interventions for practice change; technology; and pressure from benchmarking and public reporting. Many studies on the successful use of bundle strategies have been published in the past 2 years, whereas technology has somewhat disappeared from the literature. Success stories made CLABSI prevention the example of healthcare-associated infection prevention. The overwhelming success of practice change together with emerging public awareness confronts hospitals with serious implementation challenges. Fortunately, a number of implementation guidance articles were published recently, which allow hospitals to detect and overcome implementation barriers.

Summary

The efforts made for CLABSI prevention exemplify not only the complexity of the problem but also the creativity and — most recently — success. Although 'zero' risk may not seem a realistic goal, the number of hospitals approaching this idealistic threshold is growing. The evidence is now clear that CLABSI can be reduced most effectively by 'state-of-the-art' insertion technique and catheter care. The question today is not 'what to do' but 'how to do it'.

### Antiseptic solutions for skin preparation during central catheter insertion in neonates [^11226PuQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Central venous catheters (CVC) are associated with potentially dangerous complications such as thromboses, pericardial effusions, extravasation, and infections in neonates. Indwelling catheters are amongst the main risk factors for nosocomial infections. The use of skin antiseptics during the preparation for central catheter insertion may prevent catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). However, it is still not clear which antiseptic solution is the best to prevent infection with minimal side effects.

Objectives

To systematically evaluate the safety and efficacy of different antiseptic solutions in preventing CRBSI and other related outcomes in neonates with CVC.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trial registries up to 22 April 2022. We checked reference lists of included trials and systematic reviews that related to the intervention or population examined in this Cochrane Review. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster-RCTs were eligible for inclusion in this review if they were performed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and were comparing any antiseptic solution (single or in combination) against any other type of antiseptic solution or no antiseptic solution or placebo in preparation for central catheter insertion. We excluded cross-over trials and quasi-RCTs.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methods from Cochrane Neonatal. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included three trials that had two different comparisons: 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol (CHG-IPA) versus 10% povidone-iodine (PI) (two trials); and CHG-IPA versus 2% chlorhexidine in aqueous solution (CHG-A) (one trial). A total of 466 neonates from level III NICUs were evaluated. All included trials were at high risk of bias. The certainty of the evidence for the primary and some important secondary outcomes ranged from very low to moderate. There were no included trials that compared antiseptic skin solutions with no antiseptic solution or placebo. CHG-IPA versus 10% PI Compared to PI, CHG-IPA may result in little to no difference in CRBSI (risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 3.25; risk difference (RD) 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.06; 352 infants, 2 trials, low-certainty evidence) and all-cause mortality (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.68; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.06; 304 infants, 1 trial, low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CHG-IPA on CLABSI (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.08; RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.11; 48 infants, 1 trial; very low-certainty evidence) and chemical burns (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.24 to 4.48; RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.03; 352 infants, 2 trials, very low-certainty evidence), compared to PI. Based on a single trial, infants receiving CHG-IPA appeared less likely to develop thyroid dysfunction compared to PI (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.85; RD -0.06, 95% CI -0.10 to -0.02; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 17, 95% CI 10 to 50; 304 infants). Neither of the two included trials assessed the outcome of premature central line removal or the proportion of infants or catheters with exit-site infection. CHG-IPA versus CHG-A The evidence suggests CHG-IPA may result in little to no difference in the rate of proven CRBSI when applied on the skin of neonates prior to central line insertion (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.87; RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.13; 106 infants, 1 trial, low-certainty evidence) and CLABSI (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.34 to 3.84; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.15; 106 infants, 1 trial, low-certainty evidence), compared to CHG-A. Compared to CHG-A, CHG-IPA probably results in little to no difference in premature catheter removal (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.19; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.13; 106 infants, 1 trial, moderate-certainty evidence) and chemical burns (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.03; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.18; 114 infants, 1 trial, moderate-certainty evidence). No trial assessed the outcome of all-cause mortality and the proportion of infants or catheters with exit-site infection.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on current evidence, compared to PI, CHG-IPA may result in little to no difference in CRBSI and mortality. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CHG-IPA on CLABSI and chemical burns. One trial showed a statistically significant increase in thyroid dysfunction with the use of PI compared to CHG-IPA. The evidence suggests CHG-IPA may result in little to no difference in the rate of proven CRBSI and CLABSI when applied on the skin of neonates prior to central line insertion. Compared to CHG-A, CHG-IPA probably results in little to no difference in chemical burns and premature catheter removal. Further trials that compare different antiseptic solutions are required, especially in low- and middle-income countries, before stronger conclusions can be made.

### Role of EDTA lock solution in preventing catheter-related bloodstream infections or central line-associated bloodstream infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11543YEW]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) or central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) occur frequently with long-term indwelling catheters. EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and other catheter lock solutions can prevent CRBSI/CLABSI. This study aimed to identify the role of EDTA lock solution in preventing CRBSI/CLABSI compared to the non-EDTA lock solutions.

Materials and Methods

Eligible studies comparing the effectiveness of EDTA versus a control group on averting CRBSI or CLABSI were identified through searches across PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane CENTRAL, medRxiv, bioRxiv, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The secondary outcomes were catheter colonization, catheter survival, and catheter thrombosis. The relative risk for all the outcomes was calculated.

Results

This meta-analysis included eight studies (403 EDTA vs 425 control patients) and demonstrated a significant reduction in CRBSI/CLABSI with EDTA (15 vs 71 events; RR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.10–0.33; P < 0.00001). Catheter colonization also decreased significantly (8 vs 38 events; OR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.05–0.29). EDTA improved catheter survival in hemodialysis patients (OR: 3.77; 95% CI: 1.23–11.61; P < 0.02) but showed no significant effect on thrombolytic treatment or all-cause mortality. Subgroup analyses supported these findings, with no publication bias detected.

Conclusion

EDTA significantly reduces CRBSI/CLABSI and catheter colonization, improves catheter survival, but does not affect thrombolytic treatment or mortality. Evidence certainty varies across outcomes.

### Central venous catheter-related infections: a systematic review, meta-analysis, trial sequential analysis and meta-regression comparing ultrasound guidance and landmark technique for insertion [^116XJkNj]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The meta-analysis protocol was prospectively registered on the PROSPERO register of systematic reviews (CRD42022350884).

Search strategy

Studies were selected from three databases, until July 31, 2024: MEDLINE (via PubMed), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science. The search strategy is described in detail in the supplementary material (Appendix 1).

Selection criteria

We searched for RCTs and prospective NRSI, comparing AL and US-guided techniques for CVC placement, and reporting infectious complications. We included all studies of short-term catheters in adult populations (age ≥ 18 years), with no other restriction regarding population characteristics, study setting (ICU, operating room, emergency department), central venous catheterization site, or inserter experience. We included articles with no restriction on publication date, published and unpublished studies, and restricted to Latin alphabet languages.

The following studies were not included: pediatric population (age < 18 years), long-term catheters (peripherally inserted central catheter, tunneled and/or cuffed CVC, long-term dialysis catheters, and totally implantable devices), and non-prospective interventional studies (e.g. historical control group).

Outcomes

The primary outcome was a composite outcome including all types of catheter-related infection: catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs), central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), catheter colonization, or any other type of reported infection. The CRBSIs, CLABSIs and catheter colonization were defined according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). Outcomes that did not meet these definitions were classified as "undefined infections".

Secondary outcomes included each component of the composite outcome alone (CRBSIs, CLABSIs, and catheter colonization), and mortality rate at day 28. CRBSIs and CLABSIs were also evaluated together, in a composite secondary endpoint.

### Risk factors for catheter-related bloodstream infections in a high-risk cancer patient population [^115dtfRv]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

C entral venous catheters (CVCs) have become essential in medicine, particularly for cancer patients requiring long-term intravenous therapies like chemotherapy, antibiotics, and blood transfusions. While improving quality of life by reducing repeated venipunctures, long-term central venous catheters (LCVCs), implanted beyond 14 days, carry risks, notably catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs), a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite preventive measures.

This study focuses on identifying cancer patient subgroups most susceptible to CRBSI, using stringent Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) criteriato differentiate true CRBSI from the broader CDC surveillance definition of central-line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), which may include mucosal barrier injury (MBI) infections originating from the gut rather than the catheter.

### Utilizing whole genome sequencing to characterize central line-associated bloodstream infections due to… [^1152Zgad]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As the CLABSI definition is widely used for healthcare-associated infection surveillance, there is intense interest in improving the precision of the definition. Contamination of blood cultures obtained from CVCs is common and can be difficult to discern from CRBSI. Based on expert clinical review, 57% of CLABSI cases were judged ambiguous and 62.5% favored contamination. Based on WGS, 6 of 14 (43%) were determined to be due to contamination.

WGS of microbes has been extensively applied to clinical diagnostics, research, and epidemiological surveillance. This study showed that WGS was useful for the identification of STs of S. epidermidis and defined ST2 as being the most common sequence type in our isolate population. The ST2 sequence type has previously been noted to be responsible for ongoing nosocomial transmission.WGS was useful in more precisely defining genetic relatedness and demonstrating intra-patient and inter-patient strain variability. In some instances, identical strains were found from different patients (potentially indicating nosocomial acquisition) while in others, different strains were found in cultures from the same patient (more likely indicating blood culture contamination).

Disparities between the surveillance CLABSI definition, strain relatedness as determined by WGS, and review by clinical experts were noted in this study. Prior studies indicated considerable strain variation in S. epidermidis that made up the human skin microbiome. Therefore, this study suggested that WGS determination of different strains of S. epidermidis derived from multiple peripheral blood cultures or CVC/peripheral cultures was indicative of culture contamination and excluded CRBSI. Similarly, finding genetically identical strains of S. epidermidis in paired blood cultures favored the diagnosis of CRBSI. In 3 of 14 (21%) cases of CLABSI (patients 1, 7, and 14), clinical review favored the diagnosis of blood culture contamination or less likely CRBSI, which was excluded by WGS. In 1 instance (7%, patient 5), clinical review favored CRBSI diagnosis which was contradicted by finding disparate strains on WGS.

### CLABSI rates in immunocompromised patients: a valuable patient centered outcome? [^1175kDrv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The accepted approach to surveillance for hospital-acquired bloodstream infection (HABSI) due to central venous catheters requires use of the National Health and Safety Network (NHSN) definition for catheter-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). In this commentary, we discuss our experience with the application of current NHSN surveillance definitions for CLABSI and the impact that public reporting of CLABSI rates in settings with a high prevalence of special populations has on infection prevention (IP) programs. For IP programs to serve the continuous improvement needs of their organizations, surveillance methodologies need to accurately capture the burden of preventable HABSI among immunocompromised individuals with inherent risk for infection. Current NHSN CLABSI definitions lack specificity for complex and heterogeneous patient populations and require modification. Beyond definitions, IP programs must critically assess the value of their current approach to surveillance to assure that patient-centered outcomes are the focus of prevention efforts.

### Prevention of vascular catheter-related bloodstream infections [^1145h8az]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) are responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and excess health care costs. It is increasingly evident that many CRBSI can be prevented with current knowledge and techniques. Preventive measures can be broadly grouped into clinical practice-based interventions and technologic innovations. Clinical practice-based interventions require changes in human behavior and can be subdivided into interventions before and at the time of insertion and postinsertion. Despite recent successes with prevention of CRBSI, pertinent questions regarding pathogenesis and prevention remain unanswered and work on improved surveillance, devices less prone to infection, and more effective prevention techniques are needed.

### Utilizing whole genome sequencing to characterize central line-associated bloodstream infections due to… [^111a5CKJ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are linked with morbidity, mortality, and increased healthcare costs.CLABSIs are publicly reported and are often used as a metric for hospital safety, quality, and reputation. Owing to its ecological niche as a commensal organism of human skin, Staphylococcus epidermidis is a prominent cause of infection of vascular catheters and blood culture contamination. To reconcile these issues, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition of CLABSI due to commensal skin microbes requires recovery of these organisms from at least 2 blood cultures, the presence of a central venous catheter (CVC), and lack of evidence of an explanatory infection at an alternative site. Catheter-related BSI (CRBSI) is a clinical definition that requires additional corroborating evidence such as local signs of infection, cultures of vascular catheter tips revealing the same organism as blood cultures, or a shorter time to positive culture (> 2 h earlier) from blood obtained via the incriminated vascular catheter compared to peripheral blood (differential time-to-positivity, DTP).

A CRBSI is presumed due to a single strain of bacteria, and thus organisms recovered from the peripheral blood, the CVC, and the catheter tip should all be identical.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) can be used to determine the genetic identity of an organism and allows precise definition of genetic relatedness of one strain of bacteria to another, helping to differentiate between true cases of CRBSI and blood culture contamination.

Although the overall CLABSI rate decreased at our hospital from 2018 to 2023, the proportion of CLABSI caused by S. epidermidis increased from 27% to 55%. This shift may be attributable to effective CLABSI prevention efforts that decreased CLABSIs caused by other organisms, but we hypothesized that at least some of the CLABSIs were caused by repeated blood culture contamination. We utilized WGS to help characterize S. epidermidis CLABSI and to compare the genetic relationship with a clinical assessment of whether they were likely CRBSI.

### The insertion site is the main risk factor for central venous catheter-related complications in patients with hematologic malignancies [^115xGSnE]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Central venous catheters (CVC) placed either via the internal jugular vein (IJV) or the subclavian vein (SCV) are routinely used in patients with hematologic malignancies. In this retrospective study, we systematically compared CVC-associated complications for both insertion sites, IJV and SCV. Between January 2011 and June 2013, all consecutive patients (n = 87) were included with at least one CVC (n = 153; n = 94 IJV; n = 59 SCV) at our institution due to induction/consolidation for AML/ALL or autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Primary study endpoints were central line-associated (CLABSI), catheter-related (CRBSI) blood stream infections and local inflammation (LI) at the insertion site. CRBSI occurred earlier and more frequently in the IJV- versus the SCV-group with an incidence rate of CRBSI at day 15 of 10% versus 0% (p = .04) and a rate of CRBSI per 1000 CVC days of 5.7 versus 1.2. In addition, CLABSI was detected more often in IJV- compared to SCV-CVC (26% vs. 8%, p = .009). Conversely, LI occurred more frequently and earlier in SCV- versus IJV-CVC (88% vs. 56%, p < .0001) with a median time to LI of 9 versus 14days (p < .0001). The strongest risk factor for the endpoints CRBSI, CLABSI, and LI was the insertion site. However, SCV insertion was a risk factor for LI (p = .001, HR: 2.0), insertion in the IJV a risk factor for CLABSI (p = .044, HR: 2.7) and CRBSI (p = .036, HR: 5.4). These results demonstrate a differential effect of the insertion site of CVC in neutropenic patients with a significantly reduced frequency of CVC-related blood stream infections in SCV-CVC.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^112eBPcv]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Section 4: Recommended strategies to prevent CLABSI

Recommendations are categorized as either (1) essential practices that should be adopted by all acute-care hospitals or (2) additional approaches that can be considered in locations and/or populations within hospitals when CLABSIs are not controlled by use of essential practices. Essential practices include recommendations in which the potential to affect CLABSI risk clearly outweighs the potential for undesirable effects. Additional approaches include recommendations in which the intervention is likely to reduce CLABSI risk but there is concern about the risks for undesirable outcomes, recommendations for which the quality of evidence is low, recommendations in which cost-to-benefit ratio may be high, or recommendations in which evidence supports the impact of the intervention in select settings (eg, during outbreaks) or for select patient populations. Hospitals can prioritize their efforts by initially focusing on implementation of the prevention strategies listed as essential practices. If CLABSI surveillance or other risk assessments suggest ongoing opportunities for improvement, hospitals should consider adopting some or all of the prevention approaches listed as additional approaches. These can be implemented in specific locations or patient populations or can be implemented hospital-wide, depending on outcome data, risk assessment, and/or local requirements. Each infection prevention recommendation is given a quality of evidence grade (see Table 2).

Essential practices for preventing CLABSI recommended for all acute-care hospitals

Some of the following measures have been combined into a "prevention bundle" that focuses on catheter insertion. Numerous studies have documented that use of such bundles is effective, sustainable, and cost-effective in both adults and children.– Bundles are most likely to be successful if implemented in a previously established patient safety culture and their success depends on adherence to individual measures. However, data suggests that not all components of bundles may be necessary to achieve an effect on CLABSI rates. After catheter insertion, maintenance bundles have been proposed to ensure optimal catheter care. More data are needed to determine which components of the maintenance bundle are essential in reducing risk.

### Comparing success rates in central venous catheter salvage for catheter-related bloodstream infections in adult patients on home parenteral nutrition: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113oNpjF]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Definitions and outcomes

CRBSI definitions

CRBSI

Based on the IDSA definition: positive blood cultures from catheter blood drawn from the catheter and a peripheral vein with a ratio of ≥ 3:1 (CVC vs. peripheral); and a differential period of CVC culture versus peripheral blood culture positivity of 2 h. Alternatively, and as per IDSA guidelines, a CRBSI was defined when the same organism was grown from ≥ 1 percutaneous blood culture and from the catheter tip.

Central line–associated bloodstream infection

This was defined based on the CDC guidelines. At least 1 of the following criteria should be present: 1) positive blood culture from a known pathogen, or 2) positive blood cultures from common skin commensal organisms and symptoms of infection with no other potential source of infection. Studies with stricter criteria than central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), such as positive blood cultures from both catheter and peripheral vein, were categorized as CLABSI because they were broad enough to meet CLABSI criteria but not strict enough to meet the CRBSI criteria.

No standard criteria

Studies that did not provide a proper definition or reference to a standard definition for infectious catheter-related complications were categorized as "no standard criteria".

Catheter salvage

1) Catheter salvage rate

Defined by CVC status (retained or removed), clinical resolution, and no recurrence within 30 d of the previous CRBSI date.

2) Overall successful catheter salvage

Calculation of catheter salvage rates, including all CRBSI cases (regardless of the reason for removal), according to Tribler et al.

3) Successful catheter salvage attempt rate

Calculation of catheter salvage rates, including only attempted catheter salvage cases according to protocol and/or guidelines.

Recurrence

Recurrence was defined as any new CRBSI with the same microbial species and a comparable antibiogram occurring within 30–90 d of the previous CRBSI date. Recurrence data beyond 90 d were not extracted (unless representing the only measure of recurrence), because recurrence beyond this point is considered unlikely to be significantly influenced by the primary treatment.
New infection was defined as any new CRBSI with a different microbial species or different antibiograms from the former infection.

### Diagnostic stewardship to improve patient outcomes and healthcare-associated infection (HAI) metrics [^116xq1Zp]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Other challenges with CLABSI are technological advances in the detection of organisms causing bloodstream infection using molecular and other non–culture-based tests (NCTs). There is concern that CLABSI reporting could become a barrier to adoption of more sensitive diagnostics, which otherwise hold promise for more rapid and accurate detection of BSI. To address this concern, the NHSN CLABSI definition has been adjusted so if a non–culture-based test identifies a pathogen, but a blood culture drawn within 2 days before or 1 day after the non–culture-based test is negative, only the results of the blood culture will be used to make a BSI determination. This allows the laboratory to introduce non–culture-based tests that are more sensitive without changing NHSN CLABSI rates, provided they continue to perform blood cultures in parallel. The final value of non–culture-based tests remains to be determined. Although non–culture-based tests may have higher sensitivity, they cannot always discriminate true infection from contamination or from detection of nonviable organisms. As diagnostic technology improves, it is important that pressure to reduce HAI rates does not prevent laboratories from adopting advances that otherwise improve patient care.

Although patient-centered diagnostic stewardship of blood culturing is the best approach to patient care, potential metric-focused strategies that bypass diagnostic stewardship, such as avoiding blood cultures in favor of empiric treatments, could reduce CLABSI rates but are not recommended because of the potential for patient harm. The harms associated with these mostly theoretical testing practices are similar to those for other HAIs: delayed diagnoses, unnecessary treatment, adverse events, antimicrobial resistance, and undetected pathogen transmission.

Like CAUTI and HO-CDI, the CLABSI definition presents opportunities for improvement. The CDC NHSN plans to introduce a new surveillance definition that may eventually replace or complement CLABSI. This metric is hospital-onset bloodstream infections (HO-BSI) with the goal to expand prevention opportunities and further improve patient safety. Hospital-onset bacteremia broadens our prevention perspective to all HO-BSI and not only the small subset (< 10%) of HO-BSI that are CLABSI. As with the CLABSI definition described above, the impact of adopting more sensitive non–culture-based tests on HO-BSI could be ameliorated by preferentially using the results of blood cultures obtained in a specific time interval around the non–culture-based test.

Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

CLABSI events and outcomes during the COVID-19 period

In total, 219 CLABSI events occurred between March and August 2020; of these, 52 (24%) occurred in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Also, 2 additional patients were identified with COVID-19 after their CLABSI event. The average time to CLABSI from COVID-19 diagnosis was 18.0 days (median, 15.0). During the 6 months evaluated during the pandemic, 18,048 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were admitted to the 76 of the 78 hospitals (with available data on patient-based COVID-19 prevalence), constituting 5.1% of all admissions. Proportionately, COVID-19 patients had > 5 times more CLABSI events than non–COVID-19 patients. A significant difference was observed in mortality between patients with CLABSI for those with COVID-19 (28 of 52, 53.8%) and without COVID-19 (40 of 167, 24.0%) during that period (P < .001).

Microbiology associated with CLABSIs and CAUTIs

Overall, 344 organisms were associated with CLABSI events and 535 for CAUTI events in the 12 months before the COVID-19 pandemic, while 236 organisms were associated with CLABSI events and 237 organisms were associated with CAUTI events during the 6 months during the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 4). Gram-positive CLABSIs increased by 80.6% from 0.27 to 0.48 events per 1,000 line days (P < .001). Specifically, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus CLABSIs increased by 130% from 0.07 to 0.17 events per 1,000 line days (P < .001), and Candida spp infections increased by 56.9% from 0.14 to 0.21 per 1,000 line days (P = 0.01). We did not observe any significant changes between the 2 periods for organisms associated with CAUTIs.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^116CgUVU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 25 — CRBSI or bacteremia specifies that patients with suspected catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) should have blood cultures obtained from the CVC and peripheral source (dialysis circuit ± peripheral veins), and broad-spectrum antibiotics that treat both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms should be initiated immediately. Due to the high prevalence of methicillin-resistant S aureus, empiric therapy should include coverage for methicillin-resistant S aureus and be guided by local infection rates, antibiotic sensitivities, and dialysis center policies. Once the final organism and sensitivities are identified, patients should receive long-term antibiotic treatment according to the CDC or IDSA guidelines, for 4 to 6 weeks for uncomplicated S aureus.

### Source control in bloodstream infections in patients with sepsis, septic shock, or requiring ICU admission: a scoping review with recommendations for standardizing research [^113FiBAU]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The predominance of catheter removal studies, particularly in candidemia and Gram-positive BSI, is problematic due to inconsistent source identification. In 29 studies (38%), SC was defined as catheter removal regardless of BSI source, ignoring whether the catheter was the infection focus. This approach, common in candidemia studies (92% of such studies), stemmed from the risk of CVC colonization by Candida's biofilm and was supported by the 2009 IDSA candidiasis guidelines which recommended routine CVC removal in candidemia. In the following years Garnacho et al. showed that CVC removal was protective only in proven catheter-related candidemia, while Damonti et al. highlighted that catheter retention may reflect withdrawal of care and be a consequence rather than the cause of unfavorable outcome in candidemia. The 2016 IDSA updated guidelines advised removal only for presumed catheter sources, while a 2019 ESICM/ESCMID candidiasis statement emphasized early adequate SC without mandating routine catheter removal in candidemia. This shift reflects growing recognition that routine catheter removal may not benefit all candidemia patients, particularly when the catheter is not the confirmed source. Nearly half of the studies attributing BSI to a catheter before investigating removal used a CLABSI definition, which only infers the catheter as the likely source, rather than the CRBSI definition, which requires microbiological confirmation (e.g. catheter tip cultures or differential time to positivity). This reliance on CLABSI definitions risks misattributing BSI sources, potentially leading to unnecessary catheter removals and overlooking other infection sources. Accurate source identification is critical, as demonstrated by Bavaro et al. who showed that a multistep bundle including source-finding imaging and targeted SC reduced day-28 mortality in Gram-negative BSI. Similarly, Holmbom et al. found that timely radiologic diagnosis and decompression improved outcomes in urosepsis requiring SC. Klein Klouwenberg et al. further showed that when systematically defined, classifying infection sources from chart review was reliable and reproducible. These findings emphasize that precise identification of the BSI source, is essential for effective SC and improved sepsis outcomes. Standardizing source identification protocols in future studies, such as adopting CRBSI criteria for catheter-related infections or integrating imaging-based source-finding, could enhance the validity of SC interventions and their reported outcomes.

### A clinical practical approach to the surveillance definition of central line-associated bloodstream infection in cancer patients with mucosal barrier injury [^114Ab6qa]. American Journal of Infection Control (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently introduced the concept of mucosal barrier injury (MBI) in an attempt to recognize the possibility of a gastrointestinal source for certain bloodstream infections. This could underestimate the central venous catheter (CVC) as the source of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) in cancer. The definition of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) by the Infectious Diseases Society of America is a more specific and stringent definition that identifies the CVC as the source of infection. In our study, we compared the 2 definitions in cancer patients.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 149 CLABSI cases that occurred at our center between January 2013 and March 2014 who had 2 simultaneously positive blood cultures drawn from the CVC and peripheral site or concurrent paired tip and blood cultures.

Results

Of the 149 patients with CLABSI, only 70 (47%) had definite CRBSI. CRBSI was identified more commonly in non-MBI CLABSI cases than MBI CLABSI (69% vs 18%, P < .0001).

Conclusions

The CRBSI definition may be more accurate in identifying the catheter as the source of bloodstream infection in patients with MBI. Because CRBSI continues to occur in patients with MBI, we caution against excluding all MBI patients from CLABSI surveillance.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI): the urgent need to refocus on hardwiring prevention efforts [^1179z5kN]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disruptive effect on the US healthcare system, resulting in an abrupt drop in admissions for most common conditions and leading to a selective increase in severity of illness among hospitalized patients. As a large US health system with 78 hospitals, we report our experience and the outcomes related to 2 devices: central lines and urinary catheters. Our data show differing impacts of COVID-19 on the CDC NHSN–defined rates of CLABSI and CAUTI events. Based on central-line days, CLABSI rates increased by more than two-thirds within the ICUs, whereas the events per 10,000 patient days almost doubled. Recent studies have reported large increases in CLABSI eventsand a higher likelihood for secondary bloodstream infections in COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care. In an attempt to reduce healthcare worker exposure to patients and to preserve personal protective equipment, the frequency of contact with patients may have changed during the pandemic. Moreover, patients admitted during the pandemic were more likely to require critical care support and to need it for a longer period of time, potentially putting them at greater risk for CLABSI. The proportion of COVID-19 patients with CLABSI events was 5 times greater than for non–COVID-19 patients during the pandemic period. Additionally, the average time from COVID-19 diagnosis to developing CLABSI was ∼18 days, indicating that the CLABSI events occurred in COVID-19 patients with prolonged hospitalization. Although the increases in CLABSI events did not reach statistical significance in non–ICUs, we expect that similar challenges in infection prevention were encountered.

### Risk factors for catheter-related bloodstream infections in a high-risk cancer patient population [^1156wLmW]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study identifies leading risk factors for CRBSI in cancer patients including allogenic transplant, neutropenia, multiple catheters, blood product administration, BMI > 30 kg/m², and PICC lines inserted in superficial basilic/cephalic vein, while jugular insertion was protective. Notably, 32.5% and 71.0% of all CRBSIs occurred at 4 and 16 weeks, respectively, following CVC insertion. Our findings have significant clinical implications for the management and prevention of CRBSI in high-risk cancer patients.

A unique feature of this current study is the use of the strict IDSA definition of CRBSI, to determine its risk factors in patients with LCVC. Unlike previous studies that relied on the broader CLABSI definition, which often overattributes infections in cancer patients with hematologic malignancies or transplants to vascular catheters rather than the gut where it mostly originates from, our approach, using the strict definitions, allows us to identify risk factors for true CRBSI.

Our study showed a rapid increase in CRBSI cases following LCVC insertion, from 2% at 2 weeks to 32.5% at 8 weeks and 71% at 16 weeks. A meta-analysis study showed that catheterization beyond 2 weeks was an independent risk factor for CLABSI in ICU patients. This rapid increase in CRBSI reflects the natural progression from catheter colonization to CRBSI. Safdar and Makidemonstrated that short-term catheters colonization is extraluminal, reduced by chlorhexidine application at insertion site, while LCVC infections originate from the catheter hub and lumen, with increasing risk from frequent catheter hub interceptions and excessive blood products administration. Previous studies showed that lock solutions and antimicrobial catheters could prevent intraluminal colonization and CRBSI in patients with LCVC.

### Characterizing the relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and assessing the impact of a nursing-focused CLABSI reduction intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114dsM3P]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this patient-level analysis of patients with CLABSI with and without COVID-19, we observed a significantly higher CLABSI rate in patients with COVID-19, particularly in the ICU. Compared to historical controls, the CLABSI rate did not increase in non–COVID-19 patients, which suggests that the increase in CLABSI risk is likely related to factors associated with their COVID-19 diagnosis. A focused, hospital-wide quality improvement initiative significantly reduced CLABSI rates in non–COVID-19 patients, but the impact on CLABSI rates in COVID-19 patients was minimal. Additionally, COVID-19 CLABSI rates appeared to increase during times of high COVID-19 census both before and after the intervention.

Our analysis showed patient-level differences in the COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 CLABSIs that may partially explain this trend. Compared to the non–COVID-19 CLABSI cohort, COVID-19 CLABSI patients had more comorbidities and markers of critical illness: they were older, were more likely to be diabetic, were more likely to have any ICU stay, were more likely to use an arterial line use, and were far more likely to be in the ICU at the time of CLABSI.

To isolate the effect of critical illness, we performed the secondary analysis of pandemic period COVID-19 versus non–COVID-19 ICU CLABSIs, and surprisingly, we detected an even higher rate of COVID-19 CLABSI and a higher relative risk. Additionally, when comparing the patient-level characteristics between the ICU CLABSI cohorts, most of the differences observed in the primary analysis resolved, including line type, organism distribution, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, and mortality. Quite clearly, critical illness and ICU status alone do not fully explain the high COVID-19 ICU CLABSI rate.

Catheter removal studies

As shown in Table 2, 46 of the included studies (60%) focused on catheter removal as the only SC intervention. Of these, 20/46 (43%) investigated intravascular catheter-associated BSI, including 7/46 (15%) that reported BSI of multiple different sources but analyzed SC only for catheter sources. Of those 11/20 (55%) used a CRBSI definition, 8/20 (40%) a CLABSI definition and one did not specify how they identified catheter-associated BSI. Among the 29/46 (63%) studies defining SC as catheter removal regardless of BSI source, 10/29 (31%) reported on patients with a range of BSI sources, 3/29 (10%) only catheter sources – one using a CRBSI and two a CLABSI definition — and 13/29 (45%) did not report BSI sources.

Studies of candidemia

As shown in Table 1, 36 of the included studies (47%) investigated candidemia. Compared to the full cohort, candidemia studies were more likely to not report BSI sources (42% vs. 2%), and more often used the entire cohort as the denominator for SC rates (69% vs. 27%) rather than limiting to patients requiring SC (25% vs. 66%). In candidemia studies, SC was more frequently defined as catheter removal regardless of source (67% vs. 5%). Studies using this SC definition predominantly focused on candidemia (92% vs. 24% for other SC definitions).

### Choice of needleless connector technology as a risk reduction strategy for catheter related bloodstream infection, mortality, and cost: a secondary data analysis [^112CpCTc]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

The impact of COVID-19 on international CLABSI rates was severe. During the pandemic years CLABSI rates in ICUs in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East increased approximately 16% compared to 2019; 76% in 21 Brazilian hospitals; 86% hospitals in seven hospitals in seven International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) developing countries; and 47% in > 3400 U.S. National Healthcare Safety Networks (NHSN) hospitals.

With the conviction that CLABSI is preventable, the 2022 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' National Action Plan set a goal to reduce CLABSI by 40% in ICUs and general wards by 2028. Clinicians will depend on evidence-based guidelines to drive practice change and outcome improvement efforts. These guidelines rely heavily on medical device technologies such as antimicrobial dressings, securement devices, disinfection caps, lock flush solutions, etc. for the prevention of intraluminal and extraluminal sources of CRBSI. – Needleless connectors (NC), originally developed for healthcare worker needlestick prevention, have long been challenged regarding their potential role in the risk of CRBSI. Over 30 NC technologies (NCT) with varying device designs are currently marketed globally with no evidenced-based recommendation for choosing one device over another for maximum protection against microbial ingress, infection, and occlusion.

A recent prospective, clinically simulated in vitro experimental study compared 20 different NCs to quantify differences in bacterial transfer and biofilm formation. This study was controlled by utilizing two daily staphylococcus aureus inoculations of the septum, a common intermittent intravenous treatment schedule with 18 accesses per day over 5 days, and no disinfection of the connector septum prior to access. Eight different design factors were analyzed for their contribution to intraluminal biofilm and bacterial transfer in the flush. The two Clave technologies Neutron™ and MicroClave™ (ICU Medical, San Clemente, CA) had the lowest mean bacterial transfer in the flush, except for SafeTouch™ (Nipro, Osaka, Japan) and SafeAccess™ (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) NCs (p ⩾ 0.05) compared to the other 16/20 NCs (p < 0.05) The results support the hypothesis that a discriminating choice of NC is a critical component of a CLABSI risk reduction strategy.

Despite recent gains, intravascular catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) remains an important clinical problem resulting in significant morbidity, mortality, and excess economic cost. Successful prevention of CRBSI requires careful attention to insertion and maintenance protocols as well as judicious application of innovative technologic advancements. Appropriate treatment of CRBSI depends on a well-considered diagnosis, correct antimicrobial choice, removal of the offending device in many circumstances, and careful patient selection and application of antimicrobial lock therapy in patients in whom catheter salvage is attempted.

### A systematic review of central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) diagnostic reliability and error [^116eCHe8]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To establish the reliability of the application of National Health and Safety Network (NHSN) central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) criteria within established reporting systems internationally.

Design

Diagnostic-test accuracy systematic review.

Methods

We conducted a search of Medline, SCOPUS, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL (EbscoHost), and PubMed (NCBI). Cohort studies were eligible for inclusion if they compared publicly reported CLABSI rates and were conducted by independent and expertly trained reviewers using NHSN/Centers for Disease Control (or equivalent) criteria. Two independent reviewers screened, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS 2 tool. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values were analyzed.

Results

A systematic search identified 1,259 publications; 9 studies were eligible for inclusion (n = 7,160 central lines). Publicly reported CLABSI rates were more likely to be underestimated (7 studies) than overestimated (2 studies). Specificity ranged from 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58–0.81) to 0.99 (95% CI, 0.99–1.00) and sensitivity ranged from 0.42 (95% CI, 0.15–0.72) to 0.88 (95% CI, 0.77–0.95). Four studies, which included a consecutive series of patients (whole cohort), reported CLABSI incidence between 9.8% and 20.9%, and absolute CLABSI rates were underestimated by 3.3%-4.4%. The risk of bias was low to moderate in most included studies.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest consistent underestimation of true CLABSI incidence within publicly reported rates, weakening the validity and reliability of surveillance measures. Auditing, education, and adequate resource allocation is necessary to ensure that surveillance data are accurate and suitable for benchmarking and quality improvement measures over time.

Catheter-related bloodstream infection

Question

What is the most effective approach and antibiotic therapy for the management of CRBSI?

Recommendation

Effective management of CRBSI involves timely diagnosis, prompt removal of vascular access if at all possible (source control), and appropriate antibiotic therapy for 7–14 days depending on the causative microorganism, as shown in table 3. Vancomycin plus a beta-lactam (such as piperacillin-tazobactam or a ceftazidime) is usually a good empiric regimen if the risk of ESBL is not high. Reference to the local antibiogram and hospital recommendations is recommended for the selection of empiric therapy.

Table 3
Summary of antibiotic durations for common ICU infections

Discussion

The diagnosis of CRBSI should be distinguished from secondary bacteremia due to other sources. Surveillance cultures for patients with central lines are not recommended when CRBSI is not suspected such as in an asymptomatic patient and should not be done when other cultures are more appropriate to evaluate for the clinically suspected infection (eg, respiratory cultures for a suspected pneumonia).

The choice of antibiotic therapy should be based on local susceptibility patterns and the severity of illness and should be de-escalated when culture data become available. The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy is 7 days for coagulase-negative staphylococci, 7 days for Gram-negative bacilli,14 days for S. aureus (unless a complicated infection is present); and 14 days for Candida (in the absence of retinitis or risk factors for it, as described in the 'Bacteremia' section). Examples of when a S. aureus infection is considered complicated include endocarditis, osteomyelitis, foreign body or implant, metastatic infection, low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), immunocompromise, and recurrent infection. An infectious disease consultation should be sought in S. aureus CRBSI.

The management described here applies to non-tunneled lines. When a CRBSI is suspected, the central line should be removed. Catheter salvage options when the line cannot reasonably be removed are beyond the scope of this text.

### Characterizing the relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and assessing the impact of a nursing-focused CLABSI reduction intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic [^111idRBJ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

This study had several limitations. Study design, by necessity, was a nonexperimental retrospective review of events that unfolded during a pandemic; thus, the environment was not controlled. SARS-CoV-2 testing, therapeutics, healthcare worker perceptions of risk, and some infection control practices changed over time, especially early in the pandemic response. Another limitation was the lack of objective data on bedside catheter insertion or maintenance practice during the early months of the pandemic because audits were deferred due to redirection of infection control resources.

Our data demonstrate that patients hospitalized for COVID-19 are at significantly higher risk of developing a CLABSI than other patients, particularly in the ICU setting. Reasons for this increased risk are likely multifactorial, including both patient-specific and process-related issues. Focused quality improvement efforts were effective in reducing CLABSI rates in non–COVID-19 patients, but they were less effective in COVID-19 patients. More research is needed to better characterize the relationship between the COVID-19 census and COVID-19 CLABSI, to better understand the specific risk factors associated with CLABSI in COVID-19 patients, and to determine which measures may be more effective in reducing this risk.

Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The quality-improvement intervention was primarily focused on data feedback to all areas and targeted line rounds in the COVID-19 ICU, focused on maintenance. Although we achieved significant reductions in non–COVID-19 CLABSI, we detected no significant effect on the rate of COVID-19 CLABSI, the target of the line rounds. Whereas Moss et aldemonstrated success in reducing COVID-19 CLABSI in an ICU over 2 months using audits and maintenance bundles, our experience was fundamentally different due to the number of patients in our COVID-19 ICU, the size of our institution, and the breadth of our postintervention follow-up across 11 months and 2 distinct infection surges. Although the improvement observed in non–COVID-19 CLABSI rates reflects the impact of interventions on the general patient population, the minimal improvement in COVID-19 CLABSI, despite the focused rounds, is concerning. Possible explanations include unique issues with this population not addressed by the intervention, including some that may have been exacerbated by times of high COVID-19 census, particularly the surge in November 2020–February 2021, when almost all of these CLABSIs occurred.

Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

There has been speculation that a redirection of infection prevention work to focus on COVID-19 during the pandemic led to the national increases in CLABSI. Our data do not support this hypothesis. We were able to maintain stable and low CLABSI rates in the non–COVID-19 population throughout the pandemic, and the COVID-19 CLABSI rate was persistently high even after redirection of infection control and nursing resources to CLABSI prevention with the quality-improvement intervention.

The analysis has several notable strengths. This study was conducted at a large hospital with pre-existing robust CLABSI prevention efforts and low baseline CLABSI rates. We were the first hospital in Los Angeles to admit a patient with COVID-19, with large numbers of admissions and high acuity throughout the pandemic, allowing a large sample size of COVID-19 CLABSI for a single center. Numerous analyses of the increase in CLABSI have been conducted since the start of the pandemic, but this is the first to examine both the patient-level impact of the diagnosis of COVID-19 on CLABSI rates, as well as the effect of a targeted reduction intervention. These findings will lay the groundwork for further analysis of COVID-19 CLABSI causality and explorations of prevention strategies.

Additional approaches for preventing CLABSI

Several additional approaches are currently available for use. Perform a CLABSI risk assessment before considering implementation of any of these approaches, taking potential adverse events and costs into consideration. Although it is reasonable to evaluate the utility of technology-based interventions when CLABSI rates are above the institutional- or unit-based threshold, this is also an opportunity to review practices and consider behavioral changes that may be instituted to reduce CLABSI risk. These additional approaches are recommended for use in locations and/or populations within the hospital with unacceptably high CLABSI rates despite implementation of the essential CLABSI prevention strategies listed above. These measures may not be indicated if institutional goals have been consistently achieved.
Use antiseptic- or antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs (Quality of Evidence: HIGH in adult patients,– and MODERATE in pediatric patients,) The risk of CLABSI is reduced with some currently marketed antiseptic-impregnated (eg, chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine) catheters and antimicrobial-impregnated (eg, minocycline-rifampin) catheters. Use such catheters under the following conditions: Hospital units or patient populations have a CLABSI rate above institutional goals despite compliance with essential CLABSI prevention practices. Some evidence suggests that use of antimicrobial CVCs, along with other preventive technologies, may have no additional benefit in patient care units that have already established a low incidence of catheter infections. Patients have limited venous access and a history of recurrent CLABSI. Patients are at heightened risk of severe sequelae from a CLABSI (eg, patients with recently implanted intravascular devices such as a prosthetic heart valve or aortic graft). Monitor patients for adverse effects such as anaphylaxis. Many studies investigating antimicrobial-impregnated catheters were performed before infection preventive bundles were routine. Whether such catheters have an impact on CLABSI in such settings remains unknown.
Use antimicrobial lock therapy for long-term CVCs (Quality of Evidence: HIGH)– Antibiotic and antiseptic locks are created by filling the lumen of the catheter with a supratherapeutic concentration of an antibiotic solution and leaving the solution in place until the catheter hub is re-accessed. Such an approach can reduce the risk of CLABSI. The optimal antimicrobial agent or combination of agents, their concentration, and duration of lock therapy are matters of ongoing research. Due to concerns regarding the potential for the emergence of resistance in exposed organisms, use antimicrobial locks as a preventative strategy for the following: Patients with long-term hemodialysis catheters who have a history of recurrent CLABSI. Prophylaxis for patients with limited venous access and a history of recurrent CLABSI. Patients who are at heightened risk of severe sequelae from a CLABSI (eg, patients with recently implanted intravascular devices such as a prosthetic heart valve or aortic graft). To minimize systemic toxicity, aspirate rather than flush the antimicrobial lock solution after the dwell time has elapsed. – The potential of adverse effects associated with ethanol locks should be carefully considered before use.
Use recombinant tissue plasminogen activating factor (rt-PA) once weekly after hemodialysis in patients undergoing hemodialysis through a CVC (Quality of Evidence: HIGH)
Utilize infusion or vascular access teams for reducing CLABSI rates (Quality of Evidence: LOW), Studies have shown that an infusion/vascular access team responsible for insertion and maintenance of peripheral intravenous catheters reduces the risk of bloodstream infections; however, few studies have been performed regarding the impact of intravenous therapy teams on CLABSI rates.
Use antimicrobial ointments for hemodialysis catheter insertion sites (Quality of Evidence: HIGH) – Apply polysporin "triple" (where available) or povidone-iodine ointment to hemodialysis catheter insertion if compatible with the catheter material. Ingredients in ointments may interact with the chemical composition of some catheters. Thus, ensure the selected ointment will not interact with the catheter material before any such product is applied to the catheter insertion/exit site. For example, ointments containing glycol should not be applied to insertion/exit sites of polyurethane catheters. Mupirocin ointment should not be applied to the catheter insertion site due to the risks of facilitating mupirocin resistance and the potential damage to polyurethane catheters.
Use an antiseptic-containing hub/connector cap/port protector to cover connectors (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) – The utility of routinely disinfecting hub connectors and ports when using antiseptic-containing hub/connector cap/port protectors is unknown.

KDOQI 2019 vascular access — catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) goal for central venous catheters (CVC) highlights infection as a major complication and defines achievable benchmarks. The 2 most significant complications of CVC use are CVC dysfunction and CVC-related infection, especially CRBSI. Evidence demonstrates that prophylactic measures can significantly reduce infection rates and that a target CRBSI rate of 1.5 or fewer infections/1,000 CVC days is possible; a target CRBSI of ≤ 1.5/1,000 CVC days would be considered achievable. Reported facility-specific bloodstream infection rates range 0.38–0.88 BSI per 100-patient years, and the pooled mean BSI for CVC among facilities reporting was 4.2 per 100 patient months, equivalent to 1.38/1,000 CVC days. Programs should strive to have risk reductions for CRBSI of 22% to 60% to help achieve this target.

Implementation considerations highlight standardized use of CRBSI definitions among dialysis providers to ensure consistent reporting and allow comparisons, and future research priorities include validating CRBSI diagnostic criteria and further validation studies including exit site and tunnel infections in HD patients.

### Comparison of total hospital-acquired bloodstream infections to central line-associated bloodstream infections and implications for outcome measures in infection control [^115LXFfA]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2013). Low credibility.

The validity of the central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) measure is compromised by subjectivity. We observed significant decreases in both CLABSIs and total hospital-acquired bloodstream infections (BSIs) following a CLABSI prevention intervention in adult intensive care units. Total hospital-acquired BSIs could be explored as an adjunct, objective CLABSI measure.

### Characterizing the relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and assessing the impact of a nursing-focused CLABSI reduction intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114mu5wy]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Non–COVID-19 ICU CLABSI and prepandemic ICU CLABSI

We found no significant difference between the prepandemic ICU CLABSI rate and the non–COVID-19 ICU CLABSI rate (0.9 vs 0.6; P = 0.2586) (Supplementary Table). The patients with ICU CLABSI in the prepandemic period were older (68 vs 52 years; P = 0.0346) and more likely to have dementia (24% vs 0%; P = 0.0446), whereas pandemic period non–COVID-19 ICU CLABSIs were more likely attributed to femoral catheters (0% vs 33%; P = 0.0096). We found no significant differences in CLABSI rates, median central-line duration, or organisms observed (gram-positive, gram-negative, or Candida).

COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 CLABSIs before and after the quality-improvement intervention

After implementation of the quality-improvement intervention, the COVID-19 CLABSI rate did not show a significant decrease from 5.11 to 4.56 (P = 0.6804), whereas the non–COVID-19 CLABSI rate decreased significantly from 0.97 to 0.43 (P = 0.0034) (Fig. 1). We did not detect a significant difference between the prepandemic CLABSI rate and the non–COVID-19 CLABSI rate before the intervention. In both the pre- and postintervention periods, the COVID-19 CLABSI rate increased during and immediately after months of higher COVID-19 census. Variation in the non–COVID-19 CLABSI rate did not appear to be correlated with COVID-19 census.

Comparing monthly COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 CLABSI rates with inpatient COVID-19 census. COVID-19 CLABSI rates trended higher during and immediately after months of high COVID-19 inpatient census both before and after implementation of a quality improvement project.

Comparing patient characteristics before and after the quality-improvement initiative, we found no relevant statistically significant differences (Supplementary Table).

Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In our primary analysis, we compared COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 CLABSI rates (infections per 1,000 catheter days) and patient characteristics for all admitted patients. To control for any baseline changes to our non–COVID-19 CLABSI population, we performed a secondary comparison of non–COVID-19 CLABSIs with all CLABSIs in the prepandemic period. Due to the predominance of ICU CLABSIs in the COVID-19 CLABSI cohort, we also performed secondary analyses for ICU CLABSIs. We compared COVID-19 ICU CLABSIs with non–COVID-19 ICU CLABSI and non–COVID-19 ICU CLABSIs with all ICU CLABSIs in the prepandemic period. Due to very small numbers, we did not perform a subanalysis of non-ICU COVID-19 CLABSIs. Lastly, we compared all COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 CLABSIs during the pandemic period before and after the implementation of a CLABSI-reduction quality-improvement initiative.

### Do antimicrobial-impregnated central venous catheters prevent catheter-related bloodstream infection? [^11777P1n]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Controversy surrounds the role of central venous catheters (CVCs) impregnated with antimicrobial agents in the prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). We reviewed the current literature to evaluate the efficacy of antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs for preventing CRBSI. Eleven randomized studies published in article form were identified that included a control group that received nonimpregnated CVCs. We evaluated study methodologies, inclusion of key patient characteristics, use of clinically relevant end points, and molecular-relatedness studies. Review of these 11 trials revealed several methodological flaws, including inconsistent definitions of CRBSI, failure to account for confounding variables, suboptimal statistical and epidemiological methods, and rare use of clinically relevant end points. This review also failed to demonstrate any significant clinical benefit associated with the use of antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs for the purpose of reducing CRBSI or improving patient outcomes. More rigorous studies are required to support or refute the hypothesis that antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs reduce the rate of or prevent CRBSI.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI): the urgent need to refocus on hardwiring prevention efforts [^117Kk5NA]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a considerable impact on US healthcare, straining hospital resources and operations. By early December 2020, COVID-19 hospitalizations accounted for ∼14.5% of occupied inpatient beds. Caring for COVID-19 patients requires more complex processes from diagnostic to safety measures, and it places tremendous pressure on healthcare workers, from staffing challengesto risk of exposure and infection. In addition, the inpatient population has changed, with a precipitous drop in elective surgical casesand an avoidance of patients being admitted for other medical conditions resulting in a higher case mix index (CMI) among our patient populations. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients often required close monitoring and higher levels of care, including ventilatory and critical care support.

Hospital-onset healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are key quality and safety metrics publicly reported in the acute-care space and linked to hospital reimbursement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). National efforts have been successfully implemented to reduce central-line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) CLABSI and CAUTI outcomes in 78 hospitals of a large, multistate, healthcare system in the United States. Particularly, we examined changes in device utilization, CLABSI and CAUTI events, the associated microbiology of these infections, and the impact on outcomes reflected by the NHSN standardized infection ratio.

### Characterizing the relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and assessing the impact of a nursing-focused CLABSI reduction intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114jwnxC]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective:

To examine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on CLABSI rate and characterize the patients who developed a CLABSI. We also examined the impact of a CLABSI-reduction quality-improvement project in patients with and without COVID-19.

Design:

Retrospective cohort analysis.

Setting:

Academic 889-bed tertiary-care teaching hospital in urban Los Angeles.

Patients or participants:

Inpatients 18 years and older with CLABSI as defined by the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).

Intervention(s):

CLABSI rate and patient characteristics were analyzed for 2 cohorts during the pandemic era (March 2020–August 2021): COVID-19 CLABSI patients and non–COVID-19 CLABSI patients, based on diagnosis of COVID-19 during admission. Secondary analyses were non–COVID-19 CLABSI rate versus a historical control period (2019), ICU CLABSI rate in COVID-19 versus non–COVID-19 patients, and CLABSI rates before and after a quality- improvement initiative.

Results:

The rate of COVID-19 CLABSI was significantly higher than non–COVID-19 CLABSI. We did not detect a difference between the non–COVID-19 CLABSI rate and the historical control. COVID-19 CLABSIs occurred predominantly in the ICU, and the ICU COVID-19 CLABSI rate was significantly higher than the ICU non–COVID-19 CLABSI rate. A hospital-wide quality-improvement initiative reduced the rate of non–COVID-19 CLABSI but not COVID-19 CLABSI.

Conclusions:

Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 have a significantly higher CLABSI rate, particularly in the ICU setting. Reasons for this increase are likely multifactorial, including both patient-specific and process-related issues. Focused quality-improvement efforts were effective in reducing CLABSI rates in non–COVID-19 patients but were less effective in COVID-19 patients.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^117XW4Z5]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) in hemodialysis (HD) patients — KDOQI 2019 defines CRBSI as clinical manifestations and at least 1 positive blood culture result from a peripheral source (dialysis circuit or vein) and no other apparent source, with either positive semiquantitative (> 15 CFU/catheter segment, hub or tip) or quantitative (> 10² CFU/catheter segment, eg, hub or tip) culture, whereby the same organism (species and antibiogram) is isolated from the catheter segment (eg, hub or tip) and a peripheral source (dialysis circuit or vein) blood sample. Other guidelines also diagnose CRBSI by differential time to positivity defined as the blood culture from the CVC hub turning positive at least 2 hours before the peripheral blood culture, though feasibility is limited because quantitative blood cultures are not routinely available in clinical practice (ie, limited to research settings), and the differential time to positivity criteria has been found to be met in less than one third of cases.

### Bacterial transfer and biofilm formation in needleless connectors in a clinically simulated in vitro catheter model [^116f1iUC]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The CDC recommends NC exchange at least every 96 hours or according to the manufacturer's instructions. Our analyses support this, given the high levels of biofilm on the NC, hub, and catheter lumen by 72 hours. However, our study also demonstrates that some NCs require more frequent exchanges, given that some NCs allow more bacteria through the connecter over time compared to others. Even after 5 days, bacterial counts in the flush among some NCs never reached the high levels that were observed after 24 hours in other NCs (Fig. 5 A). The substantial differences in the daily bacterial transfer rate and the increase in bacteria over time for some NC types warrant reconsideration of NC exchange recommendations. However, it is important to note that NC replacement does not affect biofilm in the hub or catheter, as these distal components will continue to harbor biofilm.

Current IDSA Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend culturing long-term catheter insertion site and hub to rule out the catheter as the infection source for CRBSIs, but this is rarely practiced due to the complexity and risk of obtaining hub cultures. In a series of studies, researchers investigated the efficacy of insertion-site skin cultures and NC flush sonication cultures in the diagnosis of CRBSI to show that the combination of skin culture and NC quantitative cultures (> 1,000 CFU/connector) can be used to rule out catheter colonization and CRBSI. Our results support these findings because NC biofilm was the best predictor of bacterial transfer in the flush. Moreover, in our study, MicroClave, Clave Neutron, SafeTouch and SafeAccess NCs generated substantially lower rates of bacterial transfer. This finding may explain a reduced relative risk of CLABSI in hospitals using Clave technologies compared to hospitals using other NCs.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^1136C87o]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

CLABSI prevention — unresolved issues: Routine use of needleless connectors as a CLABSI prevention strategy before an assessment of risks, benefits, and education regarding proper use remains unresolved, with multiple devices currently available but the optimal design for preventing infections unresolved and clinical evidence limited regarding risk reduction with their routine use or other antimicrobial catheter connectors; unresolved issues also include surveillance of other types of catheters (eg, peripheral arterial or venous catheters).

### Is it possible to achieve a target of zero central line associated bloodstream infections? [^116wHYfY]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Central venous catheter (CVC)-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) result in poorer patient outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Reduced reimbursement for CLABSI events is now provided for hospitalized patients in the United States. Although a zero target is proposed, the feasibility has not been evaluated. The objective of this review is to identify factors contributing to CLABSI and determine whether current evidence supports attainment of a zero infection rate.

Recent Findings

Limitations of current surveillance methods and reporting of aggregate data impact on achieving target CLABSI rates. Standard prevention practices, including physician and patient preparation (e.g. hand hygiene), are frequently incorporated into bundles of care. CVC dwell time has been identified as means of risk stratification. Additional strategies (e.g. chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings, antimicrobial-coated devices) may be better used in patients with expected long dwell times. Non-ICU populations are increasingly targeted with prevention strategies, but expected rates of infection have not been proposed.

Summary

A zero CLABSI rate should be the target only for ICU populations having CVCs with a dwell time of 1–9 days following aseptic insertion. Additional measures should be reserved for patients with expected longer dwell time. Refinement and validation of surveillance methodology is required before target CLABSI rates can be proposed for non-ICU populations.

### Guidelines for the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections: recommendations relevant to interventional radiology for venous catheter placement and maintenance [^114gXcY9]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Catheter insertion site selection — risk considerations for infection and thrombosis emphasize that the density of skin flora at the catheter insertion site is a major risk factor for catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI); no single trial has satisfactorily compared infection rates for catheters placed in jugular, subclavian, and femoral veins; internal jugular placement has usually been associated with higher risk for colonization and/or CRBSI than subclavian placement; femoral catheters in adults have high colonization rates compared with subclavian and internal jugular sites and, in some studies, higher rates of CLABSIs; femoral catheters are also associated with a higher risk for deep vein thrombosis than internal jugular or subclavian catheters; infection risk with femoral placement may be accentuated in obese patients; in adult patients, a subclavian site is preferred for infection-control purposes although other factors should be considered; and catheters should be inserted far from open wounds because burn wound overlap of the 2.5-cm area surrounding the insertion site was associated with catheters being 1.79 times more likely to be colonized and 2.15 times more likely to be associated with bacteremia.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^114gHoSZ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Essential practices for preventing CLABSI recommended for all acute-care hospitals highlight that some measures have been combined into a prevention bundle focusing on catheter insertion, with numerous studies documenting that such bundles are effective, sustainable, and cost-effective in both adults and children; bundles are most likely to succeed when implemented within a previously established patient safety culture and success depends on adherence to individual measures, and data suggests that not all components of bundles may be necessary.

Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Secondary analyses

Non–COVID-19 CLABSI versus prepandemic CLABSI. We found no significant difference between the prepandemic CLABSI rate and the non–COVID-19 CLABSI rate (0.62 vs 0.63; P = 0.9655) (Supplementary Table). Compared to the prepandemic period, the patients in the pandemic period with non–COVID-19 CLABSI were younger (63 vs 53 years; P = 0.0092), were more likely to have femoral catheters (0% vs 23%; P = 0.0013) and had lower catheter utilization (0.73 vs 0.57 catheter/patient days; P < .0001). We found no significant differences Charlson comorbidity index scores, median central-line duration, time to CLABSI, or organism categories.

COVID-19 ICU CLABSI and non–COVID-19 ICU CLABSI

In the pandemic period, the COVID-19 ICU CLABSI rate was 6.31, compared to a non–COVID-19 ICU CLABSI rate of 0.60 (relative risk of CLABSI, 10.5; P < .0001) (Table 2). We detected no difference in age, sex, hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, time to CLABSI, or mortality. Patients with ICU COVID-19 CLABSI were more likely to have diabetes and less likely to have moderate-to-severe liver disease. Unlike the larger cohort, the organism breakdown and use of long-term catheters were similar between the ICU CLABSI cohorts, though the non–COVID-19 ICU CLABSI cohort had a higher rate of femoral catheter and pulmonary-artery catheter use. Arterial line at the time of the CLABSI diagnosis was again more frequent in COVID-19 CLABSI patients (96% vs 53%; P < .0001), as was the central-line utilization ratio (0.65 vs 0.45; P < .0001).

### A comparison of national healthcare safety network surveillance definitions to physician review for central-line-associated bloodstream infections [^1163wgQG]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

A central-line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is a healthcare-associated infection resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. CLABSIs are strictly defined by surveillance rules of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Although the NHSN surveillance definitions have been internally validated in multiple studies, few studies have assessed their external validity. We assessed the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the NHSN definitions against a gold standard of physician review of hospital-onset bloodstream infections (BSIs) with eligible central lines at our institution. We have described the drivers of any discrepancies between the surveillance and clinical designations as well as the implications of these discrepancies on the reporting of quality metrics and opportunities for infection prevention.

### Diagnosing and reporting of central line-associated bloodstream infections [^116v3Z1e]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) is often controversial, and existing guidelines differ in important ways.

Objective

To determine both the range of practices involved in obtaining blood culture samples and how central line-associated infections are diagnosed and to obtain members' opinions regarding the process of designating bloodstream infections as publicly reportable CLABSIs.

Design

Electronic and paper 11-question survey of infectious-diseases physician members of the Infectious Diseases Society of America Emerging Infections Network (IDSA EIN).

Participants

All 1,364 IDSA EIN members were invited to participate.

Results

692 (51%) members responded; 52% of respondents with adult practices reported that more than half of the blood culture samples for intensive care unit (ICU) patients with central lines were drawn through existing lines. A sizable majority of respondents used time to positivity, differential time to positivity when paired blood cultures are used, and quantitative culture of catheter tips when diagnosing CLABSI or determining the source of that bacteremia. When determining whether a bacteremia met the reportable CLABSI definition, a majority used a decision method that involved clinical judgment.

Conclusions

Our survey documents a strong preference for drawing 1 set of blood culture samples from a peripheral line and 1 from the central line when evaluating fever in an ICU patient, as recommended by IDSA guidelines and in contrast to current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations. Our data show substantial variability when infectious-diseases physicians were asked to determine whether bloodstream infections were primary bacteremias, and therefore subject to public reporting by National Healthcare Safety Network guidelines, or secondary bacteremias, which are not reportable.

### Bloodstream infections and central line-associated bloodstream infections [^116p8LHX]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

It is estimated that more than 575,000 individuals develop bloodstream infections (BSI) annually in North America, accounting for nearly 80,000 deaths. Central line-associated BSI (CLABSI) is a major contributor to the cost of health care. Although primary BSI may be seen by the surgeon, a secondary BSI is more likely to be encountered, especially CLABSI. Prompt identification of the source of infection in patients with secondary BSI is paramount. This practice allows early source control and initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, with subsequent improvement in outcomes. An understanding of evidence-based preventative measures and bundles is important.

Conclusions

Using the largest dataset ever collected from four multi-centric RCTs conducted with consistent catheter care, we showed that local signs were clearly associated with infections in short-term catheters in the ICU. In the first 7 days of catheter maintenance, local signs increased the probability to observe CRBSI.

### Review of strategies to reduce central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) in adult ICUs [^114dTC8u]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) are costly and morbid. Despite evidence-based guidelines, Some intensive care units (ICUs) continue to have elevated infection rates. In October 2015, we performed a systematic search of the peer-reviewed literature within the PubMed and Cochrane databases for interventions to reduce CLABSI and/or CAUTI in adult ICUs and synthesized findings using a narrative review process. The interventions were categorized using a conceptual model, with stages applicable to both CAUTI and CLABSI prevention: (stage 0) avoid catheter if possible, (stage 1) ensure aseptic placement, (stage 2) maintain awareness and proper care of catheters in place, and (stage 3) promptly remove unnecessary catheters. We also looked for effective components that the 5 most successful (by reduction in infection rates) studies of each infection shared. Interventions that addressed multiple stages within the conceptual model were common in these successful studies. Assuring compliance with infection prevention efforts via auditing and timely feedback were also common. Hospitalists with patient safety interests may find this review informative for formulating quality improvement interventions to reduce these infections.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^1113JMj8]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Section 3: Background on prevention of CLABSI

Summary of existing guidelines and recommendations

Several governmental, public health, and professional organizations have published evidence-based guidelines and/or implementation aids regarding the prevention of CLABSI including the following: Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Making Health Care Safer American Pediatric Surgical Association, Outcomes and Clinical Trials Committee The Joint Commission APIC, Implementation Guide to Preventing Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections Infusion Nurses Society, Infusion Nursing Standards of Practice
The recommendations in this document focus on CVCs unless noted otherwise. These recommendations: Are not stratified based on the type of catheter (eg, tunneled, implanted, cuffed, non-cuffed catheter, dialysis catheter). May not be applicable in their entirety for prevention of bloodstream infections with other intravascular devices.

Infrastructure requirements

Facilities undertaking CLABSI interventions should have the following elements in place:
An adequately staffed infection prevention and control program responsible for identifying patients who meet the surveillance definition for CLABSI.
Infection prevention staff and, preferably, information technology support to collect and calculate catheter days as a denominator when computing rates of CLABSI and patient days to allow calculation of CVC utilization. Catheter days from information systems should be validated against a manual method, with a margin of error no greater than ± 5%. –
Resources to provide appropriate education and training.
Adequate laboratory support for timely processing of specimens and reporting of results, as specified by the supervisor of the surveillance program.

Among patients with PICCs, CRBSI events included central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) in accordance with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Healthcare Safety Network criteria of laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection (BSI) with a PICC in place for at least 48 hours without another identified source of BSI or physician documentation of catheter line sepsis, catheter-related bacteremia/fungemia, or PICC removal due to suspected CLABSI. Among those with midline catheters, CRBSI was defined as laboratory-confirmed BSI with a midline catheter in place and no other identified source of BSI or physician documentation of catheter line sepsis, catheter-related bacteremia/fungemia, or midline catheter removal due to suspected CRBSI. CR-VTE included symptomatic image-confirmed upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis and symptomatic image-confirmed pulmonary embolism.

The secondary outcomes were minor complications (eg, catheter dislodgement, occlusion, tip migration, infiltration, superficial thrombophlebitis, and exit site concerns [including leaking, discharge, or infection]) and device failure, which was defined as removal of the device because of any complication. We chose this composite secondary outcome because (1) premature removal is a meaningful end point for both patients and clinicians and (2) device complications are often competing events where the occurrence of a complication (eg, occlusion) may influence the probability of another (eg, phlebitis). Thus, using premature device removal as a distinct end point better encapsulates clinical impact of these events. We used validated, published definitions to capture and record all major and minor complications.

### Choice of needleless connector technology as a risk reduction strategy for catheter related bloodstream infection, mortality, and cost: a secondary data analysis [^113jctvc]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The use of NCT is designated as an "unresolved issue" in current standards and recommended CLABSI reduction strategies. The more recent awaited research to evaluate microbial ingress and intraluminal biofilm formation found statistically significant differences among the 20 NCs studied, therefore some NCT are likely to be of greater risk for CLABSI than others. This precludes an all-inclusive recommendation for all NCT as a risk or as a preventive measure and points to the need for critical evaluation of design features in the selection process.

While CLABSI prevention requires a combination of evidenced-based strategies, we found that the cautious choice of an NC is a critical component of infection prevention bundles. The present study supports the incorporation of Clave NCT as an evidence-based strategy to significantly reduce the risk of CLABSI and mortality with substantial cost savings, especially when used as the primary NC throughout the facility.

### Closed intravenous systems for central vascular access: a difference maker for CLABSI rates in neonates? [^115no3qW]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2023). Medium credibility.

Nine ECC line characteristics, reason for insertion, catheter details and type, insertion technique, number of insertion attempts, blood vessels inserted, side of the body, octyl-butyl-cyanoacrylate glue applied, reason for removal, and dwell time was analyzed to determine which factors were associated with a diagnosis of CLABSI (Table 1). Only one factor, dwell time was associated with the occurrence of CLABSI (p = 0.04). These findings suggest that when consistent, standardized evidence-based practices are robustly adhered to ECC line characteristics, except for dwell time, have no significant independent association with CLABSI.

Table 1.
The association between IV characteristics and having CLABSI.

In contrast, the introduction of the closed IV administration set was associated with decreased CLABSI rates (Table 2 and Figure 3). During the 9 months of closed IV administration sets a monthly CLABSI rate of 0.22/1000 catheter days was determined. In comparison, during preceding 9 months (legacy set) the monthly CLABSI rate was 2.87/1000 catheter days. Statistical analysis using the Mann-Whitney U-test demonstrates a significant difference between the legacy set and advanced closed set CLABSI complication rates (Table 2). The CLABSI events (p = 0.031) and the CLABSI rate per 1000/days (p = 0.040) during the use of the closed set are significantly less than the rates observed while the legacy set was in use. The data includes a significantly greater number of advanced closed set CL days than legacy set CL days (p = 0.040).

Occurrence of CLABSI during the study period pre- and post-introduction of the closed IV set.

Based on the regression analysis results in Table 3, we reject the null hypothesis that the IV set used, legacy or advanced closed set, has no significant association with CLABSI (p -value = 0.000). These results suggest that the advanced closed set had a statistically significant effect on reducing the incidence of CLABSI.

CENTRAL LINE-ASSOCIATED BLOODSTREAM INFECTIONS

CLABSIs continue to increase morbidity, mortality, and costs. Like other HAIs, CLABSIs significantly increased in 2020 and 2021. The updated guideline to prevent CLABSIs in acute-care hospitals has now been published. As with the 2014 document, bathing intensive care (ICU) patients more than 2 months with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), using maximum barrier for insertion, using an alcohol CHG preparation for site preparation and maintenance, and ensuring adequate nurse-to-patient ratio in the ICU remained essential practices in the 2022 update. The role of CHG bathing among patients in non-ICU settings was considered unclear despite several good studies. The first was a randomized-cluster trial, which reported a significant reduction in device-associated bacteremia in the CHG-bathing group. Studies in adult hematology patients also suggest similar reductions. Under essential practices, the guideline now promotes the subclavian vein as the preferred site for insertion. The 2014 document recommended avoiding the femoral site, which is still valid, but the 2022 update only states the subclavian site is the preferred site to reduced infection when the catheter is placed in the ICU setting (HIGH). In non-ICU settings, the risk of infection between the different sites is unclear. The use of ultrasound for catheter placement is now classified as HIGH based on additional studies. The use of chlorhexidine-containing dressings is now part of essential practice (HIGH) for patients over 2 months of age instead of a special approach from the 2014 edition. Lastly, the new document now recommends routine replacement of sets not used for blood, blood products, or lipids can be changed up to 7 days instead of 4 days (HIGH).

Under additional approaches, the use of antimicrobial ointment for hemodialysis catheters has been moved to additional practices as this is a recommendation for a special population (HIGH). Antiseptic caps remain an additional approach (MODERATE), as they are not considered better than traditional manual disinfections if done properly, which remains an essential practice.

### Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) basics… [^112Yy52o]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Central line-associated bloodstream infections occur when germs enter the bloodstream through a central line.
- CLABSIs are preventable. Central lines A central line is a catheter that healthcare providers often place in a large vein in the neck, chest or groin. Central lines are different from peripheral IVs; central lines access a major vein close to the heart, can remain in place for weeks or months, and are much more likely to be a source of serious infection. Central lines are commonly used in intensive care units. Purpose of central lines
- Give medicines for treatment of pain, infection or other medical issues.
- Provide fluids or nutrition.
- Help conduct certain medical tests. Types Types of central lines Peripherally inserted central catheter. Placed into a vein in the arm.

Tunneled catheter. Passed under the skin and placed into a vein in the chest or neck. Providers can insert medicine right into the catheter. Implanted port. Surgically placed under the skin. Providers insert medicines using a needle placed through the skin into the catheter. An implanted port is not as visible as a tunneled catheter, does not require as much daily care, and does not get in the way of a patient's regular activities as much as a PICC line or a tunneled catheter might. Healthcare providers use the type that is best for each patient's care. Signs and symptoms People with CLABSIs may experience:

- Fever
- Red skin and soreness around the central line Causes CLABSIs occur when germs enter the bloodstream through the central line. What CDC is doing

### Safety of mid-thigh exit site venous catheters in multidrug resistant colonized patients [^114Dc5TK]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venous catheters inserted in superficial femoral vein and with mid-thigh exit site have emerged as a feasible and safe technique for central or peripheral tip's venous access, especially in agitated, delirious patients. The spread of multidrug-resistant bacterial (MDR) strains is an emerging clinical problem and more and more patients are being colonized by these types of bacteria. The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) or catheter related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) in mid-thigh catheters in patients with positive rectal swabs to evaluate the safety of this procedure and the real infection risk.

Methods

In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed data on patients with mid-tight catheters inserted from May 2021 to November 2022. All surveillance rectal swabs were recorded. In addition, to collect data on CLABSI and CRBSI, the results of all blood and catheter tip cultures performed during the hospital stay were acquired.

Results

Six hundred two patients were enrolled, 304 patients (50.5%) had a rectal swab; 128 (42.1%) swabs were positive for MDR. Nine CLABSI (only two in patients with a positive rectal swab) and three CRBSI were detected. No statistical difference in the absolute number of CLABSI and CRBSI and in the number of infections per 1000 catheter days emerged between the overall population and patients with positive rectal swabs (respectively p = 0.45 and p = 0.53). Similarly, no statistical difference in the number of CLABSI and CRBSI was found among patients with a negative swab and patients with a positive one (respectively p = 0.43 and p = 0.51).

Conclusions

According to our data, cannulation of the superficial femoral vein represents a safe location in patients with positive rectal swabs.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI): the urgent need to refocus on hardwiring prevention efforts [^111rPCDr]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

An integral risk-reduction strategy for CLABSI is anchored in the optimal maintenance of the device. In the prepandemic period, CLABSI prevention strategies were hardwired at our hospitals leading to a dSIR of 0.58, which outperformed the national CDC NHSN CLABSI dSIR of 0.69 for 2019. The pandemic likely affected both the care of the line for COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Qualitative feedback from infection prevention teams reported changes to routine CLABSI prevention practices in ICUs, such as less universal decolonization (eg, mupirocin administration and chlorhexidine bathing), alterations in line care due to intravenous pumps placed in hallways (eg, extension tubing used and less bedside checks on lines), line and dressing integrity gaps related to prone positioning of patients, opportunities in scrub-the-hub compliance, and increases in line draws for blood cultures. Another variable potentially impacting CLABSI outcomes includes staffing changes responding to increased patient volume on the units, such as the help of traveling clinicians not as familiar with standard unit prevention practices. Lastly, during the pre–COVID-19 period, "line rounds" were a routine practice, ensuring that proper device selection, utilization, and bedside practices were being followed. The teams reported that many of those rounds stopped during the COVID-19 pandemic period due to competing priorities. On the other hand, with the less intense needs for indwelling urinary catheter device care, nominal changes in practice were reported, with the exception of some reports of increases in pan-culturing for febrile patients.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^111tEmak]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Risk factors for CLABSI emphasize device presence and patient populations: "Patients at risk for CLABSI in acute-care facilities are those with a CVC in place". In the ICU, "The risk of CLABSI in ICU patients is high", with reasons including "the frequent insertion of multiple catheters… the use of specific types of catheters… and the fact that catheters are frequently placed in emergency circumstances, repeatedly accessed each day, and often needed for extended periods". For non-ICU settings, "most CLABSIs occur in hospitalized patients in units outside the ICU or in outpatients". Prevention efforts "should include other vulnerable populations such as patients receiving hemodialysis through catheters, intraoperative patients, and oncology patients". Beyond CVCs, "short-term peripheral catheters, peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs), midline catheters, and peripheral arterial catheters also carry a risk of infection". Independent risk factors "in at least 2 published studies" include "Prolonged hospitalization before catheterization", "Prolonged duration of catheterization", "Heavy microbial colonization at insertion site", "Heavy microbial colonization of the catheter hub", and "Multilumen catheters".

Outcome measures (See Table 4)

CLABSI rate: Use NHSN definitions. Numerator: Number of CLABSIs in each unit assessed (using NHSN definitions). Denominator: Total number of catheter days in each unit assessed (using NHSN definitions). Multiply by 1,000 so that the measure is expressed as number of CLABSIs per 1,000 catheter days.
Risk adjustment: Stratify CLABSI rates by type of patient-care unit. – Report comparisons based on historic data and NHSN data, if available. Use the NHSN device standardized infection ratio (dSIR) to evaluate hospital and unit CLABSI rates. dSIR: Observed CLABSI events divided by predicted CLABSI events based on actual device days. Consider measures that address device risk at the patient population level. A population SIR (pSIR)accounts for both device SIR and SUR, reflecting both the care of the device, and interventions to reduce utilization. pSIR: Observed CLABSI events divided by predicted CLABSI events based on predicted device days.

CLABSI Prevention Outcome Measures

External reporting

Many challenges exist in providing useful information to consumers and other stakeholders and in preventing unintended consequences of public reporting of HAIs. Recommendations for public reporting of HAIs have been provided by the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC), the Healthcare-Associated Infection Working Group of the Joint Public Policy Committee, and the National Quality Forum.

State and federal requirements

Hospitals in states that have mandatory reporting requirements for CLABSI must collect and report the data required by the state.
For information on state and federal requirements, contact your state or local health department.

External quality initiatives

Hospitals that participate in external quality initiatives or state programs must collect and report the data required by the initiative or the program.
Problems with interrater reliability may affect comparisons between different institutions.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI): the urgent need to refocus on hardwiring prevention efforts [^111yZkYK]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition to the increases in the occurrence of CLABSI during the pandemic, we observed changes in the microbiology associated with these events. Gram-positive–associated CLABSIs increased by > 80% during the pandemic period, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus –associated CLABSIs more than doubled. This change may indicate the increased risk for line infection and contamination due to suboptimal aseptic practices while obtaining blood cultures in a stressful environment. The CDC NHSN definition of CLABSIincludes common commensal organisms identified in 2 or more blood cultures in the presence of at least fever, chills, and/or hypotension, and no other related site of infection. The classification may overestimate CLABSI in the setting of a high contamination rate in a severely ill population. A higher incidence of blood culture contamination with commensal organisms, particularly coagulase negative staphylococci, has been reported in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Another noteworthy observation was the increase in Candida spp–associated CLABSIs. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial pressure and prolonged use of central lines may contribute to higher candidemia risk. We did not find increases in gram-negative CLABSIs.

Our CAUTI findings differed from those for CLABSI. During the pandemic, we did not witness an increase in CAUTI events. The CDC NHSN definition of CAUTIincludes the identification of no more than 2 organisms with a quantitative culture of > 100,000 colony-forming units per milliliter, in the presence of focal findings or fever. In addition, it excludes candiduria from the definition. The NHSN CAUTI definition is more dependent on culturing practices and the preexisting prevalence of bacteriuria and is less susceptible to device maintenance. - Plausible explanations for these findings include different hospitalized patient populations (more COVID-19; fewer surgical and elective admissions), increases in antimicrobial use resulting in the suppression of bacteriuria, and a reduction in inappropriate triggers to ordering urine cultures (eg, urine color or turbidity)in an effort to minimize contact between healthcare workers and patients.

### Bundle approach used to achieve zero central line-associated bloodstream infections in an adult coronary intensive care unit [^112Tnmmo]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

CLABSIs are a serious but preventable healthcare-associated infection. Using a multifaceted approach that includes multidisciplinary teams that follow an evidence-based, bundled approach resulted in a significant reduction in CLABSI rates in an ICU setting. We will continue to assess new interventions/preventions as guided by infection-control teams and the recent literature to sustain the gains already achieved.

### Implementing and validating a home-infusion central-line-associated bloodstream infection surveillance definition [^113GhiLk]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The surveillance staff at each agency required extensive training and support in application of the definition, which may limit generalizability. We recently described the need for ongoing education in those performing home-infusion surveillance, such as through modification of pre-existing resources through the CDC and national organizations, development of new resources, or peer-learning collaboratives, and in training in accessing data. Finally, in home infusion therapy, patients with BSIs are typically cared for in hospitals and not in the home, so the agencies themselves were infrequently involved in blood-culture decisions. Hospitals to which home-infusion patients may be admitted may differ in their blood-culture practices.

We performed the first validation study of a home-infusion CLABSI surveillance definition and found that the definition was valid, feasible, and acceptable. CLABSIs in this setting occur at a lower rate than in acute-care hospitals. In addition, differences between using an NHSN approach to secondary BSIs and an HiOB approach had minimal impact on infection rates or validity, suggesting that each of these approaches may be acceptable and that agencies may choose which approach works best for their setting. System-level supports, such as training in surveillance and better integration of EHRs, would be helpful. Additional research should investigate acceptability of the definitions among other stakeholders (eg, leadership or frontline staff) as well as larger-scale validation of the definitions and use this definition to test CLABSI prevention interventions. National implementation of the home-infusion CLABSI definition would provide critical surveillance data to motivate and inform efforts to prevent CLABSIs in home infusion therapy.

### Comparison of rates of central line-associated bloodstream infections in patients with 1 vs 2 central venous catheters [^1168prre]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Given the financial stakes, attributes of performance metrics related to CLABSI should be evaluated to ensure that facilities are being compared fairly. To be effective, performance metrics should be reliable and objective. A comparative metric should account for differences between facilities regarding patient risk for infection that are host-related and unrelated to actual performance of infection prevention. Although efforts to improve the NHSN CLABSI performance metrics have focused on standardized case ascertainment and adjustment for comorbidities, we contend that current NHSN methods for quantifying the risk period (ie, the denominator as specified by NHSN protocols) is flawed; the denominator currently reflects the sum of person–time at risk for CLABSI as central line–days (CLDs) incompletely.

Current risk adjustment only accounts for the category of patient location (eg, surgical intensive care unit, medical intensive care unit), hospital size (ie, number of licensed beds), and medical school affiliation. The output of this model is then multiplied by the number of CLDs to determine the number of expected CLABSIs. Currently, NHSN defines CLDs as the sum of patients on each day at a specified time with any CVC present; for example, 1 patient with 2 CVCs on 1 day counts as 1 CLD. However, a patient requiring more than 1 CVC at the same time (ie, concurrent CVC use) is likely to be at greater risk of CLABSI than a patient requiring only a single CVC. If concurrent CVC use confers substantial additional risk for CLABSI, NHSN risk adjustment methods could be improved to allow more fair comparisons when calculating a performance metric among facilities caring for patients for whom concurrent CVC use is a medical necessity more often than their peer facilities. To evaluate the increased risk of a patient with more than 1 CVC, we used a multiyear, multihospital data set and 2 statistical approaches to define the risk associated with concurrent CVC use on CLABSI incidence.

### The clinical impacts and risk factors for non-central line-associated bloodstream infection in 5046 intensive care unit patients: an observational study based on electronic medical records [^113sr334]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have identified that both NBSIs (as a whole) and CLABSIs were associated with poor clinical outcomes, including LOS in hospital, healthcare costs, and mortality. The prolonged LOS in ICU of CLABSIs varied from 10 to 20 days, excess costs of CLABSIs from $3700 to $39,000, and the increased mortality of CLABSIs from 4 to 37%. These ranges contained the excess outcomes of N-CLABSIs in this study. However, few studies have estimated the difference in the clinical outcomes between N-CLABSIs and CLABSIs. Our study showed that N-CLABSIs had similar poor outcomes with CLABSIs. N-CLABSI was indeed a significant independent risk factor for each of the outcomes of ICU patients according to this study. Therefore, N-CLABSI should be paid more attention to than previous, especially in ICU patients.

Most previous studies focus on CLABSI with a probable reason that CLABSI has better preventability. However, the preventability of N-CLABSI is still uncertain. The risk factors for N-CLABSI in this study were significantly different from those for CLABSI. These factors provide possibilities to prevent N-CLABSIs. Measures that could prevent pathogens from entering the bloodstream directly from the wounds or could control or prevent the infectious factors could be possible prevention strategies for N-CLABSI. For example, timely hemostasis for gastrointestinal bleeding; aseptic techniques for wound management, operation, and intravascular catheters; treating the primary infections; and preventing HAIs could be effective for preventing N-CLABSI in ICU patients. IAI (including ICU-acquired IAI) with aOR 8.37 and HAIs other than BSI, pneumonia, and IAI with aOR 3.89 were the strongest two independent risk factors for N-CLABSI. This suggests more necessity to prevent HAIs.

### Quantitative results of a national intervention to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infection: a pre-post observational study [^115JJJmE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) remains prevalent in hospitals in the United States.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of a multimodal intervention in hospitals with elevated rates of health care-associated infection.

Design

Pre-post observational evaluation of a prospective, national, clustered, nonrandomized initiative of 3 cohorts of hospitals.

Setting

Acute care, long-term acute care, and critical access hospitals, including intensive care units and medical/surgical wards.

Participants

Target hospitals had a cumulative attributable difference above the first tertile of performance for Clostridioides difficile infection and another health care-associated infection (such as CLABSI). Some hospitals that did not meet these criteria also participated.

Intervention

A multimodal intervention consisting of recommendations and tools for prioritizing and implementing evidence-based infection prevention strategies, on-demand educational videos, webinars led by content experts, and access to content experts.

Measurements

Rates of CLABSI and device utilization ratio pre- and postintervention.

Results

Between November 2016 and May 2018, 387 hospitals in 23 states and the District of Columbia participated. Monthly preimplementation CLABSI rates ranged from 0 to 71.4 CLABSIs per 1000 catheter-days. Over the study period, the unadjusted CLABSI rate was low and decreased from 0.88 to 0.80 CLABSI per 1000 catheter-days. Between the pre- and postintervention periods, device utilization decreased from 24.05 to 22.07 central line-days per 100 patient-days. However, a decreasing trend in device utilization was also observed during the preintervention period.

Limitations

The intervention period was brief. Participation in and adherence to recommended interventions were not fully assessed. Rates of CLABSI were low. Patient characteristics could not be assessed.

Conclusion

In hospitals with a disproportionate burden of health care-associated infection, a multimodal intervention did not reduce rates of CLABSI.

The paradoxical relationship between standardized infection ratio and standardized utilization ratio for catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) in contrast to central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), in addition to CAUTI definition challenges, incentivizes hospitals to focus their prevention efforts on urine culture stewardship rather than catheter avoidance and care.

CLABSI prevention — essential practices after insertion: Ensure appropriate nurse-to-patient ratio and limit use of float nurses in ICUs; use chlorhexidine-containing dressings for CVCs in patients over 2 months of age; for non-tunneled CVC in adults and children, change transparent dressings and perform site care with a chlorhexidine-based antiseptic at least every 7 days or immediately if the dressing is soiled, loose, or damp, and change gauze dressings every 2 days or earlier if soiled, loose, or damp; disinfect catheter hubs, needleless connectors, and injection ports before accessing the catheter; remove nonessential catheters; routine replacement of administration sets not used for blood, blood products, or lipid formulations can be performed at intervals up to 7 days; and perform surveillance for CLABSI in ICU and non-ICU settings.
