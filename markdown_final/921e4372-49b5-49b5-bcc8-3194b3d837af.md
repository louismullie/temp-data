## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how GLP-1 receptor agonists compare to insulin in the management of type 2 diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and where these agents fit in the treatment paradigm. Then, I should compare glycemic efficacy head-to-head and in combination. Next, I will examine weight effects, hypoglycemia risk, and cardiorenal outcomes. After that, I need to review safety and tolerability, including gastrointestinal effects and rare risks. I will then consider patient-specific factors such as baseline A1c, obesity, and comorbidities. Finally, I should align the synthesis with current guideline recommendations and close with practical clinical takeaways and a concise conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and positioning. GLP-1 receptor agonists and insulin are both injectable therapies typically considered after metformin and lifestyle measures fail to achieve targets, but they have distinct mechanisms and risk–benefit profiles; insulin directly replaces endogenous insulin, whereas GLP-1 RAs augment endogenous insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent fashion, suppress glucagon, slow gastric emptying, and reduce appetite, which helps explain differences in hypoglycemia and weight effects [^116NmXym] [^115C63cJ]. Hold on, I should verify the guideline stance: contemporary ADA Standards recommend GLP-1 RAs as the preferred first injectable in most adults with T2DM without clear insulin deficiency, reserving insulin for severe hyperglycemia or insulin-deficient states, and emphasizing combination therapy when insulin is used to improve glycemia while mitigating weight gain and hypoglycemia [^114HqfbD] [^111vBSgY] [^115C63cJ].

> Now, I will examine glycemic efficacy head-to-head. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of A1c reduction: meta-analyses show that once-weekly GLP-1 RAs such as dulaglutide and exenatide LAR can achieve greater A1c reductions than basal insulin, with pooled differences around −0.31% to −0.39% favoring GLP-1 RAs, whereas once-daily liraglutide and twice-daily exenatide are generally noninferior to basal insulin rather than superior [^117AceaW] [^114MR2p6]. I should double-check the broader comparative data: network meta-analyses and large comparative reviews indicate that GLP-1 RAs and insulin are among the most potent glucose-lowering classes, with GLP-1 RAs often achieving comparable or greater A1c lowering than basal insulin in many settings, particularly when baseline A1c is not extremely high [^116z9z6q] [^117AceaW].

> But wait, what if baseline A1c is very high or there is symptomatic hyperglycemia? I need to ensure I don't overstate GLP-1 RA monotherapy in that scenario. Evidence suggests that when baseline A1c exceeds about 9.5–10%, insulin may be more reliable for rapid, dose-titratable control, and guidelines recommend insulin initiation for A1c ≥ 10% or glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL, especially with catabolic symptoms; in such cases, GLP-1 RA monotherapy may be insufficient initially, though combination with insulin can be considered after stabilization [^116Rsmq5] [^111o3WxT] [^116t4cvs]. Hold on, I should verify that GLP-1 RAs are not categorically contraindicated in severe hyperglycemia; they are not, but their slower titration and gastrointestinal tolerability considerations make insulin the pragmatic first step when decompensation is present [^116t4cvs].

> Next, I should review combination therapy because this is where synergy matters. Meta-analyses of basal insulin plus GLP-1 RA show additional A1c lowering of roughly 0.4–0.6% versus comparator regimens, more patients reaching A1c targets, weight loss of about 2–5 kg, and similar or lower hypoglycemia versus basal-bolus insulin, with fixed-ratio combinations like IDegLira and iGlarLixi offering once-daily dosing and simplified titration [^111nW8vw] [^1135MxVZ]. Let me consider real-world data: observational and pragmatic studies corroborate that adding a GLP-1 RA to basal insulin improves glycemia while reducing insulin dose and injection burden, and some patients can even de-intensify or discontinue insulin after GLP-1 RA addition, which is clinically meaningful for adherence and weight outcomes [^115AGHkm] [^115wq8id].

> I will now examine weight effects, since this often drives therapy choice. GLP-1 RAs consistently produce weight loss of about 2–5 kg versus weight gain of roughly 2–4 kg with basal insulin in head-to-head trials, with the largest weight effects seen with semaglutide and tirzepatide, and the weight-sparing effect is a major advantage over insulin in patients with overweight or obesity [^112Ue1Eb] [^111gnj4N]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought dulaglutide might be weight neutral; let me correct that: dulaglutide produces modest weight loss, typically around 1–3 kg, so it is not weight neutral, though the magnitude is less than semaglutide or tirzepatide [^115Wa48U] [^111gnj4N].

> Next, I should review hypoglycemia risk. GLP-1 RAs have a markedly lower intrinsic risk of hypoglycemia than insulin because their insulinotropic effect is glucose dependent; pooled analyses show roughly 50–70% fewer hypoglycemic events versus basal insulin, with the caveat that hypoglycemia risk rises when GLP-1 RAs are combined with insulin or sulfonylureas, prompting dose reductions of those agents when GLP-1 therapy is added [^1175rYvM] [^114EfScz]. Hold on, I should verify that severe hypoglycemia differences are less pronounced; indeed, while overall hypoglycemia is lower, severe event rates are low and not always statistically different, reinforcing the need for careful co-medication management [^113UVnAu].

> I need to check cardiorenal outcomes because these increasingly guide agent selection. GLP-1 RAs with proven cardiovascular benefit reduce major adverse cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death, and some agents reduce stroke; in CKD, GLP-1 RAs reduce albuminuria progression and may slow eGFR decline, though SGLT2 inhibitors have stronger and more consistent kidney protection, so guidelines prioritize SGLT2 inhibitors for CKD and HF and endorse GLP-1 RAs when SGLT2 inhibitors are not tolerated or as adjuncts for cardiovascular risk reduction [^116z9z6q] [^111CwBAi] [^116c2zWc]. Let me reconsider the relative kidney benefits: real-world comparative data suggest GLP-1 RAs outperform DPP-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and basal insulin for kidney outcomes, but SGLT2 inhibitors remain superior for hard renal endpoints, aligning with guideline hierarchies [^11374fAA] [^111xYReV].

> Now, I should review safety and tolerability. GLP-1 RAs commonly cause transient gastrointestinal adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which are dose dependent and can lead to discontinuation in a minority; pancreatitis is a rare but possible risk, and there is a class warning for gallbladder disease with long-term use, whereas insulin's principal burdens are hypoglycemia and weight gain rather than gastrointestinal effects [^113UVnAu]. Wait, let me verify the pancreatitis signal: large outcome trials have not shown a consistent increase in acute pancreatitis, but caution is advised in patients with prior pancreatitis, and patients should be counseled on persistent severe abdominal pain [^notfound].

> I should confirm practical considerations that influence adherence and outcomes. GLP-1 RAs are available as once-weekly injectables and, for semaglutide, an oral formulation, which can reduce treatment burden compared with daily insulin injections; however, cost and access remain major barriers, and gastrointestinal intolerance can impair persistence, whereas insulin requires frequent glucose monitoring and dose titration, which some patients find burdensome [^113pTsKE] [^111gnj4N]. Hold on, I should verify that fixed-ratio combinations mitigate some burden: yes, IDegLira and iGlarLixi reduce injection frequency while delivering complementary basal and prandial effects, which can improve adherence in appropriate candidates [^115AGHkm].

> Next, I should review patient-specific factors that shift the balance. In patients with obesity, metabolic syndrome, or a need for weight loss, GLP-1 RAs are preferred. In those with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk, GLP-1 RAs with proven outcome benefit are indicated independent of A1c. In advanced CKD, GLP-1 RAs are reasonable when SGLT2 inhibitors are not tolerated or as add-on therapy. In older adults, GLP-1 RAs may reduce hypoglycemia compared with insulin, though renal function and GI tolerability must be considered [^111gnj4N] [^111CwBAi] [^116c2zWc]. I should double-check that dual GIP/GLP-1 agonism with tirzepatide offers additional glycemic and weight benefits; indeed, tirzepatide achieves larger A1c and weight reductions than several GLP-1 RAs, expanding options for patients needing maximal metabolic effect [^115wq8id].

> I will now align with current guideline recommendations to ensure consistency. ADA 2025 recommends GLP-1 RAs as the preferred first injectable in most adults with T2DM without insulin deficiency, favors GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors for those with ASCVD or high risk, and advises that if insulin is used, it should be combined with a GLP-1 RA for better glycemia, less weight gain, and lower hypoglycemia risk; AACE similarly prioritizes GLP-1 RAs for intensification and supports combination therapy with insulin when needed [^114HqfbD] [^111vBSgY] [^113pCAf6]. Let me verify the sequencing language: guidelines explicitly state that GLP-1 RAs should generally precede insulin unless there is symptomatic hyperglycemia or marked insulin deficiency, which reinforces the earlier point about thresholds for insulin-first strategies [^115C63cJ].

> Finally, I should synthesize practical clinical takeaways. For most patients who fail oral therapy, start with a GLP-1 RA and titrate; if A1c remains above goal, add basal insulin and consider a fixed-ratio combination to simplify; if insulin is already in use, add a GLP-1 RA and reduce insulin dose to mitigate hypoglycemia and weight gain; reserve insulin-first for severe hyperglycemia or clear insulin deficiency, and always individualize based on comorbidities, access, and patient preferences [^111gnj4N] [^115C63cJ]. Hold on, I should verify one more nuance: in patients with very high A1c, combination initiation may be reasonable to accelerate control while limiting insulin-related adverse effects, which is supported by both trial data and guideline pathways for intensification [^111nW8vw] [^111o3WxT].

> In conclusion, GLP-1 receptor agonists offer comparable or superior A1c lowering to basal insulin in many settings, with substantial advantages in weight loss, hypoglycemia risk, and cardiorenal outcomes, making them the preferred first injectable for most patients with T2DM without insulin deficiency. Insulin remains essential for severe hyperglycemia or insulin-deficient phenotypes, and combining GLP-1 RAs with insulin yields additive glycemic benefits while attenuating insulin's weight and hypoglycemia liabilities, especially with fixed-ratio coformulations [^117AceaW] [^114HqfbD] [^111nW8vw].

---

GLP-1 receptor agonists are preferred over insulin for most patients with type 2 diabetes because they provide **comparable or greater A1c lowering** [^117AceaW] with **less hypoglycemia and weight loss** [^113UVnAu] [^112Ue1Eb]. Insulin remains essential for severe hyperglycemia (A1c > 10% or glucose > 300 mg/dL) [^111o3WxT] or when GLP-1s are not tolerated. Combination therapy (GLP-1 plus insulin) is recommended when either alone is insufficient, as it improves glycemic control, reduces insulin dose, and limits weight gain and hypoglycemia [^111vBSgY] [^111nW8vw]. GLP-1s also offer cardiovascular and renal benefits [^116z9z6q], whereas insulin is associated with weight gain and hypoglycemia [^117GCvVk].

---

## Mechanisms of action

### GLP-1 receptor agonists

GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic endogenous GLP-1, **enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion** and suppressing glucagon, thereby reducing hepatic glucose output [^116NmXym]. They also slow gastric emptying and increase satiety, leading to weight loss [^115Wa48U]. These effects are glucose-dependent, so hypoglycemia risk is low unless combined with insulin or sulfonylureas [^114EfScz].

---

### Insulin

Insulin directly increases glucose uptake and suppresses hepatic glucose production, providing **rapid, dose-titratable glycemic control** [^117GCvVk]. However, its glucose-independent action increases hypoglycemia risk and is associated with weight gain and, in some cases, insulin resistance with prolonged use [^117GCvVk].

---

## Glycemic efficacy

| **Outcome** | **Glp-1 receptor agonists** | **Insulin** |
|-|-|-|
| HbA1c reduction | - Comparable or greater than insulin (0.5–1.5%) [^117AceaW] [^111GyAb3] | - Comparable or slightly less (0.5–1.2%) [^115Xk7KC] |
| Fasting glucose | - Moderate reduction [^117WTqpp] | - Significant reduction [^113UVnAu] |
| Postprandial glucose | - Significant reduction due to delayed gastric emptying [^116NmXym] | - Moderate reduction [^117GCvVk] |

---

GLP-1 receptor agonists provide **comparable or greater A1c lowering** than insulin, with particular benefit for postprandial glucose [^113UVnAu].

---

## Weight effects

GLP-1 receptor agonists consistently produce **weight loss** (2–5 kg) [^112Ue1Eb], whereas insulin is associated with **weight gain** (2–4 kg) [^117GCvVk]. This difference is clinically important for patients with obesity or overweight [^112uwrWG].

---

## Hypoglycemia risk

GLP-1 receptor agonists have a **lower hypoglycemia risk** than insulin due to their glucose-dependent mechanism [^1175rYvM]. Insulin carries a **higher hypoglycemia risk**, especially with intensive regimens or in patients with renal impairment [^117GCvVk].

---

## Cardiovascular and renal outcomes

GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce **major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiovascular death, and stroke** [^116z9z6q] and slow **chronic kidney disease progression** [^116c2zWc]. Insulin has **neutral cardiovascular effects** and does not confer renal benefits [^116z9z6q].

---

## Patient adherence and quality of life

GLP-1 receptor agonists are administered once weekly or daily, with **gastrointestinal side effects** (nausea, vomiting) that may limit adherence [^1169pRNF]. Insulin requires **multiple daily injections** and frequent glucose monitoring, which can reduce adherence and quality of life [^115omVCx].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend GLP-1 receptor agonists as the **preferred first-line injectable therapy** for most patients with type 2 diabetes, especially those with obesity, cardiovascular disease, or chronic kidney disease [^114HqfbD] [^114CAaUz]. Insulin is reserved for **severe hyperglycemia** (A1c > 10% or glucose > 300 mg/dL) [^111o3WxT] or when GLP-1 receptor agonists are not tolerated or contraindicated [^notfound].

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy with GLP-1 receptor agonists and insulin is recommended when either therapy alone fails to achieve glycemic targets. This approach provides **greater A1c reduction**, **reduces insulin dose**, and **limits weight gain and hypoglycemia** [^111vBSgY] [^111nW8vw].

---

## Limitations and contraindications

GLP-1 receptor agonists are contraindicated in patients with **medullary thyroid carcinoma** or **multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2**. Insulin is contraindicated in patients with **hypoglycemia unawareness** or **severe allergic reactions** to insulin.

---

GLP-1 receptor agonists are preferred over insulin for most patients with type 2 diabetes due to their **comparable or greater glycemic efficacy**, **weight loss**, **lower hypoglycemia risk**, and **cardiovascular and renal benefits** [^114HqfbD]. Insulin remains essential for severe hyperglycemia or when GLP-1 receptor agonists are not tolerated. Combination therapy is recommended when either therapy alone is insufficient [^111vBSgY].

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes convened a panel to update the prior position statements, published in 2012 and 2015, on the management of type 2 diabetes in adults. A systematic evaluation of the literature since 2014 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on lifestyle management and diabetes self-management education and support. For those with obesity, efforts targeting weight loss, including lifestyle, medication, and surgical interventions, are recommended. With regards to medication management, for patients with clinical cardiovascular disease, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit is recommended. For patients with chronic kidney disease or clinical heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended. GLP-1 receptor agonists are generally recommended as the first injectable medication.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to management of diabetic nephropathy, GLP-1 receptor agonists, KDIGO 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that the risk of hypoglycemia is generally low with GLP-1 receptor agonists when used alone, but the risk is increased when GLP-1 receptor agonists are used concomitantly with other medications, such as sulfonylureas or insulin. Consider reducing the doses of sulfonylurea and/or insulin.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for type 2 diabetes: a comprehensive review of how to weigh the options, select the right patients, and maximize benefits [^116sgAGQ]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

A growing body of data, guideline recommendations, algorithms, and position papers supports the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes (T2D), given their beneficial effects on glycemic control, weight, lipid parameters, and blood pressure, and low risk for hypoglycemia when used in patients who have not achieved glycemic goals with metformin and lifestyle interventions. Exciting new evidence continues to emerge, showing the utility of certain GLP-1 receptor agonists to decrease incident cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, and to bolster glycemic control when combined with other antihyperglycemic therapies, including basal insulin. The recent availability of fixed-ratio GLP-1 receptor agonist and basal insulin coformulations-and a new, first-ever, indication for the use of a GLP-1 receptor agonist (liraglutide) to reduce the risk of major adverse CV events (MACE) in adults with T2D and established cardiovascular disease (CVD)-increase options for improved care. In addition, semaglutide (another GLP-1 receptor agonist with positive CV outcomes data) received FDA approval in December 2017 with an indication to improve glycemic control in adults with T2D. These new developments and continuously emerging CV outcomes data should be considered in determining how GLP-1 receptor agonists may be best used in clinical practice. This Q&A presentation with 2 expert endocrinologists provides a pragmatic approach to inform the selection and use of GLP-1 receptor agonists based on the rapidly evolving evidence.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared with GLP-1 RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin: a network meta-analysis [^116gY3dv]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide has demonstrated significant improvements in glycaemic control compared with placebo for managing glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, and its efficacy has been shown to depend on both GIP and GLP-1 receptor-mediated actions. Several phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for tirzepatide (SURPASS trials) investigated the clinical effectiveness and safety of tirzepatide as a treatment for T2DM. The SURPASS trials compared three doses of tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg) with a range of comparators and background antihyperglycaemic agents. In the SURPASS trials, all three doses of tirzepatide demonstrated superior HbA1c reductions and weight loss in comparison with placebo, a GLP-1 RA, and insulin. A long-term cardiovascular outcomes trial, SURPASS-CVOT, is currently ongoing to assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in people with T2DM and increased cardiovascular risk. While the SURPASS trials provided direct comparative evidence on the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus a wide range of comparators, it was not feasible to conduct RCTs versus all relevant comparators in all clinical settings, including all GLP-1 RAs. For this reason, comparative data on the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus GLP-1 RAs in basal insulin population is sparse, and consequently, a network meta-analysis (NMA) approach has been employed to assess the relative efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus additional standard-of-care treatments. An NMA is a method for comparing multiple treatments at the same time in a single analysis by using direct and indirect evidence within a network of RCTs. NMAs can help in evaluating the comparative effectiveness of different treatments used in clinical practice. The objective of this NMA was to compare the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide with GLP-1 RAs in patients with T2DM receiving treatment with basal insulin.

### Comparative effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116z9z6q]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Several pharmacologic options for type 2 diabetes are available.

Purpose

To compare benefits and harms of glucose-lowering drugs in adults with type 2 diabetes.

Data Sources

Several databases from inception through 18 December 2019 and ClinicalTrials.gov on 10 April 2020.

Study Selection

English-language randomized trials that had at least 24 weeks of intervention and assessed the effects of glucose-lowering drugs on mortality, glycemic, and vascular outcomes.

Data Extraction

Pairs of reviewers extracted data and appraised risk of bias.

Data Synthesis

453 trials assessing 21 antidiabetic interventions from 9 drug classes were included. Interventions included monotherapies (134 trials), add-on to metformin-based therapies (296 trials), and monotherapies versus add-on to metformin therapies (23 trials). There were no differences between treatments in drug-naive patients at low cardiovascular risk. Insulin regimens and specific glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) added to metformin-based background therapy produced the greatest reductions in hemoglobin A 1c level. In patients at low cardiovascular risk receiving metformin-based background treatment (298 trials), there were no clinically meaningful differences between treatments for mortality and vascular outcomes. In patients at increased cardiovascular risk receiving metformin-based background treatment (21 trials), oral semaglutide, empagliflozin, liraglutide, extended-release exenatide, and dapagliflozin reduced all-cause mortality. Oral semaglutide, empagliflozin, and liraglutide also reduced cardiovascular death. Odds of stroke were lower with subcutaneous semaglutide and dulaglutide. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors reduced heart failure hospitalization and end-stage renal disease. Subcutaneous semaglutide and canagliflozin increased diabetic retinopathy and amputation, respectively.

Limitation

Inconsistent definitions of cardiovascular risk and low-level confidence in some estimates for patients at low cardiovascular risk.

Conclusion

In diabetic patients at low cardiovascular risk, no treatment differs from placebo for vascular outcomes. In patients at increased cardiovascular risk receiving metformin-based background therapy, specific GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors have a favorable effect on certain cardiovascular outcomes.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113q3f1E]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes — combining incretin therapy with insulin intensification and ongoing reassessment: in individuals who are intensifying to insulin therapy, combination therapy with a GLP‑1 RA or a dual GIP and GLP‑1 RA has been shown to have greater efficacy and durability of glycemic treatment effects, as well as weight and hypoglycemia benefits, than treatment intensification with insulin alone; however, cost, accessibility, and tolerability are important considerations, and treatment plans need to be continuously reviewed for efficacy, side effects (including hypoglycemia), and treatment burden, with some individuals requiring medication reduction and deintensification.

### Treatment evaluation of liraglutide in type 2 diabetes [^115eYmpA]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Liraglutide is a Glucagon like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, which stimulates GLP-1 receptors and consequently leads to various cardio-metabolic and glycemic improvements in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). It is administered once daily as a subcutaneous injection and has been extensively studied in randomized placebo and active comparator studies demonstrating favorable effects on glycemic control and weight reduction. This short review summarizes the role and practical use of this agent in the context of efficacy and safety information obtained during clinical trials.

### The role of basal insulin and GLP-1 receptor agonist combination products in the management of type 2 diabetes [^1135MxVZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes necessitates the development of new treatment options to individualize therapy. Basal insulin has been a standard treatment option for years, while glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have grown in use over the past decade due to glucose-lowering efficacy and weight loss potential. There are two new combination injectable products that have recently been approved combining basal insulins with GLP-1 RAs in single pen-injector devices. United States guidelines recently emphasize the option to use combination injectable therapy with GLP-1 RAs and basal insulin once the basal insulin has been optimally titrated as a second- or third-line agent in addition to metformin without reaching the goal A1c. Insulin glargine/lixisenatide 100/33 (IGlarLixi) can be dosed between 15 and 60 units once daily from a single pen-injector device. Insulin degludec/liraglutide 100/3.6 (IDegLira) can be dosed between 10 and 50 units once daily, also from a single pen-injector device. Maximum doses, while measured in units, correspond to limits defined by each individual GLP-1 RA. The dual use of basal insulin plus GLP-1 RA is non-inferior compared with basal insulin plus a single injection of prandial insulin at the largest meal and compared with twice daily-dosed premixed insulins; and this combination is associated with weight loss and less hypoglycemia. These new combination products could help providers effectively and efficiently follow clinical practice guidelines while enhancing patient adherence with injectable medications.

### Changing the approach to type 2 diabetes treatment: a comparison of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sulphonylureas across the continuum of care [^111kr7UC]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the importance of individualised strategies for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the availability of alternative treatments, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), sulphonylureas are still widely used in practice. Clinical evidence shows that GLP-1 RAs may provide better and more durable glycaemic control than sulphonylureas, with lower risk of hypoglycaemia. Other reported benefits of GLP-1 RAs include weight loss rather than weight gain (as observed with sulphonylureas), blood pressure reduction and improvement in lipid profiles. In general, the main adverse events with GLP-1 RAs are gastrointestinal in nature. The respective modes of action of GLP-1 RAs and sulphonylureas contribute to differences in the durability of glycaemic control (related to effects on beta-cells) and effects on body weight. Moreover, the glucose-dependent mode of action of GLP-1 RAs, which favours a low incidence of hypoglycaemia, contrasts with the glucose-independent mode of action of sulphonylureas. Evidence from cardiovascular outcomes trials indicates a consistent finding of cardiovascular safety across the GLP-1 RAs and suggests a class benefit for the long-acting GLP-1 RAs in reducing three-point major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality. In contrast, potential concerns relating to an increased incidence of adverse cardiovascular events with sulphonylureas have yet to be fully resolved. Recent updates to management guidelines recommend that treatment selection for patients with T2DM should consider clinical trial evidence of cardiovascular safety. Available evidence suggests that this selection should give preference to GLP-1 RAs over sulphonylureas, especially for patients at high cardiovascular risk.

### Efficacy and safety of incretin-based therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116iyYJe]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

This article aims to provide an overview of efficacy and safety data on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our goal is to differentiate the clinical profiles of GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors, as well as the individual agents within each class. Additionally, we examine the utility of GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors as these agents may be applied at different stages of type 2 diabetes therapy and discuss recently published clinical findings and their implications for treatment.

Retrospective, real-world data from electronic medical records of 32 Italian diabetes clinics were used, after propensity score adjustment, to compare effectiveness after 6months of treatment with second- versus first-generation BI (2BI vs. 1BI) or glargine 300U/ml versus degludec 100U/ml (Gla-300 vs. Deg-100), when added to (ADD-ON) or in substitution of (SWITCH) GLP-1 RA. Only comparisons, including a minimum of 100 patients per group, were performed to ensure adequate robustness of the analyses.

Results

In the ADD-ON cohort (N = 700), greater benefits of 2BI versus 1BI were found in glycated haemoglobin {HbA1c; estimated mean difference: -0.32% [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.62; -0.02]; p = .04} and fasting blood glucose [FBG; -20.73mg/dl (95% CI -35.62; -5.84); p = .007]. In the SWITCH cohort (N = 2097), greater benefits of 2BI versus 1BI were found in HbA1c [-0.22% (95% CI -0.42; -0.02); p = .03], FBG [-10.15mg/dl (95% CI -19.04; -1.26); p = .03], and body weight [-0.67 kg (95% CI -1.30; -0.04); p = .04]. In the SWITCH cohort starting 2BI (N = 688), marked differences in favour of Gla-300 versus Deg-100 were documented in HbA1c [-0.89% (95% CI -1.26; -0.52); p < .001] and FBG [-17.89mg/dl (95% CI -32.45; -3.33); p = .02]. Using propensity score matching as a sensitivity analysis, the benefit on HbA1c was confirmed [-0.55% (95% CI -1.02; -0.08); p = .02]. BI titration was suboptimal in all examined cohorts.

Conclusions

2BI are a valuable option to intensify GLP-1 RA therapy. Switching to Gla-300 versus Deg-100 was associated with greater HbA1c improvement.

### Newer pharmacologic treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111WDk7V]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes guideline evidence review — key questions and GRADE categories are summarized as follows: The CGC identified key questions and asked CGC members and CGC Public Panel members a priori to independently rate the importance of evaluated outcomes, and all critical and important outcomes were considered in developing recommendations. The ACP Center for Evidence Reviews at Wisconsin conducted the supporting systematic review, and the evidence review team and CGC used GRADE tables to summarize findings and to rate the certainty of evidence for clinical outcomes using categories of high, moderate, low, or insufficient. Key question 1 addresses the effectiveness, comparative effectiveness, and harms of SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, or long-acting insulins as monotherapy or in combination, and whether benefits and harms vary by demographic characteristics, diabetes severity and control, HbA1c levels, duration of diabetes, and comorbidities including baseline cardiovascular disease (CVD), congestive heart failure (CHF), obesity, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Key question 2 focuses on patients' values and preferences regarding diabetes medications, including how patients weigh benefits and harms and what patient factors are associated with treatment preferences. Key question 3 addresses the costs and cost-effectiveness of diabetes medications alone or in combination for adults with type 2 diabetes, noting that the CGC's value thresholds for economic evidence were used by the CER in its ACP-funded systematic review of cost-effectiveness analyses.

3.1 Risk of bias

The risk of bias for all trials included is presented in Figure S1, Supporting Information. Selection bias was assessed as unclear in 7 trials 20, 22, 31, 36, 37, 38, 39 for random sequence generation and in 4 trials 20, 36, 37, 38 for allocation concealment. Absence of reporting was the main reason for the decision to assign an RCT as presenting unclear risk of bias. All trials were open label. Attrition bias (see incomplete outcome data) was assessed to be low in 12 trials 19, 20, 21, 22, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 38 (percentage of patients lost to follow‐up reported as 0%‐3% in all arms) and was unclear in 3. 36, 37, 39 Two trials were deemed to have an unclear risk with regard to reporting. 36, 37

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^116t4cvs]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

AACE 2023 symptomatic hyperglycemia — initial insulin indications: Basal with or without prandial insulin treatment may be needed as initial therapy if the A1C is > 10% and/or glucose values are > 300 mg/dL combined with catabolic symptoms, such as weight loss. If symptomatic hyperglycemia is present, a GLP-1 RA alone is not recommended as it requires titration and may delay glucose control. The goal of initial intensive insulin therapy for symptomatic hyperglycemia is to reduce glucose levels safely and promptly. After improved glycemic control is achieved with short-term insulin therapy, especially with a new diagnosis of DM, a role for noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents could be considered.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111o3WxT]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Glycemic thresholds for intensification and insulin initiation in type 2 diabetes: When A1C is ≥ 1.5% above the individualized glycemic goal, many individuals will require dual-combination therapy or a more potent agent; insulin should be considered as part of any combination plan when hyperglycemia is severe, and it is common practice to initiate insulin for blood glucose levels ≥ 300 mg/dL (≥ 16.7 mmol/L) or A1C ≥ 10% (≥ 86 mmol/mol), or if symptomatic hyperglycemia or catabolic signs are present; people with severe hyperglycemia can also be effectively treated with a sulfonylurea, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), or dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 RA, though evidence is scarce for baseline A1C above 10–12%.

### Comparison of glucose-lowering agents after dual therapy failure in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115Xk7KC]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the evidence supporting the choice of third-line agents in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes.

Materials and Methods

We searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2000 and July 2017 that reported data on cardiometabolic outcomes and hypoglycaemia for glucose-lowering agents added to metformin-based dual treatments. Data were stratified by background therapy and RCT duration, and synthesized, when possible, with network meta-analyses.

Results

A total of 43 RCTs (16590 participants) were included, with metformin combined with: sulphonylureas (SUs) in 20 RCTs; thiazolidinediones (TZDs) in 10; basal or rapid-acting insulin in 6; dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in 3; glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in 2; and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors in 2. When added to metformin and SUs, after 24 to 36weeks, rapid-acting insulin resulted in the largest reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c; 1.6% vs placebo), followed by GLP-1RAs (1.0%), basal insulin (0.8%) and SGLT-2 inhibitors (0.7%), with no difference between GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors; body weight increased with insulin treatment (~3 kg vs placebo), while the greatest reduction was observed for SGLT-2 inhibitors compared with all other therapies. Limited data for hypoglycaemia indicated a similar risk for SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs. Results for third-line agents added to metformin and TZDs were comparable, showing similar HbA1c reduction and risk of hypoglycaemia between SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs, and a slightly greater reduction in body weight with SGLT-2 inhibitors vs GLP-1RAs. Data for 52 to 54weeks were more limited: added to metformin and a SU, TZDs, GLP-1RAs or SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced HbA1c to a similar extent but had different effects on body weight (7 kg and 5 kg more with TZDs vs SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs, respectively; 2 kg less when comparing SGLT-2 inhibitors with GLP-1RAs). Formal analyses could not be performed for any other dual therapy failure combinations because of the small number of available RCTs.

Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence supports the choice of a third-line agent only in patients on metformin combined with a SU or a TZD, with SGLT-2 inhibitors performing generally better than other drugs. In suggesting third-line agents, future guidelines should recognize the widely differing evidence on the various dual therapy failures.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111Q9UN7]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes — sequencing for greater glucose‑lowering potency: when even greater potency of glucose lowering is desired to reduce blood glucose to target and A1C goals, a basal insulin, either human NPH or a long‑acting insulin analog, should be initiated; however, if not already receiving GLP‑1 RA or dual GIP and GLP‑1 RA, an agent from these classes should be started first, and high‑potency GLP‑1 RAs and dual GIP and GLP‑1 RA are the preferred options for individuals requiring more intensive glucose management.

### Changing the approach to type 2 diabetes treatment: a comparison of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sulphonylureas across the continuum of care [^113bJswR]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Among the currently available treatment options, the sulphonylureas (a class that includes gliclazide, glimepiride, glibenclamide and glipizide) can achieve glycaemic control but are associated with weight gain and increased risk of hypoglycaemia. Over recent years, potential concerns have also arisen regarding the cardiovascular safety of the sulphonylurea class in comparison with other treatments for diabetes. As these concerns are not yet fully resolved, more recent guideline updates do not recommend sulphonylureas in patients who have experienced prior cardiovascular events. Furthermore, some guidelines recommend that sulphonylureas should be used with caution because of the risk of hypoglycaemia, especially in older patients.

Despite the disadvantages of sulphonylureas and the availability of options that are not associated with the known drawbacks of this class, the use of sulphonylureas in clinical practice continues to be high overall in some countries (e.g. Canada, England and Wales, and the United States,) and higher than that of GLP‐1 RAs in others (e.g. Italy, and Denmark).

It is possible that the continued widespread use of sulphonylureas reflects an aspect of clinical inertia — the failure to switch or discontinue therapy when targets are not achieved — and the relatively low acquisition cost of sulphonylureas (World Health Organization guidelines for treatment intensification in low‐resource settings recommend these drugs for second‐line use after metformin). An additional reason may be a lack of familiarity among physicians with the newer therapies, such as GLP‐1 RAs. None of the recent reviews summarising the effects of GLP‐1 RAs and sulphonylureas compare directly the overall evidence available for these two classes. The aim of this narrative review was to contrast the mode of action, clinical efficacy and safety of GLP‐1 RAs with those of sulphonylureas. Available data for GLP‐1 RAs and sulphonylureas as individual classes have been extensively reviewed. Consequently, in this review, differences in clinical efficacy and safety between the two drug classes were examined by focussing primarily on important information from recent network meta‐analyses, clinical studies involving head‐to‐head comparisons of GLP‐1 RAs and sulphonylureas, and studies of cardiovascular outcomes.

### GLP-1RA and SGLT2 inhibitor prescribing in people with diabetes… [^117Gxq7k]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Two newer glucose-lowering medications, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, have significant cardiorenal benefits and advantages in weight management. 1 These medications are not approved for type 1 diabetes, but some evidence indicates their use in this population. 2 This study explored prescribing trends for individuals with T1D prescribed GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors. We identified 943 456 individuals with T1D from 2010 to 2023. The T1D population newly prescribed GLP-1RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors differed from the general T1D population in Cosmos across almost all examined characteristics; those who were newly. The percentage of the T1D population prescribed GLP-1RAs increased from 0. 3% in 2010 to
6. 6% by 2023 and SGLT2 inhibitor prescribing rose from 0. 1% to
2. 4%.

Overall, the percentage of T1D patients prescribed either GLP-1RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors increased from 0. 7% to
8. 3%. Prescribing for both GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors in a T1D population identified in Cosmos increased between 2010 and 2023. Differences in characteristics of the overall T1D population and those newly prescribed the medications are often associated with elevated cardiorenal risk profiles, suggesting use of these newer treatments was intended to address additional medical needs. Concerns about euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis led to the removal of SGLT2 inhibitors for T1D in Europe, and the US Food and Drug Administration has not approved their use in T1D. Concerns exist about GLP-1RAs causing substantial weight loss and increasing the risk of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia. 5, 6 However, use of these newer medications in T1D may continue due to the significant weight management and cardiorenal benefits observed in people with and without type 2 diabetes.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists compared with basal insulins for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Hp3QS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

As the analyses for the present study were being conducted, a systematic review and meta‐analysis of once‐weekly GLP‐1 RAs was published. 10 However, the current study has several important differences from that study and other previously published analyses. Our research question was more specific than that posed by previous analyses. First, we considered only head‐to‐head comparisons with basal insulins rather than with any antihyperglycemic treatment, which offers more comprehensive evidence for clinicians regarding choice between the two injectable options in the treatment pathway. Second, rather than being restricted to once‐weekly GLP‐1 Ras, our analysis considered all licensed dosages of all GLP‐1 RAs currently being used in clinical practice. And finally, our analysis did not pool drugs according to class; thus, each drug and dosage was considered independently and we pooled only outcome data from studies within the time frame of 16 to 36 weeks of treatment. Although these restrictions meant that some treatments were not included in the meta‐analysis, notably albiglutide 30 mg (uptitrated to 50 mg as needed), dulaglutide 1.5 mg (where only one study comparing it to basal insulin at this dose was available) and lixisenatide 20 µg, it was not thought appropriate to conduct an analysis pooling the drugs, dosages or different time frames because head‐to‐head trials of GLP‐1 RAs have demonstrated differences within the class. 43 Another recently published pairwise and network meta‐analysis sought to understand the benefits and harms of once‐weekly GLP‐1 RAs. 16 However, that analysis considered only once‐weekly GLP‐1 RAs and was conducted primarily to assess the cardiometabolic efficacy and adverse effects of GLP‐1 RAs and not the comparison to basal insulin in the treatment paradigm, 16 as we did in our study.

### Dulaglutide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes [^114BqaM7]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are injectable agents used for the treatment of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. The interest for this pharmacological class is rising with the development of once weekly compounds and the demonstration of a potential reduction in cardiorenal outcomes. Areas covered: The paper describes the main pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics of dulaglutide, a new once-weekly GLP-1 RA. Dulaglutide was extensively investigated in the phase-3 AWARD program, which demonstrated its safety and efficacy when compared to placebo or active glucose-lowering agents in patients treated with diet alone, metformin or sulfonylurea monotherapy, oral dual therapies and basal insulin. In both Caucasian and Japanese patients, comparative trials showed better glucose control with dulaglutide, with a minimal risk of hypoglycemia and weight loss, but at the expense of an increased dropout rate due to side effects, mostly transient gastrointestinal disturbances. Dulaglutide proved its non-inferiority versus liraglutide and the safety and tolerance profile is similar to that of other GLP-1 RAs. Expert opinion: The once-weekly formulation and the combined positive effects on both glucose control and weight improves patient satisfaction despite nausea. Dulaglutide must prove its capacity to reduce cardiovascular and diabetic complications in the ongoing prospective REWIND trial.

### Kidney outcomes with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists versus other glucose-lowering agents in people with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of real-world data [^11374fAA]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials showed that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) reduce kidney risk in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), prominently in those with chronic kidney disease. It is unclear whether these findings may apply to broader populations of patients with T2D treated in real-world settings and compared to active controls. We summarised real-world data of adverse kidney outcomes among patients with T2D initiating GLP-1 RA versus other glucose-lowering agents.

Materials and Methods

We searched PubMed and Embase for observational cohort studies (April 2005-January 2025; PROSPERO CRD42023405356). Initiators of GLP-1 RA were compared to sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i), sulfonylureas, or basal insulin. Outcomes included risks of albuminuria progression, ≥ 40 or ≥ 50% eGFR reduction from baseline, acute kidney injury (AKI), kidney-related hospitalizations, and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), per data availability. We synthesised the data using inverse variance-weighted averages of logarithmic hazard ratios (HR)s in random-effect models.

Results

Thirty-one studies were eligible, encompassing 1,601,389 patients (mean age 49–78 years, 5%-64% women), with 21, 6, 5, and 1 of them using SGLT2i, DPP4i, basal insulin, and sulfonylureas as a comparator, respectively. Compared with SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA initiators had higher risks for AKI (HR [95% CI] 1.12 [1.05–1.20]), kidney-related hospitalizations (1.66 [1.01–2.73]), and ≥ 40% reduction in eGFR (1.40 [1.27–1.53]), without evidence for differences in risks of ≥ 50% eGFR reduction or ESKD. Compared to DPP4i, GLP-1 RA initiators had lower risks for experiencing ≥ 50% eGFR reduction (0.84 [0.76–0.92]), kidney-related hospitalizations (0.73 [0.65–0.83]), and ESKD (0.70 [0.63–0.78]). Similar benefits were observed when comparing GLP-1 RA to sulfonylureas. Compared to basal insulin, GLP-1 RA initiation was associated with a lower risk of albuminuria progression (0.89 [0.80–0.99]), with inconsistent data regarding possible benefits in reducing ESKD risk.

Conclusions

In patients with T2D, initiation of GLP-1 RA in real-world settings may be associated with improved kidney outcomes compared to DPP4i, sulfonylureas, and basal insulin, and worse kidney outcomes compared to SGLT2i.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists for type 2 diabetes and their role in primary care: an Australian perspective [^112gWRz2]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

The ever-increasing number of drugs available to treat type 2 diabetes and the complexity of patients with this condition present a constant challenge when it comes to identifying the most appropriate treatment approach. The more recent glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are non-insulin injectable options for the management of type 2 diabetes. Effective at improving glycaemic control with a low intrinsic risk of hypoglycaemia and the potential for weight reduction, this agent class is an important addition to the prescribing armamentarium. However, understanding their place in therapy may prove confusing for many primary care practitioners, especially given the common belief that 'injectables' are a last-resort treatment option, which puts them at risk of being niched alongside insulin. This review summarises the clinical evidence for GLP-1RAs and how they compare to other glucose-lowering agents in managing type 2 diabetes. It also provides practical and case-driven opinions and recommendations on the optimal use of GLP-1RAs by discussing important patient factors and clinical considerations that will help to identify those who are most likely to benefit from this class of agents.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors combination therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a network meta-analysis [^112nNDCz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Comparisons for pair‐wise meta‐analysis

We plan to investigate the following comparisons of intervention versus control/comparator:

any combination of GLP‐1RA and SGLT2i versus any GLP‐1RA alone;
any combination of GLP‐1RA and SGLT2i versus any SGLT2i alone.

We will follow the same criteria for grouping interventions as for the NMA.

Minimum duration of intervention

Because we plan to focus on patient‐important clinical outcomes, we will include trials with a minimum duration of intervention of 24 weeks.

Minimum duration of follow‐up

The minimum duration of follow‐up after randomisation will be 24 weeks.

Outcome measures

We will not exclude a study if it fails to report one or several of our critical outcome measures. We will only exclude studies if none of the outcomes relevant to this review were measured, provided there is supporting evidence for this (e.g. contact with trial authors, access to the original protocol, etc.).

Timing of outcome measures

We will assess our critical outcomes at different time points: short term (6 to 12 months' follow‐up) and long term (more than 12 months' follow‐up). If an outcome is reported more than once during any of the above time points, we will use the latest time point within that category (e.g. if there was a measure at 6 and 12 months, we will use the results at 12 months for the short term) or the time point that correlates best with other studies compared within each outcome.

Critical outcomes

Glycaemic control: measured by HbA1c in % and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in mg/dL. A minimally important difference for glycaemic control will be a 0.5% reduction in HbA1c.
Diabetes complications: we will evaluate each event of diabetes macrovascular (non‐fatal myocardial infarction, non‐fatal stroke, hospitalisation for HF) or microvascular complication (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) separately as the number of participants with at least one event.
Mortality: defined as death from any cause.

### Liraglutide: a once-daily incretin mimetic for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1169pRNF]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analog for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-May 2009) was conducted for English-language articles using the terms glucagon-like peptide 1, incretin mimetic, NN2211, and liraglutide. Abstracts presented at the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes annual meetings in 2006, 2007, and 2008 were also searched for relevant data.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles pertinent to the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of liraglutide were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Liraglutide is a GLP-1 analog with pharmacokinetic properties suitable for once-daily administration. Clinical trial data from large, controlled studies demonstrate the effectiveness of liraglutide in terms of hemoglobin A(1c) (A1C) reduction, reductions in body weight, and the drug's low risk for hypoglycemic events when used as monotherapy. Data also support benefits of liraglutide therapy on beta-cell responsiveness to glucose, with animal and in vitro data indicating potential benefits in beta-cell mass and neogenesis with liraglutide treatment. Liraglutide has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, glimepiride, and rosiglitazone for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Additionally, comparative data with insulin glargine and exenatide therapy are available from Phase 3 trials providing practitioners valuable clinical data on which to base clinical decision making. Overall, liraglutide is well tolerated with dose-dependent nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea being the most commonly reported adverse events in clinical trials.

Conclusions

Once-daily administration may provide a therapeutic advantage for liraglutide over twice-daily exenatide, with similar improvements in A1C and body weight observed when liraglutide was compared with exenatide. The glucose-dependent mechanism of insulin release with GLP-1 agonist therapy holds potential clinical significance in the management of postprandial hyperglycemic excursions, with minimal risk of hypoglycemia.

### Dulaglutide: the newest GLP-1 receptor agonist for the management of type 2 diabetes [^115Wa48U]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), dulaglutide, in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).

Data Sources

A PubMed search was completed to identify publications from 1947 to October 2014 using the search terms dulaglutide and LY2189265. References were reviewed to identify additional resources.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles were included if they evaluated the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, or efficacy of dulaglutide.

Data Synthesis

Dulaglutide reduces both glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) and weight by stimulating insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon in a glucose-dependent manner, delaying gastric emptying, and promoting satiety. Dulaglutide consists of 2 GLP-1 analogues that have been modified to make it a long-acting, once-weekly agent. Dulaglutide has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, and insulin lispro. It has demonstrated superior A1C reduction compared with placebo, metformin, insulin glargine, sitagliptin, and twice-daily exenatide. It demonstrated noninferiority in A1C reduction to liraglutide. Dulaglutide changed A1C by -0.78% to -1.51%, and it changed weight by -0.35 kg to -3.03 kg. The most common adverse effects in clinical studies were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Conclusions

Dulaglutide is the fifth GLP-1 RA approved for T2D in the United States. It is an attractive option because it is dosed once-weekly, provides A1C lowering similar to liraglutide, weight reduction similar to exenatide, and has an adverse effect profile similar to exenatide and liraglutide.

### Real-world GLP-1 RA therapy in type 2 diabetes: a long-term effectiveness observational study [^115UKTpx]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1 RA) pharmacological class is increasingly becoming a widely prescribed therapy in type 2 diabetes (T2D) based upon a robust hypoglycaemic effect mediated through stimulation of β‐cells aimed to enhance insulin secretion in a glucose‐dependent manner, while simultaneously suppressing the secretion of glucagon from α‐cells. Besides, GLP‐1 RAs are able to prolong gastric emptying and induce satiety with a potential to reduce body weight, a major factor contributing to insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia in T2DM. 1, 2 Clinical trials have demonstrated that GLP‐1 RA therapy is able to reduce glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) by 1.0% from baseline values with a reduced risk of hypoglycaemia compared with sulfonylurea and insulin. 3, 4 Furthermore, many of these agents induce significant weight loss. 3, 4 Nevertheless, clinically meaningful differences have been described in head‐to‐head trials in regard of the magnitude of the effect on these outcomes associated to different drugs of the class, with a higher effect on weight and glucose reduction for liraglutide and weekly‐based therapies, that is exenatide LAR and dulaglutide, as compared with daily‐based ones, exenatide and lixisenatide. 5, 6

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists compared with basal insulins for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117CJH8E]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Statistical tests of heterogeneity were conducted to understand the extent to which the results of trials included in the meta‐analysis were consistent. The main measure of heterogeneity used for evaluation was I 2 value. 27 Sub‐group sensitivity analysis was conducted by excluding one study to understand the impact of non‐standard dosing used in a minority (37.9%) of patients. 20

Each model was coded, analysed and summarized using forest plots. The forest plots summarize effect estimates from all included trials to provide a comprehensive view of available evidence, as well as a pooled effect size from meta‐analysis. For change in HbA1c and weight, a mean difference < 0 signifies the result favouring the GLP‐1 RA arm compared to the basal insulin arm, ie, a greater reduction in HbA1c or weight compared to basal insulin. For hypoglycaemia, an odds ratio < 1 indicates lower odds in the GLP‐1 RA arm compared to basal insulin. Where meta‐analyses were conducted (ie, 2 or more trials were available for a treatment and comparator), I 2 value was also reported. Codes designed for meta‐analyses and their outputs were validated by a second analyst.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists versus insulin in inadequately controlled patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of clinical trials [^113UVnAu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

To compare the effect and safety of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) with insulin therapy on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients inadequately controlled with metformin and/or sulfonylurea. A systematic literature search on MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using specific search terms 'GLP-1 insulin type 2 diabetes clinical trials' and eight eligible studies were retrieved. Data on mean change in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1C), weight loss, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), incidence of hypoglycaemia and gastrointestinal adverse events were extracted from each study and pooled in meta-analysis. Data on postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) and adverse events were also described or tabulated. Data from eight RCTs enrolling 2782 patients were pooled using a random-effects model. The mean net change [95% confidence interval (CIs)] for HbA1c, weight loss and FPG for patients treated with GLP-1 RA as compared with insulin was -0.14% (-2 mmol/mol) [95% CI; (-0.27, -0.02)%; p = 0.03]; -4.40 kg [95% CI; (-5.23, -3.56) kg; p < 0.01] and 1.18 mmol/l [95% CI; (0.43, 1.93) mmol/l; p < 0.01], respectively, with negative values favouring GLP-1 and positive values favouring insulin. The GLP-1 group was associated with a greater reduction in PPG than the insulin group. Overall, hypoglycaemia was reported less in the GLP-1 group [Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (M-H OR) 0.45 (0.27, 0.76); p < 0.01], while there was no significant difference in occurrence of severe hypoglycaemia [M-H OR 0.65 (0.29,1.45); p = 0.29]. A significantly higher number of gastrointestinal adverse events were reported with GLP-1 group [M-H OR 15.00 (5.44,41.35) p < 0.01]. GLP-1 RA are promising new agents compared with insulin. Further prospective clinical trials are expected to fully evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of these therapies within the T2DM treatment paradigm.

### Efficacy and safety of short-and long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists on a background of basal insulin in type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis [^112ktoEZ]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy and safety of short- and long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), both used in combination with basal insulin, in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials comparing the coadministration of short- or long-acting GLP-1 RAs and basal insulin with basal insulin ± placebo were identified (PubMed search). Of 974 identified publications, 14 clinical trials were included. Eight trials examined short-acting and six long-acting GLP-1 RAs.

Data Extraction and Data Synthesis

Differences in HbA 1c, fasting plasma glucose, body weight, and adverse events were compared between studies using short- or long-acting GLP-1 RAs by random-effects meta-analysis.

Limitations

There were relatively small numbers of available publications, some heterogeneity regarding protocols, and differences in the GLP-1 RA compound used.

Conclusions

Long-acting GLP-1 RAs more effectively reduced HbA 1c (∆ -6 mmol/mol [95% CI -10; -2], P = 0.007), fasting plasma glucose (∆ -0.7 mmol/L [-1.2; -0.3], P = 0.007), and body weight (∆ -1.4 kg [-2.2; -0.6], P = 0.002) and raised the proportion of patients achieving an HbA 1c target < 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol) (P = 0.03) more than the short-acting ones. Patients reporting symptomatic (P = 0.048) but not severe (P = 0.96) hypoglycemia were fewer with long- versus short-acting GLP-1 RAs added to insulin. A lower proportion of patients reported nausea (-52%, P < 0.0001) or vomiting (-36%, P = 0.0002) with long-acting GLP-1 RAs. Overall, GLP-1 RAs improved HbA 1c, fasting plasma glucose, and body weight when added to basal insulin. However, long-acting GLP-1 RAs were significantly more effective for glycemic and body weight control and displayed better gastrointestinal tolerability.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Updated guidelines and consensus from the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommend that, in most people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) uncontrolled by two or more oral antihyperglycaemic drugs (OADs), the preferred initial injectable therapy is a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1 RA), with the addition of basal insulin therapy as required. 1, 2 Combination therapy with a GLP‐1 RA plus basal insulin may be considered as an initial injectable therapy in patients with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) > 10% (> 86 mmol/mol) and/or patients with HbA1c > 2% (> 23 mmol/mol) above target. 2 The sequential combination of basal insulin and GLP‐1 RA therapy has been extensively studied, demonstrating complementary mechanisms of action and clinical effect. 2 GLP‐1 RAs improve postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) excursions by stimulating insulin secretion, reducing glucagon secretion and, in particular for those that are rapid‐acting such as lixisenatide, by decelerating gastric emptying. 2 Basal insulins improve fasting glucose mainly through reduction of hepatic glucose production.

Simplification of treatment regimens in people with T2D has been shown to offer medication adherence benefits. 3 Fixed‐ratio combinations (FRCs) of a basal insulin and a GLP‐1 RA enable administration of both therapies simultaneously, and thereby reduce the number of injections required per day compared with administering these two therapies separately. FRCs have also shown robust HbA1c reductions with mitigation of the weight gain usually observed with insulin therapy, no increased hypoglycaemic risk compared with basal insulin, and a reduction in gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs) compared with GLP‐1 RA therapy alone – primarily due to the slow titration of the GLP‐1 RA concomitant with basal insulin adjustments. 4, 5

iGlarLixi, a once‐daily injectable FRC of basal insulin glargine 100 units/mL (iGlar) and the short‐acting GLP‐1 RA lixisenatide (Lixi), has been shown to be well tolerated and efficacious in people with T2D inadequately controlled by either OADs (LixiLan‐O study) or basal insulin (LixiLan‐L study). 4, 5

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115C63cJ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment — insulin thresholds and combinations specify that in adults with type 2 diabetes, initiation of insulin should be considered if symptoms of hyperglycemia are present or when A1C or blood glucose levels are very high (i.e. A1C > 10% [≥ 86 mmol/mol] or blood glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL [≥ 16.7 mmol/L]); in adults with type 2 diabetes and no evidence of insulin deficiency, a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, is preferred to insulin; if insulin is used, combination therapy with a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, is recommended for greater glycemic effectiveness as well as beneficial effects on weight and hypoglycemia risk for adults with type 2 diabetes, and insulin dosing should be reassessed upon addition or dose escalation of a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA; and in adults initiating insulin therapy, continue glucose-lowering agents (unless contraindicated or not tolerated) for ongoing glycemic and metabolic benefits.

### How do we continue treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes when therapeutic goals are not reached with oral antidiabetes agents and lifestyle? Incretin versus insulin treatment [^115jT2rt]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The recent ADA/EASD Position Statement for the therapy of type 2 diabetes has already changed the positioning of GLP-1 RA treatment from "less validated treatments" in the preceding statement to an equal positioning as second-line therapy with insulin. The novel statement evaluates therapies not only by their efficacy in glucose lowering but also by treatment side effects, hypoglycemia incidence, body weight development, and costs as well as individual considerations concerning patient characteristics (e.g. disease duration, comorbidities, cardiovascular risk). In conclusion, the indications and outcomes for GLP-1 RA treatment compared with insulin therapy seem favorable for patients with type 2 diabetes when oral antidiabetes therapy and lifestyle intervention do not achieve the therapeutic goals. In this case, an injectable therapy with a GLP-1 RA is feasible, especially when body weight reduction and prevention of hypoglycemia are further important therapeutic aims.

### For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are taking a GLP-1… [^11485VCT]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Bottom Line This propensity score–matched analysis concluded that an SGLT2 inhibitor is preferred over a sulfonylurea for patients with type 2 diabetes who are already taking a GLP-1 receptor agonist, with favorable effects on the likelihood of hospitalization for myocardial infarction and heart failure, and all-cause mortality. Synopsis There have been no randomized trials that address whether there are benefits to adding an SGLT2 inhibitor or sulfonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes who are already taking a GLP-1 receptor agonist. The researchers used three U. S. insurance registries to identify adults with type 2 diabetes who were taking a GLP-1 receptor agonist and had not taken an SGLT2 inhibitor or a sulfonylurea in the previous three months. Patients with gestational or type 1 diabetes, cancer, end-stage renal disease, or HIV infection were excluded.

After initially identifying 32, 221 patients adding an SGLT2 inhibitor and 26, 894 adding a sulfonylurea, the authors used propensity score matching with more than 95 covariates to create 12, 584 matched pairs for comparison. Patients were followed up for a mean of 10 months. The primary outcome was a composite of hospitalization for myocardial infarction and stroke, and all-cause mortality. A secondary outcome was hospitalization for heart failure. The primary outcome was significantly less likely in the group given an SGLT2 inhibitor. Heart failure hospitalizations were also less common in the group given an SGLT2 inhibitor and all-cause mortality, but not for stroke.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists compared with basal insulins for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117AceaW]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

Since 2005, several glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been approved to treat people with type 2 diabetes. These agents are considered for use at the same point in the treatment paradigm as basal insulins. A comprehensive comparison of these drug classes, therefore, can help inform treatment decisions. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the clinical efficacy and safety of GLP-1 RAs compared with basal insulins.

Materials and Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and PubMed databases were searched. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of ≥ 16 weeks' duration comparing GLP-1 RAs vs basal insulins in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with oral antihyperglycemic drugs were included. Data on the change from baseline to 26 weeks (± 10 weeks) of treatment in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and weight, as well as the proportion of patients experiencing hypoglycaemia, were extracted. Fixed-effect pairwise meta-analyses were conducted where data were available from ≥ 2 studies.

Results

Fifteen RCTs were identified and 11 were meta-analysed. The once-weekly GLP-1 RAs, exenatide long acting release (LAR) and dulaglutide, led to greater, statistically significant mean HbA1c reductions vs basal insulins (exenatide: -0.31% [95% confidence interval -0.42, -0.19], dulaglutide: -0.39% [-0.49, -0.29]) whilst once-daily liraglutide and twice-daily exenatide did not (liraglutide: 0.06% [-0.06, 0.18], exenatide: 0.01% [-0.11, 0.13]). Mean weight reduction was seen with all GLP-1 RAs while mean weight gain was seen with basal insulins. Interpretation of the analysis of hypoglycaemia was limited by inconsistent definitions and reporting. Because of the limited number of available studies sensitivity analyses to explore heterogeneity could not be conducted.

Conclusions

Although weight reduction is seen with all GLP-1 RA's, only the once-weekly agents, exenatide LAR and dulaglutide, demonstrate significant HbA1c reductions when compared to basal insulins.

### A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis comparing once-weekly semaglutide with other GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes previously receiving basal insulin [^1121PZij]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Semaglutide is a new once-weekly GLP-1 analogue available at either a 1.0 mg or 0.5 mg dose. The clinical efficacy of once-weekly semaglutide has been extensively studied in the Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) clinical trial program, for which data from seven global phase 3 trials have been published. Specifically, the efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide as an add-on to basal insulin (± OADs) has been investigated in the SUSTAIN 5 clinical trial. In this trial, once-weekly semaglutide (+ basal insulin ± metformin) provided a superior reduction in HbA 1c levels and body weight compared with placebo (+ basal insulin ± metformin) and allowed a significantly greater proportion of patients to achieve target HbA 1c levels.

Given the number of treatment options available for the management of T2D, it is important for decision makers to understand the relative clinical benefits of all treatment options to allow for an informed treatment decision. So far, no head-to-head trials between once-weekly semaglutide and other GLP-1 RAs in patients inadequately controlled on basal insulin (± OADs) have been conducted. As each GLP-1 RA may demonstrate unique advantages and disadvantages, it is important to understand the relative efficacy and safety of each GLP-1 RA. The aim of the current study was to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) and network meta-analysis (NMA) to assess the relative efficacies and safety of GLP-1 RAs as an add-on to basal insulin (± OADs) in the treatment of T2D.

### Options for combination therapy in type 2 diabetes: comparison of the ADA / EASD position statement and AACE / ACE algorithm [^113paztV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Treating patients with diabetes is one of the most challenging and important activities a physician (primary care physician or specialist) can undertake. A key to successful therapy for type 2 diabetes is the insight that this condition is progressive and that the need for additional agents over time is normative. The ability to individualize therapy by patient and medication characteristics comes from experience and knowledge of pertinent clinical studies. However, guidelines from expert bodies such as the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology can help clinicians of all levels of expertise to approach therapy choices more rationally. There is unity across these guidelines about the role and benefits of metformin as first-line pharmacological treatment, probability of good efficacy, low risk of hypoglycemia, modest weight loss, and overall long-term data. Unfortunately, this unity does not extend to recommendations for subsequent pharmacological agents and their use in combination to intensify treatment when insulin is not (yet) appropriate. Across both statements, some drug classes seem more prominent, and looking at their benefit-risk profile, it is clear why this is the case. The most profound recent change in diabetes therapy has been the introduction of incretin therapies. Incretin therapies minimize 2 important adverse effects seen with many other therapies: hypoglycemia and weight gain. These agents have increased the range of options available for early intensification of treatment of type 2 diabetes. In combination with more established therapies, there are more opportunities than ever to accommodate patient preferences while improving glycemic control and harnessing extraglycemic benefits of a second (or third) agent.

### Efficacy and safety of liraglutide versus placebo added to basal insulin analogues (with or without metformin) in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^117WTqpp]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Achieving and maintaining individualized glycaemic targets, minimizing the risk of hypoglycaemia and preventing complications present challenges in the management type 2 diabetes 1. Most patients with diabetes eventually require insulin therapy 2, 3. The benefits of basal insulin combination therapy have been well documented 4, 5; however, insulin therapy increases the risk of hypoglycaemia and often leads to weight gain 6, leaving an unmet need for additional treatment options that can improve glycaemic control with greater efficacy, safety and convenience.

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) is an incretin hormone that augments insulin secretion and suppresses glucagon secretion in a glucose‐dependent manner 7; thus, GLP‐1 receptor agonists decrease fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial glucose (PPG) and body weight, with a low risk of hypoglycaemia 8. These drugs are generally well tolerated, apart from mostly transient gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs) during initiation 2. GLP‐1 receptor agonists may, therefore, fulfill the need for additional antidiabetic therapies.

There is evidence that combination therapy with GLP‐1 receptor agonists and basal insulin has benefits, including weight loss and greater patient satisfaction 9, 10, 11, 12, 13; however, the sequencing of basal insulin versus GLP‐1 receptor agonists is not well established, and different combinations of basal insulin and GLP‐1 receptor agonists have not been adequately evaluated.

Liraglutide, a once‐daily human GLP‐1 analogue approved in Europe, the USA and other countries, lowers glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) by up to −1.5% (−16.4 mmol/mol), and induces weight loss with a low risk of hypoglycaemia. Liraglutide also improves lipid and blood pressure profiles, although slight increases in pulse rate have been reported 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. While a large proportion of subjects achieved HbA1c targets with liraglutide, adding insulin detemir to liraglutide further reduced HbA1c in those not achieving glycaemic control with liraglutide alone 21, 22. Moreover, in a study of patients with HbA1c ≥ 7% (53 mmol/mol), the reverse sequence [adding liraglutide to basal insulin (degludec)] was effective in further lowering HbA1c [0.3% (3.3 mmol/mol) greater than when insulin aspart was added to the largest meal], and also in inducing weight loss, with less hypoglycaemia 23.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^116Fw9dd]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3 PATIENT FACTORS IMPACTING GLYCEMIC GOALS AND THERAPY SELECTION

Most patients with T2D will require basal insulin. Patients with T2D requiring insulin therapy have, in most circumstances, a longer duration of diabetes, whether this time period is with diagnosed or undiagnosed T2D. In the context of FRCs, while the GLP‐1 RA component may mitigate the weight gain associated with basal insulin, insulin therapy is still associated with a net increase in body weight and hypoglycaemia risk vs. not using insulin. Thus, patients being treated with FRCs are more similar to subjects in older trials of glycemic control (e.g. ACCORD, ADVANCE and VDAT) vs. newer trials of incretins and SGLT2 inhibitors where lower or even HbA1c levels below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes may be beneficial.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) prefers an HbA1c of < 6.5% as the primary glycemic goal for people with T2D. However, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) prefer a HbA1c goal of < 7% as the primary glycemic goal for most adults with T2D. While these goals seem to contrast, they begin to mirror each other when patient‐specific adjustments to these goals are brought into focus.

### Newer pharmacologic treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and network meta-analysis for the American College of Physicians [^116ejhpZ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Newer diabetes medications may have beneficial effects on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, and renal outcomes.

Purpose

To evaluate the effectiveness, comparative effectiveness, and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, and long-acting insulins as monotherapy or combination therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Data Sources

MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from 2010 through January 2023.

Study Selection

RCTs lasting at least 52 weeks that included at least 500 adults with T2DM receiving eligible medications and reported any outcomes of interest.

Data Extraction

Data were abstracted by 1 reviewer and verified by a second. Independent, dual assessments of risk of bias and certainty of evidence (CoE) were done.

Data Synthesis

A total of 130 publications from 84 RCTs were identified. CoE was appraised using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria for direct, indirect, and network meta-analysis (NMA); the highest CoE was reported. Compared with usual care, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1 agonists reduce all-cause mortality (high CoE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (moderate to high CoE), SGLT2 inhibitors reduce progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure hospitalizations and GLP1 agonists reduce stroke (high CoE), and SGLT2 inhibitors reduce serious adverse events and severe hypoglycemia (high CoE). The threshold for minimally important differences, which was predefined with the American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines Committee, was not met for these outcomes. Compared with usual care, insulin, tirzepatide, and DPP4 inhibitors do not reduce all-cause mortality (low to high CoE). Compared with insulin, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1 agonists reduce all-cause mortality (low to moderate CoE). Compared with DPP4 inhibitors, GLP1 agonists reduce all-cause mortality (moderate CoE). Compared with DPP4 inhibitors and sulfonylurea (SU), SGLT2 inhibitors reduce MACE (moderate to high CoE). Compared with SU and insulin, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1 agonists reduce severe hypoglycemia (low to high CoE).

Limitations

Infrequent direct comparisons between drugs of interest; sparse data for NMA on most outcomes; possible incoherence due to differences in baseline patient characteristics and usual care; insufficient data on predefined subgroups, including demographic subgroups, patients with prior cardiovascular disease, and treatment-naive persons.

Conclusion

In adults with T2DM, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1 agonists (but not DPP4 inhibitors, insulin, or tirzepatide) reduce all-cause mortality and MACE compared with usual care. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce CKD progression and heart failure hospitalization and GLP1 agonists reduce stroke compared with usual care. Serious adverse events and severe hypoglycemia are less frequent with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1 agonists than with insulin or SU.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists compared with basal insulins for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114wXuwq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Although our analysis attempted to minimize heterogeneity among studies by ensuring that treatment regimens and outcome time points were consistent, and the systematic review eligibility criteria specifying that background therapy must be received concurrently with study medication, any OAD was allowed as background therapy. However, because of the limited evidence base, heterogeneity was observed among studies, leading to uncertainty concerning the estimates. Table 1 clearly indicates that background therapy varied among the included studies, which could also have impacted the results. Whilst MET is largely weight neutral and has a low risk of hypoglycaemia associated with it, both SU and TZD treatments are associated with weight gain, which should be considered when interpreting results. In addition, SUs carry a moderate risk of hypoglycaemia, which is of particular importance because basal insulin is also associated with weight gain and an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. 42 Although sensitivity analyses can be conducted to assess the impact of differing background therapies, it was not possible in this study because most meta‐analyses included only 2 trials, a number insufficient for a meaningful sensitivity analysis.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111gnj4N]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, general principles, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to use a person-centered shared decision-making approach to guide the choice of glucose-lowering medications in adult patients with T2DM. Use medications providing sufficient effectiveness to achieve and maintain intended treatment goals with consideration of the effects on cardiovascular, kidney, weight, and other relevant comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, cost and access, risk for adverse reactions and tolerability, and individual preferences:

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^116dUpym]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology 2023 type 2 diabetes — cardiovascular risk therapy selection states that GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) lower major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in meta-analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80–0.93, P < .001), while sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce hospitalization for heart failure (HF) and cardiovascular death, including a 32% reduction in HF hospitalization (HR 0.68 [95% CI 0.61–0.76]) and a 15% reduction in CV death (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.78–0.93]) versus placebo. For persons with T2D and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or at high risk, a GLP-1 RA with cardiovascular benefit should be initiated as first-line therapy independent of A1C goal or other antihyperglycemic treatments, and as an alternative clinicians may recommend an SGLT2i with proven cardiovascular benefit to reduce MACE or CV death in persons with T2D and established ASCVD. SGLT2is should be recommended in persons with T2D and HF regardless of A1C goal or other antihyperglycemic treatments, and they have been shown to improve HF-related symptoms irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction and background therapies. High-risk trial features included "albuminuria or proteinuria, HTN and LV hypertrophy, LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, and/or ABI < 0.9". DPP-4 inhibitors show neutrality for MACE, but saxagliptin increased HF hospitalizations and caution is advised with alogliptin in New York Heart Association Class III or IV CHF. Thiazolidinediones can worsen fluid retention and should not be used in symptomatic HF, and initiation of pioglitazone is contraindicated in New York Heart Association Class III or Class IV CHF.

### Efficacy and safety of once-weekly glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists for the management of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111GyAb3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess the efficacy and safety of recently approved once-weekly glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing any GLP-1 RA licensed for once-weekly dosing (albiglutide, dulaglutide or exenatide extended release) with placebo or other antidiabetic agents. We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library and grey literature for articles published up to December 2014 and extracted data in duplicate.

Results

In our systematic review we included 33 trials with a total of 16003 participants. Compared with placebo the change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration was -0.66% [six studies; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.14 to -0.19; I(2) = 88%] with albiglutide, and -1.18% (seven studies; 95% CI -1.34 to -1.02; I(2) = 65%) with dulaglutide. Based on data from placebo-controlled trials, we did not detect statistically significant weight-sparing benefits for albiglutide or dulaglutide. Compared with other antidiabetic agents, once-weekly GLP-1 RAs outperformed sitagliptin, daily exenatide and insulin glargine in terms of HbA1c-lowering (mean differences -0.40%; 95% CI -0.66 to -0.14; I(2) = 85%, -0.44%; 95% CI -0.58 to -0.29; I(2) = 40% and -0.28; 95% CI -0.45 to -0.10; I(2) = 81%, respectively). The main adverse effects of treatment included gastrointestinal and injection site reactions.

Conclusions

Given their dosing scheme and overall efficacy and safety profile, once-weekly GLP-1 RAs are a convenient therapeutic option for use as add-on to metformin.

### Effects of insulin plus glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in treating type 1 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113hGuPm]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Combination therapy with insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) has already been proven an efficient treatment option for type 2 diabetes. This combination can effectively improve glycated hemoglobin levels, cause weight loss and reduce the dosage of insulin. In addition, it can also reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Several randomized controlled trials have confirmed that this treatment may be just as effective for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the effects and efficacy of the treatment on glycemic changes, weight loss and insulin dosage in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients.

Methods

We searched Embase, PubMed and Cochrane for randomized controlled trials (no time restrictions) that investigated combined insulin and GLP-1 treatment. The main endpoints were measurements of glycated hemoglobin and changes in the weight and the dosage of insulin.

Results

In total, 1093 were studies identified, and 7 studies were included in our meta-analysis. GLP-1 agonist and insulin combination therapy led to greater reductions in HbA1c levels [P = 0.03; mean difference −0.21; 95% confidence intervals (CI) (−0.40, 0.02)] and weight [P < 0.05; −3.53 (−4.86, 2.19)] compared to control treatments. The combination therapy did not significantly influence the daily weight-adjusted total insulin dose [P = 0.05; −0.11 (−0.23, 0)], but it did reduce the daily weight-adjusted bolus insulin dose [P = 0.001; −0.06 (−0.1, 0.02)].

Conclusion

Our meta-analysis supports the use of a combined therapeutic regimen of insulin and GLP-1RAs for treating patients with T1DM. Combination therapy with GLP-1 and insulin could achieve an ideal treatment effect on glycemic control, weight loss and bolus insulin dose in patients with T1DM.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 analog and insulin combination therapy in the management of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^117MKtiM]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of combination glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs and insulin in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in adults.

Data Source

A MEDLINE search (1966-April 2010) was conducted using the key terms glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, exenatide, incretin mimetic, liraglutide, diabetes mellitus, and insulin.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles identified from the data source were evaluated and reviewed for inclusion. Original research and retrospective cohorts were included in this review. The references of articles that we identified were examined for any additional studies appropriate for review.

Data Synthesis

Exenatide is a subcutaneously administered GLP-1 receptor agonist that is used for the improvement of glycemic control in adults with T2DM. Through actions similar to those of endogenous GLP-1, exenatide contributes to improved postprandial glycemic control and weight loss. The concomitant use of exenatide and insulin is currently not Food and Drug Administration-approved due to lack of clinical trial data. However, combination insulin and exenatide may be advantageous, especially for reducing weight gain, particularly for obese patients with T2DM. Several small prospective and retrospective studies evaluating combination therapy found statistically significant reductions in hemoglobin A(1c) (A1C), weight, and total daily insulin dose requirements. The most common adverse effects reported included gastrointestinal effects, such as nausea and vomiting, and hypoglycemia.

Conclusions

Although there is a limited amount of data and not all studies demonstrated A1C reduction, the combination of exenatide with insulin therapy appears to be a safe option in the management of T2DM. It may be a promising therapeutic strategy for some patients, as reductions in weight and insulin doses were observed. Further well-designed prospective trials are warranted to fully determine the long-term effectiveness and safety of this combination as well as its place in therapy.

2016. 1523. Two relatively new classes of therapeutics, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists, have been widely adopted in practice for diabetes management based on clinical trial evidence demonstrating effective glycosylated hemoglobin control, benefits for weight management, and low risk of hypoglycemia. It has been suggested that these agents may also reduce risk for cardiovascular outcomes among patients with diabetes. This benefit has recently been reported in a placebo control randomized clinical trial for the GLP-1 agonist Liraglutide. 1 GLP-1 agonists amplify glucose-mediated insulin secretion, whereas DPP-4 inhibitors enhance and prolong the action of endogenously secreted GLP-1.

1 INTRODUCTION

Consensus guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommend that people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who need a greater glucose‐lowering effect than is achieved by their current dual/triple oral diabetes therapy should add an injectable medication. 1 Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs) are the preferred first‐choice injectable for most patients, however, insulin is recommended first for people with significant and symptomatic hyperglycaemia (HbA1c ≥ 10%). 1 Furthermore, guidelines currently recommend that if an individual requires further glucose‐lowering therapy despite treatment with a GLP‐1 RA or basal insulin, the other injectable can be promptly added as a treatment intensification. 1, 2

In people with a baseline HbA1c of 9.0% or higher, the likelihood of reaching glycaemic control is even lower than in people with a baseline HbA1c of 7% to less than 8%, or of 8% to less than 9%. 3 In a retrospective, longitudinal, observational study, in those subjects with a baseline HbA1c of 9% or higher, the cumulative probability of achieving an HbA1c of less than 7.0% with either basal insulin or a GLP‐1 RA alone was 15% and 19% at 12 months, and 26% and 28% at 24 months, respectively. 3 By contrast, in those with a baseline HbA1c of 8% to less than 9%, the cumulative probability of achieving an HbA1c of less than 7.0% with either a basal insulin or GLP‐1 RA was 24% and 41% at 12 months, and 36% and 59% at 24 months, respectively, and in those with a baseline HbA1c of 7% to less than 8%, the probability was 34% and 75% at 12 months, and 50% and 91% at 24 months, respectively. 3 Thus, in people with an HbA1c of 9.0% or higher, combined treatment intensification with a GLP‐1 RA and basal insulin should be considered, administered either separately or together in the form of a fixed‐ratio combination. 1, 3

3.2.1 Glycemic control

Of the 15 RCTs identified by the systematic review, 11 studies reported change in HbA1c at 26 weeks (± 10 weeks) and had comparable data from at least 2 studies to allow for a pairwise meta‐analysis. These included 5 trials of exenatide 10 µg vs insulin glargine 19, 20, 34, 37, 38; 2 trials of exenatide 2 mg LAR vs insulin glargine 29, 33; 2 trials of liraglutide 1.8 mg vs insulin glargine 36, 39; and 2 trials of dulaglutide 0.75 mg vs insulin glargine. 21, 28 Four studies could not be included in the pair‐wise meta‐analysis as the requirement of comparable data for the same dose or comparator insulin from 2 studies was not met. These studies compared exenatide 2 mg LAR vs insulin detemir, 30 liraglutide 1.8 mg vs insulin degludec, 31 albiglutide 30 mg titrated to 50 mg (as required) vs insulin glargine 22 and lixisentatide 20 µg vs insulin glargine. 35 In addition, although 2 studies were available for a pair‐wise meta‐analysis of the 0.75 mg dose of dulaglutide 21, 28 to be performed, only 1 study reported both doses of dulaglutide (0.75 and 1.5 mg). 21 In the absence of another study with the 1.5 mg dose, a pair‐wise analysis for this dose could not be performed. A summary of all evidence identified by the systematic review and the results of the pairwise meta‐analyses are presented in Figure 2 A. Mean HbA1c changes from baseline as well as the percentage of patients achieving HbA1c < 7% (53 mmol/L) are presented in Table S2, Supporting Information.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^117GCvVk]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

The key messages from dozens of comparative insulin trials in type 2 diabetes include the following:
1 Any insulin will lower glucose and HbA 1c.
2 All insulins are associated with some weight gain and some risk of hypoglycemia.
3 The larger the doses and the more aggressive the titration, the lower the HbA 1c, but often with a greater likelihood of adverse effects.
4 Generally, long-acting insulin analogs reduce the incidence of overnight hypoglycemia, and rapid-acting insulin analogs reduce postprandial glucose excursions as compared with corresponding human insulins (NPH, Regular), but they generally do not result in clinically significantly lower HbA 1c.

Metformin is often continued when basal insulin is added, with studies demonstrating less weight gain when the two are used together. Insulin secretagogues do not seem to provide for additional HbA 1c reduction or prevention of hypoglycemia or weight gain after insulin is started, especially after the dose is titrated and stabilized. When basal insulin is used, continuing the secretagogue may minimize initial deterioration of glycemic control. However, secretagogues should be avoided once prandial insulin regimens are employed. TZDs should be reduced in dose (or stopped) to avoid edema and excessive weight gain, although in certain individuals with large insulin requirements from severe insulin resistance, these insulin sensitizers may be very helpful in lowering HbA 1c and minimizing the required insulin dose. Data concerning the glycemic benefits of incretin-based therapy combined with basal insulin are accumulating; combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists may be helpful in some patients. Once again, the costs of these more elaborate combined regimens must be carefully considered.

### Exenatide: an incretin mimetic for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116NmXym]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Exenatide is a subcutaneously injected incretin mimetic. It is indicated as adjunctive therapy to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are already receiving therapy with metformin, a sulfonylurea, or both but continue to have suboptimal glycemic control.

Objective

This article reviews available information on the clinical pharmacology, comparative efficacy, tolerability, drug interactions, contraindications and precautions, dosage and administration, availability and storage, and cost of exenatide.

Methods

MEDLINE (1966-April 2006) and Web of Science (1995-April 2006) were searched for original research and review articles published in the English language. The search terms used were exenatide, exendin-4, glucagon-Like peptide-1, GLP-1, and incretin mimetic. The reference lists of identified articles were also consulted, as was selected information from the package insert for exenatide. All relevant comparative efficacy studies that were available in published form were included in the review.

Results

Naturally occurring incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), exhibit insulinotropic properties after release into the circulation from the gut. As a GLP-1 agonist, exenatide improves glucose homeostasis by mimicking the actions of naturally occurring GLP-1. It improves glycemic control by reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations through a combination of known mechanisms, including glucose-dependent insulin secretion, restoration of first-phase insulin response, regulation of glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying, and decreasing food intake. Three Phase III comparative efficacy trials were identified that enrolled a total of 1,446 patients who received exenatide 5 pg SC BID, exenatide 10 mug SC BID, or placebo for 30 weeks in addition to their existing therapy with metformin, sulfonylurea, or both. In these trials, the addition of exenatide was associated with significant reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) values (P < 0.001-P < 0.002), greater proportions of patients achieving an HbA(1c) ≤ 7%, significant decreases in fasting plasma glucose concentrations (P < 0.001-P < 0.005), and a dose-dependent progressive weight loss compared with placebo. Nausea (43.5%) was the most commonly reported adverse event in the combined exenatide groups. Other adverse events occurring in > 10% of patients receiving exenatide were hypoglycemia (19.6%), diarrhea (12.8%), and vomiting (12.8%).

Conclusions

During clinical trials, exenatide added to existing metformin and/or sulfonylurea therapy in patients with T2DM reduced fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations, with improvements in HbA(1c) and modest weight loss. The main adverse effect associated with exenatide therapy was nausea.

### An indirect comparison of basal insulin plus once-weekly semaglutide and fully optimised basal-bolus insulin in type 2 diabetes [^115omVCx]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a progressive disease associated with several complications, including retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, heart attack, and stroke. Various pharmacological treatments are available for T2D, including biguanides, sulfonylureas, meglitinide, thiazolidinedione, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor antagonists (GLP-1 RAs) and α-glucosidase inhibitors. However, treatment regimens are frequently complex, which can limit adherence, especially in patients who face additional challenges in self-management, such as social disadvantage, poor education, or psychiatric disorders. Adverse effects of some treatments, such as weight gain, can also serve as barriers to optimal pharmaceutical management of T2D.

As a progressive disease, T2D requires intensification of treatment over time. Treatment progression is tailored to the needs of each patient, and, where possible, American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend that GLP-1 RAs be initiated prior to insulin therapy. However, in practice, some patients initiate basal insulin prior to GLP-1 RAs, and there will sometimes be a need to intensify treatment from basal insulin and metformin. The ADA and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) have issued guidance on treatment intensification for patients in this situation, which can involve either multiple doses of insulin or the addition of GLP-1 RAs.

The first of these intensification strategies generally involves adding one or more daily doses of bolus insulin at mealtimes. However, this increases treatment complexity, requiring regular dose adjustments and multiple daily injections. Treatment regimens with more frequent injections have been linked to lower compliance with therapy, especially in patients with limited self-management ability. Increasing the dose of insulin can also increase the risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain.

An alternative treatment intensification strategy is joint therapy with basal insulin and GLP-1 RAs. GLP-1 RAs are an established treatment option for T2D, offering improved glycaemic control alongside weight management and cardiovascular benefits. Some GLP-1 RAs allow once-weekly (OW) dosing to minimize treatment burden, which can facilitate adherence and improve quality of life (QoL). Recent ADA and EASD guidelines support the use of joint therapy with GLP-1 RAs and basal insulin in T2D, and the risk of weight gain and hypoglycaemia is reported to be lower than for optimised basal–bolus treatment.

### Current issues in GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy for type 2 diabetes [^114M64od]. Endocrine Practice (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is guided not only by published treatment algorithms, but also by consideration of recent evidence and through consultation with colleagues and experts. Recent studies have dramatically increased the amount of information regarding the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). Topics that may be of particular interest to clinicians who treat T2DM patients include relative glycemic control efficacy of GLP-1 RAs, use of GLP-1 RAs across T2DM progression and in combination with insulin, recent data regarding GLP-1 RA safety, nonglycemic actions of GLP-1 RAs, including weight effects, and impact of GLP-1 RAs on patient quality of life and treatment satisfaction. The following review includes expert consideration of these topics with emphasis on recent, relevant reports to illustrate current perspectives.

### A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis comparing once-weekly semaglutide with other GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes previously receiving basal insulin [^112ugHJR]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Overall, once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg as an add-on to basal insulin is the most efficacious GLP-1 RA in terms of reductions in HbA 1c and body weight from baseline after 6 months of treatment. Once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg is also efficacious in reducing HbA 1c compared with the majority of GLP-1 RA comparators in the analysis. The increased efficacy of once-weekly semaglutide vs other GLP-1 RA comparators was not associated with an increase in GI-related AEs.

### Use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists among individuals on basal insulin requiring treatment intensification [^1173nZf8]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

What's new?

Many patients with Type 2 diabetes require supplemental insulin as β‐cell function declines.
Treatment intensification is often required as patients are unable to achieve or maintain glycaemic control on basal insulin. For these patients, use of combination injectable treatments with different, complementary mechanisms of action can allow physicians to specifically target the glycaemic defects of their patient.
In this rapidly changing field, this evidence‐based review examines the available options for treatment intensification, including new fixed‐ratio combinations of glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists and basal insulin.

### How do we continue treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes when therapeutic goals are not reached with oral antidiabetes agents and lifestyle? Incretin versus insulin treatment [^114YnLui]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

All three components of hyperglycemia — elevated fasting blood glucose; elevated postprandial blood glucose; and, as a consequence, elevated HbA 1c — contribute to and correlate with the development and progression of microvascular and macrovascular complications in subjects with diabetes. Glycemic targets from the European Society of Cardiology/EASD guidelines are < 108 mg/dL for fasting blood glucose, 2 h after beginning eating postprandial blood glucose < 135 mg/dL, and ≤ 6.5% for HbA 1c in patients with type 2 diabetes. Recently, the ADA/EASD guidelines have recommended new HbA 1c treatment goals in their patient-centered approach.

In patients not reaching therapeutic goals on metformin only to achieve/maintain an HbA 1c target over ∼3 months, the next step recommended was to add either a second OHA, a GLP-1 RA, or basal insulin. Basal insulins, especially basal insulin analogs (glargine or detemir), added to OHAs (in particular metformin) alone at bedtime, have the highest efficacy lowering HbA 1c and fasting blood glucose with consecutively improved postprandial blood glucose levels. In principle, insulin therapy has a high risk of hypoglycemia and is associated with weight gain compared with the other options recommended on level 2 of the treatment algorithm. However, BOT using either insulin glargine or insulin detemir was associated with significantly less risk comparing BOT using NPH insulin with other insulin regimens like prandial insulin or premixed insulin. Insulin therapy theoretically allows reaching glycemic goals from high baseline glycemic values by individual and consequent dose titration to the desired target. Basal insulin analogs in that respect provide relatively uniform insulin coverage throughout the whole day and night.

On the other hand, GLP-1 RAs added to metformin have a high efficacy in lowering HbA 1c and postprandial blood glucose with improvement of fasting blood glucose levels alongside. By contrast, GLP-1 RA treatment confers no risk of hypoglycemia with further advantage of weight loss and a relative low risk of gastrointestinal side effects.

Two head-to-head studies of GLP-1 RAs, using either exenatide once per week or liraglutide once a day, found superiority or noninferiority in terms of lowering HbA 1c compared with basal insulin glargine. In both studies, GLP-1 RA therapy was associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia and loss of weight compared with insulin glargine therapy. Both basal insulin therapy and GLP-1 RA therapy are more effective but still more expensive than OHA treatment.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists compared with basal insulins for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116zxPBA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical effectiveness and safety of GLP‐1 RAs compared to each other and to oral antihyperglycemic drugs (OAD) have been assessed in several meta‐analyses. 9, 10, 11 However, the positioning of GLP‐1 RAs within the treatment paradigm is at the point when the use of basal insulin might also be considered; therefore, there is an increasing desire to understand the similarities and differences between GLP‐1 RAs and basal insulins. Although such comparisons have been published, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 they all have limitations to consider. Wang et al. 15 do not include the two new agents (dulaglutide and albiglutide) and, although Karagiannis et al. 10 do include the new treatments, their analysis is limited to only once‐weekly GLP‐1 RAs. Liu et al. 13 on the other hand, pooled all GLP‐1 RAs together when comparing to insulin glargine. Such pooling assumes, a priori, that all GLP‐1 RAs are similar in efficacy and pharmacodynamic profile, which is not the case as demonstrated in head‐to‐head studies. 17, 18 More recently, Zaccardi et al. 16 conducted an analysis where GLP‐1 RAs were considered independently, but basal insulins were pooled, again making an a priori assumption that all basal insulins have the same efficacy and pharmaocodynamic profile. Pooling also discounts the heterogeneity between GLP‐1 RA trials regarding background therapy and drug dosage; as such, it is imperative that heterogeneity using appropriate measures is assessed prior to combining treatments for analytical purposes. To this end, to evaluate the clinical efficacy of GLP‐1 RAs, by type, vs basal insulins, we conducted a systematic review of the literature and a series of paired meta‐analyses to assess the differences in glycaemic control, weight change and the risk of hypoglycaemia in adults with type 2 diabetes.

### How do we continue treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes when therapeutic goals are not reached with oral antidiabetes agents and lifestyle? Incretin versus insulin treatment [^116Rsmq5]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Recently, a systematic review of the efficacy of eight classes of diabetes medications used in current clinical practice (metformin, sulfonylureas, α-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, glinides, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs, and insulin analogs) to reach the HbA 1c target < 7.0% in type 2 diabetes was performed. A total of 218 RCTs (339 arms and 77,950 patients) were identified in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through April 2011, which included at least 30 subjects in every arm with a follow-up of at least 12 weeks.

For GLP-1 RAs (n = 5,783 patients) and basal insulins (21,615 patients), overall rates of patients achieving a target of HbA 1c < 7.0% were 45.7 and 38.9%, respectively. In a much smaller group of only 668 patients treated with long-acting release exenatide, a rate of 63.2% was found. Outcomes for insulins and noninsulin drugs (including GLP-1 RAs) divided by different strata of baseline HbA 1c clearly demonstrated a much lower efficacy of noninsulin drugs compared with insulins beyond a baseline HbA 1c of ~9.5%.; i.e. this review emphasizes that in most of the patients failing on OHA treatment, adding either a basal insulin analog or a GLP-1 RA is meaningful and effective, with a preference for insulin therapy when baseline HbA 1c is already > 9.5%. But even with both of these best monotherapy options added to OHA therapy, an average of 40–60% of the patients will not achieve a < 7.0% HbA 1c target. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics and advantages for various patient types of either therapeutic option of injectable agents when therapeutic goals are not reached with OHA therapy alone.

### Injecting new ideas into managing type 2 diabetes: evolving roles of GLP-1 receptor agonists [^115dmSqP]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease that often requires therapeutic intensification. Patients with type 2 diabetes frequently experience complications related to hyperglycemia, treatment-induced hypoglycemia, and comorbidities. Management of patients with type 2 diabetes is complicated and must be individualized, though guidelines from both the American Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology provide treatment algorithms detailing therapeutic escalation with both oral and injectable therapies according to glycated hemoglobin (A1c) level. The development of injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists has expanded management options and provided therapies that do not have some of the adverse events commonly associated with many other therapies used to treat type 2 diabetes. These incretin-based therapies, available in both daily and weekly formulations, have been shown to significantly reduce A1c levels, body weight, and cardiovascular risk factors. In this 4-part series, 2 expert physicians discuss clinical profiles of GLP-1 receptor agonists, strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes, barriers to the use of injectable noninsulin therapies, and practical recommendations for noninsulin injectable therapies.

### Insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist combination therapy in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111nW8vw]. Diabetes Care (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The combination of basal insulin plus a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) has been proposed as a treatment option to intensify insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing this combination strategy to other injectable antidiabetes treatments on metabolic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

We conducted an electronic search until November 2016 on many electronic databases to identify RCTs assessing changes in HbA 1c, proportion of patients at HbA 1c target ≤ 7% (53 mmol/mol), hypoglycemia, and weight change. We used a random-effect model to calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD) or relative risk (RR) with the 95% CI.

Results

We identified 26 RCTs, lasting 12–52 weeks, and involving 11,425 patients. When the combination strategy was compared with other injectable treatments (overall data), there were reductions in HbA 1c (WMD = -0.47%, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.35), more patients at HbA 1c target (RR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.44–1.88), similar hypoglycemic events (RR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.93–1.39) and a reduction in weight (WMD = -2.5 kg, 95% CI -3.3 to -1.7), with high heterogeneity (I 2 > 89%, P < 0.001) and a significant publication bias for three outcomes. In preplanned subgroup analyses, the combination treatment was similar to basal-bolus insulin regimens for glycemic control, with less hypoglycemia (RR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.46–0.93) and reduced weight (WMD = -4.7 kg, 95% CI -6.9 to -2.4). Fixed-ratio combinations yielded results similar to the overall analysis (HbA 1c WMD = -0.56%, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.40).

Conclusions

GLP-1RAs alone or as titratable fixed-ratio combinations with basal insulin may represent a promising option to advance basal insulin therapy or to initiate injectable therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on oral agents. Longer studies are needed to assess durability and tolerability.

### Comparison of efficacy between incretin-based therapies for type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113Jscfq]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is widely prevalent and is often coexistent with obesity. Many of the available treatment options have side effects such as weight gain which often affect patient's willingness to continue the treatment. Effective weight loss, lack of significant hypoglycaemia, and favourable cardiometabolic profile make Incretin based therapies an attractive treatment option for type 2 diabetes. Incretin based therapies are available as either incretin mimetics (also called GLP-1 agonists) or incretin enhancers (DPP-4 inhibitors). Although agents in both these classes of incretin based therapy are effective through a common GLP-1 pathway, there are many differences amongst them including the route of administration, frequency of administration, effects on body weight, extent of glycaemic improvement. There are several trials evaluating these individual incretin based agents either as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-diabetic agents, however very few have looked into direct comparison amongst the agents in these two classes. This review is aimed to look at important mechanistic differences between incretin mimetics and enhancers through direct comparison trials and impact of these differences on biochemical, metabolic and patient satisfaction parameters.

### A review of the new GLP-1 receptor agonist / basal insulin fixed-ratio combination products [^111n7aob]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

There have been several new treatment approaches established for the management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes (T2D), with treatment guidelines listing both glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and basal insulin therapies as considerations for patients who have failed to control their blood glucose with oral antidiabetic agents. New studies have highlighted the importance of initiating combination therapy earlier in the T2D disease process to avoid clinical inertia and prevent the long-term complications arising from uncontrolled diabetes. Until recently, both GLP-1 RAs and basal insulin therapies were only available as single agents, but there are now two combination pen devices that deliver both a GLP-1 RA and basal insulin simultaneously. This article reviews the current clinical evidence evaluating the use of these combination GLP-1 RA/basal insulin preparations to treat T2D, presents both potential benefits as well as possible downsides with the use of these agents, and discusses the current place in therapy these products represent in the management of T2D.

1 INTRODUCTION

Several drug classes provide options for physicians to improve patients' control of type 2 diabetes. Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs) are a novel class of injectable antihyperglycaemic treatments that, when compared to traditional treatment options such as insulin and sulfonylureas (SUs), offer the advantage of regulating insulin secretion in proportion to ambient glucose levels, thus reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia and, at the same time, facilitating weight loss. 1 Various diabetes treatment algorithms include GLP‐1 RAs as a therapy option after initial treatment with metformin (MET). 2, 3, 4 Since the introduction of exenatide twice daily (BID) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in 2005, several GLP‐1 RAs have been developed and marketed. Increasingly, new GLP‐1 RAs are available as once‐weekly treatments rather than once‐ or twice‐daily options and in 2014, two new once‐weekly GLP‐1 RAs received marketing authorization: albiglutide and dulaglutide. 5, 6, 7, 8

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

Current Practice

Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes• Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

Understanding The Recommendation

We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making.

### The current and future role of insulin therapy in the management of type 2 diabetes: a narrative review [^113pTsKE]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Early initiation of intensive insulin therapy has been demonstrated to be effective in controlling glycemia and possibly preserving beta-cell function. Innovations in insulin formulations and delivery systems continue. However, we have seen an acceleration in the development of new classes of diabetes medications for individuals with type 2 diabetes and obesity, such as, for example, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). These formulations have been shown to confer significant benefits in achieving good glycemic control with reduced hypoglycemia risk, weight loss, and cardiorenal protection. Therefore, it is reasonable to question whether there is still a role for insulin therapy in the management of type 2 diabetes. However, there are clear limitations inherent to GLP-1 RA therapy, including high rates of suboptimal adherence and treatment discontinuation due to high cost and side effects, which diminish long-term efficacy, and supply issues. In addition, newer formulations have shown improvements in convenience and tolerability, and have been shown to be even more effective when used in conjunction with basal insulin. In this narrative review, we discuss current evidence that supports GLP-1 RA use in combination with insulin therapy and the potential pitfalls of reliance on GLP-1 RAs as a substitute for insulin therapy.

### What is the 'real-world' experience with fixed-ratio combination therapy (insulin + GLP-1 receptor agonist) in routine clinical practice? Take-home messages for clinicians regarding key outcomes [^115AGHkm]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

The fixed-ratio combinations (FRCs) of a basal insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), IDegLira (insulin degludec/liraglutide) and iGlarLixi (insulin glargine/lixisenatide), offer a once-daily injectable treatment option for adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D), combining complementary mechanisms of action to target both fasting and postprandial hyperglycaemia. While randomized controlled trials have demonstrated their efficacy and safety, real-world evidence (RWE) provides important insights into their effectiveness, tolerability and use across routine clinical practice.

Materials and Methods

This is a narrative review of selected real-world studies assessing the FRCs IDegLira and iGlarLixi in adults with T2D. Studies assessing the use of FRCs to intensify and simplify therapy, as well as their use in special populations such as older adults were reviewed and are summarized.

Results

Among individuals inadequately controlled on oral antihyperglycaemic drugs (OADs), basal insulin ± OADs, or GLP-1 RAs, initiation of FRC therapy consistently improved glycaemic outcomes, supported modest weight loss or stability, and was associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia. FRCs have also been evaluated as a strategy for simplifying complex insulin regimens. Transitions from basal-bolus or premixed insulin to FRCs maintained or improved glycaemic control while reducing total daily insulin dose and injection burden. Evidence in special populations and clinical contexts further supports the utility of FRCs. In older adults, FRC use was associated with reductions in HbA1c and hypoglycaemia risk, along with improvements in treatment satisfaction and functional measures. During Ramadan fasting, iGlarLixi demonstrated favourable glycaemic control, low hypoglycaemia incidence, modest weight loss and high adherence. Studies assessing glycaemic control using continuous glucose monitoring showed improvements in time in range, reductions in time above range and stable time below range, indicating enhanced glycaemic stability without increased risk of hypoglycaemia. Two real-world head-to-head studies comparing IDegLira and iGlarLixi found both FRCs to be effective and well tolerated. IDegLira was associated with greater weight loss and lower insulin dose requirements, while iGlarLixi showed advantages in postprandial glucose control. Both agents demonstrated significant improvements in HbA1c and low rates of hypoglycaemia.

Conclusions

Collectively, these real-world studies confirm that FRCs are effective, safe and patient-centred treatment options for adults with T2D. Their simplified dosing, metabolic benefits and favourable safety profiles support their use for both therapy intensification and de-intensification across a broad spectrum of clinical scenarios. These findings reinforce results from randomized controlled trials, providing further confidence in the role of FRCs in contemporary diabetes care.

### Differentiating among incretin-based therapies in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^117LhPMG]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have become important options for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. While the GLP-1R agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors act on the incretin system to regulate glucose homeostasis, there are important clinical differences among the five agents currently available in the U.S. For example, the GLP-1R agonists require subcutaneous administration, produce pharmacological levels of GLP-1 activity, promote weight loss, have a more robust glucose-lowering effect, and have a higher incidence of adverse gastrointestinal effects. In contrast, the DPP-4 inhibitors are taken orally, increase the half-life of endogenous GLP-1, are weight neutral, and are more commonly associated with nasopharyngitis. Differences in efficacy, safety, tolerability, and cost among the incretin-based therapies are important to consider in the primary care management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Strengths and Limitations of GLP-1 RA Therapy

Exenatide, the first commercial GLP-1 RA formulation, was introduced almost 20 years ago as a twice-daily injectable treatment for the management of T2D. Liraglutide and lixisenatide, given as once-daily injections, followed soon thereafter. These formulations are now widely available as once-daily and once-weekly injectables and once-daily oral medications. Most recently, we have seen the introduction of tirzepatide, which in a single molecular entity combines a GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIP RA) agonism to lower HbA1c and reduce body weight. Compared with insulin, these medications have been shown to improve glycemic control with lower hypoglycemia risk and reduce body weight.

The most notable weight loss has been observed in adults with T2D treated with tirzepatide. In a phase 3, double-blind, randomized trial involving 2539 adults with obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2), 50% of participants treated with tirzepatide at dosages of 10 mg and 15 mg per week experienced body weight reductions of ≥ 20% over a 72-week treatment period. Recent studies have also shown an association between GLP-1 RA therapy and significant cardiorenal protection.

Importantly, in a treat-to-target study of 814 suboptimally controlled adults treated with insulin lispro, Rosenstock et al. reported that 54% of participants who transitioned to a once-weekly GLP-1 RA (n = 412) were able to discontinue insulin therapy. In the remaining insulin + GLP-1 RA cohort, investigators observed improved glycemic control with reduced injections, lower insulin dosages, less hypoglycemia, and weight loss. Another significant benefit of GLP-1RA therapy is the cardiorenal protective quality of these formulation. In a recent systematic review and network meta-analysis of current diabetes medications, investigators reported that GLP-1 RA formulations were effective in reducing all-cause death, non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, and end-stage renal disease. Based on an emerging body of evidence, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends use of GLP-1 RA medications in all patients with demonstrated atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) or renal disease. The GLP-1 RA should be initiated regardless of insulin therapy or achievement of HbA1c or time in range (%TIR) goals.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists compared with basal insulins for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Ue1Eb]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

The RCT conducted by Bunck et al. 20 included 5 different doses of exenatide: 10 µg BID (62.1% of participants), 15 µg BID (3.4%), 10 µg 3 times daily (TID) (6.9%), 15 µg TID (3.4%) and 20 µg TID (17.2%). This RCT was included in the systematic literature review because the majority of participants (62.1%) received a licensed dose of exenatide (10 µg BID). However, because of the different doses of exenatide administered to patients as compared to other exenatide 10 µg BID trials, sensitivity analyses for HbA1c and weight were conducted to understand the impact of this trial on the overall pooled estimate and heterogeneity. This sensitivity analysis showed no impact on the overall effect estimate or heterogeneity measure for exenatide 10 µg BID vs insulin glargine with a pooled mean HbA1c change of +0.01% (95% CI, −0.11, 0.13; I² = 0%), (+3.2 mmol/L [95% CI, −1.2, 1.4]), which is the same as the pooled estimates when including the Bunck et al. trial.

3.2.2 Body weight

A summary of all evidence for bodyweight, as well as the pairwise meta‐analyses at 26 weeks, are presented in Figure 2 B. Compared with insulin glargine, the mean difference in bodyweight was −4.31 kg (95% CI, −4.71, −3.90; I² = 76%) with exenatide 10 µg, −2.85 kg (95% CI, −3.20, −2.49; I² = 96.5%) with exenatide 2 mg LAR, −4.65 kg (95% CI, −5.08, −4.22; I² = 89.1%) with liraglutide 1.8 mg, and −1.98 kg (95% CI, −2.32, −1.64, I² = 91%) with dulaglutide 0.75 mg. Removing the RCT conducted by Bunck et al. 20 minimally changed the overall effect estimate for exenatide 10 µg to −4.35 kg (95% CI, −4.77, −3.93; I² = 81.5%). Mean bodyweight and BMI change from baseline are presented in Table S3, Supporting Information.

Introduction

Many therapies are available for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and various clinical algorithms have been proposed to aid clinicians in the management of patients with T2D. Treatment usually starts with patient education, lifestyle-directed interventions to promote weight loss and increase physical activity, and with initiation of metformin (MET). As metabolic deterioration occurs over time, additional glucose-lowering agents are usually required to achieve and maintain targeted haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) goals. Initiation of insulin therapy is necessary for most T2D patients as β-cell function declines–.

In addition to glycaemic efficacy, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) therapy has potential for weight loss with low risk of hypoglycaemia–. In the comprehensive diabetes management algorithm for T2D by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), GLP-1 RA therapy in combination with MET is a recommended option for treatment of patients with HbA1c values ≥ 7.5% or in combination with two oral antihyperglycaemic medications (OAMs) for asymptomatic patients with HbA1c > 9.0%. Exenatide twice daily (BID) monotherapy or in combination with OAMs suppresses post-breakfast and post-dinner glycaemic excursions, but has limited impact on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels. The combination of basal insulin with short-acting GLP-1 RA offers the advantage of complementary pharmacologic effects to control both fasting and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) levels, respectively.
