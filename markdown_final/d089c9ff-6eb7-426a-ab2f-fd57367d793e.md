## Question

A patient presents with lateral left hip pain and tenderness in the left thigh, experiences pain when lying on that side, but has no pain with hip movement — what is the diagnosis and recommended treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what diagnosis best explains lateral left hip pain with focal tenderness, pain when lying on the affected side, and no pain with hip movement, and what treatment should be recommended. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the pattern is intra-articular or extra-articular. Then, I should generate and prune the differential diagnosis for lateral hip pain. Next, I will match the key features to GTPS versus alternatives, review the pathophysiology, and outline first-line conservative therapy. After that, I will evaluate the role of injections, imaging strategies, and indications for referral or surgery, and finally, I will propose a practical, staged care plan with reassessment checkpoints and red flags to monitor.

> Let me first confirm the symptom pattern points away from an intra-articular hip source. Pain localized to the lateral hip with point tenderness over the greater trochanter and pain when lying on that side is classic for peritrochanteric pathology, while the absence of pain with passive or active range of motion decreases the likelihood of intra-articular etiologies such as osteoarthritis, labral tears, or femoroacetabular impingement, which typically provoke pain with motion or provocative maneuvers [^114zZkPK] [^1116VEYT] [^116pY7t9].

> I need to check the lateral hip pain differential and see what still fits given these findings. Common considerations include greater trochanteric pain syndrome encompassing gluteus medius/minimus tendinopathy or tears and trochanteric bursitis, iliotibial band friction, referred pain from lumbar radiculopathy, meralgia paresthetica, and less commonly intra-articular processes presenting laterally; however, the negative motion-provoked pain and focal trochanteric tenderness keep GTPS at the top, whereas neurologic signs that would steer me toward radiculopathy or meralgia paresthetica are not described here [^114zZkPK] [^112kVU25].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify which bedside features further strengthen the GTPS hypothesis. Point tenderness over the greater trochanter, side-lying pain, and reproduction of pain with single-leg stance or resisted external derotation testing are supportive for GTPS, and the syndrome is fundamentally extra-articular, aligning with the preserved, painless hip motion described; if available, those focused tests would further increase diagnostic confidence at the bedside without immediate need for advanced imaging [^116CBQeA] [^1116VEYT] [^1176CjXJ].

> Let me consider the pathophysiology to ensure the treatment targets the driver. I should confirm whether GTPS is primarily inflammatory bursitis or abductor tendinopathy with mechanical overload, because that distinction guides therapy; contemporary evidence emphasizes abductor tendon degeneration and weakness as the predominant substrate, with true isolated bursitis representing a minority, and gluteus medius/minimus tear risk concentrated in the thinner anterolateral tendon footprint, especially in middle-aged women, which fits the typical epidemiology of GTPS [^116DmMVj] [^112kVU25] [^111XMJMA].

> Next, I should review first-line management that addresses mechanism while controlling symptoms. The cornerstone is a structured hip abductor strengthening and lumbopelvic control program, accompanied by short-term analgesia and activity modification such as avoiding prolonged standing and lying on the affected side; NSAIDs can help short-term if not contraindicated, although I need to acknowledge that the strongest NSAID evidence base is in hip osteoarthritis and we extrapolate pragmatically to peritrochanteric pain, so I should individualize based on comorbidity and response rather than assume identical effect sizes here [^116DmMVj] [^114zZkPK] [^116Udmoj].

> Wait, let me verify where injections fit and how to deliver them if needed. Corticosteroid injection into the peritrochanteric bursa or around the abductor tendons can provide short-term relief in selected patients, but given the tendinopathic substrate, injections should be adjuncts rather than substitutes for strengthening; dry needling appears noninferior to corticosteroid at 6 weeks in a small pragmatic RCT, suggesting a plausible lower-risk alternative when expertise is available, and importantly, fluoroscopic guidance has not shown outcome superiority over landmark-based techniques for trochanteric injections, implying that routine referral solely for fluoroscopy is unnecessary in most cases [^113y5qwj] [^112A3m96] [^116t3iWG].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought I should mandate ultrasound guidance because AAFP recommends point-of-care ultrasound guidance for hip injections; hold on, I should double-check the scope of that recommendation. The 2024 AAFP guidance specifically addresses intra-articular hip injections for osteoarthritis, so while ultrasound can improve anatomic accuracy for peritrochanteric injections and facilitate targeted deposition when bursitis is visualized, the high-quality evidence has not demonstrated superior clinical outcomes over well-executed landmark injections in GTPS; therefore, I can prefer ultrasound when available and especially if imaging shows active bursitis, but it is not obligatory for benefit and should not delay care [^114jQXmi] [^112A3m96] [^116t3iWG].

> Next, I should review when to image and when to escalate. If there is failure of a comprehensive conservative program over about 3 to 6 months, or if there are concerning signs such as marked abductor weakness, Trendelenburg gait, or suspicion for a full-thickness gluteus medius/minimus tear, then targeted imaging is appropriate; ultrasound can identify bursitis and guide injections dynamically, while MRI has high sensitivity and specificity for abductor tears and helps exclude alternate etiologies, although incidental peritrochanteric edema or bursae can be present and should be correlated clinically to avoid overcalling disease [^111XMJMA] [^112s7WJR] [^112kVU25].

> I will now examine the role for operative referral in recalcitrant or tear-confirmed cases. For persistent pain despite structured rehabilitation and appropriate injections, or for imaging-confirmed abductor tears with clinical dysfunction, endoscopic or open procedures such as bursectomy with iliotibial band release for impingement and endoscopic repair of gluteal tendon tears are reasonable, with series demonstrating symptomatic improvement, although most data are from lower-level evidence and should be individualized to patient goals, function, and tear chronicity and quality [^115A99B4] [^11554DR2] [^116H6mz3] [^111XMJMA].

> But wait, what if the context is post–total hip arthroplasty or there are mixed pain generators. I need to ensure I am not missing iliopsoas or other soft-tissue sources and recognize that peritrochanteric pain after arthroplasty is common and multifactorial; diagnostic ultrasound-guided anesthetic injections can help localize the pain generator, and even in the arthroplasty population, most patients respond to nonoperative care, reserving surgery for persistent, well-localized pathology after systematic evaluation [^116XLWPL] [^116jpGFz] [^113XoH6d].

> Bringing this together, I should confirm the working diagnosis as greater trochanteric pain syndrome given the lateral hip pain, trochanteric tenderness, side-lying aggravation, and painless range of motion, and initiate a staged plan: immediate referral to physical therapy focused on abductor strengthening and pelvic stability with activity modification and short-term NSAIDs if appropriate; reassess at 6 to 8 weeks to verify pain and function gains and adherence; consider an adjunct peritrochanteric corticosteroid or dry needling intervention if pain limits rehabilitation; and if symptoms persist beyond roughly 3 to 6 months or significant abductor dysfunction emerges, obtain targeted imaging to evaluate for abductor tears and discuss surgical options if indicated, all while monitoring for alternative or concomitant sources of pain as suggested by history and exam [^114zZkPK] [^116DmMVj] [^113y5qwj] [^111XMJMA].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS)**, given lateral hip pain, tenderness over the greater trochanter, pain when lying on the affected side, and no pain with hip movement [^113bw672] [^1176CjXJ]. First-line treatment is **conservative management**, including activity modification, NSAIDs, and a structured physical therapy program focused on hip abductor strengthening and IT band stretching [^111XMJMA]. If symptoms persist, consider ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection [^116t3iWG]; surgery is **reserved for refractory cases** [^11554DR2] [^116H6mz3].

---

## Clinical diagnosis

GTPS is a **clinical diagnosis** characterized by:

- **Pain location**: Lateral hip pain localized over the greater trochanter [^114zZkPK].

- **Tenderness**: Point tenderness over the greater trochanter [^1176CjXJ].

- **Night pain**: Pain exacerbated by lying on the affected side [^116pY7t9].

- **ROM**: No pain with passive or active hip range of motion [^113bw672].

- **Trendelenburg**: Positive Trendelenburg sign due to hip abductor weakness [^112kVU25].

This presentation aligns with these features, supporting a **diagnosis of GTPS** [^1116VEYT].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Other conditions causing **lateral hip pain** include:

- **Gluteal tendinopathy**: Often coexists with GTPS [^1176CjXJ].

- **IT band syndrome**: Typically presents with lateral knee pain [^116F9mxq].

- **Hip osteoarthritis**: Usually causes anterior groin pain and pain with hip movement [^113bw672] [^114zZkPK].

- **Lumbar radiculopathy**: Often associated with back pain and neurological symptoms [^113bw672] [^114zZkPK].

The absence of hip joint pain and neurological symptoms, along with localized tenderness, make GTPS the **most likely diagnosis** [^113bw672].

---

## Recommended treatment

### Conservative management (first-line)

- **Activity modification**: Avoid prolonged standing, stair climbing, and lying on the affected side [^1176CjXJ].

- **NSAIDs**: Reduce pain and inflammation [^116Udmoj].

- **Physical therapy**: Focus on hip abductor strengthening and IT band stretching [^111XMJMA].

- **Weight loss**: If overweight, to reduce mechanical stress [^116pY7t9].

---

### Interventional management (if conservative measures fail)

If conservative measures fail, **interventional options** include **corticosteroid injection** — an ultrasound-guided injection into the trochanteric bursa for short-term pain relief [^112befHJ] — and **dry needling**, an alternative to corticosteroid injection that is non-inferior for pain reduction [^113y5qwj].

---

### Surgical management (rarely indicated)

Surgery is **rarely indicated** and is **reserved for refractory cases**; options include arthroscopic bursectomy or gluteal tendon repair [^11554DR2] [^116H6mz3].

---

## Prognosis

Most patients experience **significant improvement** with conservative management [^116pY7t9]. Persistent symptoms may require corticosteroid injections or, rarely, surgical intervention [^112befHJ].

---

The patient's presentation is most consistent with **GTPS**, and the recommended treatment is **conservative management** with activity modification, NSAIDs, and physical therapy [^1176CjXJ]. If conservative measures fail, corticosteroid injection or dry needling may be considered, with surgery **reserved for refractory cases**.

Optimal management of patients presenting with lateral hip and/or thigh pain requires a systematic approach for accurate diagnosis of underlying pathology contributing to symptoms. This section describes evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the most common causes of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults.

- **Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS)**: GTPS is defined as pain and tenderness to palpation over the greater trochanter (GT). Until the early 2000s, this entity was most frequently called "greater trochanteric bursitis"; however, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that approximately 20% of people with tenderness over the GT have imaging-proven bursitis. Non-inflammatory pathology is often seen on imaging, such as gluteal tendonosis, gluteal tendon tears, and/or enthesopathy at the GT. GTPS is often caused by relative weakness of the hip abductor muscles, especially the gluteus medius, which leads to excessive gluteal tendon shearing over the GT and eventual tendonopathy.

GTPS often coexists with other musculoskeletal lumbopelvic and hip conditions. Additionally, it is often a secondary pain generator resulting from suboptimal biomechanics. In fact, in people with low back pain, GTPS has a prevalence of up to 45% and it commonly occurs in people with knee osteoarthritis, as well. GTPS is more common in women, possibly because they have a wider pelvis structure. It may be associated with nighttime pain when lying on the affected side, pain with prolonged standing, and pain or paresthesias.

### Hip pain in adults: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113bw672]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Adults commonly present to their family physicians with hip pain, and diagnosing the cause is important for prescribing effective therapy. Hip pain is usually located anteriorly, laterally, or posteriorly. Anterior hip pain includes referred pain from intra-abdominal or intrapelvic causes; extra-articular etiologies, such as hip flexor injuries; and intra-articular etiologies. Intra-articular pain is often caused by a labral tear or femoroacetabular impingement in younger adults or osteoarthritis in older adults.

Lateral hip pain is most commonly caused by greater trochanteric pain syndrome, which includes gluteus medius tendinopathy or tear, bursitis, and iliotibial band friction. Posterior hip pain includes referred pain such as lumbar spinal pathology, deep gluteal syndrome with sciatic nerve entrapment, ischiofemoral impingement, and hamstring tendinopathy.

In addition to the history and physical examination, radiography, ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed for a definitive diagnosis. Radiography of the hip and pelvis should be the initial imaging test. Ultrasound-guided anesthetic injections can aid in the diagnosis of an intra-articular cause of pain. Because femoroacetabular impingement, labral tears, and gluteus medius tendon tears typically have good surgical outcomes, advanced imaging and/or early referral may improve patient outcomes.

- **Trochanteric bursitis**: Trochanteric bursitis (TB), or inflammation of one or more of the peri-trochanteric bursae, has historically been considered a primary source of lateral hip pain, with an approximate prevalence of 4.4% to 29% in patients post-THA. A proposed cause is repetitive friction between the greater trochanter (GT) and the iliotibial band, commonly associated with overuse, trauma, and altered gait patterns. Teng et al. investigated the effect of performing a bursectomy during primary THA. In this study, 550 patients underwent routine bursectomy, while 400 did not. At an 11-year follow-up, the incidence of TB was unaffected by whether a bursectomy was performed.

	- Furthermore, White et al. recently conducted a risk factor analysis for the development of trochanteric bursitis, evaluating 1,094 patients, of whom 103 (9.4%) developed TB. The incidence varied slightly by surgical approach: 8.7% for the posterior approach, 10.8% for the direct anterior approach, and 4.2% for the direct lateral approach. However, the surgical approach was not identified as a notable risk factor. Among the variables analyzed, only sex was markedly associated with increased risk; women had a 1.79 times higher risk of developing TB. Notably, changes in acetabular offset, femoral offset, total offset, and leg length between preoperative and postoperative radiographs were not associated with an increased risk of TB in either univariate or multivariate models.

- **Clinical presentation**: Patients usually complain of lateral thigh pain, often aggravated by prolonged sitting or stair climbing, with a tender area on the GT.

### Trochanteric bursitis after total hip arthroplasty: Incidence and evaluation of response to treatment [^1141UhAe]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2010). Low credibility.

We examined the efficacy of corticosteroid injections as a treatment for post-arthroplasty trochanteric bursitis and assessed the risk factors for nonoperative treatment failure. There were 32 (4.6%) cases of postsurgical trochanteric bursitis among 689 primary total hip arthroplasties. Of the 25 hips with follow-up, 11 (45%) required multiple injections. Symptoms resolved in 20 (80%), but persisted in 5. We found no statistically significant differences between patients who developed trochanteric bursitis and those who did not, nor between those who responded to treatment and those who did not. There was a trend toward younger age and greater limb-length discrepancy in nonresponders. In conclusion:

- **Corticosteroid injections are effective**: for postoperative trochanteric bursitis.
- **Nonoperative management may fail more likely**: in young patients and those with leg-length discrepancies.

### Dry needling versus cortisone injection in the treatment of greater trochanteric pain syndrome: A noninferiority randomized clinical trial [^113y5qwj]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, and partially blinded trial. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), previously termed greater trochanteric or subgluteal bursitis, is commonly treated with cortisone (corticosteroid) injection into the lateral hip. However, the efficacy of this treatment is under scrutiny. An alternative treatment with fewer adverse effects could be beneficial.

The objective was to investigate whether dry needling (DN) is noninferior to cortisone injection for reducing lateral hip pain and improving function in patients with GTPS. Forty-three participants (50 hips observed) were randomly assigned to receive either cortisone injection or DN. Treatments occurred over six weeks, with clinical outcomes assessed at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 weeks. The primary outcome was the numeric pain-rating scale (0–10), while the secondary outcome was the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (0–10). Medication usage for pain was gathered as a tertiary outcome.

Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. A noninferiority test for repeated measures of pain and averaged function scores at 6 weeks, using a noninferiority margin of 1.5 for both outcomes, demonstrated DN's noninferiority compared to cortisone injection (both p < 0.01). Medication usage did not differ significantly between groups (P = 0.74) at this point. No adverse side effects were reported.

Perhaps the most common local cause of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults is GTPS. Gluteus medius weakness is often a significant contributor to the development of GTPS. As a result, hip abductor strengthening exercises should be the first-line treatment of this syndrome in conjunction with medication. While medications and modalities may provide temporary symptomatic relief, pain will likely recur if the underlying weakness is not addressed. Additionally, since GTPS and other lumbopelvic conditions often coexist, it is important to perform a thorough history and physical examination to evaluate for the possibility of multiple pain generators as well.

- **Lateral hip and/or thigh pain causes**: In the older adult with CLBP, pain can be from numerous causes, with the most common being greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS), hip osteoarthritis, lumbar radiculopathy/radiculitis, and lumbar spinal stenosis. Meralgia paresthetica should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. Often, lateral hip and/or thigh pain is multifactorial.

- **Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS)**: GTPS is a common cause of lateral hip pain and is usually due to weakness of the gluteus medius muscle. Hip abductor strengthening is the first-line treatment for GTPS. True GT bursitis causing GTPS occurs in a minority of cases; therefore, corticosteroid injections should be used sparingly, ideally only when there is imaging evidence of bursitis. Injections should always be accompanied by a hip abductor strengthening program.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: A scoping review [^112kVU25]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Recent advances in diagnostic imaging techniques and soft tissue endoscopy now allow for precise diagnosis and management of extra-articular hip pathology. The aim of this scoping review is to present an evidence-based update of the relevant literature focusing only on the pathoanatomy, clinical assessment, and diagnosis of pathology in the peritrochanteric space.

A literature search was performed on PubMed to include articles that reported on the anatomy and diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome, trochanteric bursitis, gluteus medius tears, and external snapping hip syndrome.

A total of 542 studies were identified, of which 49 articles were included for full-text analysis for the scoping review. Peritrochanteric space pathology can be broadly classified into the following:

- **Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS)**.

- **Abductor tears**.

- **External snapping hip syndrome**.

Anatomically, the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fascia lata work in conjunction to abduct and internally rotate the hip. The anterolateral part of the gluteus medius tendon is more prone to tears due to a thin tendinous portion. Increased acetabular anteversion has also been shown to be associated with gluteal and trochanteric bursitis.

In terms of clinical examination, tests which were found to be most useful for assisting in the diagnoses of lateral hip pain were the single-leg stance, resisted external derotation of the hip, hip lag sign, and the Trendelenburg's test. Dynamic ultrasound along with guided injections and MRI scan do assist in differentiating the pathology.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: a scoping review [^114TKnep]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Gluteus medius is the largest and perhaps the most complex of the three hip abductors. This muscle has three areas of origin: the gluteal fossa, the gluteal aponeurosis, and the posterior inferior edge of the lip of the iliac crest. There are also three points of insertion of the gluteus medius tendon. The tendinous portion of the aponeurosis inserts onto the superolateral facet of the greater trochanter, while the remainder inserts along an anteroinferior oblique line running on the lateral facet. In Flack's cadaveric investigation, the majority of muscle fascicles inserted onto the deep portion with a more proximal insertion on the greater trochanter than the superficial part of the tendon. A small cadaveric series found that the tendon length was significantly longer in males, but the gross muscle volume was not significantly different on a gender basis. Innervation of the gluteus medius is from branches of the superior gluteal nerve, which passes between the gluteus minimus and medius, pierces and then branches in the gluteus medius, and finally enters the tensor fasciae latae (TFL) in its mid-length. The gluteus medius abducts and internally rotates the hip joint, and stabilizes the pelvis during locomotion, thereby preventing a pelvic drop. Tsutsumi et al. evaluated 25 hips in 15 Japanese cadavers and found that the anterolateral part of the gluteus medius tendon was thin compared to the posterior part, which may well be the reason for this area being more prone to tears.

### Prevalence of contralateral hip abductor tears and factors associated with symptomatic progression [^115fnLxk]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with gluteus medius tendinopathy present with laterally based hip pain that can be diagnosed under the greater trochanteric pain syndrome diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can assist in diagnosing the pathology of the symptomatic hip. When a pelvic MRI includes both hips, the clinician may identify asymptomatic tears in the nonsurgical hip. In patients who undergo unilateral gluteus medius repairs, little is known about the prevalence or subsequent onset of clinical symptoms in the nonsurgical hip.

- **Purpose**: To describe (1) the prevalence of asymptomatic contralateral gluteus medius tears in patients with unilateral symptoms, (2) the presentation and time before symptom onset, and (3) the morphological characteristics on MRI of future symptomatic tears.

- **Study design**: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

- **Methods**: A total of 51 consecutive patients who underwent gluteus medius tear surgery were reviewed for contralateral hip pathology; of these, 43 patients were 2 years out from index surgery with reviewable preoperative MRI scans. A musculoskeletal radiologist reviewed the MRI scans for tear size, tendon retraction, and fatty infiltration using the Goutallier-Fuchs grading system. Medical record review identified contralateral hips requiring subsequent treatment.

- **Results**: Of the original 43 patients, 10 (23%) had no contralateral tear, 19 (44%) had low-grade partial tears, 9 (20%) had high-grade partial tears, and 5 (11%) had full-thickness tears. Thirty-seven patients had unilateral symptoms; the other 6 had mild contralateral hip pain.

### Arthroscopic bursectomy with concomitant iliotibial band release for the treatment of recalcitrant trochanteric bursitis [^115A99B4]. Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Trochanteric bursitis with lateral hip pain is a commonly encountered orthopaedic condition. Although most patients respond to corticosteroid injections, rest, physical therapy, stretching, and anti-inflammatory medications, those with recalcitrant symptoms may require operative intervention. Studies have explored the use of the arthroscope in the treatment of these patients; however, these reports have not addressed the underlying pathology in this chronic condition. We believe that the iliotibial band must be addressed as it is the main cause of pain, inflammation, and trochanteric impingement leading to the development of bursitis.

We report a new technique for arthroscopic trochanteric bursectomy with iliotibial band release. Our technique involves two incisions: one 4 cm proximal to the greater trochanter along the anterior border of the iliotibial band and the other 4 cm distal along the posterior border. The 30-degree arthroscope is introduced through the inferior portal, and a cannula is introduced through the superior portal. A 5.5-mm arthroscopic shaver is inserted through the superior cannula to clear off the surface of the iliotibial band, allowing for adequate visualization. A hooked electrocautery probe is then used to longitudinally incise the iliotibial band until it no longer rubs, causing impingement over the greater trochanter.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic injection of the hip and knee [^117UDdW2]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Joint injection of the hip and knee regions is a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool for the family physician. In this article, the injection procedure for the greater trochanteric bursa, the knee joint, the pes anserine bursa, the iliotibial band, and the prepatellar bursa is reviewed.

- **Greater trochanteric bursa injection**: Indications include acute and chronic inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, repetitive use, and other traumatic injuries to the area.
- **Knee joint injection**: Aspiration may be performed to aid in the diagnosis of an unexplained effusion and relieve discomfort caused by an effusion. Injection of the knee can be performed for viscosupplementation or corticosteroid therapy. Indications for corticosteroid injection include advanced osteoarthritis and other inflammatory arthritides, such as gout or calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease.
- **Aspiration and corticosteroid injection**: Swelling and tenderness of the pes anserine or prepatellar bursae can be relieved with these treatments.
- **Iliotibial band syndrome**: Persistent pain and disability respond to local injection therapy.

The proper technique, choice and quantity of pharmaceuticals, and appropriate follow-up are essential for effective outcomes.

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: Current concept [^114PM8nb]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Domb et al. have suggested that partial tears of the gluteus medius and minimus tendon insertions to the greater trochanter can be misdiagnosed as trochanteric bursitis, and this may be a source of chronic debilitating lateral hip pain. The authors presented an endoscopic technique that enables the visualization, debridement, and repair of these tears. Furthermore, they suggested that the diagnosis of gluteus tendinopathy or rupture should initially be made clinically. Clinical examination includes palpation for tenderness, Trendelenburg testing, abduction strength testing, and resisted external rotation in the supine position with the hip flexed at 90°.

Theoretically, the pathology in the short rotator muscle tendons could contribute to the symptoms experienced by patients with osteoarthritic hips or degenerative lumbar disease. It is interesting to speculate that, by intervening early in the tendinous disease, it might be possible to reduce the symptoms of OA or even slow the process.

The treatment of tendinosis in patients with mild and moderate OA might therefore be an option to reduce the symptoms. Injections of platelet-rich plasma, physiotherapy, and also radiofrequency microtenotomy of the small rotator muscle tendons in the hip region are treatment options to consider when it comes to reducing the symptoms in these patients. Favorable results have been reported after using microtenotomy for the treatment of tendinosis in lateral epicondylitis and patellar and rotator cuff tendinosis.

### Successful treatment of gluteal pain from obturator internus tendinitis and bursitis with ultrasound-guided injection [^1138m6qy]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

This case report describes the first documented instance of a patient with obturator internus tendinitis and bursitis being successfully treated with a corticosteroid injection using a trans-tendinous lateral to medial approach. The patient presented with right gluteal pain that was not relieved by physical therapy or existing interventions such as right hip and ischial bursa corticosteroid injections. Pelvic and lumbar spine MRIs, along with EMG/NCS findings, were unremarkable. Physical examination revealed tenderness to palpation in the right middle lower gluteal region. Ultrasound imaging with sonopalpation pinpointed the maximum local tender point as the right obturator internus muscle and/or its underlying bursa.

A 22-gauge, 3.5-inch needle was inserted in-plane to the transducer and longitudinal to the obturator internus from a lateral to medial direction, an approach previously described in cadaver studies. The obturator internus tendon sheath and bursa were injected with 2.5 mL of 0.5% lidocaine combined with 10 mg of triamcinolone. The patient reported immediate and complete relief of pain, with sustained relief at 2 and 6 months post-injection. This case report demonstrates that the injection of the obturator internus tendon sheath and bursa using a trans-tendinous approach may be successful for treating patients with persistent gluteal pain due to obturator internus tendinitis and bursitis.

### 'Bald trochanter' spontaneous rupture of the conjoined tendons of the gluteus medius and minimus presenting as a trochanteric bursitis [^115Ga36R]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old white woman presented with progressive complaints of right lateral hip and thigh pain associated with a disabling limp, without an antecedent history of trauma. Physical examination revealed localized pain over the right greater trochanter to palpation. A full, pain-free range of motion of the right hip was associated with weakness in the hip abductors. The patient ambulated with a compensated right Trendelenburg gait.

Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a trochanteric bursitis and an effusion of the hip, as well as a full-thickness tear of the gluteus medius muscle, with both a disruption and retraction of the tendon of an atretic gluteus minimus muscle. Conjoined tendon pathology of both the gluteus medius and minimus, as revealed by magnetic resonance examination, is probably more frequent than heretofore commonly recognized. In patients presenting with "intractable" complaints of a trochanteric bursitis and an ambulatory limp due to weakness in the hip abductors, imaging studies highlighting a possible tendon rupture may be diagnostic.

### Atypical hip pain in femoroacetabular impingement: A comparison of outcomes based on primary hip pain location [^113ayDoT]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) typically have anterior groin pain. However, a subset of these patients may have pain located laterally, posteriorly, or in a combination of locations around the hip.

- **Purpose**: To report and compare outcomes of hip arthroscopy for patients with FAI and atypical hip pain versus classic anterior groin pain.

- **Study design**: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for FAI between August 2011 and March 2013 were identified. A total of 258 patients were diagnosed with symptomatic FAI based on clinical, radiographic, and advanced imaging. Exclusion criteria included isolated thigh, knee, or low back pain, as well as hip abductor pathology and trochanteric bursitis. Of the 226 patients ultimately included, 159 (70.4%) reported anterior groin pain, while 67 (29.6%) experienced isolated lateral or posterior hip pain or a combination. Patients were categorized into four groups: isolated anterior groin pain, lateral hip pain, posterior hip pain, and multiple primary hip pain locations (combined). These patients were followed prospectively for a minimum of 2 years. Data recorded included patient characteristics, surgical characteristics, modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), Non-arthritic Hip Score (NAHS), revision hip arthroscopy, and conversions to total hip arthroplasty (THA).

- **Results**: All 226 patients were included at final follow-up. Hip arthroscopy was performed by a single sports medicine fellowship-trained surgeon.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Multicentre randomised controlled trial [^114d9eDh]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

When stratified by the number of injections — one injection (all blind injections plus intra-bursal on the first attempt in the fluoroscopy group) versus more than one injection (two or more attempts for intra-bursal spread in the fluoroscopy group) — the outcomes for single and multiple injection groups were essentially comparable. Although the decrease in the mean Oswestry Disability Index score was significantly greater in the single injection group (P = 0.003), we found a greater improvement in the multiple injection group for the SF-36 general health subscale (P = 0.02).

When examined by location of injection, no significant differences existed between the intra-bursal and extra-bursal groups. However, we noted trends for greater improvement in pain at rest at three months and the SF-36 general health category for intra-bursal injections, and for drug reduction and the SF-36 vitality index for extra-bursal spread of contrast.

At the time of discharge, blinding was assessed by an independent evaluator.

The clinical course of the patient involved a diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), which included an inflammatory component as evidenced by bursitis seen on ultrasound. She was educated on hip abductor strengthening exercises; however, she was not interested in performing the exercises regularly. Instead, she requested a corticosteroid injection. Consequently, an ultrasound-guided greater trochanteric bursa injection was performed by the ultrasound-trained physiatrist.

### Does surgical approach in total hip arthroplasty affect postoperative corticosteroid injection requirements [^111kfwtz]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). High credibility.

Corticosteroid injections following total hip arthroplasty (THA) are commonly used to address soft tissue pathology such as bursitis and tendinitis. The THA surgical approaches differ in the extent of muscle and soft tissue dissection. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of surgical approach on postoperative corticosteroid injection requirements while controlling for multiple covariates. A secondary aim was to identify risk factors associated with the various injection types.

- **Methods**: This was a propensity-matched retrospective study of 10,907 THA patients from June 2016 to December 2022 at a single urban academic health center. Patients were stratified into cohorts based on the following surgical approaches: anterior (n = 4,287) and posterior (n = 6,620). These groups were then propensity-matched 1:1 with nearest neighbor matching to form two cohorts of 4,287 patients. Baseline characteristics and corticosteroid injection data for soft-tissue pathology were obtained and analyzed. Chi-square and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the impact of patient and surgical factors on receiving postoperative steroid injections.

- **Results**: A posterior approach conferred increased risk of postoperative injections (adjusted odds ratio 1.242, P = 0.001) after controlling for multiple covariates. The posterior approach also had higher total rates of greater trochanter bursitis injections postoperatively compared to the anterior group (11.5% versus 7.3%, P < 0.001). Both surgical approaches demonstrated comparable rates of iliopsoas bursitis injections.

### Editorial commentary: It is imperative to fix symptomatic hip gluteus medius tears at time of femoroacetabular impingement: Why ignore this pain in the butt [^111vuBGV]. Arthroscopy (2022). Low credibility.

The hip can present with various pathologies leading to different symptoms. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome, historically attributed to bursitis, has been largely associated with lesions of the gluteus medius and minimus tendons. The prevalence of gluteus medius pathology in patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is as high as one-third of the FAI population. If a patient exhibits significant clinical symptoms of both FAI and a gluteus medius tear, it is imperative to address both pathologies.

The most crucial diagnostic predictor in hip arthroscopy is not magnetic resonance imaging but a well-executed history and physical examination. We employ a quadrant approach:

- **Medial quadrant**: Accounts for adductor bursitis, adductor tears, pudendal neuralgia, or sports hernias.
- **Posterior quadrant**: May account for a hamstring tear, lumbar radiculopathy, ischiofemoral impingement, or, in rare cases, piriformis syndrome.
- **Anterior quadrant**: Accounts for intraarticular pathologies, including FAI, labral tears, osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, or iliopsoas bursitis.
- **Lateral quadrant**: Includes greater trochanteric pain syndrome, gluteus medius and minimus tears, external snapping hip syndrome, and iliotibial band syndrome.

By using this systematic approach and magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis, we can accurately determine patients' hip pathologies.

- **Risk of ectopic pregnancy**: Advise the patient about the risks of ectopic pregnancy, including the loss of fertility. Teach her to recognize and promptly report any symptoms of ectopic pregnancy to her healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Risks of intrauterine pregnancy**: Advise the patient to contact her healthcare provider if she thinks she might be pregnant. Inform her about the risks of intrauterine pregnancy while using Mirena, including the risks of leaving Mirena in place and the risks associated with removing Mirena or probing of the uterus. If Mirena cannot be removed in a pregnant patient, advise her to report immediately any symptom that suggests complications of the pregnancy. Additionally, inform her of isolated reports of virilization of the female fetus following local exposure to LNG during pregnancy with an LNG IUS in place [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Special Populations (8.1)].

- **Sepsis**: Counsel the patient that severe infection or sepsis, including Group A streptococcal sepsis (GAS), can occur within the first few days after Mirena is inserted. Instruct her to contact a healthcare provider immediately if she develops severe pain or fever shortly after Mirena is inserted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Multicentre randomised controlled trial [^112befHJ]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

In order to determine whether fluoroscopy should be routinely used during trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injections, we conducted a multicentre, randomised controlled study comparing fluoroscopically guided and blind procedures. This question is relevant for two reasons. Firstly, greater trochanteric pain syndrome is a clinical diagnosis, but recent studies have shown that only a small percentage of patients who meet inclusion criteria for greater trochanteric pain syndrome have radiological evidence of bursal inflammation. Extra-bursal hip injections might therefore be as effective as, or even superior to, intra-bursal trochanteric injections. Secondly, administering any injection under radiographic guidance usually requires pain management services, which adds to the cost of treatment. Additionally, the delays inherent in obtaining subspecialty care can impair treatment outcomes.

### Hip pain in adults: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^114zZkPK]. American Family Physician (2021). High credibility.

Hip pain in adults can stem from various causes, including gluteal tendinitis, hip osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, atypical femoral fracture, and trochanteric bursitis. Additional conditions such as lumbar radiculopathy, septic arthritis of the hip, and hip osteomyelitis also contribute to hip discomfort. Other possibilities to consider are hip fracture, osteochondritis dissecans, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, acetabular dysplasia, and slipped upper femoral epiphysis.

Pediatric conditions like Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease and conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, osteonecrosis, and hip osteonecrosis should also be considered. Beyond these, axial spondyloarthritis, hip labral tear, iliopsoas bursitis, and avascular necrosis of the femoral head may be potential causes. Sacroiliac joint dysfunction, piriformis syndrome, and snapping hip syndrome can manifest as hip pain too.

Other less common but significant causes include Paget's disease, femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, gout, synovial chondromatosis, and hip dislocation. Rare causes to consider are chondrosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and bone metastasis.

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome: A review of anatomy, diagnosis and treatment [^116pY7t9]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a term used to describe chronic pain overlying the lateral aspect of the hip. This regional pain syndrome, once described as trochanteric bursitis, often mimics pain generated from other sources, including but not limited to myofascial pain, degenerative joint disease, and spinal pathology. The incidence of greater trochanteric pain is reported to be approximately 1.8 patients per 1000 per year, with the prevalence being higher in women and patients with coexisting low back pain, osteoarthritis, iliotibial band tenderness, and obesity.

Symptoms of GTPS consist of persistent pain in the lateral hip radiating along the lateral aspect of the thigh to the knee and occasionally below the knee and/or buttock. Physical examination reveals point tenderness in the posterolateral area of the greater trochanter. Most cases of GTPS are self-limited, with conservative measures, such as physical therapy, weight loss, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and behavior modification, providing resolution of symptoms. Other treatment modalities include bursa or lateral hip injections performed with corticosteroid and local anesthetic. More invasive surgical interventions have anecdotally been reported to provide pain relief when conservative treatment modalities fail.

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome [^1176CjXJ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Patients who have lateral hip pain have historically been diagnosed with trochanteric bursitis and treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroid injections, and physical therapy. Although this strategy is effective for most patients, a substantial number continue to experience pain and functional limitations. Over the past decade, our understanding of disorders occurring in the peritrochanteric space has increased dramatically. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome encompasses trochanteric bursitis, external coxa saltans (i.e. snapping hip), and abductor tendinopathy. A thorough understanding of the anatomy, examination findings, and imaging characteristics aids the clinician in treating these patients. Open and endoscopic treatment options are available for use when nonsurgical treatment is unsuccessful.

### Iliotibial band syndrome: a common source of knee pain [^116F9mxq]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Iliotibial band syndrome is a common knee injury. The most common symptom is lateral knee pain caused by inflammation of the distal portion of the iliotibial band, which is a thick band of fascia that crosses the hip joint and extends distally to insert on the patella, tibia, and biceps femoris tendon. In some athletes, repetitive flexion and extension of the knee causes the distal iliotibial band to become irritated and inflamed, resulting in diffuse lateral knee pain. This syndrome can cause significant morbidity and may lead to the cessation of exercise.

Although iliotibial band syndrome is easily diagnosed clinically, it can be extremely challenging to treat. Effective treatment requires active patient participation and compliance with activity modification. Most patients respond to conservative treatment, which involves stretching the iliotibial band, strengthening the gluteus medius, and altering training regimens. Corticosteroid injections should be considered if visible swelling or pain with ambulation persists for more than three days after initiating treatment. A small percentage of patients are refractory to conservative treatment and may require surgical release of the iliotibial band.

### Response to: Rho et al. "Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: Lateral hip and thigh pain" [^115gjHEV]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Dear Editor,

It was with great interest that we reviewed the article by Rho et al, "Deconstructing Chronic Low Back Pain in the Older Adult-Step by Step Evidence and Expert-Based Recommendations for Evaluation and Treatment. Part VIII: Lateral Hip and Thigh Pain". We applaud the authors for addressing the common issue of lateral hip pain and their thoughtful, evidence-supported discussion regarding the diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) rather than the commonly used and inaccurate term "greater trochanteric bursitis".

The authors nicely review the literature, summarizing that there is a lack of findings on MRI and ultrasound, as well as in histological evidence, to support the diagnosis of "bursitis" and/or "tendinitis" in the vast majority of these patients. Additionally, we fully agree with the authors' observation that there is a lack of inflammatory findings in patients suffering from GTPS and that effective treatment consists of strengthening the weak hip abductors, which are often noted in these patients. We have found this to be true in the patients we have treated with GTPS. The authors also note the deficiency of evidence for the use of corticosteroid injections, citing both the potential systemic side effects and the now well-known toxic effects of corticosteroids on tenocytes, which they note "can potentially contribute to progressive tendinopathy and partial tears".

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Multicentre randomised controlled trial [^112A3m96]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

The principal finding of this study suggests that the use of fluoroscopy does not improve outcomes in patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome who receive corticosteroid injections. This is consistent with our secondary finding showing comparable success rates for intra-bursal and extra-bursal injections. The results from this pilot study should not be surprising, considering that most patients clinically diagnosed with greater trochanteric pain syndrome have no radiological evidence of bursal inflammation. Even among patients with actual "trochanteric bursitis", many develop secondary pathology in adjacent tissues. In these patients, using radiographic guidance to direct the needle into the bursa in cases with an extra-bursal pain generator might be counterproductive. Subgroup analysis did not reveal any significant differences in outcomes between fluoroscopy patients who needed more than one needle placement before injection (45% success rate at three months) and patients in whom only one injection attempt was made (44% success rate).

Our results suggest that a referral to a pain specialist with fluoroscopic capability is not warranted in most patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome who present to a primary care doctor, physiatrist, or surgeon, all of whom often encounter this condition. The delay in treatment entailed by referral to a subspecialty may even be detrimental, as previous interventional studies have found an inverse relation between duration of pain and likelihood of success.

### The accuracy of clinical symptoms and signs for the diagnosis of serious bacterial infection in young febrile children: prospective cohort study of 15 781 febrile illnesses [^116CLzPo]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

Definite bacteraemia was defined as a pure growth of a single pathogenic micro-organism on blood culture or polymerase chain reaction positive for Meningococcus. Probable bacteraemia was defined as the growth of two or more types of organisms (with at least one not a likely contaminant), growth of Streptococci viridans or other likely contaminant if the final diagnosis was endocarditis, or persistently positive blood cultures (that is, two or more blood cultures positive for the same type of organism). Given the very low frequency of meningitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis, we decided not to undertake diagnostic modelling for these outcomes because the risk of unreliable and potentially misleading models was unacceptably high. Children with one of these diagnoses were not included in the analysis.

All probable cases of serious bacterial infection were reviewed by a final diagnosis committee composed of two specialist paediatricians (with experience in paediatrics, infectious disease, and respiratory medicine) and, in cases of pneumonia, a radiologist. The presence or absence of bacterial infection was decided blinded to clinical information and based on consensus. Where a reference standard test (urine or blood culture, or chest radiograph) was performed outside the hospital, the report and films were obtained for review. Uncertain results and all abnormal chest radiographs were reviewed by the final diagnosis committee.

Children were classified into three categories: serious bacterial infection, clinically diagnosed infection, and no bacterial infection.

### Clinical practice guideline: Otitis media with effusion (update) [^111Wexzb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for otitis media with effusion (OME), particularly concerning indications for screening, the AAO-HNSF 2016 guidelines recommend evaluating at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of certain at-risk conditions and at 12–18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time).

- **Permanent hearing loss**: Independent of OME.
- **Speech and language disorders**: Suspected or confirmed speech and language delay or disorder.
- **Developmental disorders**: Autism spectrum disorder and other pervasive developmental disorders.
- **Syndromes and craniofacial disorders**: Syndromes such as Down syndrome or craniofacial disorders, including cognitive, speech, or language delays.
- **Visual impairments**: Blindness or uncorrectable visual impairment.
- **Cleft palate**: With or without an associated syndrome.
- **Developmental delay**.

The guidelines are crafted to ensure early identification and management of OME in children who have a higher risk of associated complications.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: a scoping review [^1168VpS9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Recent advances in diagnostic imaging techniques and soft tissue endoscopy now allow for precise diagnosis and management of extra-articular hip pathology. The aim of this scoping review is to present an evidence-based update of the relevant literature focusing only on the pathoanatomy, clinical assessment, and the diagnosis of pathology in the peritrochanteric space.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed on PubMed to include articles that reported on the anatomy and diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome, trochanteric bursitis, gluteus medius tears, and external snapping hip syndrome.

- **Results**: A total of 542 studies were identified, of which 49 articles were included for full-text analysis for the scoping review. Peritrochanteric space pathology can be broadly classified into (1) greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), (2) abductor tears, and (3) external snapping hip syndrome. Anatomically, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fascia lata work in conjunction to abduct and internally rotate the hip. The anterolateral part of the gluteus medius tendon is more prone to tears due to a thin tendinous portion. Increased acetabular anteversion has also been shown to be associated with gluteal and trochanteric bursitis. In terms of clinical examination, tests that were found to be most useful for assisting in the diagnoses of lateral hip pain were the single-leg stance, resisted external derotation of the hip, hip lag sign, and the Trendelenburg's test. Dynamic ultrasound, along with guided injections and MRI scans, assists in differentiating the pathologies.

### Arthroscopic anatomy and surgical techniques for peritrochanteric space disorders in the hip [^11554DR2]. Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Disorders of the lateral or peritrochanteric space, often grouped into the greater trochanteric pain syndrome, such as recalcitrant trochanteric bursitis, external snapping iliotibial band, and gluteus medius and minimus tears, are now being treated endoscopically. We outline the endoscopic anatomy of the peritrochanteric space of the hip and describe surgical techniques for the treatment of these entities.

Proper portal placement is key in understanding the peritrochanteric space and should be first oriented at the gluteus maximus insertion into the linea aspera, as well as the vastus lateralis. When tears of the gluteus medius and minimus are encountered, suture anchors can be placed into the footprint of the abductor tendons in a standard arthroscopic fashion. Our initial experience indicates that recalcitrant trochanteric bursitis, external coxa saltans, and focal, isolated tears of the gluteus medius and minimus tendon may be successfully treated with arthroscopic bursectomy, iliotibial band release, and decompression of the peritrochanteric space and suture anchor tendon repair to the greater trochanter, respectively.

A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, encompassing articles from inception to the 30th of June 2020. Various combinations of keywords were used, as outlined in Table 1. The analysis included studies reporting on the anatomy and diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome, trochanteric bursitis, gluteus medius tears, and external snapping hip syndrome (ESHS). Studies that focused solely on the anatomy and diagnosis of lateral hip pain were also included. Conversely, narrative reviews, case reports, and studies concentrating on treatment or outcomes were excluded from the analysis.

### The role of arthroscopic bursectomy in the treatment of trochanteric bursitis [^114CrexQ]. Arthroscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Arthroscopy is reported as a treatment for recalcitrant trochanteric bursitis, and its role in treating this common clinical entity is explored. Over a 7-year period, 27 patients underwent this procedure. All patients experienced lateral hip pain despite undergoing at least two localized corticosteroid injections. The minimum follow-up was 1 year, with the cases of 22 patients reviewed after 5 years.

- **Immediate results**: Twenty-three of the 27 patients had good or excellent outcomes immediately following the procedure, with no complications.

- **Long-term results**: At 1 year, only 1 patient experienced symptom recurrence. At 5 years, only 2 patients had recurrence. All patients except 1 were satisfied with their outcome.

Arthroscopically performed trochanteric bursectomy is a minimally invasive technique that appears to be both safe and effective for treating recalcitrant pain syndromes.

### Iliopsoas bursa injections can be beneficial for pain after total hip arthroplasty [^116ENpvZ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

Impingement of the iliopsoas tendon is an uncommon cause of groin pain after total hip arthroplasty (THA). We questioned whether selective steroid and anesthetic injections for iliopsoas tendonitis following THA would relieve pain and improve function. We retrospectively reviewed 27 patients with presumed iliopsoas tendonitis who were treated with fluoroscopically guided injections of the iliopsoas bursa.

Pre- and immediately post-injection questionnaires, along with telephone follow-up questionnaires, were administered to assess patient outcomes. Four patients were lost to follow-up, and we were unable to obtain information from relatives on an additional four. The questionnaire was successfully administered to the remaining 19 patients, including six who subsequently underwent surgery at an average of 44.6 months (range, 25–68 months) after their first injection.

The average modified Harris hip score in these 19 patients improved from 61 pre-injection to 82 post-injection. Additionally, the average pain level decreased from 6.4 pre-injection to 2.9 post-injection. However, eight patients (30%) needed a second injection at an average of 8.2 months after the first injection. Ultimately, six patients (22%) required an additional surgical procedure to address the underlying cause of iliopsoas irritation.

Iliopsoas tendonitis is uncommon after THA but should be considered in the differential diagnosis for all patients presenting with groin pain post-THA. Selective steroid and anesthetic injections of the iliopsoas bursa provide adequate pain relief for the majority of patients and should be considered part of the nonoperative treatment plan.

### Satisfactory results after endoscopic gluteus medius repair combined with selective gluteus maximus reflected tendon release for the treatment of a full-thickness tear of gluteus medius [^111XMJMA]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). High credibility.

Recently, greater trochanteric pain syndrome has become a common cause of lateral hip pain. In particular, it is more common among women in the 5th and 6th decades of their lives, with a ratio of women to men up to 4:1 and an estimated prevalence of 1.8/1000.

Although trochanteric pain is generally associated with the inflammation of the trochanteric bursa, many studies have suggested that the main cause of lateral hip pain is tearing in gluteal muscles, which is more prevalent in gluteus medius than in gluteus minimus. Abductor tears are characterized more often by the onset of chronic pain generated by attritional forces than by acute traumatic pain. However, partial-thickness undersurface tears may be more common than complete ruptures, and they typically occur at the dual insertion of the anterior and middle muscle fibers of the gluteus medius into the superoposterior and lateral facets of the greater trochanter.

Although findings on plain radiographs are generally normal, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to have a specificity of 95% and a sensitivity of 91% in detecting hip abductor tears. Conservative treatment is considered the first option, including steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, functional therapies, peritrochanteric corticosteroids, and local anesthetic injections. The surgical option, using either open or endoscopic techniques, is recommended for patients with recalcitrant lateral hip pain who continue to feel pain after more than at least 6 months of non-operative management.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: Practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^115wpFdJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), or trochanteric bursitis, is described as pain on the lateral side of the hip that does not involve the hip joint and can be elicited clinically by palpation over the greater trochanter. At the time of writing, there remains no consensus on clinical guidelines for either diagnosis or management of GTPS.

- **Methods**: To understand the practice patterns, beliefs, and attitudes relating to the management of GTPS after total hip arthroplasty, a survey was developed and completed by Canadian arthroplasty surgeons. The final survey consisted of 23 questions divided into three sections: 1) screening questions; 2) demographic information; and 3) practice patterns, attitudes, and beliefs.

- **Results**: Most surgeons use physical examination alone for diagnosis. A detailed analysis indicates that surgeons primarily treat GTPS with oral anti-inflammatories (57.1%), structured physiotherapy (52.4%), and steroid injections (45.2%). Management options are typically nonsurgical and comprise a combination of either unstructured or targeted physiotherapy, corticosteroid injections, or platelet-rich plasma.

- **Discussion**: There remains an absence of clinical consensus for the diagnosis and management of GTPS after total hip arthroplasty. Physical examination is most often relied on, regardless of the availability of imaging aids. While common treatments of GTPS were identified, up to one-third of patients fail initial therapy.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: Practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^1138bH3L]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global research & reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), or trochanteric bursitis, is classically described as pain on the lateral side of the hip that does not involve the hip joint and can be elicited clinically by palpation over the greater trochanter. Although diagnosis can be made with clinical examination alone, an ultrasound or MRI is sometimes used to increase sensitivity. GTPS can include a multitude of pathologies, including gluteus medius/minimus tears, inflammation of the trochanteric bursa, and snapping hip syndrome (coxa saltans).

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most common and successful operations in Canada, with over 95% of patients reporting good or excellent outcomes. However, up to 17% of patients can suffer from GTPS postoperatively. GTPS can be associated with altered hip biomechanics from implant malposition or from direct injury to the abductor musculature intraoperatively. Other causes of GTPS include inflammation of the bursa overlying the greater trochanter secondary to the surgical incision; however, histopathologic studies often find little evidence of inflammation. It has been argued that a surgical approach for THA can affect the prevalence of GTPS. Advocates for using a direct anterior approach (DAA) adduce a decrease in postoperative limp and GTPS because neither the iliotibial band nor the abductor musculature is violated. Patients who suffer from GTPS postoperatively are known to have impaired functional status with reduced walking speed and slower timed up and go tests. Recalcitrant cases of GTPS may necessitate surgical débridement, increasing the demand for careful postoperative management.

Endoscopic surgery can be used to address peritrochanteric pathology in patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome. During the management of these patients, surgeons must decide whether adjunctive hip arthroscopy to treat concomitant intra-articular pathology, such as labral tears or chondral lesions, is required because the prevalence of intra-articular findings may be greater than the clinical significance. A thorough history and physical examination can help distinguish whether the symptoms are arising from a peritrochanteric issue (e.g. gluteal tendinopathy, trochanteric bursitis, external coxa saltans) versus an intra-articular pain generator. Increased symptoms with provocative impingement or instability testing indicate adjunctive hip arthroscopy to address intra-articular abnormalities. In addition, an ultrasound-guided analgesic injection into the hip joint or peritrochanteric region may aid in diagnosis. A patient with partial symptomatic relief from separate injections into both areas is a classic presentation and is consistent with a mixed picture of peritrochanteric and intra-articular pathology, which may be addressed with a combined endoscopic and arthroscopic approach.

### Clinical indications for image-guided interventional procedures in the musculoskeletal system: a Delphi-based consensus paper from the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR)-part IV, hip [^116jpGFz]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Ultrasound- and fluoroscopy-guided iliopsoas peri-tendinous/bursal injections with local anesthetic and corticosteroids are both safe and feasible. They provide good pain relief in symptomatic patients with iliopsoas tendinopathy. This procedure may also be used to exclude the iliopsoas tendon as a cause of hip or groin pain in both arthroplasty and non-arthroplasty patients. Level of evidence: 3. Agreement was unanimous, with 53 agreeing, 0 disagreeing, and 0 abstaining, resulting in 100% agreement.

Iliopsoas bursa injection under ultrasound and fluoroscopy guidance for treating iliopsoas tendinopathy or bursitis is feasible and accurate. However, there are no studies comparing the different injection techniques or the outcomes of palpation-guided and image-guided injections. In ultrasound-guided injections, dynamic injection with local anesthetic may be used to ensure proper needle placement in the bursa. Complications are rare, minor, and transient. Iliopsoas bursa injection may be useful to determine the origin of pain, particularly in patients with hip arthroplasty.

Adler et al. observed that ultrasound-guided iliopsoas injections with local anesthetic and steroids after hip replacement provided relief to most patients (90%) with iliopsoas tendinosis/bursitis. Authors reported a lower success rate in non-arthroplasty patients due to several conditions involved in hip pain, although 64% of these patients responded positively. This response confirmed the diagnosis of iliopsoas tendinosis and highlighted patients who might benefit from surgical tendon release.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: Practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^116DnDWK]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

A graph showing the most commonly used first-line treatments of trochanteric bursitis is presented, in order of most common to least.

In patients resistant to physiotherapy and/or oral anti-inflammatories (54.8% and 23.3%, respectively), the most common treatment for trochanteric bursitis was corticosteroids and PRP. No other uses were reported for PRP, while 31% reported using corticosteroids for both first-line and resistant cases, with 9.5% using corticosteroids primarily for first-line treatment.

Among all patients with post-THA trochanteric bursitis, surgeons estimated that on average 29.9% (SD: 25.7%) would eventually receive a corticosteroid injection. Only 0.2% of these patients (SD: 0.9%) received PRP injections. The most common number of corticosteroid injections was one injection (40%, range 1 to 3). All surgeons who provided PRP injections only provided a single injection (15%). Most injections were not administered under ultrasound guidance for either corticosteroid injections (82.5%) or PRP (75.0%).

- **Attitudes and beliefs**: The potential benefit of PRP in the setting of trochanteric bursitis was divided, with 54.8% of respondents being unsure, 14.3% thinking it has potential benefit, and 31% thinking that it does not. Furthermore, most of the respondents (85.7%) agreed that if high-quality evidence supported the use of PRP, and if cost was not an issue, they would use PRP in treating this condition. Finally, over half of all respondents (54.8%) stated that they would participate in a randomized trial assessing the efficacy of PRP in post-THA trochanteric bursitis.

### Greater trochanter pain syndrome: a descriptive MR imaging study [^112s7WJR]. European Journal of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Greater trochanter pain syndrome (GTPS) is a diverse clinical entity caused by a variety of underlying conditions. We sought to explore the impact of hip morphology, namely the center-edge angle (CEa) and femoral neck-shaft (NSa) angle; hip abductor tendon degeneration; the dimensions of peritrochanteric edema; and bursitis on the presence of GTPS using MR imaging.

The presence of pain was prospectively assessed blindly by the senior author. CEa and NSa were blindly measured in 174 hip MR examinations after completion of the clinical evaluation by another evaluator. The existence and dimensions of T2 hyperintensity of the peritrochanteric soft tissues, the existence and dimensions of bursae, as well as degeneration and tearing of gluteus tendons were also recorded.

Out of 174 examinations, 91 displayed peritrochanteric edema (group A) and 34 bursitis, all with peritrochanteric edema (group B). A total of 78 patients from both groups A and B showed gluteus medius tendon degeneration and one tendon tear. CEa of groups A and B were 6° higher than those of normals (group C, P = 0.0038). The mean age of normals was 16.6 years less than in group A and 19.8 years less than in group B (P < 0.0001). Bursitis was associated with pain with a negative predictive value of 97% (P = 0.0003).

Acetabular morphology is associated with GTPS, and the absence of bursitis was proven to be clinically relevant. Peritrochanteric edema alone was not associated with local pain.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^116t3iWG]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A hip-strengthening program is considered the first-line treatment for patients with GTPS since it directly addresses the biomechanical cause of pain. If a patient is resistant to engaging in a strengthening program and/or is severely limited by pain from GTPS, we prefer referral to a musculoskeletal specialist prior to considering treatment with a corticosteroid injection for two reasons.

First, using ultrasound or MRI to identify whether bursitis (i.e. active inflammation) is actually present helps the clinician determine how likely the patient is to benefit from an anti-inflammatory medication, such as a corticosteroid. When available and in the hands of an experienced ultrasonographer, ultrasound is superior to MRI because it is faster, cheaper, and provides real-time imaging, which can also be used for visualization during injection. Second, cadaveric studies have demonstrated that there are seven bursae surrounding the GT. Therefore, to maximize a clinical response to a corticosteroid injection, it should be performed under ultrasound guidance by an experienced provider into the appropriate bursa demonstrating inflammation.

An experienced specialist can use ultrasound to evaluate for bursitis and accurately administer any indicated injection during a regular office visit without the need for delay to obtain an MRI to confirm inflammation. Also, there is often concomitant gluteal tendinopathy in the form of tendon tears or tendinosis. It is possible that decreasing the inflammation of the bursa will result in incomplete pain relief. Of course…

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: a scoping review [^116CBQeA]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

There are several pathologies that can affect the abductor muscle complex in the peritrochanteric space. These pathologies can be broadly classified into:

- **Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS)**: GTPS is thought to be a degenerative condition affecting the abductor tendons and the bursae around them. It has a female preponderance of 4:1, with most patients being between the fourth and sixth decades of life. A varus femoral neck and greater gynoid adipose tissue in females increase the risk of developing GTPS. The spontaneous onset of lateral hip pain with point tenderness over the greater trochanter (GT) is suggestive of GTPS.

- **Clinical diagnosis**: Clinical tests aiding in the diagnosis of GTPS include the inability to complete a single-leg stance for 30 seconds, and inability to perform a resisted external derotation of the hip in the supine position with the hip flexed to 90°, and in the prone position with the hip extended. The resisted external derotation test involves flexing the hip to 90°, placing it in full internal rotation, and asking the patient to bring the leg to a neutral position against resistance. A positive test is indicated by pain or weakness. The sensitivity and specificity for the single-leg stance test were found to be 100% and 97.3%, respectively. For the resisted external derotation of the hip in the supine position, these were 88% and 97.3%, respectively, as correlated in the MRI study by Lequesne et al.

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: Current concept [^116xS2EC]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

There are no laboratory or radiographic methods for diagnosing the retro-trochanteric pain syndrome. However, standard antero-posterior radiographs of the pelvis and hips, a lateral view of the hips, and either CT or MRI of the lumbar spine are recommended to rule out the possibility that the symptoms experienced by the patients originate from the spine or the hip joint.

When clinical and radiographic examinations raise a suspicion that femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is present in the hip, an MRI arthrogram is helpful in revealing further intra-articular pathology such as cartilage damage or labral tears. MRI of the pelvis and retro-trochanteric area may also be helpful in recognizing pathological conditions in the short rotators of the hip, but there are no reports in the literature in terms of the sensitivity and specificity of an MRI in evaluations of this condition.

The role of MRI is, however, also considered controversial. Blankenbaker et al. studied 256 hips of patients with 'trochanteric pain syndrome' using MRI and found that 88% of asymptomatic hips had abnormal findings, with hyperintensity signs in the trochanteric area. They therefore concluded that MRI has high sensitivity to pathology in conjunction with 'trochanteric pain syndrome', while Bird et al. studied 24 patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) and a positive Trendelenburg sign and found approximately 46% gluteus medius tears and 63% gluteus medius tendinosis.

Hwang et al. described a 'boomerang'-shaped fluid collection between the obturator internus tendon and the posterior grooved surface of the os ischium seen on MRI.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: Practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^113XoH6d]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The complexity in both the treatment and diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) reflects the multiplicity of attitudes and perceptions toward this condition. In a recent systematic review of GTPS after total hip arthroplasty (THA), more than 10 different diagnostic criteria for trochanteric pain have been reported, but only a single tool has reported its sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis.

The lack of consensus in the treatment approach is evident through the multiple treatments used, including platelet-rich plasma (PRP), steroids, a variety of physiotherapy protocols, peripheral nerve stimulation, local anesthetic injections, and others. Five studies reported on the utility of corticosteroid injections either alone (one study) or in combination with home physiotherapy treatment protocols. Four studies reported on the treatment of trochanteric bursitis resistant to nonsurgical management using either gluteal bursectomy or iliotibial band lengthening. Notably, no studies reported on outcomes with a follow-up of longer than one year, which limits the reliability of outcome assessments.

In our study, the surgical approach was not associated with a notable difference in the surgeon-perceived rates of post-THA GTPS. While it is important to consider that this is based on surgeon estimates rather than actual data, it remains interesting to compare these estimates across approaches. Although a lack of notable difference among the various approaches is consistent with previous clinical literature, lower rates of GTPS are sometimes touted as a potential benefit of certain approaches. Among the myriad of potential causes of GTPS, gluteus medius/minimus tears (i.e. "bald trochanter")…

### Corticosteroid injections for trochanteric bursitis: Is fluoroscopy necessary? A pilot study [^115ZiSwD]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that therapeutic injections carried out to treat various pain conditions should ideally be performed under radiological guidance due to the propensity for blinded injections to be inaccurate. Although trochanteric bursa injections are commonly performed to treat hip pain, they have never been described using fluoroscopy.

- **Methods**: The authors reviewed recorded data on 40 patients who underwent trochanteric bursa injections for hip pain with or without low back pain. The initial needle placement was done blindly, with all subsequent attempts using fluoroscopic guidance. After bone contact, imaging was used to determine if the needle was positioned on the lateral edge of the greater trochanter (GT). Once this occurred, 1 mL of radiopaque contrast was injected to assess bursa spread.

- **Results**: The GT was contacted in 78% of cases, and a bursagram was obtained in 45% of patients on the first needle placement. In 23% of patients, a bursagram was obtained on the second attempt, and in another 23% on the third attempt. Four patients (10%) required four or more needle placements before a bursagram was appreciated. Attending physicians obtained a bursagram on the first attempt 53% of the time compared to 46% for fellows and 36% for residents (P = 0.64). Older patients were more likely to require multiple injections than younger patients.

- **Conclusions**: Radiological confirmation of bursal spread is necessary to ensure that the injectate reaches the area of pathology during trochanteric bursa injections.

### Evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma [^115Dd149]. Clinics in Sports Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Blunt abdominal trauma can be associated with various clinical signs and symptoms, including altered mental status, abdominal pain, rebound tenderness, abdominal tenderness, and tachycardia. Some observable indicators include pneumoperitoneum, costal margin tenderness, hypotension, shock, seat belt sign, and concomitant femur fracture. Laboratory findings may reveal an increased white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, free intraperitoneal fluid, microscopic hematuria, decreased serum base deficit, and abnormal chest radiographs. Additionally, abdominal tenderness, a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 14, costal margin tenderness, femur fracture, hematocrit of 130 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) greater than 130 U/L, increased serum lactate, peritoneal findings, and abdominal distension are notable.

### Surgical repair of the gluteal tendons: A report of 72 cases [^116H6mz3]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2011). Low credibility.

Lateral hip pain is a common problem in middle-aged women, usually attributed to trochanteric bursitis and treated as such. This study reports on the investigation results, surgical findings, operative technique, histopathologic findings, and outcomes of gluteal tendon repair in 72 patients with long-standing trochanteric pain. It also presents a classification of the operative findings. Six patients (7%) from the original cohort of 89 were lost to follow-up. However, of the remaining 72 patients, 65 (90%) were pain-free or experienced minimal pain (P < .00001). Surgical reconstruction of detached gluteal tendons, which causes chronic lateral hip pain, directly addresses the problem and reliably relieves symptoms associated with so-called "trochanteric bursitis".

### Editorial commentary: Hip trochanteric bursitis and femoroacetabular impingement: The arthroscope is only the tool [^1179ZpEV]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Lateral hip pain is debilitating, with pain located at or around the greater trochanter. Trochanteric bursitis is one of the conditions that are part of the greater trochanter pain syndrome. At times, trochanteric bursitis coexists with femoroacetabular impingement. In such cases, the arthroscope is used as a soft tissue endoscope facilitating debridement of the bursa and functional lengthening of the fascia lata. Coupled with appropriate femoroacetabular impingement treatment and rehabilitation, the procedure allows predictable functional results.

### Hip pain: Dry needling versus cortisone injections [^115DGMjL]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is characterized by chronic, intermittent pain and tenderness on the outside of the hip. The medical community once believed that a swollen hip bursa was the source of such pain, leading to the use of corticosteroid injections in the bursa to help decrease swelling and pain. However, researchers now believe that injuries to the muscles and tendons around the hip are the actual cause of this pain and that inflammation is often not involved. A study published in the April 2017 issue of JOSPT explores dry needling as an alternative to cortisone injections to reduce pain and improve function in patients with GTPS.

### Beyond the greater trochanter: A pictorial review of the pelvic bursae [^112VJfaV]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Reviewing the MRI appearance of different bursae located throughout the pelvis, including the pertinent osseous and musculotendinous anatomy, contributes significantly to clinical diagnostics.

- **Purpose**: The bursae are potential spaces that reduce friction between opposed moving components; they can become inflamed and clinically mimic internal derangement.

- **Materials and methods**: This review illustrates both common and lesser-known pelvic bursae, delving into common causes of bursitis, including overuse, trauma, and infection.

- **Conclusion**: Multiple bursae are located throughout the pelvis. It is crucial for radiologists to recognize bursitis as a potential etiology of pain and to be familiar with their anatomical locations to guide appropriate management.

### Kenalog-80 [^115ypYFF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Strict aseptic technique is mandatory. The vial should be shaken before use to ensure a uniform suspension. Prior to withdrawal, the suspension should be inspected for any clumping or granular appearance (agglomeration). Agglomeration occurs when the drug substance separates from the solution and appears as a white precipitate in the vial. An agglomerated product should be discarded and not used. After withdrawal, Kenalog-40 injection and Kenalog-80 injection should be injected without delay to prevent settling in the syringe. Careful technique should be employed to avoid the possibility of entering a blood vessel or introducing infection.

- **Systemic use**: For systemic therapy, the injection should be made deeply into the gluteal muscle (see warnings). For adults, a minimum needle length of 1½ inches is recommended. In obese patients, a longer needle may be required. Use alternative sites for subsequent injections.

- **Local use**: For the treatment of joints, the usual intra-articular injection technique should be followed. If an excessive amount of synovial fluid is present in the joint, some, but not all, should be aspirated to aid in the relief of pain and to prevent undue dilution of the steroid. With intra-articular administration, prior use of a local anesthetic may often be desirable. Care should be taken with this kind of injection, particularly in the deltoid region, to avoid injecting the suspension into the tissues surrounding the site, as this may lead to tissue atrophy. In treating acute nonspecific tenosynovitis, care should be taken to ensure that the injection site is properly managed.
