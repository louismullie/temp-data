## Question

What are the specific criteria for initiating metformin therapy in patients with prediabetes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the specific criteria for initiating metformin therapy in patients with prediabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis of prediabetes using accepted laboratory thresholds. Then, I should verify that lifestyle intervention is first-line and has been attempted. Next, I will identify the high-risk subgroups in whom metformin is most beneficial. After that, I need to check for contraindications and special populations where metformin is not recommended. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and note implementation and monitoring considerations, including vitamin B12 and renal function, while keeping in mind that metformin remains off-label for prediabetes in the U.S.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic criteria for prediabetes, because I need to ensure we are applying metformin to the right population. Prediabetes is defined by impaired fasting glucose 100–125 mg/dL, impaired glucose tolerance 140–199 mg/dL at 2 hours on a 75-g OGTT, or A1C 5.7%–6.4%, and I should double-check that these are the ADA-recognized thresholds used in guidelines and trials like the DPP, which they are [^512f7e0c] [^3a028a6e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pharmacotherapy before lifestyle therapy. I need to verify that structured lifestyle intervention is the foundation and should be offered first, ideally via a Diabetes Prevention Program–style program, because lifestyle reduces diabetes incidence more than metformin and improves cardiometabolic outcomes; metformin is considered when lifestyle fails or is not feasible or when risk is high, so I should confirm that sequence in guidelines before discussing metformin initiation [^6dba54e3] [^3a028a6e] [^7aac3c95].

> Next, I should review who benefits most from metformin, and I need to check the subgroup effects from the DPP and long-term follow-up. The clearest benefit is in adults younger than 60 years, those with BMI 35 kg/m² or higher, and women with a history of gestational diabetes; metformin also shows greater relative risk reduction when fasting glucose is 110–125 mg/dL or A1C is 6.0–6.4%, and these modifiers are consistently reflected in ADA and USPSTF summaries and the 21-year DPPOS data, so I should anchor on these high-risk phenotypes [^eb4a4ca2] [^9b3f54b1] [^3a028a6e].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit so I can counsel accurately. In the DPP, metformin reduced diabetes incidence by about 31% versus placebo over 2.8 years, and in DPPOS the absolute reduction persisted with a hazard ratio around 0.83 over approximately 21 years; importantly, the effect attenuates when metformin is stopped, so adherence matters for durable benefit, which I should emphasize during shared decision-making [^9b3f54b1] [^8b89a89f].

> I should confirm contraindications and special populations before recommending metformin. In adults 65 years and older, metformin is generally not recommended for diabetes prevention because evidence is limited and FDA has not approved this indication; in chronic kidney disease, eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² is a contraindication, and dose adjustments are needed if eGFR is 30–45, so I need to check renal function and age before prescribing [^c671a99b] [^6998c45f].

> Let me consider additional risk enhancers that, while not absolute criteria, strengthen the case for metformin. Combined IFG and IGT, a strong family history of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, rising A1C within the prediabetes range, and elevated triglycerides or low HDL are associated with higher progression risk and are highlighted by endocrine guidelines; I should integrate these into individualized risk discussions even though they are not standalone initiation criteria [^f9682708] [^d932ffba].

> I will now examine a practical decision framework, and I should double-check that it aligns with major guidelines. After confirming prediabetes and ensuring lifestyle intervention is in place or attempted, metformin is reasonable to consider for adults younger than 60, those with BMI 35 kg/m² or higher, women with prior gestational diabetes, or those with more severe glycemic markers such as fasting glucose 110–125 mg/dL or A1C 6.0–6.4%, provided there are no contraindications; this is consistent with ADA, AAFP, and USPSTF summaries and the DPP subgroup analyses [^eb4a4ca2] [^3a028a6e] [^00916e80].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on a structured lifestyle program and doing well with weight loss and glycemic improvement. I should confirm that metformin can still be layered in select high-risk cases, and the evidence suggests adding metformin to lifestyle can modestly improve glycemic outcomes and may further reduce progression in some subgroups, though lifestyle remains the dominant driver of benefit; shared decision-making should weigh gastrointestinal side effects and the need for adherence [^805694f2] [^2bc39d3a] [^3a028a6e].

> Next, I should review implementation details and monitoring. I need to ensure baseline renal function is checked and rechecked periodically, and I should remember that long-term metformin use can lower vitamin B12 levels, so periodic B12 assessment is prudent; I should also confirm that patients understand the off-label status of metformin for prediabetes in the U.S. and discuss potential benefits, risks, and the importance of adherence to realize preventive gains [^3a028a6e] [^9d5e956f].

> Hold on, I should verify real-world uptake to set expectations. Despite guideline support, metformin remains underused in prediabetes, with prescription rates around 2–4% in high-risk cohorts, which underscores the need to proactively identify eligible patients, address clinician and system barriers, and embed prediabetes care pathways into routine practice [^5c367f5e] [^0fb8182d] [^9e9db9f6].

> In summary, I need to ensure the criteria are explicit and evidence-based: confirm prediabetes with ADA thresholds, prioritize structured lifestyle intervention, and consider metformin for adults younger than 60, those with BMI 35 kg/m² or higher, women with prior gestational diabetes, or those with fasting glucose 110–125 mg/dL or A1C 6.0–6.4%, while avoiding use in adults 65 and older and in those with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; this approach balances efficacy, safety, and patient-centered care and is consistent with high-quality guidelines and long-term trial data [^512f7e0c] [^eb4a4ca2] [^9b3f54b1] [^c671a99b].

---

Metformin is **not first-line** for prediabetes; prioritize lifestyle interventions [^6dba54e3] [^3a028a6e]. Consider metformin for **high-risk patients** who meet any of the following: age < 60 years, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², history of gestational diabetes, or progressive hyperglycemia (A1C 6.0–6.4% or fasting glucose 110–125 mg/dL) [^eb4a4ca2] [^3a028a6e]. Use metformin when lifestyle fails or is not feasible, and avoid in patients ≥ 65 years, with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², or with high risk of lactic acidosis [^c671a99b] [^6998c45f]. Monitor renal function and vitamin B12 periodically [^3a028a6e].

## Diagnostic criteria for prediabetes

Prediabetes is defined by **impaired fasting glucose (IFG)**, **impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)**, or **elevated A1C** below diabetes thresholds [^512f7e0c]:

| **Test** | **Prediabetes criteria** |
|-|-|
| Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) | 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L) |
| 2-hour plasma glucose during 75-g OGTT | 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L) |
| Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) | 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) |

## Evidence supporting metformin use in prediabetes

The **Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)** showed metformin reduced diabetes incidence by 31% vs placebo over 2.8 years, with greater benefit in younger patients, those with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², and women with prior gestational diabetes [^eb4a4ca2] [^9b3f54b1]. Long-term follow-up (DPPOS) showed a persistent 18% risk reduction over 15 years [^8b89a89f]. Meta-analyses confirm a **modest reduction in diabetes risk** with metformin in prediabetes [^afc9c5cf].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines align on **lifestyle first**, with metformin for selected high-risk patients:

- **ADA 2023**: Lifestyle intervention is first-line; consider metformin for patients < 60 years, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², or with history of gestational diabetes, especially if A1C is rising or lifestyle fails [^eb4a4ca2].
- **AACE 2022**: Consider metformin, acarbose, pioglitazone, or GLP-1 RAs in prediabetes, particularly with adiposity-based chronic disease or persistent hyperglycemia [^f9682708].
- **VA/DoD 2023**: After lifestyle therapy, consider metformin or other agents in adults who remain high risk, with weak recommendation and low-quality evidence [^a698672f].

---

## Specific criteria for metformin initiation in prediabetes

Metformin is **not routine**; use it when any of the following are present:

- **Age**: < 60 years.
- **BMI**: ≥ 35 kg/m².
- **History**: Prior gestational diabetes.
- **Glycemia**: Progressive hyperglycemia (A1C 6.0–6.4% or FPG 110–125 mg/dL).
- **Failure**: Lifestyle intervention not feasible or unsuccessful after 3–6 months.

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Avoid metformin or use with caution in the following situations:

- **Age**: ≥ 65 years (generally not recommended) [^c671a99b].
- **Renal function**: eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m².
- **Liver disease**: Significant hepatic impairment.
- **Heart failure**: Unstable or decompensated.
- **Hypoxia**: Conditions with high lactic acidosis risk (e.g. sepsis, severe COPD).

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

If metformin is initiated, **monitor the following**:

- **Renal function**: Baseline and at least annually.
- **Vitamin B12**: Periodically (about every 2–3 years).
- **Glycemia**: A1C or FPG every 6–12 months to assess response and detect progression.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line**: Lifestyle intervention for all with prediabetes [^6dba54e3].
- **Second-line**: Consider metformin for high-risk patients who fail lifestyle or cannot participate [^a698672f].
- **High-risk features**: Age < 60, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², prior GDM, or progressive hyperglycemia [^eb4a4ca2].
- **Avoid**: Patients ≥ 65, eGFR < 30, or high lactic acidosis risk [^c671a99b].
- **Monitor**: Renal function, vitamin B12, and glycemia periodically [^3a028a6e].

---

Metformin is a **targeted therapy** for prediabetes in patients at highest risk or in whom lifestyle fails, with modest but meaningful benefits. Use shared decision-making to balance benefits, risks, and patient preferences [^00916e80].

### Metformin should not Be used to treat prediabetes [^4d85662d]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Based on the results of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS), in which metformin significantly decreased the development of diabetes in individuals with baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations of 110–125 vs. 100–109 mg/dL (6.1–6.9 vs. 5.6–6.0 mmol/L) and A1C levels 6.0–6.4% (42–46 mmol/mol) vs. < 6.0% and in women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus, it has been suggested that metformin should be used to treat people with prediabetes. Since the association between prediabetes and cardiovascular disease is due to the associated nonglycemic risk factors in people with prediabetes, not to the slightly increased glycemia, the only reason to treat with metformin is to delay or prevent the development of diabetes. There are three reasons not to do so. First, approximately two-thirds of people with prediabetes do not develop diabetes, even after many years. Second, approximately one-third of people with prediabetes return to normal glucose regulation. Third, people who meet the glycemic criteria for prediabetes are not at risk for the microvascular complications of diabetes and thus metformin treatment will not affect this important outcome. Why put people who are not at risk for the microvascular complications of diabetes on a drug (possibly for the rest of their lives) that has no immediate advantage except to lower subdiabetes glycemia to even lower levels? Rather, individuals at the highest risk for developing diabetes-i.e., those with FPG concentrations of 110–125 mg/dL (6.1–6.9 mmol/L) or A1C levels of 6.0–6.4% (42–46 mmol/mol) or women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus-should be followed closely and metformin immediately introduced only when they are diagnosed with diabetes.

### Should prediabetes be treated pharmacologically? [^6f1f241e]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

In this commentary I will evaluate whether prediabetes should be treated pharmacologically. To consider this question, certain information concerning prediabetes is relevant.

Background Information

(1) Prediabetes is not independently associated with cardiovascular disease; the other factors in the metabolic syndrome increase that risk; (2) various tests and criteria for diagnosing prediabetes are recommended, yielding prevalences varying from 6% to 38% depending on which are used; (3) one-third of patients with prediabetes revert to normal over time; (4) up to two-thirds of patients with prediabetes do not develop diabetes; (5) people with prediabetes have insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion; (6) although pharmacological treatment of the dysglycemia temporarily lowers it, when the drugs are discontinued, incident diabetes develops similarly as that in those who received placebos; (7) when the drugs are discontinued, there are no changes in insulin resistance or impaired insulin secretion; (8) incident diabetes was similar at 10 years in people remaining on metformin in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcome Study compared with those who did not receive the drug; (9) no current drugs will directly increase insulin secretion (except sulfonylureas and glinides which have not been used to treat prediabetes because of hypoglycemia concerns); (10) sufficient weight loss to lower insulin resistance by nutritional means is challenging and especially difficult to maintain.

Conclusions

Pharmacological treatment of the dysglycemia of prediabetes is not warranted. On the other hand, the ability of high doses of glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonists and the combination of a GLP-1 receptor agonist and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) to lower weight by 15% and 20%, respectively, deserves consideration for the treatment of prediabetes. This amount of weight loss should decrease insulin resistance, allowing endogenous insulin secretion to be more effective and lower the risk for developing diabetes.

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^6dba54e3]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes — interventions for prediabetes. Lifestyle interventions for persons with prediabetes reduced progression to diabetes (pooled RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.69 to 0.88]). Metformin reduced diabetes incidence in pooled trials (pooled RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.64 to 0.83]) and, in DPP subgroup analyses, the effect was greater at higher body mass index, with a reduction in diabetes incidence of 53% [95% CI, 36% to 65%] for BMI ≥ 35 vs 3% [95% CI, −36% to 30%] for BMI of 22 to < 30. In DPP, metformin produced greater weight loss than placebo (−2.0 kg [95% CI, −3.2 to −0.8 kg]) and increased high-density lipoprotein levels after 3 years (difference between groups, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.65]).

### Prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus… [^3a028a6e]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Prediabetes is not a diagnosis but rather an opportunity to prevent or delay a future diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
- Intensive lifestyle programs are the most effective intervention for preventing or delaying a diagnosis of diabetes in patients with prediabetes.
- In patients with prediabetes, metformin therapy will slow the progression to type 2 diabetes, although less effectively than lifestyle programs over time.
- In patients who have had gestational diabetes, the benefits of metformin therapy are similar to those of lifestyle programs. From the AFP Editors. People younger than 45 years who are overweight or obese and are at high risk because of a family history, certain medical conditions, or physical inactivity and those who belong to a high-risk racial or ethnic group or who have signs of insulin resistance should also receive regular testing. Classifying screening test results as indicative of prediabetes shows an increased risk of a future diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and provides an opportunity for prevention. Criteria for prediabetes, including A1C levels of 5. 7 to
6. 4, fasting plasma glucose of 100 to 125 mg per dL, or two-hour glucose of 140 to 199 mg per dL after a 75-mg oral glucose load, identify individuals for whom diabetes prevention will be beneficial. Initially, metformin is nearly as effective as lifestyle modification; however, over time, lifestyle interventions demonstrate clear superiority.

In patients with previous gestational diabetes, metformin reduces diabetes incidence by 50%, equivalent to lifestyle changes. Because long-term use of metformin can lead to vitamin B 12 deficiency, monitoring vitamin B 12 levels should be considered. The USPSTF and ADA suggest three-year screening intervals and lifestyle interventions, metformin, or both for patients with prediabetes. This ADA guideline adds more specifics to these recommendations. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Contributing Editor.

### Metformin prescription rates for patients with prediabetes [^5c367f5e]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Prediabetes is a serious public health concern, with 34.5% of US adults meeting the criteria for prediabetes. The American Diabetes Association has highlighted metformin therapy as a consideration for individuals with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², those aged < 60 years, and women with a history of gestational diabetes. We examined metformin prescription rates among a national sample of commercially insured, higher risk patients with prediabetes.

Methods

We gathered 2012 to 2018 demographic, laboratory, and prescription data for 53,551 patients with prediabetes from the IBM MarketScan research database. Our primary outcome was metformin prescription rates 1 or 3 years after a laboratory confirmation of prediabetes among patients who have a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² or are aged < 60 years.

Results

Overall, 2.4% (n = 1,124) of patients received a metformin prescription within 1 year of a laboratory confirmed prediabetes result, including 2.4% of patients aged < 60 years and 10.4% of those with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m². By a 3 year follow-up, 4.1% (n = 1901) received a metformin prescription, including 3.9% of patients aged < 60 years and 14.0% with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m². Patients who developed type 2 diabetes within the 1 (n = 2,769) or 3 year (n = 7,268) follow-up periods were excluded from analysis.

Conclusions

Few prediabetes patients who were either obese or aged < 60 years received a metformin prescription between 2012 and 2018. Prescription rates increased slightly between 1 and 3 years after a prediabetes diagnosis, so strategies to support timely intervention among higher risk patients with prediabetes are critically needed.

### Metformin plus lifestyle interventions versus lifestyle interventions alone for the delay or prevention of type 2 diabetes in individuals with prediabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^805694f2]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement guidelines when performing this systematic review and meta-analysis. In addition, our study was carried out per the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis of Interventions. We registered our study protocol on the PROSPERO database (CRD42023458096).

Literature search

On August 1, 2023, we performed a comprehensive literature search on four electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central) using the following keywords: lifestyle, metformin, prediabetes, glucose intolerance, and impaired fasting glucose. In addition, we performed manual citation analysis for all the references of the included studies and relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses. On March 20, 2024, we updated our search again for other potential publications. We provide the detailed search strategy and results for each database in Supplementary Table 1.

Eligibility criteria

We considered all RCTs comparing lifestyle interventions plus metformin versus lifestyle interventions alone or lifestyle interventions plus placebo in individuals with prediabetes either with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, or both. Our population was not restricted to a specific age group. Therefore, RCTs including adults or adolescents were included. Lifestyle interventions were defined as diet or exercise interventions offering more than the provision of general information or advice, which are considered "standard care". However, we were interested in more intensive care such as goal setting and individually tailored information to ensure the implementation of these interventions in the study population. Included studies had to assess at least one of our outcome measurements. We excluded studies comparing adding metformin to lifestyle interventions versus metformin alone. Similarly, studies comparing lifestyle interventions versus metformin were also excluded. RCTs including individuals with concomitant use of other antidiabetic drugs were excluded. Finally, animal studies, conference abstracts, and studies that were not in English were excluded.

Primary and secondary outcomes

Our primary outcomes included the incidence of type 2 diabetes and glycemic control measurements, such as HbA1c and FPG levels, which are important indicators of diabetes risk. Secondary outcomes included clinical and biochemical parameters, which provide insights about the overall health status and risk factors associated with diabetes, such as blood pressure, plasma lipids, insulin resistance, and weight measurements (Table 1).

Table 1
Secondary outcomes

Screening of the literature search results

The literature search results were screened in a two-step process. Initially, the titles and abstracts of all articles were assessed for eligibility. Subsequently, full-text screening was conducted for the studies that met our eligibility criteria.

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^151da958]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes — key clarifications emphasize that the available evidence best supports screening starting at age 35 years, that overweight and obesity are the strongest risk factors for developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and that metformin appears to be effective in reducing the risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes in persons with a history of gestational diabetes, based on post hoc analyses of the DPP and DPPOS.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^f9682708]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Prediabetes — recommendation 11.6 and diagnostic thresholds: Diabetes medications including metformin, acarbose, pioglitazone, or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) can be considered in persons with prediabetes or in those with adiposity-based chronic disease (ABCD) who remain glucose-intolerant after weight loss using lifestyle and/or weight-loss medications (Grade A; BEL 1). Prediabetes can be identified by impaired fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose 100 to 125 mg/dL), impaired glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test result 140 to 199 mg/dL, 2 hours after ingesting 75 g of glucose), or A1C 5.7% to 6.4%, and progression risk is greatest with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus, strong family history of type 2 diabetes, progressive glycemia within the prediabetes range, or meeting a combination of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or metabolic syndrome criteria (any 2 out of 3).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^e87d5144]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Prediabetes — pharmacologic prevention and evidence quality: We recommend that clinicians continue monitoring the most up-to-date research for evidence-based changes in practice management related to prediabetes. The evidence informing this area is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, with sample sizes low and follow-up varying from 6.0 months to 3.5 years. In patients who are poor candidates for metformin, the benefits of using an alternative medication to prevent progression of prediabetes to type 2 diabetes mellitus slightly outweighed the potential harm of side effects, such as nausea and diarrhea. Accordingly, in adults with prediabetes who have participated in healthy lifestyle modification and remain at high risk for progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus, we suggest evaluating patient characteristics (e.g., age, life expectancy, co-occurring conditions, BMI, other risk factors) and offering metformin or other select medications to reduce the risk of progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Prescribing paradigm shift? Applying the 2019 European Society of Cardiology-led guidelines on diabetes, prediabetes, and cardiovascular disease to assess eligibility for sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists as first-line monotherapy (or add-on to metformin monotherapy) in type 2 diabetes in scotland [^2f51ec03]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology led and released new guidelines for diabetes cardiovascular risk management, reflecting recent evidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) reduction with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) and some glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in type 2 diabetes (T2D). A key recommendation is that all those with T2D who are (antihyperglycemic) drug naïve or on metformin monotherapy should be CVD risk stratified and an SGLT-2i or a GLP-1RA initiated in all those at high or very high risk, irrespective of glycated hemoglobin. We assessed the impact of these guidelines in Scotland were they introduced as is.

Research Design and Methods

Using a nationwide diabetes register in Scotland, we did a cross-sectional analysis, using variables in our register for risk stratification at 1 January 2019. We were conservative in our definitions, assuming the absence of a risk factor where data were not available. The risk classifications were applied to people who were drug naïve or on metformin monotherapy and the anticipated prescribing change calculated.

Results

Of the 265,774 people with T2D in Scotland, 53,194 (20.0% of those with T2D) were drug naïve, and 56,906 (21.4%) were on metformin monotherapy. Of these, 74.5% and 72.4%, respectively, were estimated as at least high risk given the guideline risk definitions.

Conclusions

Thus, 80,830 (30.4%) of all those with T2D (n = 265,774) would start one of these drug classes according to table 7 and figure 3 of the guideline. The sizeable impact on drug budgets, enhanced clinical monitoring, and the trade-off with reduced CVD-related health care costs will need careful consideration.

### Update and next steps for real-world translation of interventions for type 2 diabetes prevention: reflections from a diabetes care editors' expert forum [^806d425c]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 415 million adults worldwide now have diabetes and 318 million have impaired glucose tolerance. These numbers are expected to increase to 642 million and 482 million, respectively, by 2040. This burgeoning pandemic places an enormous burden on countries worldwide, particularly resource-poor regions. Numerous landmark trials evaluating both intensive lifestyle modification and pharmacological interventions have persuasively demonstrated that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or its onset can be delayed in high-risk individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. However, key challenges remain, including how to scale up such approaches for widespread translation and implementation, how to select appropriately from various interventions and tailor them for different populations and settings, and how to ensure that preventive interventions yield clinically meaningful, cost-effective outcomes. In June 2015, a Diabetes Care Editors' Expert Forum convened to discuss these issues. This article, an outgrowth of the forum, begins with a summary of seminal prevention trials, followed by a discussion of considerations for selecting appropriate populations for intervention and the clinical implications of the various diagnostic criteria for prediabetes. The authors outline knowledge gaps in need of elucidation and explore a possible new avenue for securing regulatory approval of a prevention-related indication for metformin, as well as specific considerations for future pharmacological interventions to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. They conclude with descriptions of some innovative, pragmatic translational initiatives already under way around the world.

### Review of metformin use for type 2 diabetes prevention [^d3d0ee82]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Context

Prediabetes is prevalent and significantly increases lifetime risk of progression to type 2 diabetes. This review summarizes the evidence surrounding metformin use for type 2 diabetes prevention.

Evidence Acquisition

Articles published between 1998 and 2017 examining metformin use for the primary indication of diabetes prevention available on MEDLINE.

Evidence Synthesis

Forty articles met inclusion criteria and were summarized into four general categories: (1) RCTs of metformin use for diabetes prevention (n = 7 and n = 2 follow-up analyses); (2) observational analyses examining metformin use in heterogeneous subgroups of patients with prediabetes (n = 9 from the Diabetes Prevention Program, n = 1 from the biguanides and the prevention of the risk of obesity [BIGPRO] trial); (3) observational analyses examining cost effectiveness of metformin use for diabetes prevention (n = 11 from the Diabetes Prevention Program, n = 1 from the Indian Diabetes Prevention Program); and (4) real-world assessments of metformin eligibility or use for diabetes prevention (n = 9). Metformin was associated with reduced relative risk of incident diabetes, with the strongest evidence for use in those at highest risk (i.e., aged < 60 years, BMI ≥ 35, and women with histories of gestational diabetes). Metformin was also deemed cost effective in 11 economic analyses. Recent studies highlighted low rates of metformin use for diabetes prevention in real-world settings.

Conclusions

Two decades of evidence support metformin use for diabetes prevention among higher-risk patients. However, metformin is not widely used in real-world practice, and enhancing the translation of this evidence to real-world practice has important implications for patients, providers, and payers.

3.3 The Rebuttal

Despite these contending views, metformin remains the cornerstone of pharmacological management in prediabetes for a couple of reasons. To start with, Herman et al.proposed that metformin should be used in high‐risk individuals meeting DPP eligibility criteria, as it offers proven benefits in preventing T2D and associated complications. He further noted that there was often a 3–8 years delay between the onset and diagnosis of T2D, during which many patients already develop microvascular complications. Therefore, early intervention with metformin — an effective, safe and cost‐efficient drug — can help mitigate diabetes progression before complications manifest. Secondly, while lifestyle modifications may be superior to metformin monotherapy, it heavily depends on the patients' compliance and the intensity of the lifestyle moderation. Indeed, as shown in the Look AHEAD study, most participants regained their body weight 1 year after receiving lifestyle intervention. Realistically, while lifestyle modifications remain the first line in all treatment, they may be inadequate in the management of high‐risk individuals with prediabetes, particularly in those who are not fit for intense physical activity or have dietary restrictions. In fact, the Look AHEAD trial also showed that intensive weight‐loss lifestyle modifications subsequently proved limited in reducing the rate of cardiovascular events in overweight or obese adults with T2D. Only those participants with significant weight loss of 5–10% showed reduced cardiovascular risks. Therefore, a pharmacological option in prediabetes management remains relevant and necessary in clinical practice in high‐risk prediabetic populations.

The efficacy, safety and cost‐effectiveness of metformin therapy have been established among very high‐risk individuals. The likelihood of achieving beneficial effects is greatest when metformin is prescribed to those who meet the DPP eligibility criteria. Given the variability in treatment response, metformin therapy should be prioritized for individuals at highest risk — such as younger, more obese, more hyperglycaemic individuals, including women with a history of GDM.

### Metformin plus lifestyle interventions versus lifestyle interventions alone for the delay or prevention of type 2 diabetes in individuals with prediabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^7aac3c95]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 537 million adults are living with diabetes. Of them, more than 90% are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Given the continuous rise in the global incidence and prevalence of diabetes, it is considered a global pandemic ranking among the leading causes of premature death. It is predicted that 783 million individuals will be affected with diabetes by 2045.

Prediabetes, which is a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes, is an intermediate stage of hyperglycemia in which blood glucose levels are below the diagnostic threshold for type 2 diabetes; however, they are too high to be normal. Individuals with prediabetes have either impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, or both. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) defines impaired fasting glucose as a fasting glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL, while impaired glucose tolerance is defined as a 2-hour plasma glucose level after a 75-g oral glucose challenge (2hPG) of 140 to 199 mg/dL. Prediabetes can also be diagnosed with an HbA1c level of 5.7–6.4%. The major risk factors for prediabetes include obesity, physical inactivity, older age, and genetic predisposition. Given the increasing prevalence of obesity across all age groups, the International Diabetes Federation expects that by 2045, one billion individuals will be affected with prediabetes.

Individuals with prediabetes have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular complications, peripheral neuropathy, and accelerated frailty compared to those with normal glucose regulation. Hence, we can reduce these complications by adopting effective strategies to decrease the transition from prediabetes to diabetes. Currently, lifestyle interventions, such as calorie restriction, nutrition visits, and exercise are the mainstay of diabetes prevention. However, adherence to these lifestyle interventions is challenging.

Therefore, multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated the efficacy of pharmacological agents, such as metformin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogs, and thiazolidinediones for delaying or even preventing the progression from prediabetes to diabetes. Although metformin was superior to placebo in reducing the progression from prediabetes to diabetes, its long-term efficacy for preventing diabetes was generally lower than that of lifestyle interventions. Most diabetes prevention trials have found that the effects of lifestyle interventions on diabetes prevention persisted after discontinuation of these interventions; however, metformin lost its effect when discontinued.

Conclusion

In conclusion, adding metformin to lifestyle interventions may be superior to lifestyle interventions alone in reducing HbA1c and FPG levels in individuals with prediabetes, and consequently, may reduce the risk of progression to diabetes in these individuals. However, this combined approach appears to be limited in terms of lipid profile, blood pressure, and body weight measurements. Future well-designed RCTs are required to confirm our findings.

USPSTF preventive interventions for persons with prediabetes state that both lifestyle interventions focused on diet and physical activity and metformin have demonstrated efficacy in preventing or delaying progression to diabetes; however, metformin has not been approved for this specific indication by the US Food and Drug Administration. Lifestyle interventions were effective in all subgroups, while subgroup analyses suggest that metformin was effective in persons younger than 60 years, in persons with a BMI of 35 or greater, in persons with a fasting plasma glucose level of 110 mg/dL (6.11 mmol/L) or greater, or in persons with a history of gestational diabetes. Lifestyle interventions have a beneficial effect on weight, blood pressure, and lipid levels, whereas metformin has a beneficial effect on weight but does not appear to affect blood pressure or to consistently improve lipid levels.

### A systematic approach to treating early metabolic disease and prediabetes [^082f0f6b]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

A clinical treatment approach either values preventing type 2 diabetes or it does not. Clinicians cannot abdicate the decision with a patient in front of them. No decision to promote metabolic health is a decision not to promote metabolic health. So, each clinician must answer whether attempting to prevent type 2 diabetes helps. The evidence suggests it does. Importantly, there is no economic rationale for withholding lifestyle intervention or metformin as both are cost-saving in attempting to prevent of type 2 diabetes. A key point in the preceding sentence is the word "attempting" as adherence significantly waned over time in the group assigned to receive metformin. Even so, diabetes prevalence remained lower with metformin, and cost-savings were achieved. Therefore, even if the evidence suggesting a macro- and microvascular benefit from not developing type 2 diabetes is discounted, the primary interventions to delay or prevent new-onset type 2 diabetes are cost-saving, with the added benefit of avoiding type 2 diabetes in some patients as highlighted above. Indeed, as illustrated above and in the literature, type 2 diabetes impacts a range of patient-centered outcomes. Thus, lifestyle intervention and metformin should be deployed systematically to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare spending.

### Should adults with prediabetes Be prescribed metformin to prevent… [^00916e80]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

High-Quality Evidence Supports Metformin for Diabetes Prevention in Higher-Risk Patients Several randomized controlled trials, including the Diabetes Prevention Program study, have shown that metformin can significantly lower incident diabetes risk among overweight and obese patients with prediabetes. 3 When compared with placebo, metformin had a relative risk reduction of 31% over three years, with a number needed to treat of 14. 2, 5 Three randomized trials reported absolute risk reductions ranging from 4% to 14%. 5 However, rates of diabetes progression vary significantly among individuals. 2) and in women with a history of gestational diabetes. 4, 7 When A1C level was used to define DPP eligibility and diagnosis of diabetes, metformin and intensive lifestyle intervention showed similar degrees of risk reduction. 9 Thus, higher A1C, but also other important risk factors, such as family history of diabetes, higher fasting plasma glucose levels, and higher triglyceride levels, may predict greater risk of progression to diabetes. 10 All of these risk factors should also be assessed when metformin is being considered for individual patients.
10. Benefits of Metformin Use for Diabetes Prevention Outweigh the Risks Metformin is a safe, tolerable, cost-effective, and possibly cost-saving treatment for prediabetes. Metformin Use for Diabetes Prevention Is Aligned with Patient-Centered Principles of Care To provide patient-centered care for any condition, it is critical to help patients understand management options, weigh relative risks and benefits, and make choices that are aligned with their values and preferences. Initiating intensive lifestyle interventions is the first-line treatment for prediabetes, but metformin should also be presented as a safe and effective option for higher-risk patients.

Studies have shown that most patients consider both metformin and intensive lifestyle intervention as acceptable treatment options. 15 In summary, high-quality evidence supports metformin use for diabetes prevention among younger or more obese individuals or for women with a history of gestational diabetes. In these groups, the benefits of metformin likely outweigh the risks; therefore, clinicians should consider prescribing metformin, in addition to intensive lifestyle interventions, in accordance with patients' values and preferences. Family physicians have the opportunity to provide more patient-centered care and reduce the burden of type 2 diabetes, one patient at a time.

Finally, the natural history of prediabetes is somewhat reassuring. Approximately two-thirds of people with prediabetes do not develop diabetes. In the placebo arm of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcome Study (DPPOS), 65% of participants had not developed diabetes 5.7 years after the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) had ended. Similarly, 69% of people with prediabetes in the Framingham Offspring Study had not developed diabetes 27 to 30 years later. In people with prediabetes who were older than 60 years enrolled in the Swedish National Study on Aging who were followed for 12 years, 23% died and 13% developed diabetes. Even assuming that all the individuals who died had developed diabetes before doing so (highly unlikely), 64% of those still living would not have developed diabetes. Furthermore, a mean of one-third, with a wide range of 13–69% depending on the diagnostic criteria used to diagnose prediabetes and euglycemia, returned to normal glucose regulation over time.

Background

Prediabetes is a condition characterized by impaired glucose tolerance and/or fasting glucose levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. Prediabetes is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), or a combination of the 2. IGT is plasma glucose of 7.8–11.0 mmol/L (140–200 mg/dL) two hours after ingestion of 75 g of glucose. IFG is defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels ranging from 6.1–6.9 mmol/L (110–125 mg/dL). The American Diabetes Association (ADA) uses the same criteria but with a lower cut-off value for IFG (100–125 mg/dL) and adds HbA1c level of 5.7% to 6.4% to define prediabetes.

According to the impaired fasting glucose criteria, around 10.6% of adults globally (541 million individuals) are estimated to have prediabetes in 2021, which will increase to 11.4% (730 million people) by 2045. Prediabetes progresses to diabetes in 25% of cases within 3–5 years, and 70% of prediabetics develop overt diabetes in their lifetime. In addition to an increased risk of diabetes progression and diabetes-related complications, prediabetes is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, retinopathy, and other complications.

Lifestyle interventions, such as diet and exercise, play a pivotal role in preventing or delaying the progression of prediabetes to diabetes. Their implementation and long-term adherence, however, pose significant challenges. Diabetes prevention program revealed that adherence to lifestyle interventions was lower than adherence to metformin. While only 38% of patients in the lifestyle group retained their weight loss, medication adherence over 4 years was around 70%. This highlights the importance of investigating alternative strategies for managing prediabetes, such as pharmacological interventions.

### Should prediabetes be treated pharmacologically? [^ef98207a]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

A large number of studies have tracked incident CVD (but without taking the other risk factors of the MetS into account) for 6–15 years after diagnosing prediabetes by either the lower range of the ADA IFG criteria (5.6–6.0 mmol/L) or the international IFG range (6.1–6.9 mmol/L). The CVD outcomes in these studies, involving 471,769 individuals, were CVD death, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and any CVD event. Of the eight studies in which the lower range of the ADA IFG criteria were evaluated, none showed a significant difference in incident CVD compared to persons with a FPG concentration < 5.6 mmol/L. Of the ten studies that evaluated the international range of the IFG criteria, three showed a significant difference in at least one of the CVD outcomes (one was significant in women, not men). Eight studies (with nine cohorts) involving 67,259 individuals tracked incident CVD after the diagnosis of prediabetes was made by HbA1c levels. In the six cohorts in which HbA1c levels < 42 mol/mmol could be evaluated, two showed a significant increase in incident CVD. In the nine cohorts in which the international HbA1c levels were evaluated, five were significant. Although these results show that HbA1c levels may be more specific for an association of prediabetes with CVD, treating the glycemia of prediabetes should not have much of an overall effect on the CVD risk associated with the MetS.

This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any new studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

Given this general background of prediabetes, let us consider whether it should be treated pharmacologically. The well-known Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group studied the effect of an intensive lifestyle intervention or metformin on the development of diabetes in people with prediabetes diagnosed by IGT who also had a FPG > 5.3 mmol/L. Compared to the control group, there was a 58% and 31% decrease in the development of diabetes in those in the lifestyle and metformin groups, respectively, after a mean follow up of 2.8 years. The intensive lifestyle intervention included a 16-lesson curriculum taught monthly on a one-to-one basis over the first 4 months after enrollment with subsequent individual and group sessions to reinforce behavioral changes as well as opportunities and facilities for exercise. Unfortunately, such intensive lifestyle intervention programs are mostly unavailable without research support.

Quality assessment

Two authors independently evaluated the quality of the included clinical trials using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool for RCTs, which involves five domains: randomization process (selection bias), deviation from intended interventions (performance bias), outcome measurement (detection bias), missing outcome data (attrition bias), selection of reported results (reporting bias), and other potential sources of bias. The authors' assessment decisions were categorized as 'Low risk of bias', 'High risk of bias', or 'Some concerns'. Any discrepancies between the two authors were resolved through discussion with a third author.

Publication bias

According to Egger et al. publication bias assessment is reliable only for at least 10 pooled studies. Although our meta-analysis included 12 RCTs, we could not assess the risk of publication bias due to the insufficient number of pooled RCTs in each outcome.

### Many Americans have pre-diabetes and should be considered for metformin therapy [^1e797267]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In consideration of the enormous public health impact of diabetes and the evidence of benefit from pharmacological treatment for the prevention of diabetes, the ADA issued a consensus statement recommending preventive treatment in individuals at high risk of developing diabetes, defined as those with more severe pre-diabetes (both IFG and IGT as well as an additional risk factor). To determine the proportion of individuals who would be targeted by such a recommendation, we examined a relatively healthy population without previously diagnosed diabetes (SIGT) and representative samples of the U.S. population (NHANES III and NHANES 2005–2006) and found that one-quarter to one-third had pre-diabetes. Among those with IFG, nearly one-third of subjects met the criteria for consideration of metformin treatment to prevent diabetes in accordance with the recent ADA consensus statement, more than one-half of all of the subjects with IGT qualified, and almost all of those with both IFG and IGT qualified. Overall, 8–9% met the recommended criteria. Assuming that our data are generalizable to the U.S. population, ∼24 million Americans might benefit from pharmacological treatment in addition to lifestyle modification.

### Many Americans have pre-diabetes and should be considered for metformin therapy [^3b56b859]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The morbidity, mortality, and cost of the epidemic of diabetes have prompted a call for primary prevention of diabetes in high-risk individuals by the use of metformin in addition to lifestyle changes. To the extent that our findings are representative of the U.S. population, close to 1 in 12 American adults may meet the recommended guidelines for consideration of metformin treatment for diabetes prevention or delay. Notably, eligibility for metformin use appeared to be almost completely determined by impaired glucose metabolism alone, because 99% of the SIGT population and 96% of the NHANES populations with both IFG and IGT had at least one risk factor. Therefore, once the presence of both IFG and IGT has been established, the presence of additional risk factors could almost be assumed, and initiation of metformin should be considered. Moreover, because nearly one-third of all subjects with IFG met the criteria for metformin treatment, providers should perform OGTTs in all patients with IFG to test for the presence of IGT (or unrecognized diabetes) and thereby determine whether they merit consideration of metformin treatment.

### Successful treatment of prediabetes in clinical practice using physiological assessment (STOP DIABETES) [^6a12da9d]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Of the 84 million American adults with prediabetes, over 5 to 7 years, about 28 million progress to type 2 diabetes. We aimed to assess whether a real-world, pathophysiology-based, therapeutic approach could prevent development of type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals.

Methods

We did a retrospective observational study of people at increased risk of type 2 diabetes from a community practice in southern California, USA. Participants had an oral glucose tolerance test and were assigned a risk stratification on the basis of presence and severity of insulin resistance, impaired β-cell function, and glycaemia (ie, 1-h plasma glucose concentration of more than 8.6 mmol/L during an oral glucose tolerance test). Treatment was recommended on the basis of risk: metformin, pioglitazone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, and lifestyle therapy for participants at high risk of diabetes, and metformin, pioglitazone, and lifestyle therapy for those at intermediate risk. Individuals who refused pharmacological therapy were assigned to lifestyle therapy only. Participants were followed up every 6 months and oral glucose tolerance tests were repeated at 6 months and subsequently every 2 years or sooner. The primary outcome of our analysis was incidence of type 2 diabetes according to the American Diabetes Association criteria, within the study period (2009–16). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03308773.

Findings

Between Jan 1, 2009 and Dec 31, 2016, we assessed 1769 people at increased risk of diabetes, of which 747 (42%) were identified at high or intermediate risk and were recommended pharmacological treatment. Of 422 participants analysed, 28 (7%) progressed to type 2 diabetes (seven [5%] of 141 participants who received metformin, pioglitazone, and lifestyle therapy, none [0%] of 81 who received metformin, pioglitazone, GLP-1 receptor agonist, and lifestyle therapy, and 21 [11%] of 200 who received lifestyle therapy only) after mean follow-up of 32.09 months (SEM 1.24). Compared with participants who received lifestyle therapy only, the adjusted hazard ratio for progression to type 2 diabetes was 0.29 (95% CI 0.11–0.78, p = 0.0009) in participants who received metformin and pioglitazone, and 0.12 (95% CI 0.02–0.94, p = 0.04) in participants who received metformin, pioglitazone, and GLP-1 receptor agonist. Improved β-cell function was the strongest predictor of type 2 diabetes prevention.

Interpretation

Progression to type 2 diabetes in people at high risk of diabetes can be markedly reduced with interventions designed to correct underlying pathophysiological disturbances (ie, impaired insulin secretion and resistance) in a real-world setting.

### Many Americans have pre-diabetes and should be considered for metformin therapy [^777df140]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a public health epidemic associated with high morbidity, mortality, and cost. Currently, an estimated 38 million Americans have the disease, nearly 40% of which is undiagnosed, and another 87 million have pre-diabetes: impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Diabetes develops insidiously over several years, during which time glucose metabolism progresses slowly from normal to pre-diabetes and then more rapidly to diabetes. Based on observational and prospective studies, ∼25–40% of individuals with pre-diabetes go on to develop diabetes over 3–8 years, and there is evidence of complications in 50% of patients at the time of diagnosis of diabetes.

Because progression from pre-diabetes can be prevented or delayed by lifestyle change and/or medication, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has issued a consensus statement recommending early identification and preventive treatment in high-risk individuals. The panel statement recommends that individuals with both IFG and IGT and one additional risk factor (age < 60 years, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², family history of diabetes in first-degree relative, elevated triglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol, or A1C > 6.0%) should be considered for treatment with metformin, in addition to lifestyle modification, which includes weight loss and physical activity.

To determine what proportion of the American population presenting with either IFG or IGT would merit consideration for metformin treatment in accordance with the recent ADA recommendations, we evaluated healthy volunteers without known diabetes who were screened for diabetes/pre-diabetes by the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

A Way Forward

Overweight, obesity, and prediabetes must be diagnosed for two key reasons. First, this enables population health approaches to improve patient care and outcomes. With a diagnosis, these efforts can be done efficiently. Population health studies in hypertension and diabetes have demonstrated improvements in care, and patient identification is simplified when International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes can be searched electronically. Without a diagnosis, population health initiatives become less efficient if they must start with screening. Specific to prediabetes, when patients are already screened for type 2 diabetes in practice, the return on investment of screening is diminished when prediabetes is identified… but not diagnosed. Second, patients receiving a diagnosis should receive a plan in a progress note for the new problem identified as standard care. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that diagnosed obesity prompts action by clinicians. However, many patients with prediabetes receive no diagnosis and no intervention. Regardless of intervention, the diagnosis of overweight, obesity, or prediabetes can be done at no added cost (as screening is already being done) and can improve the process for continued screening for progression to overt metabolic disease, including type 2 diabetes. By formalizing a follow-up plan for subsequent screening, it may be possible to limit patients being lost to follow-up and later presenting with significant glucose elevations as their new baseline or other advanced metabolic disease.

Recommendations for screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes have been established by multiple guidelines. Patients lost to follow-up with prediabetes who later present with type 2 diabetes and significantly elevated glucose appear to be at substantially higher risk for complications. Conversely, patients benefit from the early treatment and control of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, the benefit of early treatment and control of type 2 diabetes is likely underestimated as newer medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes significantly reduce cardiovascular events. Given the benefit of early treatment and control of type 2 diabetes, and the harm associated with developing type 2 diabetes versus not developing type 2 diabetes, we propose it is appropriate for clinicians to operate with the understanding that patients significantly benefit when they do not develop type 2 diabetes. Among various populations, the interventions which appear to have the clearest data regarding diabetes prevention and cardiovascular benefit are intensive lifestyle intervention, metformin, pioglitazone, and liraglutide and semaglutide. As such, we propose these interventions should be systematically deployed as supported by evidence and guideline for the prevention of type 2 diabetes.

### The national clinical care commission report to congress: leveraging federal policies and programs to prevent diabetes in people with prediabetes [^0f279915]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Individuals with an elevated fasting glucose level, elevated glucose level after glucose challenge, or elevated hemoglobin A1c level below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes (collectively termed prediabetes) are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes. More than one-third of U.S. adults have prediabetes but fewer than one in five are aware of the diagnosis. Rigorous scientific research has demonstrated the efficacy of both intensive lifestyle interventions and metformin in delaying or preventing progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes. The National Clinical Care Commission (NCCC) was a federal advisory committee charged with evaluating and making recommendations to improve federal programs related to the prevention of diabetes and its complications. In this article, we describe the recommendations of an NCCC subcommittee that focused primarily on prevention of type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes. These recommendations aim to improve current federal diabetes prevention activities by 1) increasing awareness of and diagnosis of prediabetes on a population basis; 2) increasing the availability of, referral to, and insurance coverage for the National Diabetes Prevention Program and the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program; 3) facilitating Food and Drug Administration review and approval of metformin for diabetes prevention; and 4) supporting research to enhance the effectiveness of diabetes prevention. Cognizant of the burden of type 1 diabetes, the recommendations also highlight the importance of research to advance our understanding of the etiology of and opportunities for prevention of type 1 diabetes.

### Many Americans have pre-diabetes and should be considered for metformin therapy [^74407077]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

In addition to the recommendations of the ADA, the American College of Endocrinology (ACE) has recently issued their consensus statement on the management of pre-diabetes. Similar to the ADA recommendations, the ACE statement recognizes the need for preventive treatment, beginning with lifestyle modification, but also emphasizes the importance of treating relevant comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity, and provides a looser set of criteria regarding the initiation of pharmacological treatment. Acarbose and metformin are their recommended treatments for individuals who are at high risk of developing diabetes, which include, but are not limited to, those with IFG, IGT, and/or the metabolic syndrome, worsening glycemia, cardiovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a history of gestational diabetes, or polycystic ovary syndrome. Taking into account the target populations as defined by the ADA and the ACE, > 8% of Americans could benefit from pharmacological treatment to prevent or delay development of diabetes.

Use of pharmacological agents for the many Americans who may benefit from preventive treatment would incur substantial costs: at current generic rates for metformin, possibly $4/month × 12 months × 24 million Americans = $1.15 billion per year. However, several studies suggest that diabetes prevention or delay with metformin is likely to be cost-effective and/or cost-saving; further evaluation using a variety of cost analysis methods may be required to reach a definitive conclusion regarding the cost of preventive treatment.

To our knowledge, our findings are the first evaluation of the proportion of relatively healthy individuals who might benefit from metformin treatment for the prevention or delay of development of diabetes. However, our study has limitations. Because all SIGT subjects were recruited on a volunteer basis, there may have been a selection bias toward higher family history of diabetes and/or other risk factors for diabetes. Therefore, the SIGT population may represent a group of individuals at higher risk. However, because many SIGT subjects were recruited from university and health care settings, they may also follow healthier lifestyles, which could offset such a bias. Moreover, the proportion with diabetes or pre-diabetes in SIGT was no higher than that in NHANES III and was comparable to that in the more recent NHANES 2005–2006, both of which represent randomized, stratified samples of the American population.

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^8b89a89f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — reducing progression to type 2 diabetes in prediabetes: "In individuals with prediabetes, we recommend prescribing lifestyle modification before drug therapy to reduce plasma glucose levels", and for those with activity limitations or not responding to lifestyle modifications, "we recommend metformin as a first pharmacologic approach to reduce plasma glucose levels". Clinical trial evidence indicates diabetes risk can be markedly reduced by lowering plasma glucose, achievable via lifestyle intervention or drug therapy; in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), both metformin and troglitazone delayed conversion of prediabetes to diabetes. Metformin reduced risk of developing diabetes by 31% over ~4 years and by 18% during 10 and 15 years of follow-up, and at the 15-year follow-up both metformin and lifestyle interventions prevented microvascular events; metformin was also estimated to be cost-saving. Thiazolidinediones have been studied (TRIPOD, DREAM), but potential harmful effects have decreased clinical use and careful harms-to-benefits assessment is advised before considering this class.

### Do patients with prediabetes managed with metformin achieve better glycaemic control? A national study using primary care medical records [^35b3e998]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

To estimate the effectiveness of metformin on glycaemic parameters among participants with incident prediabetes attending Australian general practices.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study used electronic health records of regular participants (3+ visits in two consecutive years) attending 383 Australian general practices (MedicineInsight). Participants with 'incident' prediabetes (newly recorded diagnosis between 2012 and 2017) and their glycaemic parameters (haemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] or fasting blood glucose [FBG]) at 6-, 12-, and 18-24months post diagnosis (unexposed) or post-management with metformin (treatment) were identified from the database. We estimated the average treatment effect (ATE) of metformin management on glycaemic parameters using both linear regression and augmented inverse probability weighting.

Results

Of the 4770 investigated participants with 'incident' prediabetes, 10.2% were managed with metformin. Participants on metformin had higher HbA1c levels at the baseline than those unexposed (mean 45mmol/mol [6.2%] and 41mmol/mol [5.9%], respectively), but no differences were observed at 6-12months (mmol/mol ATE 0.0, 95% CI -0.4; 0.7) or 12-18months (ATE -0.3, 95% CI -1.2; 0.3). However, participants on metformin had lower mean HbA1c mmol/mol at 18-24months (ATE -1.1, 95% CI -2.0; 0.1) than those unexposed. Consistent results were observed for FBG (ATE at 6-12months -0.14 [95% CI -0.25; -0.04], 12-18months 0.02 [95% CI -0.08; 0.13] and 18-24months -0.07 [95% CI -0.25; 0.12]).

Conclusion

The higher HbA1c and FBG baseline levels among participants with 'incident' prediabetes managed with metformin improved after 6-12months of starting pharmacological management, and the effect persisted for up to 24months. Management with metformin could prevent further deterioration of glycaemic levels.

### Metformin prescription for insured adults with prediabetes from 2010 to 2012: a retrospective cohort study [^0fb8182d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Prediabetes affects 1 in 3 Americans. Both intensive lifestyle intervention and metformin can prevent or delay progression to diabetes. Over the past decade, lifestyle interventions have been translated across various settings, but little is known about the translation of evidence surrounding metformin use.

Objective

To examine metformin prescription for diabetes prevention and patient characteristics that may affect metformin prescription.

Design

Retrospective cohort analysis over a 3-year period.

Setting

Employer groups that purchased health plans from the nation's largest private insurer.

Participants

A national sample of 17 352 working-age adults with prediabetes insured for 3 continuous years between 2010 and 2012.

Measurements

Percentage of health plan enrollees with prediabetes who were prescribed metformin.

Results

Only 3.7% of patients with prediabetes were prescribed metformin over the 3-year study window. After adjustment for age, income, and education, the predicted probability of metformin prescription was almost 2 times higher among women and obese patients and more than 1.5 times higher among patients with 2 or more comorbid conditions.

Limitation

Missing data on lifestyle interventions, possible misclassification of prediabetes and metformin use, and inability to define eligible patients exactly as defined in the American Diabetes Association guidelines.

Conclusion

Evidence shows that metformin is rarely prescribed for diabetes prevention in working-age adults. Future studies are needed to understand potential barriers to wider adoption of this safe, tolerable, evidence-based, and cost-effective prediabetes therapy.

Diabetes prevention in older adults with prediabetes — In patients aged 65 years and older who have prediabetes, we recommend a lifestyle program similar to the Diabetes Prevention Program to delay progression to diabetes, whereas metformin is not recommended for diabetes prevention at this time because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this indication; as of 2018, a Diabetes Prevention Program–like lifestyle intervention is a covered benefit for eligible Medicare beneficiaries in the United States.

### A systematic approach to treating early metabolic disease and prediabetes [^49fbc0a7]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to the overall benefits observed in the Diabetes Prevention Program, five key points further highlight the expected benefit of metformin for diabetes prevention in practice. First, the benefit of metformin in preventing type 2 diabetes is not simply masking type 2 diabetes. The majority of metformin's benefit was retained following metformin washout in the Diabetes Prevention Program. Second, it is established that greater adherence to metformin improved its effect on reduced new-onset type 2 diabetes. Thus, patients choosing and staying on metformin can expect benefits beyond those observed in the Diabetes Prevention Program. Third, it is established that a major health disparity exists in diabetes prevalence. Diabetes prevention efforts must account for health disparity and access to care. Not all patients have access to healthy foods or intensive lifestyle interventions. As such, patients should be offered metformin when indicated as the "in practice" alternative to metformin for some patients would be no intervention, far below the level of care provided to patients in the placebo group of the Diabetes Prevention Program. Fourth, key subgroups benefited from metformin more or less in the Diabetes Prevention Program. These subgroups are mirrored in the American Diabetes Association's recommendations. Thus, targeting metformin therapy in practice toward patients younger and more obese would generate a benefit greater than that observed in the Diabetes Prevention Program as obesity is a trigger for increasing insulin resistance and subsequent new-onset type 2 diabetes. Fifth, men, particularly younger men, are underrepresented among those participating in the National Diabetes Prevention Program. In the Diabetes Prevention Program, men experienced a reduction in coronary artery calcium with metformin therapy. Thus, the patients least likely to participate in intensive lifestyle interventions (i.e. younger patients and men) are also the most likely to benefit from metformin.

### Survey of knowledge for diagnosing and managing prediabetes in latin-America: cross-sectional study [^f6f8f05d]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study shows that there is insufficient knowledge about the diagnosis, clinical implications and management of prediabetes amongst the Latin American health providers. The participants answered correctly that a family history of diabetes in a first-degree relative is a main risk factor and the main criteria to screen their patients. However, few recognized ethnicity as a risk factor or that prediabetes is a risk factor for CVD. Despite 75% of those surveyed agreeing that lifestyle modification can reduce the risk of diabetes, 50% correctly identified guidelines recommendations for minimum physical activity and target weight-loss. There was a strong perception that low adherence of patients to lifestyle modifications is due to the lack of motivation and a perception that these changes have clinical impact. However, there is also a lack of familiarity with weight loss programs and skepticism about the effectiveness of these programs among health care providers. There is an important substantial underprescription of metformin in the treatment of prediabetes, despite the published Latin American and Colombian Consensus recommending its use if the goal of glycemia is not achieved after 3 months of lifestyle changes. Additionally, the ADA guidelines recommend the use of metformin for the prevention of development of DM2 in subjects with prediabetes, especially in those with body mass index > 35 kg/m 2, over 60 years old, and in women with a history of gestational diabetes (recommendation grade A). This recommendation is based mainly on the results of the Diabetes Prevention Program, which showed the importance of using metformin in high-risk subjects. Of the 3234 subjects with IFG and body mass index (BMI) > 24 included in the study, 1079 were randomized to intensive lifestyle intervention, 924 to metformin treatment, and 932 to placebo. At 2.8 years of follow-up, lifestyle changes were the most effective intervention for the reduction in the incidence of DM2 (58% compared to placebo). However, metformin was effective in reducing this incidence by 31% compared to the placebo. Moreover, at the 15-year follow-up, the incidence of diabetes was reduced by 18% in the metformin group (0.82, 0.72–0.93; p = 0.001) compared to placebo. Lifestyle changes are the first line and the cornerstone of dysglycemia management. However, given the particular context of our region regarding social and economic, where there are limited time and resources to implement adequate monitoring programs, the addition of the pharmacological strategy as a compliment in the management could be a correct intervention. In addition, the Diabetes Prevention Program of India (IDPP) that resemblances our socioeconomic context showed that changes in lifestyle and metformin reduced the progression to DM2 in a similar proportion, 28.5% (95% CI²0.5 to 37.3%) vs 26.4% (95% CI 19.1 to 35.1%), respectively. The results of our study are worrisome since we have previously shown that 49% of patients with a first AMI were unaware that they had prediabetes, which is not only associated with a higher risk of AMI, but also to lower survival rates following it. Moreover, there is evidence that the benefit of treating prediabetes is the reduction in the risk of progression to diabetes and coronary atherosclerosis.

### Patterns of diabetes screening and prediabetes treatment during office visits in the US [^50b8ce1c]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The American Diabetes Association recommends annual screenings for prediabetes if the patient meets the suggested requirements. The overall prevalence of prediabetes has decreased from an estimated 86 million adults in 2012 to 84.1 million adults in 2015 in the United States. Along with lifestyle modifications, the use of metformin as a treatment option or in combination has shown a decrease in weight and health care costs. This study was designed to review the prevalence of screening and treatment of prediabetes in the United States by using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, as well as identify any factors associated with screenings and treatment.

Methods

The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey was used to examine a study sample of office visits between 2012 and 2015, reviewing the prevalence of screenings and lab services ordered or provided at each patient visit. Inclusion criteria consisted of the recommendations given by the American Diabetes Association including any patient ≥ 45 years or adult patient < 45 years with a body mass index of ≥ 25 kg/m² and an additional risk factor. Patients with a previous diagnosis of diabetes were excluded from the sample.

Results

A total of 105,721 office visits (2012 to 2015) were included in the analysis. The diabetes screening prevalence increased from 10% in 2012 to 13.4% in 2015. Metformin (n = 140, 76.1%) was the most common antidiabetic medication prescribed to treat prediabetes.

Conclusions

The prevalence of diabetes screening during office visits remained lower than 15% between 2012 and 2015 in the United States. Physicians primarily prescribe lifestyle modifications, including a healthy diet and exercise, with metformin being used in some cases for the prevention of diabetes.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^e8ad71ac]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Prediabetes — high-risk adults: Meta-analyses reported increased regression to normal glucose regulation with vitamin D versus placebo (RR 1.48 [95% CI, 1.14–1.92] and RR 1.30 [95% CI, 1.16–1.46]). Trials informing this recommendation primarily related to adults with high risk for diabetes by American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria. Dosing varied across trials, 4 studies used vitamin D2, and due to this variability the panel could not recommend a specific dosage of vitamin D. Over 3 years, absolute diabetes risk reductions were 24 fewer per 1000 (systematic review) or 33 fewer per 1000 (IPD-MA), compared with 70 fewer per 1000 with metformin, noting vitamin D in trials was applied in addition to recommended lifestyle changes.

### Approach to the patient with prediabetes [^726300e3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Prediabetes consists of impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance and is a significant risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes, microvascular, and macrovascular disease. The values used to define prediabetes are arbitrary, because prediabetes represents an intermediary category along the continuum from normal glucose levels and tolerance to overt hyperglycemia. The progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes occurs over many years, strong evidence to support intervention to delay the progression from prediabetes to diabetes. Large, randomized prospective studies with lifestyle intervention and/or various modes of pharmacotherapy have demonstrated successful delay of diabetes. Several issues in the management of prediabetes remain controversial, such as the role of pharmacotherapy and when to escalate treatment. This article will review some of the issues surrounding the identification and treatment of prediabetes, with an interpretation of the available data to help guide management.

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^afc9c5cf]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Type 2 diabetes is common and is a leading cause of morbidity and disability.

Objective

To review the evidence on screening for prediabetes and diabetes to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through September 2019; references; and experts; literature surveillance through May 21, 2021.

Study Selection

English-language controlled studies evaluating screening or interventions for prediabetes or diabetes that was screen detected or recently diagnosed.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; qualitative synthesis of findings; meta-analyses conducted when at least 3 similar studies were available.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, diabetes-related morbidity, development of diabetes, quality of life, and harms.

Results

The review included 89 publications (N = 68 882). Two randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (25 120 participants) found no significant difference between screening and control groups for all-cause or cause-specific mortality at 10 years. For harms (eg, anxiety or worry), the trials reported no significant differences between screening and control groups. For recently diagnosed (not screen-detected) diabetes, 5 RCTs (5138 participants) were included. In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, health outcomes were improved with intensive glucose control with sulfonylureas or insulin. For example, for all-cause mortality the relative risk (RR) was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.96) over 20 years (10-year posttrial assessment). For overweight persons, intensive glucose control with metformin improved health outcomes at the 10-year follow-up (eg, all-cause mortality: RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.91]), and benefits were maintained longer term. Lifestyle interventions (most involving > 360 minutes) for obese or overweight persons with prediabetes were associated with reductions in the incidence of diabetes (23 RCTs; pooled RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.69 to 0.88]). Lifestyle interventions were also associated with improved intermediate outcomes, such as reduced weight, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure (pooled weighted mean difference, -1.7 mm Hg [95% CI, -2.6 to -0.8] and -1.2 mm Hg [95% CI, -2.0 to -0.4], respectively). Metformin was associated with a significant reduction in diabetes incidence (pooled RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.64 to 0.83]) and reduction in weight and body mass index.

Conclusions and Relevance

Trials of screening for diabetes found no significant mortality benefit but had insufficient data to assess other health outcomes; evidence on harms of screening was limited. For persons with recently diagnosed (not screen-detected) diabetes, interventions improved health outcomes; for obese or overweight persons with prediabetes, interventions were associated with reduced incidence of diabetes and improvement in other intermediate outcomes.

### Many Americans have pre-diabetes and should be considered for metformin therapy [^ee295df7]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the proportion of the American population who would merit metformin treatment, according to recent American Diabetes Association (ADA) consensus panel recommendations to prevent or delay the development of diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

Risk factors were evaluated in 1,581 Screening for Impaired Glucose Tolerance (SIGT), 2,014 Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), and 1,111 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2006 (NHANES 2005–2006) subjects, who were non-Hispanic white and black, without known diabetes. Criteria for consideration of metformin included the presence of both impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), with ≥ 1 additional diabetes risk factor: age < 60 years, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², family history of diabetes, elevated triglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol, hypertension, or A1C > 6.0%.

Results

Isolated IFG, isolated IGT, and IFG and IGT were found in 18.0, 7.2, and 8.2% of SIGT; 22.3, 6.4, and 9.4% of NHANES III; and 21.8, 5.0, and 9.0% of NHANES 2005–2006 subjects, respectively. In SIGT, NHANES III, and NHANES 2005–2006, criteria for metformin consideration were met in 99, 96, and 96% of those with IFG and IGT; 31, 29, and 28% of all those with IFG; and 53, 57, and 62% of all those with IGT (8.1, 9.1, and 8.7% of all subjects), respectively.

Conclusions

More than 96% of individuals with both IFG and IGT are likely to meet ADA consensus criteria for consideration of metformin. Because > 28% of all those with IFG met the criteria, providers should perform oral glucose tolerance tests to find concomitant IGT in all patients with IFG. To the extent that our findings are representative of the U.S. population, approximately 1 in 12 adults has a combination of pre-diabetes and risk factors that may justify consideration of metformin treatment for diabetes prevention.

### Long-term effects and effect heterogeneity of lifestyle and metformin interventions on type 2 diabetes incidence over 21 years in the US diabetes prevention program randomised clinical trial [^9b3f54b1]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

In the US Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a 3-year randomised clinical trial in 3234 adults with prediabetes, type 2 diabetes incidence was reduced by 58% with intensive lifestyle intervention (ILS) and by 31% with metformin, compared with placebo. We sought to assess the long-term effects and potential heterogeneity of treatment effects over approximately 21 years of follow-up.

Methods

The DPP trial was continued with protocol modifications as the DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS). In the DPPOS, placebo was discontinued, metformin (850 mg twice a day as tolerated) was continued after unmasking, and group-based booster intervention classes were offered to the ILS group twice a year; additionally, all participants were offered group-based lifestyle intervention four times a year. The prespecified primary outcome during DPP and DPPOS was diabetes incidence defined by American Diabetes Association criteria. The DPPOS protocol specified continued diabetes incidence as an outcome; Feb 23, 2020, was chosen as the closing date for the present analysis, as a date prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused major disruptions in clinic visits and complicated longitudinal data analyses. We assessed long-term persistence of intervention effects on diabetes incidence, and heterogeneity of effects in subgroups defined by baseline diabetes risk factors. Follow-up is reported for the combined study from July 31, 1996, to Feb 23, 2020, and analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00004992 (DPP) and NCT00038727 (DPPOS); follow-up is ongoing but the trial is closed to enrolment except for previous DPP participants.

Findings

3195 participants originally enrolled in the DPP were included in the present analyses. This population comprised 2171 (67.9%) female participants and 1024 (32.1%) male participants, with a mean baseline age of 50.6 years (SD 10.7). Individual follow-up times ranged from 0.2 to 23.2 years (median 8.0 years [IQR 3.0 to 18.0]); remaining numbers at risk decreased sharply after 21 years because of administrative censoring and thus follow-up was considered to represent a 21-year period. During follow-up, compared with placebo, diabetes incidence rate was reduced in the original ILS group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76 [95% CI 0.68 to 0.85], rate difference [RD] -1.59 cases [95% CI -2.25 to -0.93] per 100 person-years) and in the original metformin group (HR 0.83 [0.74 to 0.93], RD -1.17 [-1.85 to -0.49]), with corresponding increases in median diabetes-free survival of 3.5 years and 2.5 years, and mean diabetes-free survival of 2.0 years (95% CI 1.2 to 2.8) and 1.2 years (0.4 to 2.0), respectively. The diabetes cumulative incidence curves separated early, especially in the first 3 years, with lower incidence rates in the metformin and ILS groups than in the placebo group. The metformin and ILS curves progressively converged with longer follow-up. The overall treatment effects appeared to result from large early effects during the DPP. Absolute intervention effects, measured as RDs versus placebo, were greater with ILS in participants with higher values for baseline fasting glucose, HbA 1c, and multivariable clinical and physiological risk indices, and with metformin in younger participants.

Interpretation

The large initial intervention effects seen in the DPP trial were followed by sustained reductions in cumulative diabetes incidence for 21 years. Intervention effects were heterogeneous according to some baseline variables. These findings could guide precision interventions to help address the current type 2 diabetes epidemic.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^602a2138]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Based on the results of clinical trials and the known risks of progression of pre-diabetes to diabetes, an ADA Consensus Development Panel concluded that people with IGT and/or IFG should be counseled on lifestyle changes with goals similar to those of the DPP (5–10% weight loss and moderate physical activity of ∼30 min/day). Regarding the more difficult issue of drug therapy for diabetes prevention, the consensus panel felt that metformin should be the only drug considered for use in diabetes prevention. For other drugs, the issues of cost, side effects, and lack of persistence of effect in some studies led the panel to not recommend use for diabetes prevention. Metformin use was recommended only for very-high-risk individuals (those with combined IGT and IFG who are obese and have at least one other risk factor for diabetes) who are under 60 years of age. In addition, the panel highlighted the evidence that in the DPP, metformin was most effective compared with lifestyle in individuals with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2 and those under age 60 years.

### Metformin use in prediabetes among U.S. adults, 2005–2012 [^1d28240c]. Diabetes Care (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of and characteristics associated with metformin use among U.S. adults with prediabetes using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005–2012.

Research Design and Methods

The American Diabetes Association's guidelines for metformin use in prediabetes have evolved, with 2017 recommendations suggesting metformin be considered in patients with prediabetes and additional risk factors (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², age < 60 years, or prior gestational diabetes mellitus) or rising hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c). We estimated the age-adjusted prevalence of metformin use among individuals with prediabetes (defined by HbA 1c 5.7–6.4%, fasting glucose 100–125 mg/dL, 2-h poststimulated glucose 140–199 mg/dL, or self-report) and used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate characteristics associated with metformin use.

Results

Of 22,174 adults, 7,652 had prediabetes. The age-adjusted prevalence of metformin use among those with prediabetes was 0.7%. Metformin use was associated with higher mean BMI (35.1 kg/m 2 vs. 29.6 kg/m 2, P < 0.01) and higher glucose (fasting glucose 114 mg/dL vs. 105 mg/dL, P = 0.03; 2-h poststimulated glucose 155 mg/dL vs. 128 mg/dL, P = 0.003; and HbA 1c 6.0% [42 mmol/mmol] vs. 5.6% [38 mmol/mmol], P < 0.01). Metformin use was low even among those with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², a group for whom metformin use is recommended. Metformin use did not vary by race, poverty-to-income ratio, or education.

Conclusions

Metformin use was < 1% among U.S. adults with prediabetes and only slightly more common among those with additional risk factors for diabetes.

### National survey of primary care physicians' knowledge, practices, and perceptions of prediabetes [^9e9db9f6]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite strong evidence and national policy supporting type 2 diabetes prevention, little is known about type 2 diabetes prevention in the primary care setting.

Objective

Our objective was to assess primary care physicians' knowledge and practice regarding perceived barriers and potential interventions to improving management of prediabetes.

Design

Cross-sectional mailed survey.

Participants

Nationally representative random sample of US primary care physicians (PCPs) identified from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile.

Main Measures

We assessed PCP knowledge, practice behaviors, and perceptions related to prediabetes. We performed chi-square and Fisher's exact tests to evaluate the association between PCP characteristics and the main survey outcomes.

Key Results

In total, 298 (33%) eligible participants returned the survey. PCPs had limited knowledge of risk factors for prediabetes screening, laboratory diagnostic criteria for prediabetes, and management recommendations for patients with prediabetes. Only 36% of PCPs refer patients to a diabetes prevention lifestyle change program as their initial management approach, while 43% discuss starting metformin for prediabetes. PCPs believed that barriers to type 2 diabetes prevention are both at the individual level (e.g., patients' lack of motivation) and at the system level (e.g., lack of weight loss resources). PCPs reported that increased access to and insurance coverage of type 2 diabetes prevention programs and coordination of referral of patients to these resources would facilitate type 2 diabetes preventive efforts.

Conclusions

Addressing gaps in PCP knowledge may improve the identification and management of people with prediabetes, but system-level changes are necessary to support type 2 diabetes prevention in the primary care setting.

### Clinical recognition and management of patients with prediabetes [^eb425686]. Endocrine Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: Early identification and management of prediabetes is critical to prevent progression to diabetes. We aimed to assess whether prediabetes is appropriately recognized and managed among patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Methods: We carried out an observational study of Olmsted County residents evaluated at the Mayo Clinic between 1999–2017. We randomly selected 108 subjects with biochemical criteria of IFG and 105 normoglycemic subjects. We reviewed their health records at baseline (1999–2004) and during follow up (2005–2017) collecting demographic and clinical data including vitals, diagnoses, laboratory, and medications associated with cardiovascular comorbidities. The main outcome was documentation of any recognition of prediabetes and management recommendations (lifestyle changes and/or medications). Results: At baseline (1999–2004), 26.85% (29/108) of subjects with IFG were recognized as having prediabetes, and of these 75.86% (22/29) received management recommendations with 6.9% (2/29) getting metformin. During follow-up (2005–2017), 26.67% (28/105) of initial cohort of normoglycemic subjects developed incident IFG and of these, 85.71% (24/28) were recognized as having prediabetes, and 58.33% (14/24) received management recommendations. During the entire study period, 62.50% (85/136) were recognized as having prediabetes of which 75.29% (64/85) had documented management recommendations. High body mass index (BMI) (≥ 35) was associated with increased recognition (odds ratio [OR] 3.66; confidence interval [CI] 1.065, 12.500; P = 0.0395), and normal BMI (< 25) was associated with a lack of recognition (OR 0.146; CI 0.189, 0.966; P = 0.0413). Conclusion: Despite evidence supporting the efficacy of lifestyle changes and medications in managing prediabetes, this condition is not fully recognized in routine clinical practice. Increased awareness of diagnostic criteria and appropriate management are essential to enhance diabetes prevention.

### Trends in self-reported prediabetes and metformin use in the USA: NHANES 2005–2014 [^69311202]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that treatment with metformin be considered for prevention of type 2 diabetes in persons with prediabetes. However, metformin use outside the setting of diagnosed diabetes in US adults is not well characterized.

Objective

To examine trends in self-reported prediabetes and treatment with metformin. We also compared characteristics of adults self-reported prediabetes who were vs. were not taking metformin.

Design

Cross-sectional analysis.

Participants

Adults ≥ 20 years of age who participated in the 2005–2014 National Health and Nutrition and Examination Survey (NHANES), n = 28,461.

Approach

We characterized trends in self-reported prediabetes and metformin use in this population. We used multiple logistic regression models to identify predictors of metformin use among adults with self-reported prediabetes. All analyses accounted for the weighted complex survey design to generate nationally representative estimates.

Key Results

The prevalence of self-reported prediabetes increased from 5.1% in 2005–2006 to 7.4% in 2013–2014 (P-for-trend < 0.001). In persons with self-reported prediabetes, metformin use increased, from 2.4 to 8.3% (P-for-trend = 0.013). Adults who were taking metformin were more likely to be obese and to report trying to lose weight in the past year.

Conclusions

Self-reported prediabetes has increased in the past decade. Metformin use in the setting of prediabetes has also increased but remains relatively uncommon at 8% in adults who self-report prediabetes, despite current clinical recommendations.

### Survey of knowledge for diagnosing and managing prediabetes in latin-America: cross-sectional study [^57d5ecfe]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Attitudes, beliefs and barriers

There is strong agreement (78%) that the identification and management of prediabetes is important, but just 46% strongly agreed that this would help identify the means to treat comorbidities like hypertension, and only 56% believed that patients with prediabetes progress more rapidly to diabetes. Only 40.6% considered that metformin could reduce the risk of diabetes in patients that have already been diagnosed with prediabetes.

Amongst the barriers that the providers identified to be effective in lifestyle changes, (88.4%) agreed and strongly agreed that there was a lack of patient motivation, (72.5%) thought that the patients did not consider lifestyle changes important. 45% considered that weight-loss and physical activity goals were not achieved due to lack of resources, or to financial limitations. Table 4 summarizes the barriers for interventions in prediabetes patients.

Table 4
Barriers for interventions in prediabetes patients

Amongst the interventions that could be improved in the management and treatment of prediabetes, (92.4%) believed that there is a need to improve the access to prevention programs and 58% believed that there is a need for more, and better, educational and nutritional resources. The reasons providers gave for prescribing metformin in patients with prediabetes were: risk of diabetes and obesity (73%), HbA1c > 6% (53%), lack of response to lifestyle intervention (52%) and family history of diabetes (47%). Providers agreed and strongly agreed that the main barriers to the use of metformin is poor patient adherence (76.2%) and because patients did not like to take medicines (70.8%). Moreover, the lack of awareness about the recommendations of the clinical guidelines for metformin use in prediabetes is high (61.4%).

Knowledge by type of speciality of the provider

There was no difference in the level of knowledge about the risk factors that might prompt screening for prediabetes and diabetes between doctors in general medicine, internal medicine, other specialties and other health providers. Similarly, there were no differences in the laboratory criteria for diagnosing prediabetes with the use of HbA1c, in the minimum weight loss recommendation or the selection of laboratory tests for screening. However, there were differences in the correct identification of recommended minimum physical activity and in the fasting glucose values that diagnosed prediabetes (Fig. 1).

Knowledge of risk factors and laboratory criteria, prediabetes practice and management

Table 2 summaries knowledge of diagnoses criteria and management of prediabetes. The principle approaches for initial management of prediabetes used by the providers were: counseling on diet changes and physical activity to lose weight (94.9%), and referral of the patient to a nutritionist (57.3%). Seventy percent considered that they should repeat laboratory tests 3 months after the diagnosis of prediabetes with further follow up 3 months after that (75.1). Almost 80% of the physicians that had patients with prediabetes (without progression to diabetes) had prescribed less than 25% with metformin.

### Novel use and utility of integrated electronic health records to assess rates of prediabetes recognition and treatment: brief report from an integrated electronic health records pilot study [^a229a5cb]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This novel study is the first to describe the use of EHR-based measures for prediabetes identification, follow-up, and treatment. We found that < 50% of patients had documented clinical follow-up in the EHR. In general, those patients with the highest immediate risk of progression to diabetes (based on higher baseline blood glucose levels and higher BMI) were somewhat more likely to receive follow-up. However, despite evidence from the DPP that metformin use in prediabetes patients may slow progression to diabetes, metformin use was low (< 1%) and did not increase among those at highest risk. While some caution in adopting metformin may be due to a reluctance to "medicalize" prediabetes, future research should address barriers to metformin initiation among prediabetes patients and their providers and identify ways to target patients who may potentially benefit from its use.

A key barrier to the wider adoption of lifestyle interventions and metformin use may be a lack of strong evidence-based guidelines for primary care providers on appropriate care paths for prediabetes. Current American Diabetes Association evidence-based guidelines for prediabetes care do not specify metformin initiation for all patients, recommend a specific lifestyle program, or address elevated risk for cardiovascular disease in these patients within primary care settings. In addition, many lifestyle programs (such as that implemented by the DPP) and nutrition counseling are not broadly available as a covered benefit, which may be an additional barrier to their adoption and use. Additional research should address which types of evidence-based prediabetes care guidelines are most effective at improving outcomes and how to best encourage widespread adoption of practical evidence-based prediabetes care by patients, clinicians, and health systems.

This study has a few limitations. We used EHR data from an integrated delivery system to define follow-up care metrics for prediabetes; while some patients may have received care outside the system, utilization data for patients in this "closed" care system are complete for most patients and validated in numerous other research studies. While we searched text notes for all evidence of prediabetes counseling, notes may not document all prediabetes discussions between physicians and patients. We used one laboratory value to determine prediabetes status; however, we used retesting as a key follow-up measure to account for appropriate validation of prediabetes in clinical practice. Finally, our results are from one integrated system with high diabetes care quality that regularly uses EHRs to measure quality; our results may not reflect care in other settings.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^d932ffba]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Prediabetes management — recommendations: Prediabetes is a metabolic and vascular disorder, and clinicians should actively treat people with prediabetes to prevent or at least delay progression to T2D and development of CVD complications. In persons with prediabetes and/or metabolic syndrome and overweight or obesity, clinicians should recommend lifestyle intervention; the Mediterranean diet should be considered to reduce progression to T2D and risk of CVD, and low-fat, vegetarian, and DASH meal patterns can also be considered for prevention of T2D. Clinicians should manage and monitor CVD risk factors in prediabetes and metabolic syndrome, including elevated BP, dyslipidemia, and excessive weight, with the same targets as for a person with T2D. Lifestyle intervention should include physical activity with an ultimate goal of ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate aerobic exercise during 3 to 5 sessions per week, plus resistance training using major muscle groups 2 to 3 times per week, and increasing nonexercise and active leisure activity to reduce sedentary behavior. Obesity medications — phentermine/topiramate ER, liraglutide 3 mg, or weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg — in conjunction with lifestyle therapy should be considered in persons with prediabetes and/or metabolic syndrome with ABCD.

2.1.4. Prediabetes: a Continuum of Cardio-Renal-Metabolic Risk

Prediabetes is a continuum of metabolic abnormalities that extend from the metabolic syndrome with high normal glucose through increasingly severe glucose abnormalities, including impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to just below the diagnostic thresholds for T2D. Metabolic syndrome is defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Third Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP III; i.e. at least 3 of the following: elevated fasting glucose, triglycerides, or BP; low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol [HDL–C], and abdominal obesity). Patients with prediabetes have increased risks of ASCVD, HF, and CKD. It is therefore essential to optimally control BP, lipids, and other CVD risk factors (see below).

Progression from normoglycemia to overt T2D results from a progressive beta-cell defect. Among patients with prediabetes, the incidence of T2D is up to 8% to 11% per year, and roughly half of patients at risk for T2D never develop it. Evidence suggests that intervening early, when dysglycemia is less severe, may prevent progression to T2D or even foster reversion to normoglycemia. Prediabetes therapy is therefore focused on identifying and educating the person at risk with an emphasis on lifestyle modification, weight management, control of CVD risk factors, and efforts to revert to normoglycemia.

Sustained weight loss increases the likelihood of achieving normoglycemia. If a weight loss of at least 5% to 10% cannot be achieved with lifestyle therapy alone, pharmacological and surgical intervention may be considered depending on the patient's underlying comorbidities as well as body mass index (BMI). Although lifestyle therapy is the most effective and durable approach to delaying or preventing T2D onset in patients with prediabetes, pharmacological therapy with metformin, acarbose, or pioglitazone has been shown to decrease the risk of overt T2D. – Accumulating data suggest that glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs), and to a lesser extent sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, may be quite potent in delaying or preventing progression to T2D, probably in part through their weight loss effects. Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any of these medications to prevent T2D, based on clinical research results, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recommend their use in high-risk patients.

### Strategies for diabetes management: using newer oral combination therapies early in the disease [^0e23e369]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment Guidelines and Approaches

Treatment guidelines developed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), as well as by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the American College of Endocrinology (ACE), recommend metformin as the first-choice pharmacotherapy if lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, fail to achieve glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) goals within 3 months. Metformin does not cause significant hypoglycemia, is weight neutral, inexpensive, and has a long-standing evidence base for efficacy and safety; it may even reduce the risk of CV events. On the basis of the Diabetes Prevention Program study, metformin is also recommended for individuals with prediabetes, particularly those with a body mass index greater than 35 kg/m², aged less than 60 years, and women with previous gestational diabetes. If metformin is contraindicated (e.g. because of decreased renal function) or not tolerated, the AACE/ACE guidelines suggest the use of one of the newer agents, such as a GLP-1 receptor agonist, SGLT2 inhibitor, or DPP-4 inhibitor, over older agents (α-glucosidase inhibitors, TZDs, and SUs). The ADA/EASD Position Statement does not prioritize treatments and instead emphasizes patient preference and individualized treatment. Individuals with T2DM benefit from learning about managing their disease, adopting a healthier lifestyle, and understanding the pros and cons of their medications. Well-structured education, such as diabetes self-management education, should aim to support informed decision-making, problem-solving, and active collaboration with the health care team to improve clinical outcomes, health status, and quality of life in a cost-effective manner. Monitoring glycemic goals via determination of HbA1c levels and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) varies according to the individual and his or her treatment.

### Pioglitazone for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its associated complications in people at risk for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^03d9b8b1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The term prediabetes is used to describe a population with an elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). With projections of an increase in the incidence of T2DM, prevention or delay of the disease and its complications is paramount. It is currently unknown whether pioglitazone is beneficial in the treatment of people with increased risk of developing T2DM.

Objectives

To assess the effects of pioglitazone for prevention or delay of T2DM and its associated complications in people at risk of developing T2DM.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Chinese databases, ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We did not apply any language restrictions. Further, we investigated the reference lists of all included studies and reviews. We tried to contact all study authors. The date of the last search of databases was November 2019 (March 2020 for Chinese databases).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a minimum duration of 24 weeks, and participants diagnosed with intermediate hyperglycaemia with no concomitant diseases, comparing pioglitazone as monotherapy or part of dual therapy with other glucose-lowering drugs, behaviour-changing interventions, placebo or no intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts, read full-text articles and records, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We performed meta-analyses with a random-effects model and calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE.

Main Results

We included 27 studies with a total of 4186 randomised participants. The size of individual studies ranged between 43 and 605 participants and the duration varied between 6 and 36 months. We judged none of the included studies as having low risk of bias across all 'Risk of bias' domains. Most studies identified people at increased risk of T2DM by impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or both. Our main outcome measures were all-cause mortality, incidence of T2DM, serious adverse events (SAEs), cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke (NMI/S), health-related quality of life (QoL) and socioeconomic effects. The following comparisons mostly reported only a fraction of our main outcome set. Three studies compared pioglitazone with metformin. They did not report all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, NMI/S, QoL or socioeconomic effects. Incidence of T2DM was 9/168 participants in the pioglitazone groups versus 9/163 participants in the metformin groups (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.38; P = 0.96; 3 studies, 331 participants; low-certainty evidence). No SAEs were reported in two studies (201 participants; low-certainty evidence). One study compared pioglitazone with acarbose. Incidence of T2DM was 1/50 participants in the pioglitazone group versus 2/46 participants in the acarbose group (very low-certainty evidence). No participant experienced a SAE (very low-certainty evidence). One study compared pioglitazone with repaglinide. Incidence of T2DM was 2/48 participants in the pioglitazone group versus 1/48 participants in the repaglinide group (low-certainty evidence). No participant experienced a SAE (low-certainty evidence). One study compared pioglitazone with a personalised diet and exercise consultation. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality, NMI/S, QoL or socioeconomic effects were not reported. Incidence of T2DM was 2/48 participants in the pioglitazone group versus 5/48 participants in the diet and exercise consultation group (low-certainty evidence). No participant experienced a SAE (low-certainty evidence). Six studies compared pioglitazone with placebo. No study reported on QoL or socioeconomic effects. All-cause mortality was 5/577 participants the in the pioglitazone groups versus 2/579 participants in the placebo groups (Peto odds ratio 2.38, 95% CI 0.54 to 10.50; P = 0.25; 4 studies, 1156 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Incidence of T2DM was 80/700 participants in the pioglitazone groups versus 131/695 participants in the placebo groups (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.95; P = 0.04; 6 studies, 1395 participants; low-certainty evidence). There were 3/93 participants with SAEs in the pioglitazone groups versus 1/94 participants in the placebo groups (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 28.22; P = 0.34; 2 studies, 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence). However, the largest study for this comparison did not distinguish between serious and non-serious adverse events. This study reported that 121/303 (39.9%) participants in the pioglitazone group versus 151/299 (50.5%) participants in the placebo group experienced an adverse event (P = 0.03). One study observed cardiovascular mortality in 2/181 participants in the pioglitazone group versus 0/186 participants in the placebo group (RR 5.14, 95% CI 0.25 to 106.28; P = 0.29; very low-certainty evidence). One study observed NMI in 2/303 participants in the pioglitazone group versus 1/299 participants in the placebo group (RR 1.97: 95% CI 0.18 to 21.65; P = 0.58; very low-certainty evidence). Twenty-one studies compared pioglitazone with no intervention. No study reported on cardiovascular mortality, NMI/S, QoL or socioeconomic effects. All-cause mortality was 11/441 participants in the pioglitazone groups versus 12/425 participants in the no-intervention groups (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.91; P = 0.70; 3 studies, 866 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Incidence of T2DM was 60/1034 participants in the pioglitazone groups versus 197/1019 participants in the no-intervention groups (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.40; P < 0.001; 16 studies, 2053 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Studies reported SAEs in 16/610 participants in the pioglitazone groups versus 21/601 participants in the no-intervention groups (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.32; P = 0.28; 7 studies, 1211 participants; low-certainty evidence). We identified two ongoing studies, comparing pioglitazone with placebo and with other glucose-lowering drugs. These studies, with 2694 participants. may contribute evidence to future updates of this review.

Authors' Conclusions

Pioglitazone reduced or delayed the development of T2DM in people at increased risk of T2DM compared with placebo (low-certainty evidence) and compared with no intervention (moderate-certainty evidence). It is unclear whether the effect of pioglitazone is sustained once discontinued. Pioglitazone compared with metformin neither showed advantage nor disadvantage regarding the development of T2DM in people at increased risk (low-certainty evidence). The data and reporting of all-cause mortality, SAEs, micro- and macrovascular complications were generally sparse. None of the included studies reported on QoL or socioeconomic effects.

The Restoring Insulin Secretion (RISE) Consortium is testing interventions designed to preserve or improve β-cell function in prediabetes or early type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

β-Cell function is measured using hyperglycemic clamps and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs). The adult medication protocol randomizes participants to 12 months of placebo, metformin alone, liraglutide plus metformin, or insulin (3 months) followed by metformin (9 months). The pediatric medication protocol randomizes participants to metformin or insulin followed by metformin. The adult surgical protocol randomizes participants to gastric banding or metformin (24 months). Adult medication protocol inclusion criteria include fasting plasma glucose 95–125 mg/dL (5.3–6.9 mmol/L), OGTT 2-h glucose ≥ 140 mg/dL (≥ 7.8 mmol/L), HbA1c 5.8–7.0% (40–53 mmol/mol), and BMI 25–40 kg/m². Adult surgical protocol criteria are similar, except for fasting plasma glucose ≥ 90 mg/dL (≥ 5.0 mmol/L), BMI 30–40 kg/m², HbA1c < 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol), and diabetes duration < 12 months. Pediatric inclusion criteria include fasting plasma glucose ≥ 90 mg/dL (≥ 5.0 mmol/L), 2-h glucose ≥ 140 mg/dL (≥ 7.8 mmol/L), HbA1c ≤ 8.0% (≤ 64 mmol/mol), BMI > 85th percentile and ≤ 50 kg/m², 10–19 years of age, and diabetes < 6 months.

Results

Primary outcomes are clamp-derived glucose-stimulated C-peptide secretion and maximal C-peptide response to arginine during hyperglycemia. Measurements are made at baseline, after 12 months on treatment, and 3 months after treatment withdrawal (medication protocols) or 24 months postintervention (surgery protocol). OGTT-derived measures are also obtained at these time points.

Conclusions

RISE is determining whether medication or surgical intervention strategies can mitigate progressive β-cell dysfunction in adults and youth with prediabetes or early type 2 diabetes.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^4738604d]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

AACE 2023 prediabetes management — Lifestyle intervention specifies regular physical activity with a combination of aerobic and resistance exercises to achieve ≥ 150 minutes per week of moderately intense aerobic exercise over 3 to 5 sessions plus resistance exercise 2 to 3 times per week, which should be added. Pharmacotherapy for weight loss should be considered when lifestyle measures alone are inadequate, with FDA‑approved agents that have shown efficacy including semaglutide 2.4 mg, liraglutide 3 mg, and phentermine/topiramate‑extended release (ER); other FDA‑approved options (naltrexone‑ER/bupropion‑ER, short‑term phentermine, or orlistat) could be considered if the above are not tolerated or accessible. Bariatric procedures are more effective than lifestyle interventions and medications in weight reduction and should be considered in those with prediabetes with a BMI > 35 kg/m². For prevention of progression, although there are currently no drugs approved by the FDA with an indication to prevent the progression of prediabetes to T2D, metformin, pioglitazone, and acarbose have evidence of efficacy in clinical trials.

### Prevention of diabetes mellitus in patients with prediabetes [^bbc6e457]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in patients with diabetes. Consequently, as antidiabetic medications have demonstrated cardiovascular benefit, cardiologists have been asked to weigh in regarding antidiabetic therapy. The cardiologist's role will continue to grow as antidiabetic agents with cardiovascular benefit are being studied in prediabetes as part of an evolving clinical environment. Still, current guidelines primarily recommend high-intensity lifestyle intervention or metformin for diabetes prevention. Considering that many patients cared for by a cardiologist will have prediabetes, we propose herein that cardiologists can also facilitate diabetes prevention through direct intervention, referring patients to community-based high-intensity lifestyle interventions, and through advocacy, policy, and additional guideline development. The most important messaging for a patient is that avoiding new-onset diabetes can reduce microvascular disease, reduce healthcare cost, and improve health-related quality of life. Moreover, as the mortality risk of patients with a history of myocardial infarction and diabetes is almost double that of patients with a history of myocardial infarction who are free of diabetes, there is even more potential benefit in delaying and/or avoiding diabetes in patients with cardiovascular disease. Despite these important health advantages, the implementation of diabetes prevention strategies is lagging. The under implementation may be exaggerated by published opinions conflicting major guidelines in addition to conflicting guideline recommendations. In conclusion, we propose cardiologists can play a key role in preventing diabetes and aligning practice patterns with guideline recommendations among endocrinology, cardiology, and primary care stake holders.

### Prediabetes in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs [^f7cfdb82]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In 2010, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) proposed that individuals with fasting glucose level of 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L) or glucose level of 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L) 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test or hemoglobin A(1c) 5.7%-6.4% be classified as prediabetic, indicating increased risk for the emergence of diabetes mellitus. At the same time, the ADA formulated guidelines for the use of metformin for the treatment of prediabetes.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of prediabetes in a cohort of psychiatrically ill adults receiving antipsychotics and to compare the clinical and metabolic features of prediabetic patients with those of patients with normal glucose tolerance and those with diabetes mellitus.

Method

The 2010 ADA criteria were applied to a large, consecutive, single-site European cohort of 783 adult psychiatric inpatients (mean age: 37.6 years) without a history of diabetes who were receiving antipsychotics. All patients in this cross-sectional study underwent measurement of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, oral glucose tolerance test, and fasting insulin and lipids from November 2003 through July 2007.

Results

413 patients (52.8%) had normal glucose tolerance, 290 (37.0%) had prediabetes, and 80 (10.2%) had diabetes mellitus. The fasting glucose and/or hemoglobin A(1c) criteria were met by 89.7% of prediabetic patients. A statistically significant intergroup gradient from normal glucose tolerance to prediabetes and from prediabetes to diabetes mellitus was observed for waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting insulin levels, and frequency of metabolic syndrome (P = 0.02 to P < .0001). Only 19/290 prediabetic patients (6.6%) met the 2010 ADA criteria for treatment with metformin.

Conclusions

Prediabetes is highly prevalent in adults treated with antipsychotic drugs and correlates with markers of increased intraabdominal adiposity, enhanced lipolysis, and insulin resistance. Criteria for using metformin to prevent the emergence of diabetes mellitus may need to be revised for this population.

### American college of endocrinology pre-diabetes consensus conference: part three [^31e6bef3]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Finally, Alberti asked whether pre-diabetes should be treated, and if so, how? Recalling that one-third revert to normal glucose tolerance, he asked whether a single abnormal GTT should be repeated. We do not know whether the aim of treatment should be restoration of normal glucose tolerance or prevention of diabetes. Prevention of CVD will probably, he suggested, be impossible to ascertain and may not be an appropriate goal for a state defined by glycemia, and he noted that statins would be more likely than metformin to have a benefit in this regard. At present, he suggested that use of acarbose and metformin might be considered, noting that "we don't have the data" to recommend treatment with other agents.

### Metformin use in prediabetes: a review of evidence and a focus on metabolic features among peri-menopausal women [^42e5e2f0]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Metformin's glucose‐lowering effects also contribute to better glycaemic control in prediabetic individuals, which has been supported by a body of evidence and affirmed by the ADA guidelines. A recent Chinese open‐label randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed that metformin combined with standard lifestyle intervention further reduced the risk of developing diabetes than lifestyle intervention alone by around 17% (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.70–0.99]; p = 0.043) over a 2‐year follow‐up. A similar study among general practitioners in Australia found that patients on metformin, particularly those with higher baseline HbA1c levels (6.2% vs. 5.9%), achieved lower mean HbA1c and fasting blood glucose after 18–24 months of follow‐up. Furthermore, a study by Safiah et al. demonstrated a significant reduction in mean fasting blood glucose (101.7 versus 84.1 mg/dL, p = 0.017) and HbA1c (5.6% versus 5.4%, p = 0.001) in female patients after 12 months of metformin therapy.

Multiple meta‐analyses further reinforce metformin's utility in preventing T2D in the population with prediabetes. For example, Patel et al. reported based on 17 studies that the pooled risk ratio (RR) for developing T2D indicated a 35% lower risk (RR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.80) of progressing to T2D among prediabetic individuals receiving metformin compared to controls. Another meta‐analysis of 12 RCTs showed that adding metformin to lifestyle intervention significantly reduced HbA1c levels and the risk of T2D development by 15% (RR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.75–0.97).

### Survey of primary care providers' knowledge of screening for, diagnosing and managing prediabetes [^74545641]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Prediabetes affects 86 million US adults, but primary care providers' (PCPs') knowledge, practices, attitudes and beliefs toward prediabetes are unclear.

Objective

Assess PCPs' (1) knowledge of risk factors that should prompt prediabetes screening, laboratory criteria for diagnosing prediabetes and guidelines for management of prediabetes; (2) management practices around prediabetes; (3) attitudes and beliefs about prediabetes.

Design

Self-administered written survey of PCPs.

Participants

One hundred forty of 155 PCPs (90%) attending an annual provider retreat for academically affiliated multispecialty practices in the mid-Atlantic region.

Main Measures

Descriptive analyses of survey questions on knowledge, management, and attitudes and beliefs related to prediabetes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association between provider characteristics (gender, race/ethnicity, years since training, specialty and provider type) and knowledge, management, and attitudes and beliefs about prediabetes.

Key Results

Six percent of PCPs correctly identified all of the risk factors that should prompt prediabetes screening. Only 17% of PCPs correctly identified the laboratory parameters for diagnosing prediabetes based on both fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c. Nearly 90% of PCPs reported close follow-up (within 6 months) of patients with prediabetes. Few PCPs (11%) selected referral to a behavioral weight loss program as the recommended initial management approach to prediabetes. PCPs agreed that patient-related factors are important barriers to lifestyle change and metformin use. Provider characteristics were generally not associated with knowledge, management, attitudes and beliefs about prediabetes in multivariate analyses.

Conclusions

Addressing gaps in knowledge and the underutilization of behavioral weight loss programs in prediabetes are two essential areas where PCPs could take a lead in curbing the diabetes epidemic.

### Analysis of long-term follow-up of a randomized clinical trial with departures from assigned treatments: estimation of metformin effects on diabetes and its complications in the diabetes prevention program outcomes study [^1f41bd72]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) was a 3-year randomized clinical trial (RCT) with evaluation of lifestyle and metformin interventions compared with placebo for diabetes prevention in high-risk adults. Both interventions significantly reduced diabetes incidence, prompting the long-term Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) to assess the progression of diabetes and its complications over 22 years. During follow-up, departures from the original metformin or placebo assignment occurred primarily because of development of diabetes that, by protocol, was managed by clinicians outside the study, after participants developed diabetes with HbA1c ≥ 7.0%. Diabetes development led to changes in metformin treatment and addition of other glucose-lowering therapies. Using statistical methods designed to estimate intervention effects despite these deviations, we consistently found that metformin reduced diabetes incidence. However, using these methods to evaluate whether use of metformin for prediabetes confers continued benefits after diabetes diagnosis did not substantially change the conclusions from those of the simpler intention-to-treat analysis that did not account for treatment changes. All of the analytic methods used resulted in similar metformin effect estimates with 95% CIs for hazard ratios including 1.0 (no effect) for all outcomes except for diabetes incidence. Elucidating metformin's long-term role in mitigating diabetes-related complications beyond its effects on diabetes prevention is challenging.

Guideline key action statements — Each evidence-based statement in the CPG is organized with an evidence-based KAS in bold, followed by the strength of the recommendation, and an action statement profile that explicitly states the quality improvement opportunity, aggregate evidence quality, level of confidence in evidence (high, medium, low), benefits, harms, risks, costs, and a benefit-harm assessment that determines the strength of the recommendation. Additionally, statements include any value judgments, the role of patient preferences, clarification of intentional vagueness, exceptions, differences of opinion among panel members, and implementation considerations.

### Impact of A1c screening criterion on the diagnosis of pre-diabetes among U.S. adults [^d4df9430]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

It is important to recognize that either criterion (fasting glucose or A1C) is a diagnostic test, not a traditional screening test in that it is not compared with a true criterion standard. Astute clinicians may recognize the shortcomings of each test; however, many providers will probably choose only one or the other for use in practice. The clinical guidelines do not comment on the need for follow-up testing for pre-diabetes. This situation increases the likelihood of higher degrees of variation in screening practices with a possibility of more confusion among providers and patients. Educational interventions may need to be developed to help primary care providers and patients understand the advantages and shortcomings of each test used alone or in combination.

Pre-diabetes is a label developed to identify those at highest risk for incident diabetes in the near future. Data from observational studies suggest that 25–40% of individuals with pre-diabetes will develop diabetes over the next 3–8 years. Guidelines suggest targeting individuals identified as having pre-diabetes for early interventions. Currently, the most effective intervention for the prevention or delay of diabetes is intensive lifestyle behavior change with metformin therapy a less potent alternative. Whereas intensive lifestyle interventions are recommended for individuals identified via IFG, A1C, or IGT, current guidelines recommend that metformin be reserved for those with both combined IFG and IGT plus other risk factors such as A1C > 6%, hypertension, low HDL cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, or a family history of diabetes in a first-degree relative who are obese and aged > 60 years. This recommendation has led some investigators to call for follow-up IGT testing in all individuals identified as having pre-diabetes based on their fasting glucose. This is in part due to the observation that the odds for incident diabetes are fourfold higher among individuals with both IFG and IGT than either alone (odds ratio 39.5 vs. 10.0 and 10.9, respectively). With the use of A1C as a legitimate alternative diagnostic criterion for pre-diabetes, the need for a follow-up OGTT before prescribing metformin may become a point of contention. If an OGTT is not performed, combined criteria of A1C with follow-up IFG testing could be used because this group would also be very high risk, and the data could be combined with other metabolic abnormalities using one of the established diabetes risk calculators to generate a more precise risk estimate. Which criterion is more accurate and clinically relevant for predicting diabetes and tailoring interventions will need to be examined in future prospective studies.

### Effects of exercise, metformin and their combination on glucose metabolism in individuals with abnormal glycaemic control: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^c738f08d]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of exercise, metformin and their combination on glucose metabolism in individuals with abnormal glycaemic control.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Embase, Web of Science, PubMed/MEDLINE and SPORTDiscus.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials involving exercise, metformin or their combined treatments in individuals with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were included. Outcomes included haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 2-hour glucose during oral glucose tolerance test, fasting glucose, fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).

Results

407 articles with 410 randomised controlled trials (n = 33802) were included. In prediabetes, the exercise showed greater efficacy than metformin on HbA1c levels (mean difference -0.16%, 95%CI (-0.23 to -0.09) vs -0.10%, 95% CI (-0.21 to 0.02)), 2-hour glucose (-0.68mmol/L, 95% CI (-0.97 to -0.39) vs 0.01mmol/L, 95% CI (-0.38 to 0.41)) and HOMA-IR (-0.54, 95% CI (-0.71 to -0.36) vs -0.23, 95% CI (-0.55 to 0.10)), while the efficacy on fasting glucose was comparable (-0.26mmol/L, 95% CI (-0.32 to -0.19) vs -0.33mmol/L, 95% CI (-0.45 to -0.21)). In T2DM, metformin was more efficacious than exercise on HbA1c (-0.88%, 95% CI (-1.07 to -0.69) vs -0.48%, 95% CI (-0.58 to -0.38)), 2-hour glucose (-2.55mmol/L, 95% CI (-3.24 to -1.86) vs -0.97mmol/L, 95% CI (-1.52 to -0.42)) and fasting glucose (-1.52mmol/L, 95% CI (-1.73 to -1.31) vs -0.85mmol/L, 95% CI (-0.96 to -0.74)); exercise+metforminalso showed greater efficacy in improving HbA1c (-1.23%, 95% CI (-2.41 to -0.05)) and fasting glucose (-2.02mmol/L, 95% CI (-3.31 to -0.74)) than each treatment alone. However, the efficacies were modified by exercise modality and metformin dosage.

Conclusion

Exercise, metformin and their combination are efficacious in improving glucose metabolism in both prediabetes and T2DM. The efficacy of exercise appears to be superior to metformin in prediabetes, but metformin appears to be superior to exercise in patients with T2DM.

### Early response to preventive strategies in the diabetes prevention program [^dcba446b]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Recommendations for diabetes prevention in patients with prediabetes include lifestyle modification and metformin. However, the significance of early weight loss and glucose measurements when monitoring response to these proven interventions is unknown.

Objective

To quantify the relationship between early measures of weight and glucose and subsequent diabetes in patients undergoing diabetes prevention interventions.

Design

Analysis of results from a randomized controlled trial in 27 academic medical centers in the United States.

Participants/Interventions

3,041 adults with hyperglycemia randomized to lifestyle (n = 1,018), metformin (n = 1,036), or placebo (n = 987) with complete follow-up in The Diabetes Prevention Program.

Main Measures

Independent variables were weight loss at 6 and 12 months; fasting glucose (FG) at 6 months; hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 6 months; and post-load glucose at 12 months. The main outcome was time to diabetes diagnosis.

Key Results

After 6 months, 604 participants developed diabetes in the lifestyle (n = 140), metformin (n = 206), and placebo (n = 258) arms over 2.7 years. In the lifestyle arm, 6-month weight loss predicted decreased diabetes risk in a graded fashion: adjusted HR (95% CI) 0.65 (0.35–1.22), 0.62 (0.33–1.18), 0.46 (0.24–0.87), 0.34 (0.18–0.64), and 0.15 (0.07–0.30) for 0- < 3%, 3- < 5%, 5- < 7%, 7- < 10%, and ≥ 10% weight loss, respectively (reference: weight gain). Attainment of optimal 6-month FG and HbA1c and 12-month post-load glucose predicted > 60% lower diabetes risk across arms. We found a significant interaction between 6-month weight loss and FG in the lifestyle arm (P = 0.038).

Conclusion

Weight and glucose at 6 and 12 months strongly predict lower subsequent diabetes risk with a lifestyle intervention; lower FG predicts lower risk even with substantial weight loss. Early reduction in glycemia is a stronger predictor of future diabetes risk than weight loss for metformin. We offer the first evidence to guide clinicians in making interval management decisions for high-risk patients undertaking measures to prevent diabetes.

### Global status of diabetes prevention and prospects for action: a consensus statement [^5e8426e6]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Primary prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) should be achievable through the implementation of early and sustainable measures. Several randomized control studies that found success in preventing the progression to T2D in high-risk populations have identified early and intensive intervention based on an individualized prevention model as the key factor for participant benefit. The global prevalence of both overweight and obesity has now been widely recognized as the major epidemic of the 21st century. Obesity is a major risk factor for the progression from normal glucose tolerance to prediabetes and then to T2D. However, not all obese individuals will develop prediabetes or progress to diabetes. Intensive, multicomponent behavioural interventions for overweight and obese adults can lead to weight loss. Diabetes medications, including metformin, GLP-1 agonists, glitazones, and acarbose, can be considered for selected high-risk patients with prediabetes when lifestyle-based programmes are proven unsuccessful. Nutrition education is the cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle. Also, physical activity is an integral part of the prediabetes management plan and one of the main pillars in the prevention of diabetes. Mobile phones, used extensively worldwide, can facilitate communication between health professionals and the general population, and have been shown to be helpful in the prevention of T2D. Universal screening is needed. Noninvasive risk scores should be used in all countries, but they should be locally validated in all ethnic populations focusing on cultural differences around the world. Lifestyle interventions reduce the progression to prediabetes and diabetes. Nevertheless, many questions still need to be answered.

Regarding medical management for transient ischemic attack, more specifically with respect to management of diabetes, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider initiating metformin to control blood glucose and to prevent the progression of prediabetes to diabetes in patients with a TIA and prediabetes, particularly with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², ≥ 35 kg/m² in < 60 years of age, or females with a history of gestational diabetes.

### Metformin plus lifestyle interventions versus lifestyle interventions alone for the delay or prevention of type 2 diabetes in individuals with prediabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^4793910a]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition, the combined approach's efficacy in short-term glucose regulation, evidenced by decreased fasting blood glucose levels, may be attributed to the impact of lifestyle interventions and metformin's insulin-sensitizing properties. This dual mechanism addresses both immediate and prolonged aspects of glycemic control, offering a comprehensive strategy for the prevention and management of diabetes.

The absence of a significant difference between the two groups in terms of HbA1c levels at 12 months may be attributed to several factors. First, the intervention's efficacy may diminish over time. In the initial phases, patients may be more compliant with lifestyle modification and medication use, potentially leading to more substantial early improvements in glucose regulation. Over time, adherence may wane, and the body may adapt to the intervention, ultimately plateauing the effects. Additionally, variations in the specific components of lifestyle interventions can contribute to these varied outcomes. In contrast, the absence of a significant difference in FPG levels at 3 and 6 months with the observed significant reduction in the metformin plus lifestyle interventions group at 12 months implies that while the immediate impact on fasting blood glucose might not be pronounced, a longer intervention duration may be necessary to observe the desired effects.

While the combined approach demonstrates efficacy in glycemic control, its impact on other parameters may be limited. This underscores the complexity of diabetes management and highlights the importance of tailoring interventions to address the multifaceted nature of the condition.

We believe that Zhang et al.'s study significantly influences our meta-analysis, being the largest included RCT, comprising 1678 participants. In contrast, other included RCTs had 16 to 262 participants, making them more susceptible to type 2 errors. In addition, Zhang et al.'s study had a longer follow-up duration compared to most included RCTs. These variations underscore the importance of recognizing Zhang et al.'s unique contributions in our analysis.

Metabolic syndrome by National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria is considered a prediabetes equivalent.

### Should adults with prediabetes Be prescribed metformin to prevent… [^21aa2611]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

The American Diabetes Association definition of prediabetes now includes a threshold value in fasting glucose, two-hour glucose tolerance test, or A1C. This definition dramatically expands the number of people who meet the definition of prediabetes; one-third of Americans older than 18 years meet the criteria. 2 In addition, many people will be mislabeled as having prediabetes. Compared with the reference standard of an oral glucose tolerance test, a single A1C measurement is 49% sensitive and 79% specific for prediabetes. 3 The ADA itself states that "prediabetes should not be viewed as a clinical entity in its own right but rather as an increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. " 1 Cutoff values for diabetes and prediabetes are arbitrary.

4 There is broad agreement that the first interventions for people with obesity, diabetes, or elevated blood glucose levels should be improving diet and exercise. A diagnosis is not needed to focus on these interventions to improve health and well-being. Studies of patients with borderline glucose values have shown a decreased incidence of crossing the threshold for a diabetes diagnosis with lifestyle intervention. 3 Those advocating for pharmacologic intervention for threshold glucose values cite randomized controlled trials that show a lower incidence of diabetes with metformin treatment. The landmark 2002 Diabetes Prevention Program studied metformin vs. placebo medication vs. a lifestyle modification program in patients without diabetes who had elevated fasting and postload plasma glucose levels. 5 This study showed a decreased incidence of diabetes at 2. 8 years.

It is unlikely that initiating metformin before diabetes is diagnosed improves outcomes compared with waiting for a formal diagnosis. When the clinically meaningful benefit of a treatment is marginal, harms become more important to consider. Although metformin is inexpensive and simple to use, many patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, and vomiting. 5 Long-term use is associated with vitamin B 12 deficiency. 7 Further, the labeling of patients with the diagnosis of prediabetes is an example of disease mongering (i.e., "the selling of sickness that widens the boundaries of illness in order to grow the markets for those who sell and deliver treatments".

### Independent and combined effects of exercise training and metformin on insulin sensitivity in individuals with prediabetes [^e35ed148]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Metformin or placebo protocol

In a double-blind design, pills were distributed and subjects were instructed to take metformin or placebo with food to minimize potential side effects. Subjects started treatment with 500 mg/day of metformin. The dose was increased 500 mg/day each week until a clinical dose of 2,000 mg/day was reached by week 4. Subjects remained at this dose for the last 8 weeks of the 12-week protocol. Subjects were instructed to return any pills missed to verify compliance, which was > 90% for all conditions.

Preliminary testing

Peak oxygen consumption (V peak) was determined using a continuous progressive exercise test on a cycle ergometer (SensorMedics 800, Yorba Linda, CA). V peak was defined as the highest value obtained during the test using common criteria (i.e. respiratory exchange ratio > 1.1, heart rate within 15 bpm of age-predicted maximum, and rise in V < 150 mL/min despite increased workload). In addition, one-repetition maximum (1-RM) tests were conducted for the chest press, latissimus pull-down, leg press, bicep curl, triceps push-down, and upright row. The 1-RM was defined as the highest weight lifted with proper technique through the full range of motion. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar Prodigy, Madison, WI) was used for determination of body fat, central fat (i.e. from the last floating rib to the top of the iliac crest divided by total body fat mass), and fat-free mass (FFM).

### Design and rationale of the myocardial infarction and new treatment with metformin study (MIMET)-study protocol for a registry-based randomised clinical trial [^ad50a9b7]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

To investigate if addition of metformin to standard care (life-style advice) reduces the occurrence of cardiovascular events and death after myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with newly detected prediabetes.

Methods

The Myocardial Infarction and new treatment with Metformin study (MIMET) is a large multicentre registry-based randomised clinical trial (R-RCT) within the SWEDEHEART registry platform expected to include 5160 patients with MI and newly detected prediabetes (identified with fasting blood glucose, HbA1c or 2-h glucose on oral glucose tolerance test) at ∼20 study sites in Sweden. Patients 18–80 years, without known diabetes and naïve to glucose lowering therapy, will be randomised 1:1 to open-label metformin therapy plus standard care or standard care alone.

Outcomes

Patients will be followed for 2 years for the primary outcome new cardiovascular event (first of death, non-fatal MI, hospitalisation for heart failure or non-fatal stroke). Secondary endpoints include individual components of the primary endpoint, diabetes diagnosis, initiation of any glucose lowering therapy, cancer, and treatment safety. Events will be collected from national healthcare registries.

Conclusions

The MIMET study will investigate if metformin is superior to standard care after myocardial infarction in preventing cardiovascular events in patients with prediabetes (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT05182970; EudraCT No: 2019-001487-30).

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to prevention of CVD, glucose-lowering medications, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to consider initiating metformin to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with T2DM without ASCVD or severe target-organ damage at low, moderate,
high, or very high risk.

HbA1c

Our pooled analysis for the change in HbA1c levels at the endpoints of included studies showed that the combination of metformin and lifestyle interventions exhibited a significant reduction in HbA1c levels, compared to lifestyle interventions alone (SMD = -0.10, 95% CI [-0.19, -0.01], P = 0.03). The pooled studies were homogenous (I² = 0%, P = 0.89) (Fig. 4 a). However, sensitivity analysis omitting Zhang et al. showed no significant difference between the two groups (RR = -0.21, 95% CI [-0.44, 0.02], I² = 0%) (Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. S3).

Furthermore, our subgroup analysis based on different time points, revealed that the combined approach resulted in a significant decrease in HbA1c levels at 3 and 6 months (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI [-0.68, -0.05], P = 0.02; SMD = -0.35, 95% CI [-0.62, -0.07], P = 0.01, respectively). However, the pooled studies at 12 months indicated no significant difference between the two groups (SMD = -0.20, 95% CI [-0.49, 0.09], P = 0.17). The studies within each subgroup exhibited homogeneity (I² = 0%, P = 0.97; I² = 0%, P = 0.58; I² = 0%, P = 0.86, respectively) (Fig. 4 b).

Table 2
Prevalence of risk factors for diabetes in study subjects

Figure 1
Prevalence of metformin indication, stratified by glucose tolerance category. Metformin is indicated per the ADA consensus statement criteria of the presence of both IFG and IGT and one of the following diabetes risk factors: age < 60 years, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², family history of diabetes, elevated triglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol, and A1C > 6.0%. Risk factors for diabetes that were not specifically defined by the ADA were categorized according to the AHA/NHLBI diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome: presence of hypertension by history, systolic blood pressure > 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 85 mmHg, triglyceride level ≥ 150 mg/dl, and HDL cholesterol < 40 mg/dl in men and < 50 mg/dl in women. Glucose tolerance categories are as follows: IFG 100–109, FPG levels 100–109 mg/dl and 2-h postchallenge plasma glucose < 140 mg/dl; IFG 110–125, FPG 110–125 mg/dl and 2-h postchallenge plasma glucose < 140 mg/dl; all IFG, isolated IFG (FPG 100–125 mg/dl and 2-h postchallenge plasma glucose < 140 mg/dl); IGT, isolated IGT; and IFG 100–125 + IGT, all IFG and IGT.

Weight

Our pooled studies at endpoints showed a trend towards higher weight with lifestyle interventions plus metformin; however, this did not reach statistical significance (SMD = 0.12, 95% CI [-0.03, 0.27], P = 0.11). The pooled studies demonstrated heterogeneity (I² = 57%, P = 0.07) (Supplementary Fig. S15). To address this heterogeneity, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using the leave-one-out model, which showed that it was best resolved by excluding Zhang et al. and the results became significant favoring the lifestyle interventions only group (SMD = 0.22, 95% CI [0.10, 0.33], I² = 0%) (Supplementary Fig. S16).

Insulin resistance

Our pooled analysis at the studies endpoints showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups, with a SMD − 0.06 (95% CI [-0.16, 0.03], P = 0.17). The pooled studies demonstrated homogeneity (I² = 0%, P = 0.86) (Supplementary Fig. S17). The results remained non-significant after omitting Zhang et al. and Wiegand et al. (SMD = -0.15, 95% CI [-0.51, 0.22]; SMD = -0.06, 95% CI [-0.16, 0.03], respectively) (Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. S18).

Lipid profile measurements

Serum HDL

Our pooled analysis at 6 and 12 months showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups (SMD = 0.03, 95% CI [-0.27, 0.33], P = 0. 83; SMD = -0.02, 95% CI [-0.28, 0.23], P = 0.87, respectively). The pooled studies at 6 and 12 months were homogenous (I² = 0%, P = 0.80; I² = 0%, P = 0.95) (Supplementary Fig. S19). The results remained statistically non-significant after omitting the study by Wiegand et al. (SMD = 0.02, 95% CI [-0.20, 0.23], Supplementary Fig. S20).

Diagnosis at study start and follow-up

We integrated two sources of information: self-reported diabetes status and results from clinical tests for HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and non-fasting blood glucose (nFBG) performed at the baseline study visit. Participants with pre-existing diagnoses of T2D or prediabetes, including those with HbA1c or blood glucose values outside of the disease's clinical range at study start, were classified according to the pre-existing diagnosis (assuming these may reflect cases of successful disease management). Participants without a diagnosis for T2D or prediabetes could be classified as "with T2D" or "with prediabetes" if their HbA1c or blood glucose was in the diabetic or prediabetic clinical range at study start and at the following yearly visit (diabetes defined as HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, or FBG ≥ 126 mg/dL or random blood glucose [RBG] ≥ 200 mg/dL; prediabetes defined as HbA1c between 5.7% and 6.4%, or FBG between 100 and 125 mg/dL). All participants without initial T2D diagnosis who were classified as "with T2D" had HbA1c ≥ 6.5%. To monitor the maintenance of a given diagnosis or the occurrence of progression events to T2D or prediabetes, we followed study measurements of HbA1c and blood glucose. When HbA1c or blood glucose test results shifted to the diabetic or prediabetic clinical range for at least 2 study visits at any point, diagnoses were updated. Self-reports of initiation of diabetes medications while on the study were marked as progression events to prediabetes or T2D, depending on the indication of the medication. We considered the following diabetes medications: metformin, pioglitazone, glimepiride, exenatide, canagliflozin, empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, dulaglutide, glimepiride, glibenclamide, glipizide, glucagon, chlorpropamide, glyburide, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, alogliptin, semaglutide, liraglutide, and insulin. With these criteria, we observed 242 participants who developed prediabetes, 42 participants with an initial prediabetes diagnosis who reverted their HbA1C and FBS to normoglycemia, 37 participants who progressed from prediabetes to T2D, and 7 participants with normoglycemia who developed T2D. Of these, 101, 17, 15, and 4 participants had plasma samples processed through our proteomic pipeline, respectively.
