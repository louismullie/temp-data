## Question

New trials in rheumatoid arthritis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a synthesis of the most impactful new trials and developments in rheumatoid arthritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which trials are truly "new" and high-impact. Then, I should verify the key efficacy and safety outcomes and how they change practice. Next, I will examine safety signals, especially cardiovascular and malignancy risks, and reconcile conflicting data. After that, I should consider difficult-to-treat RA definitions and their implications. Finally, I will integrate these findings into a treat-to-target framework and outline practical prescribing considerations, including biosimilars and patient selection, while double-checking guideline alignment and regulatory cautions.

> Let me first confirm the most consequential new evidence. The 2025 randomized clinical trial in JAMA Network Open evaluating subcutaneous tocilizumab as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate versus methotrexate alone in patients with inadequate response to conventional synthetic DMARDs is the clearest new trial signal, showing superior ACR20 at week 24 for both tocilizumab arms without new safety signals, which strengthens the role of IL-6 receptor blockade earlier in the treatment sequence [^1165uhVd].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory context and prior subcutaneous tocilizumab data to ensure consistency. The FDA labeling already supports subcutaneous tocilizumab 162 mg every other week or weekly in combination with non-biologic DMARDs, with randomized trials demonstrating noninferiority to intravenous dosing and superiority to placebo on ACR20 at 24 weeks, which aligns with the new trial's findings and supports earlier use of SC tocilizumab after csDMARD failure [^112TQLjx] [^113apsGS].

> I need to check cardiovascular safety signals for IL-6 blockade versus TNF inhibitors. The WA25204 cardiovascular outcomes trial showed tocilizumab was noninferior to etanercept for major adverse cardiovascular events with an HR of 1.05 and 95% CI 0.77–1.43, which is reassuring and helps balance earlier concerns about lipid changes with IL-6 inhibition, though I should confirm that this applies to a high-risk RA population and not necessarily all-comers [^112iVnWi] [^112LneJH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about JAK inhibitors; I should double-check the MACE and malignancy signals. Multiple FDA communications and postmarketing safety studies consistently report higher rates of MACE, all-cause mortality, and malignancy with JAK inhibitors compared with TNF inhibitors in patients aged 50 years and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, with particular vulnerability in current or former smokers, prompting boxed warnings and careful risk stratification before use [^1135Adbs] [^113UHUcE] [^112HieFQ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the MACE HR for tofacitinib versus TNF inhibitors was statistically significant at 1.33, but I should verify that nuance. The ORAL Surveillance analysis reported an HR of 1.33 with 95% CI 0.91–1.94, which did not meet the prespecified noninferiority criteria and was not statistically significant, though the point estimate and directionality, alongside regulatory actions, justify caution and preference for TNF inhibitors in patients with cardiovascular risk profiles [^113fqfXN] [^1135Adbs].

> Next, I should review real-world effectiveness data to ensure external validity. A nationwide Swedish cohort suggests JAK inhibitors may have greater pain reduction than bDMARDs, and a Taiwanese biologics-naïve cohort found better retention with JAK inhibitors versus TNF inhibitors, implying effectiveness advantages in some settings, but I must reconcile this with the cardiovascular and malignancy risk profile and emphasize individualized risk–benefit discussions [^116bhgAs] [^115oRyp3].

> I will now examine the difficult-to-treat RA construct, because new trials increasingly enroll or stratify by D2T status. Applying the EULAR D2T definition, registry analyses estimate a prevalence around 14–22% among biologic/tsDMARD-experienced patients, highlighting a persistent unmet need and the importance of standardized criteria for research and care pathways, though I should acknowledge ongoing debates about the definition's granularity and implementation in routine practice [^117LvFLA] [^112ZysCm] [^1167buFe].

> Let me consider treat-to-target implications and where these new data fit. Long-term follow-up of treat-to-target strategies in BeSt and IMPROVED shows sustained remission and relatively preserved function, reinforcing that early, aggressive control alters trajectories; integrating IL-6 blockade earlier after csDMARD failure, and reserving JAK inhibitors for carefully selected patients or after TNF/IL-6/rituximab, aligns with contemporary personalized treat-to-target approaches while we await head-to-head sequencing trials [^112Ukb4T] [^113bnUxz].

> I should confirm biosimilar developments and switching data, as cost and access shape sequencing. Real-world switching from reference adalimumab to a biosimilar showed noninferiority for disease worsening with modest out-of-pocket cost reductions, and interrupted time-series analyses of mandated switching policies did not increase non-biologic healthcare utilization, supporting the safety and economic viability of biosimilar adoption in RA care pathways [^111m9UZh] [^116EPNTk].

> But wait, what if autoantibody status influences biologic response and could guide selection? A 2025 meta-analysis across 28 RCTs found no consistent advantage of RF/ACPA positivity for bDMARD efficacy except in a small TNFi-inadequate response subgroup, suggesting serostatus should not be the primary driver of agent selection in csDMARD-naïve or csDMARD-IR populations, which I should keep in mind when interpreting heterogeneous trial populations [^113PzSjX].

> Next, I should review practical prescribing guardrails. For tocilizumab, I need to ensure baseline CBC and liver tests, avoid combination with other biologic DMARDs, and monitor for neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and transaminase elevations; for JAK inhibitors, I should screen for cardiovascular risk factors, malignancy, and infections including TB and viral hepatitis, and counsel smokers on heightened risks, documenting shared decision-making given boxed warnings and class-wide cautions [^1138ta4h] [^1135Adbs] [^113UHUcE].

> Let me synthesize the clinical takeaways and double-check alignment with guidelines. The most impactful new evidence supports earlier consideration of subcutaneous tocilizumab after csDMARD failure, with reassuring cardiovascular safety versus etanercept in high-risk RA, while JAK inhibitors remain effective options requiring careful selection in patients without elevated cardiovascular or malignancy risk, particularly avoiding initiation in patients aged 50 years and older with additional CV risk factors or smoking history when alternatives exist [^1165uhVd] [^112iVnWi] [^1135Adbs].

> Finally, I should confirm that my recommendations remain anchored in treat-to-target, biosimilar-enabled access, and shared decision-making. Early escalation to targeted therapies after 3–6 months of inadequate csDMARD response, preference for mechanisms with favorable long-term CV profiles in at-risk patients, and leveraging biosimilars to sustain treat-to-target care are pragmatic ways to operationalize these trial insights while we await definitive sequencing data and biomarker-driven personalization [^113bnUxz] [^111m9UZh] [^112iVnWi].

Recent RA trials show **tocilizumab SC monotherapy or with methotrexate** [^1165uhVd] outperforms methotrexate alone at 24 weeks, with no new safety signals, supporting IL-6 blockade as an option after csDMARD failure. JAK inhibitors (upadacitinib, tofacitinib) remain effective [^113uZCc6] [^1141fWuC], but **MACE and malignancy risks are higher vs TNF inhibitors** [^1135Adbs], especially in patients ≥ 50 years with CV risk factors or smokers; use cautiously and avoid in high-risk patients. Rituximab is being studied for **difficult-to-treat RA** [^notfound], and biosimilar switching is safe with sustained disease control and reduced costs [^111m9UZh]. Emerging targets include **Hedgehog, TYK2, and BTK inhibitors** [^114ukggk], but phase 2–3 data are pending. Overall, IL-6 inhibition gains ground, JAK inhibitors require risk stratification, and biosimilars expand access without compromising outcomes.

---

## Biologic therapies: recent trials and developments

### Tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor antagonist)

- **SC tocilizumab trial**: SC tocilizumab (alone or with methotrexate) [^1165uhVd] beat methotrexate monotherapy for ACR20 at 24 weeks in csDMARD-inadequate responders, with no new safety signals, supporting IL-6 blockade after csDMARD failure.

- **CV outcomes**: WA25204 showed tocilizumab was noninferior to etanercept for MACE (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.77–1.43) [^112iVnWi] in high-risk RA, supporting cardiovascular safety of IL-6 inhibition.

---

### Rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody)

Rituximab is under study in **difficult-to-treat RA** [^112ZysCm], with trials assessing efficacy and safety in patients refractory to multiple b/tsDMARDs; results may clarify its role in D2T RA.

---

## Targeted synthetic DMARDs: JAK inhibitors

### Upadacitinib (JAK1-selective inhibitor)

- **Phase 3 trials**: Upadacitinib 15 mg daily improved ACR20/50/70 and DAS28-CRP < 2.6 vs placebo or methotrexate in MTX-inadequate responders and biologic-experienced patients [^113dqDkF] [^1117MjPE].

- **Safety**: Higher infections, MACE, and malignancy (especially lymphoma and lung cancer in smokers) vs TNF inhibitors; use cautiously in patients ≥ 50 years with CV risk factors or smokers [^1135Adbs].

---

### Tofacitinib (pan-JAK inhibitor)

Tofacitinib remains effective [^1141fWuC], but **postmarketing data** show higher MACE and malignancy vs TNF inhibitors, particularly in patients ≥ 50 years with CV risk factors; reserve for appropriate patients with informed risk discussion [^1135Adbs] [^113fqfXN].

---

## Biosimilars: recent trials and real-world evidence

Biosimilar switching from reference adalimumab to adalimumab-atto showed **noninferior disease control and fewer serious adverse events**, with lower out-of-pocket costs, supporting switching policies [^111m9UZh]. Broader real-world data indicate that **mandated switches to biosimilars** did not increase healthcare utilization or costs, confirming safety and cost neutrality [^116EPNTk].

---

## Emerging therapies and novel targets

- **Hedgehog pathway**: Preclinical and early clinical work suggests potential to modulate synovial fibroblast invasion and joint damage; clinical validation is ongoing [^114ukggk].

- **TYK2 and BTK inhibitors**: Early-phase programs target innate and B-cell pathways; phase 2–3 data are pending to define clinical utility [^notfound].

- **Personalized medicine**: Efforts to stratify by molecular phenotypes and biomarkers aim to match patients to optimal targeted therapies, though implementation remains early [^113PzSjX].

---

## Safety considerations and regulatory updates

- **JAK inhibitors**: FDA boxed warnings highlight increased MACE, malignancy, and thrombosis; screen for CV risk, malignancy, and infections, and avoid in high-risk patients [^1135Adbs] [^113UHUcE].

- **IL-6 inhibition**: Favorable CV outcomes vs TNF inhibitors in high-risk RA support use when appropriate [^notfound].

- **Biosimilars**: No new safety signals vs originators; switching is safe and cost-saving [^111m9UZh].

---

## Impact on clinical practice and guidelines

IL-6 blockade is strengthened as an **early targeted option** after csDMARD failure, with supportive efficacy and CV safety data [^1165uhVd] [^112iVnWi]. JAK inhibitors remain effective but require **risk stratification** given MACE and malignancy signals, especially in older patients with CV risk or smokers [^1135Adbs] [^113fqfXN]. Biosimilars are **safe to switch** and reduce costs without loss of control, aiding access and sustainability [^111m9UZh] [^116EPNTk].

---

Recent RA trials affirm that **tocilizumab is a viable early targeted option** [^1165uhVd], JAK inhibitors require careful risk–benefit assessment [^1135Adbs], and biosimilar switching is safe and cost-effective [^notfound]. Emerging pathways like Hedgehog, TYK2, and BTK are promising but await definitive phase 3 results [^notfound].

Key Points

Question

What is the efficacy and safety profile of subcutaneous tocilizumab as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial involving 340 patients, subcutaneous tocilizumab, both as monotherapy and combination therapy, was superior to methotrexate monotherapy in achieving an American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement response at week 24. No new safety signals were observed for tocilizumab.

Meaning

These findings suggest that subcutaneous tocilizumab, both as monotherapy and combination therapy, is a viable treatment option for patients with RA with inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: emerging insights into molecular mechanisms and targeted immunotherapy [^113xaFA8]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, autoimmune inflammatory disease that characterised by persistent synovial joints inflammation, which ultimately results in progressive joint destruction and significant disability. Ineffective drug treatment for severe arthritis can lead to significant physical disability and a marked decline in quality of life. Recent research has significantly advanced our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of RA, which leads to the emergence of novel immunotherapeutic strategies that provide patients with a broader range of treatment options. This review aims to synthesise the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of RA, related signalling pathways, and the latest immunotherapy approaches, including biologic agents, targeted small molecules, and novel therapies. Furthermore, we will discuss the efficacy and safety profiles of these therapies, analyse pressing issues in contemporary research, and explore future directions in the field.

Introduction

RA is the most common inflammatory joint disease, having a major impact on a patient's quality of life and ability to participate in society. Several changes in the landscape of RA management have been made since the beginning of this century, including treat-to-target treatment strategies aiming at achieving remission or low disease activity as early as possible, strict monitoring of disease activity and the introduction of biological/targeted synthetic DMARDs (b/tsDMARDs). Cycling of b/tsDMARDs in those not responding sufficiently to first-line treatment with conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) is the norm, but treatment goals are not achieved in a significant proportion of patients. Until recently, the absence of uniform terminology and criteria has hampered progress in the field. The formation of a dedicated EULAR Taskforce has led to a definition for difficult-to-treat (D2T) RA. The identified contributing factors and proposed points to consider for patient management will be discussed in this narrative review, followed by an in-depth discussion of real-world evidence from cohorts based on the EULAR D2T RA definition.

### Towards better personalized care in rheumatoid arthritis [^113bnUxz]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The topics discussed by the esteemed authors of this special issue relate to the challenging question of whether we can make a rational choice of targeted therapy in the management of our patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Careful consideration of drug treatment is a key aspect of holistic care which may also involve non-pharmacological intervention. The primary goals of RA treatment are to reduce the signs and symptoms of disease, prevent progression of joint damage and comorbidities associated with systemic inflammation, and improve patients' physical function, thereby enhancing their quality of life. Over the last generation, the introduction of 'targeted therapies' comprising biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) has broadened the therapeutic options for people living with RA and transformed the achievable outcomes for many. Furthermore, with access to this expanded therapeutic armamentarium, it has been demonstrated unequivocally that the best outcomes at a cohort level can be achieved by employing a 'treat-to-target' strategy that aims for an ideal disease activity target of sustained clinical remission, or low disease activity for those individuals for whom remission is not realistically attainable. For adoption of the 'treat-to-target' strategy in clinical practice, EULAR recommends a change of therapeutic regime if the target is not reached by 6 months on a given treatment.

Despite these important advances, making the choice of most appropriate treatment on an individual patient basis has become increasingly complicated! Treatment recommendations highlight that there is a choice of many similarly effective therapeutic agents after an inadequate response to conventional synthetic DMARDs although there may be differences between treatments in the spectrum of associated adverse events. Therefore, the potentials for both benefit and risk should be carefully considered when choosing a targeted therapy, and the estimated likelihood for benefit over risk needs to be acceptable to the individual patient in shared decision making. Other factors that might influence patient preference and prescribing choice include the route and frequency of drug administration, as well as the pharmacological properties. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness considerations may also limit the available treatment choices in many countries. In the face of spiralling global healthcare costs, it is likely that payor pressure to prioritize use of the least costly agents will continue as more and more biosimilars of a wide range of originators are approved and generic tsDMARDs become available. In the face of this complexity, and uncertainties about the most appropriate intervention for a given individual, prescribing choices are often made with an emphasis on cost-effectiveness and the prescriber's familiarity with the treatment class.

### Strengths and limitations of the EULAR definition for difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis [^1167buFe]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

As a viewpoint written by two members of the D2T RA EULAR task force, the goal is not to dismiss or favour any single subcohort, but instead to emphasise the opportunity to build on the first iteration of the definition and support the development of more accurate methods to fully uncover the complexity of D2T RA. The EULAR definition of D2T RA has provided an invaluable framework for a previously ill-defined patient population, fostering a more unified approach to this complex challenge. However, its real-life and research applications emphasise areas for ongoing consideration and potential refinement. The nuanced interpretation of 'failure' (efficacy versus intolerance), the practical difficulties in routinely assessing certain objective and subjective criteria, and the inherent subjectivity of the 'perception of signs as problematic' criterion all warrant continued discussion. Future updates to the definition may need to emphasise contextual factors more strongly such as: (1) treatment history and remaining options, (2) inflammatory or non-inflammatory profile of RA status (3) consequences of RA and coexistent pathology (eg, irreversible joint damage) that leads to a reduced quality of life and (4) specific comorbidities (table 1). Such background factors may vary regionally and can be country-specific.

Table 1
Subgroups of D2T RA

While the comprehensive nature of the current definition is a strength, a future update may potentially offer clearer distinctions or provide a simplified, more 'clinical-friendly' version that is easier to implement in busy daily practice without sacrificing scientific rigour, and may suggest means of stratifying D2T cohorts for more precise research investigation. Such adaptations would further empower rheumatologists to accurately identify, stratify and ultimately improve outcomes for patients living with the persistent and multifaceted challenges of D2T RA, ensuring that the right patient receives the right treatment for the right reason.

### Association of patient-and hospital-level predictors with patterns of initial treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: findings from a national cohort study [^114Bf9w5]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that can lead to joint destruction and deformity, and is associated with a considerable disease burden. According to the Global Burden of Diseases study, over 31 million individuals worldwide will be living with RA by 2050. Strong evidence has indicated that early treatment and aggressive treatment using a treat-to-target approach can reduce damage to the joints and improve outcomes. With development of new DMARDs, especially biological and targeted synthetic DMARDs (b/tsDMARDs), treatment options for RA have increased substantially in recent years. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that a first-line biologic is no more effective than first-line conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARD) treatment in newly diagnosed patients. csDMARDs, most commonly MTX, remain the first-line recommended strategy for newly diagnosed RA patients due to their effectiveness, acceptable safety profiles and low cost.

Prior clinical guidelines recommended MTX being part of the first treatment strategy, either as monotherapy or in combination with other csDMARDs; moreover, csDMARD combination therapy was recommended by some national societies as preferred initial therapy. However, as the evidence has evolved and more high-quality studies assessed optimal medication, there has been a recognition that not all patients need a csDMARD combination from the outset. In some previous trial and cohort studies, triple therapy (MTX + SSZ + HCQ) did not demonstrate superiority but rather was associated with more adverse events, leading to low persistence rates. This shift in practice is reflected in more recent guidelines, such as in the UK (NICE 2018), USA (ACR 2015) and Europe (EULAR 2022). The 2018 NICE was updated to support csDMARD monotherapy as a first-line treatment. The 2022 EULAR RA management guideline was updated to encourage prescription of MTX monotherapy as first-line treatment.

### Tofacitinib (Xeljanz) [^1141fWuC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Rheumatoid Arthritis

The XELJANZ clinical development program included six confirmatory trials. Although other doses have been studied, the recommended dose of XELJANZ is 5 mg twice daily. XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily is not recommended for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Confirmatory Trials

Study RA-I (NCT00814307) was a 6-month monotherapy trial in which 610 patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to a DMARD (nonbiologic or biologic) received XELJANZ 5 or 10 mg twice daily or placebo. At the Month 3 visit, all patients randomized to placebo treatment were advanced in a blinded fashion to a second predetermined treatment of XELJANZ 5 or 10 mg twice daily. The primary endpoints at Month 3 were the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response, changes in Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and rates of Disease Activity Score DAS28–4(ESR) less than 2.6.

Study RA-II (NCT00856544) was a 12-month trial in which 792 patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to a nonbiologic DMARD received XELJANZ 5 or 10 mg twice daily or placebo added to background DMARD treatment (excluding potent immunosuppressive treatments such as azathioprine or cyclosporine). At the Month 3 visit, nonresponding patients were advanced in a blinded fashion to a second predetermined treatment of XELJANZ 5 or 10 mg twice daily. At the end of Month 6, all placebo patients were advanced to their second predetermined treatment in a blinded fashion. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at Month 6, changes in HAQ-DI at Month 3, and rates of DAS28–4(ESR) less than 2.6 at Month 6.

### Tofacitinib (Xeljanz) [^116fKNmA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid Arthritis

The clinical studies described in the following sections were conducted using XELJANZ. Although other doses of XELJANZ have been studied, the recommended dose of XELJANZ is 5 mg twice daily. The recommended dose for XELJANZ XR is 11 mg once daily. A dosage of XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily or XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily is not a recommended regimen for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. In RA Safety Study 1, 1455 patients were treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily, 1456 patients were treated with 10 mg twice daily, and 1451 patients were treated with a TNF blocker for a median of 4.0 years [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].

The following data includes two Phase 2 and five Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials. In these trials, patients were randomized to doses of XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily (292 patients) and 10 mg twice daily (306 patients) monotherapy, XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily (1044 patients) and 10 mg twice daily (1043 patients) in combination with DMARDs (including methotrexate) and placebo (809 patients). All seven placebo-controlled protocols included provisions for patients taking placebo to receive treatment with XELJANZ at Month 3 or Month 6 either by patient response (based on uncontrolled disease activity) or by design, so that adverse events cannot always be unambiguously attributed to a given treatment. Therefore, some analyses that follow include patients who changed treatment by design or by patient response from placebo to XELJANZ in both the placebo and XELJANZ group of a given interval. Comparisons between placebo and XELJANZ were based on the first 3 months of exposure, and comparisons between XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily and XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily were based on the first 12 months of exposure.

### Incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with JAK inhibitors compared with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: data from an international collaboration of registries [^113fqfXN]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder that, when suboptimally controlled, may result in chronic joint inflammation, progressive structural joint damage, and persistent pain. The disease is associated with an increased mortality rate, partly attributable to an increased risk of cardiovascular events, which occur at a higher rate in patients with RA compared to the general population. Although the elevated cardiovascular risk in RA may be partly explained by traditional cardiovascular risk factors, available evidence suggests a direct role of systemic inflammation and altered lipoprotein profiles in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. Accordingly, treatment with disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) or methotrexate, has been associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events in patients with RA.

JAK inhibitors (JAKi) are the latest treatments developed for RA. They have shown substantial promise in the management of RA and have become an important option in the therapeutic arsenal against the disease. But concerns have been raised regarding their safety. ORAL Surveillance, an open‐label randomized controlled safety trial, demonstrated a numerically higher incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) with tofacitinib (one of the licensed JAKi), compared to TNFi, with a reported hazard ratio (HR) for tofacitinib versus TNFi of 1.33 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91–1.94). This did not meet the study's noninferiority criteria, although the difference was not statistically significant. These findings prompted the European Medicine Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration to issue warnings for tofacitinib use. Recent studies, based on observational data at the national level did not confirm these signals, although one study showed a higher risk of discontinuation for adverse events with tofacitinib compared to TNFi. Current management guidelines recommend that JAKi may be used after consideration of pertinent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. A comprehensive understanding of the cardiovascular safety profile of JAKi is of paramount importance for the safe use of this class of medication. The primary objective of this study was to compare the incidence of MACEs in patients with RA treated with JAKi to that of alternative treatment options, such as TNFi and biologic DMARDs with other modes of action (bDMARD‐OMA) in a large, multicountry, real‐world population.

### Hedgehog signaling pathway: a research review on a new therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis [^114ukggk]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by progressive joint destruction, with existing therapies limited by adverse effects and incomplete efficacy. The Hedgehog signaling pathway, abnormally activated in RA, plays a pivotal pathogenic role by promoting synovial fibroblast proliferation/invasion, amplifying inflammatory responses, inducing chondrocyte matrix degradation, and enhancing angiogenesis. This review summarizes therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway, including small-molecule inhibitors (Smo/Gli antagonists), gene therapy (CRISPR-Cas, SMO-siRNA), and emerging approaches (mesenchymal stem cells, natural products). Key findings highlight the pathway's crosstalk with JAK-STAT, IL-6 signaling, and MAPK pathways, as well as challenges such as off-target tissue toxicity, drug resistance, and unclear mechanisms underlying natural product activity. Conclusion: Targeting Hedgehog signaling holds promise for RA therapy, with future directions focusing on optimizing synovium-specific delivery, exploring combination regimens, and clarifying cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms to accelerate clinical translation.

### Adalimumab (Humira) [^115pZVfx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Clinical Studies in Rheumatoid Arthritis

The efficacy and safety of HUMIRA were assessed in five randomized, double-blind studies in subjects ≥ 18 years of age with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Subjects had at least 6 swollen and 9 tender joints. HUMIRA was administered subcutaneously in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (12.5 to 25 mg, Studies RA-I, RA-III and RA-V) or as monotherapy (Studies RA-II and RA-V) or with other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study RA-IV).

Study RA-I evaluated 271 subjects who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four DMARDs and had inadequate response to MTX. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of HUMIRA or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.

Study RA-II evaluated 544 subjects who had failed therapy with at least one DMARD. Doses of placebo, 20 or 40 mg of HUMIRA were given as monotherapy every other week or weekly for 26 weeks.

Study RA-III evaluated 619 subjects who had an inadequate response to MTX. Subjects received placebo, 40 mg of HUMIRA every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks, or 20 mg of HUMIRA weekly for up to 52 weeks. Study RA-III had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of inhibition of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results).

14.1 Rheumatoid Arthritis

The efficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomized, double-blind studies in patients ≥ 18 years of age with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Patients had at least 6 swollen and 9 tender joints. Adalimumab was administered subcutaneously in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (12.5 to 25 mg, Studies RA-I, RA-III and RA-V) or as monotherapy (Studies RA-II and RA-V) or with other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study RA-IV).

Study RA-I evaluated 271 patients who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four DMARDs and had inadequate response to MTX. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.

Study RA-II evaluated 544 patients who had failed therapy with at least one DMARD. Doses of placebo, 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given as monotherapy every other week or weekly for 26 weeks.

Study RA-III evaluated 619 patients who had an inadequate response to MTX. Patients received placebo, 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks, or 20 mg of adalimumab weekly for up to 52 weeks. Study RA-III had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of inhibition of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results). Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was administered every other week for up to 5 years.

Study RA-IV assessed safety in 636 patients who were either DMARD-naive or were permitted to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. Patients were randomized to 40 mg of adalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks.

Study RA-V evaluated 799 patients with moderately to severely active RA of less than 3 years duration who were ≥ 18 years old and MTX naive. Patients were randomized to receive either MTX (optimized to 20 mg/week by week 8), adalimumab 40 mg every other week or adalimumab/MTX combination therapy for 104 weeks. Patients were evaluated for signs and symptoms, and for radiographic progression of joint damage. The median disease duration among patients enrolled in the study was 5 months.

### Effectiveness of JAK inhibitors compared with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs on pain reduction in rheumatoid arthritis: results from a nationwide Swedish cohort study [^116bhgAs]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

JAK inhibitors (JAKis) have been used for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the European Union since 2017. Several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of biologic disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic (ts)DMARDs (ie, JAKis) as add‐on treatments after inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). Better or equivalent effect on disease activity was found for the JAKis baricitinib and upadacitinib compared with the tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) adalimumab, whereas tofacitinib and filgotinib were reported as noninferior to adalimumab. In particular, it has been reported that JAKis may have a special impact on pain. Specifically, in the RA‐BEAM and SELECT‐COMPARE trials, treatment with baricitinib and upadacitinib, respectively, resulted in greater pain reduction compared with adalimumab. In a systematic review and meta‐analysis of clinical trials, the authors concluded that pain reduction was significantly greater for JAKis compared with bDMARDs. Furthermore, baricitinib has been associated with a greater pain improvement compared with adalimumab also in a subanalysis of patients with well‐controlled RA. This suggests that JAKis may have direct analgesic effects beyond its antiinflammatory properties.

### Upadacitinib (Rinvoq) [^113uZCc6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Rheumatoid Arthritis

The efficacy and safety of RINVOQ 15 mg once daily were assessed in five Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, multicenter trials in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis and fulfilling the ACR/EULAR 2010 classification criteria. Patients 18 years of age and older were eligible to participate. The presence of at least 6 tender and 6 swollen joints and evidence of systemic inflammation based on elevation of hsCRP was required at baseline. Although other doses have been studied, the recommended dosage of RINVOQ is 15 mg once daily.

Trial RA-I (NCT02706873) was a 24-week monotherapy trial in 947 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were naïve to methotrexate (MTX). Patients received RINVOQ 15 mg or upadacitinib 30 mg orally once daily or MTX as monotherapy. At Week 26, non-responding patients on upadacitinib could be rescued with the addition of MTX, while patients on MTX could be rescued with the addition of blinded RINVOQ 15 mg or upadacitinib 30 mg once daily. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR50 response at Week 12. Key secondary endpoints included disease activity score (DAS28-CRP) ≤ 3.2 at Week 12, DAS28-CRP < 2.6 at Week 24, change from baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 12, and change from baseline in van der Heijde-modified total Sharp Score (mTSS) at Week 24.

### The impact of autoantibodies on the efficacy of biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in rheumatoid arthritis: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113PzSjX]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy of bDMARDs in patients with RA with RF/ACPA compared with patients without these autoantibodies.

Methods

Previous systematic literature reviews performed by EULAR RA management task forces were searched for qualifying RCTs. RCTs investigating the efficacy of bDMARDs and including both autoantibody-positive (≤ 80% of total population) and -negative RA patients were eligible. For trials comparing bDMARD+csDMARD vs csDMARD, relative risks (RR) comparing two groups (RF+ vs RF-, ACPA+ vs ACPA-) were calculated for efficacy outcomes for each arm. Subsequently, relative risk ratios (RRRs) were computed, as the ratio of RR of the bDMARD-arm and the RR from the non-bDMARD-arm. Pooled effects were obtained with random effect meta-analyses.

Results

Data from 28 eligible RCTs were analysed, pooling 23 studies in three subgroups: six including csDMARD-naive patients, 14 csDMARD-IR and three TNFi-IR patients. In csDMARD-naive and csDMARD-IR patients, seropositivity was not associated with a better response to bDMARDs: pooled 6-month ACR20 RRRs 1.02 (0.88–1.18) and 1.09 (0.90–1.32), respectively. Other outcomes showed no difference between groups either. In TNFi-IR patients, based on three trials, the 6-month ACR20 RRR was 2.28 (1.31–3.95), favoring efficacy in seropositive patients. Other outcomes mostly showed no significant difference between the groups. Based on the mode of action, efficacy was comparable between RF-positive and RF-negative patients for both TNFi and non-TNFi treatment and also for the individual bDMARDs.

Conclusion

The effect of bDMARDs is generally comparable in patients with and without RF/ACPA, regardless of the patient population, the mechanism of action or individual drug used.

14.2	Rheumatoid Arthritis – Subcutaneous Administration

The efficacy and safety of subcutaneously administered tocilizumab was assessed in two double-blind, controlled, multicenter studies in patients with active RA. One study, SC-I (NCT01194414), was a non-inferiority study that compared the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab 162 mg administered every week subcutaneously to 8 mg per kg intravenously every four weeks. The second study, SC-II (NCT01232569), was a placebo controlled superiority study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab 162 mg administered every other week subcutaneously to placebo. Both SC-I and SC-II required patients to be > 18 years of age with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to ACR criteria who had at least 4 tender and 4 swollen joints at baseline (SC-I) or at least 8 tender and 6 swollen joints at baseline (SC-II), and an inadequate response to their existing DMARD therapy, where approximately 20% also had a history of inadequate response to at least one TNF inhibitor. All patients in both SC studies received background non-biologic DMARD(s).

In SC-I, 1262 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive tocilizumab-SC 162 mg every week or intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg every four weeks in combination with DMARD(s). In SC-II, 656 patients were randomized 2:1 to tocilizumab-SC 162 mg every other week or placebo, in combination with DMARD(s). The primary endpoint in both studies was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at Week 24.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for management of adults with dyslipidemia-2025 update [^111ErDy2]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Adults with autoimmune disorders — atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and statin outcomes: Chronic inflammatory or autoimmune disease should be considered as a risk-enhancing factor for ASCVD, and individuals with psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and inflammatory myopathies require careful ASCVD risk assessment because of increased risks linked to chronic inflammation. Individuals with psoriasis and RA, irrespective of disease severity, may be considered at increased ASCVD risk. In RA, studies show that statins significantly lower all-cause mortality and reduce the progression of atherosclerosis. Large prospective trials with statin therapy in SLE are lacking; smaller studies did not show benefit in terms of progression of subclinical measures of atherosclerosis. Post hoc analyses of major lipid trials show a similar decrease in event rates in individuals with and without psoriasis when statin was used for secondary prevention.

Study II (NCT00106535) was a 104-week study with an optional 156-week extension phase that evaluated patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Patients received ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg, ACTEMRA 4 mg per kg, or placebo every four weeks, in combination with MTX (10 to 25 mg weekly). Upon completion of 52-weeks, patients received open-label treatment with ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg through 104 weeks or they had the option to continue their double-blind treatment if they maintained a greater than 70% improvement in swollen/tender joint count. Two pre-specified interim analyses at week 24 and week 52 were conducted. The primary endpoint at week 24 was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response. At weeks 52 and 104, the primary endpoints were change from baseline in modified total Sharp-Genant score and the area under the curve (AUC) of the change from baseline in HAQ-DI score.

Study III (NCT00106548) evaluated patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Patients received ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg, ACTEMRA 4 mg per kg, or placebo every four weeks, in combination with MTX (10 to 25 mg weekly). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24.

Study IV (NCT00106574) evaluated patients who had an inadequate response to their existing therapy, including one or more DMARDs. Patients received ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg or placebo every four weeks, in combination with the stable DMARDs. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24.

Study V (NCT00106522) evaluated patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant to one or more TNF antagonist therapies. The TNF antagonist therapy was discontinued prior to randomization. Patients received ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg, ACTEMRA 4 mg per kg, or placebo every four weeks, in combination with MTX (10 to 25 mg weekly). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24.

### "Treat-to-target": a call for earlier targeted intervention in asthma [^1167SzpV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

The treat-to-target approach is a concept that has been successfully implemented in many disease areas such as rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular disease and more recently is being discussed in asthma. Currently, asthma management is focused on severity of symptoms and disease control, with treatment approaches tailored to these symptoms versus the underlying disease activity. Although successful in many patients, there are limitations to this approach, because treatments targeting the underlying pathophysiology of disease may not be initiated until later in a patient's disease trajectory. This can leave patients with uncontrolled asthma despite high treatment doses, or initiating these treatments after long-term lung function decline has occurred. Implementing a treat-to-target approach in asthma that focuses on remission as a treatment goal advocates for a more personalized treatment approach in which the remission target offers patients and clinicians a clear benchmark for the best possible outcomes, and treatments that target the underlying pathophysiology of disease are initiated earlier in the disease course, to optimize long-term outcomes and prevent irreversible lung function decline.

### Advances in treatment of psoriatic arthritis: current guidelines and emerging therapies [^111FkNgM]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a multifaceted autoimmune condition that affects the peripheral and axial joints, entheses, skin, and nails. The management of PsA relies on prompt diagnosis and early initiation of effective treatment to minimize joint destruction. Treatment options for PsA are rapidly evolving and emerging. This review will discuss screening tools, early diagnosis/outcome measures, and treatment guidelines for PsA, including the most recent EULAR/GRAPPA/ACR recommendations. Advances in science and technology are also rapidly changing the landscape of medicine, and we have discussed how targeted therapies, smartphone monitoring, and artificial intelligence could benefit PsA monitoring and treatment. Finally, we discussed the concept of treating PsA as a multisystem disorder with a multidisciplinary team of specialists and implementation of a 'Total Care' program. Overall, this review highlights the evolving treatment frameworks in PsA, advocating for early detection, comprehensive assessment, and targeted therapy that can improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

### Leflunomide (Arava) [^117W4TNz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Trial Results

Clinical response

The ACR20 Responder at Endpoint rates are shown in Figure 1. ARAVA was statistically significantly superior to placebo in reducing the signs and symptoms of RA by the primary efficacy analysis, ACR20 Responder at Endpoint, in study Trial 1 (at the primary 12 months endpoint) and Trial 2 (at 6-month endpoint). ACR20 Responder at Endpoint rates with ARAVA treatment were consistent across the 6 and 12-month studies (41%–49%). No consistent differences were demonstrated between leflunomide and methotrexate or between leflunomide and sulfasalazine. ARAVA treatment effect was evident by 1 month, stabilized by 3 to 6 months, and continued throughout the course of treatment as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Percentage of ACR20 Responders at Endpoint in Patients with Active RA in Trials 1, 2, and 3

Figure 2: ACR20 Responders over Time in Patients with Active RA in Trial 1*

ACR50 and ACR70 Responders are defined in an analogous manner to the ACR 20 Responder, but use improvements of 50% or 70%, respectively (Table 3). Mean change for the individual components of the ACR Responder Index are shown in Table 4.

Table 4 shows the results of the components of the ACR response criteria for Trial 1, Trial 2, and Trial 3. ARAVA was significantly superior to placebo in all components of the ACR Response criteria in study Trial 1 and Trial 2. In addition, ARAVA was significantly superior to placebo in improving morning stiffness, a measure of RA disease activity, not included in the ACR Response criteria. No consistent differences were demonstrated between ARAVA and the active comparators.

Maintenance of effect

After completing 12 months of treatment, patients continuing on study treatment were evaluated for an additional 12 months of double-blind treatment (total treatment period of 2 years). ACR Responder rates at 12 months were maintained over 2 years in most patients continuing a second year of treatment.

Improvement from baseline in the individual components of the ACR responder criteria was also sustained in most patients during the second year of ARAVA treatment in all three trials.

Anemia

In placebo-controlled trials (RA-III, RA-IV, and RA-V) with background DMARDs, for up to 12/14 weeks, hemoglobin decreases below 8 g/dL in at least one measurement occurred in < 0.1% of patients in both the RINVOQ 15 mg and placebo groups. In RA-III and RA-V, hemoglobin decreases below 8 g/dL in at least one measurement were observed in 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, and none in patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg and upadacitinib 30 mg.

Adverse Reactions in Patients with Psoriatic Arthritis

A total of 1827 adult patients with psoriatic arthritis were treated with RINVOQ 15 mg or upadacitinib 30 mg tablets once daily in clinical trials, representing 1639.2 patient-years of exposure, of whom 722 were exposed to upadacitinib for at least one year. In the two Phase 3 trials, 907 patients received at least 1 dose of RINVOQ 15 mg, of whom 359 were exposed for at least one year.

Two placebo-controlled trials were integrated (640 patients on RINVOQ 15 mg once daily and 635 patients on placebo) to evaluate the safety of RINVOQ 15 mg in comparison to placebo for up to 24 weeks after treatment initiation.

5.2 Mortality

In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of an oral JAK inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared with TNF blockers.

Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OPZELURA.

5.3 Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders

Malignancies, including lymphomas, were observed in clinical trials of oral JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk.

Malignancies, including lymphomas, have occurred in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of an oral JAK inhibitor in RA patients, a higher rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. A higher rate of lymphomas was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. A higher rate of lung cancers was observed in current or past smokers treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. In this study, current or past smokers had an additional increased risk of overall malignancies.

Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OPZELURA, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancers), patients who develop a malignancy when on treatment, and patients who are current or past smokers.

Non-melanoma Skin Cancers

Non-melanoma skin cancers including basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma have occurred in patients treated with OPZELURA. Perform periodic skin examinations during OPZELURA treatment and following treatment as appropriate. Exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using broad-spectrum sunscreen.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Adults

Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis

The meloxicam Phase 2/3 clinical trial database includes 10,122 OA patients and 1012 RA patients treated with meloxicam 7.5 mg/day, 3505 OA patients and 1351 RA patients treated with meloxicam 15 mg/day. Meloxicam at these doses was administered to 661 patients for at least 6 months and to 312 patients for at least one year. Approximately 10,500 of these patients were treated in ten placebo- and/or active-controlled osteoarthritis trials and 2363 of these patients were treated in ten placebo- and/or active-controlled rheumatoid arthritis trials. Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events were the most frequently reported adverse events in all treatment groups across meloxicam trials.

A 12-week multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial was conducted in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip to compare the efficacy and safety of meloxicam with placebo and with an active control. Two 12-week multicenter, double-blind, randomized trials were conducted in patients with rheumatoid arthritis to compare the efficacy and safety of meloxicam with placebo.

5.3	Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders

Malignancies were observed in clinical trials of LEQSELVI [see Adverse Reactions 6.1)].

In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety trial of another JAK inhibitor in subjects with RA, a higher rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) was observed in subjects treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. A higher rate of lymphomas was observed in subjects treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. A higher rate of lung cancers was observed in current or past smokers treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. In this trial, current or past smokers had an additional increased risk of overall malignancies.

Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to and during treatment with LEQSELVI, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than successfully treated NMSC), patients who develop a malignancy, and patients who are current or past smokers.

Non-melanoma skin cancers

Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) have been reported in patients treated with LEQSELVI. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

5.4	Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE)

In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety trial of another JAK inhibitor in subjects with RA 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and non-fatal stroke was observed with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk.

Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to and during treatment with LEQSELVI, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur. Discontinue LEQSELVI in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke.

### Tocilizumab (Tofidence) [^116Bqqq5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Part II, patients (ITT, n = 163) were randomized to tocilizumab (same dose received in Part I) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio that was stratified by concurrent methotrexate use and concurrent corticosteroid use. Each patient continued in Part II of the study until Week 40 or until the patient satisfied JIA ACR 30 flare criteria (relative to Week 16) and qualified for escape.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a JIA ACR 30 flare at week 40 relative to week 16. JIA ACR 30 flare was defined as 3 or more of the 6 core outcome variables worsening by at least 30% with no more than 1 of the remaining variables improving by more than 30% relative to Week 16.

Tocilizumab treated patients experienced significantly fewer disease flares compared to placebo-treated patients (26% [21/82] versus 48% [39/81]; adjusted difference in proportions -21%, 95% CI: -35%, -8%).

During the withdrawal phase (Part II), more patients treated with tocilizumab showed JIA ACR 30/50/70 responses at Week 40 compared to patients withdrawn to placebo.

Cardiovascular Outcomes

Study WA25204 (NCT01331837) was a randomized, open-label (sponsor-blinded), 2-arm parallel-group, multicenter, non-inferiority, cardiovascular (CV) outcomes trial in patients with a diagnosis of moderate to severe RA. This CV safety study was designed to exclude a moderate increase in CV risk in patients treated with tocilizumab compared with a TNF inhibitor standard of care (etanercept).

The study included 3,080 seropositive RA patients with active disease and an inadequate response to non- biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, who were aged ≥ 50 years with at least one additional CV risk factor beyond RA. Patients were randomized 1:1 to IV tocilizumab 8 mg/kg Q4W or SC etanercept 50 mg QW and followed for an average of 3.2 years. The primary endpoint was the comparison of the time-to-first occurrence of any component of a composite of major adverse CV events (MACE; non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or CV death), with the final intent-to-treat analysis based on a total of 161 confirmed CV events (83/1538 [5.4%] for tocilizumab; 78/1542 [5.1%] for etanercept) reviewed by an independent and blinded adjudication committee.

Non-inferiority of tocilizumab to etanercept for cardiovascular risk was determined by excluding > 80% relative increase in the risk of MACE. The estimated hazard ratio (HR) for the risk of MACE comparing tocilizumab to etanercept was 1.05; 95% CI (0.77, 1.43).

### Adalimumab (Humira) [^112hw1Bs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The effectiveness of HUMIRA has not been established in patients who have lost response or were intolerant to TNF blockers.

The safety and effectiveness of HUMIRA have not been established in pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis less than 5 years of age.

Pediatric Uveitis

The safety and effectiveness of HUMIRA for the treatment of non-infectious, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Use of HUMIRA for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of HUMIRA in adults and a 2:1 randomized, controlled clinical study in 90 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.12)]. The safety and effectiveness of HUMIRA have not been established in pediatric patients with uveitis less than 2 years of age.

Hidradenitis Suppurativa

Use of HUMIRA in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of moderate to severe HS is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of HUMIRA in adult HS patients. Additional population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation predicted that weight-based dosing of HUMIRA in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older can provide generally similar exposure to adult HS patients. The course of HS is sufficiently similar in adult and adolescent patients to allow extrapolation of data from adult to adolescent patients. The recommended dosage in pediatric patients 12 years of age or older is based on body weight [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.10)].

The safety and effectiveness of HUMIRA have not been established in patients less than 12 years of age with HS.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In clinical studies of RA (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV), a total of 519 subjects 65 years of age and older, including 107 subjects 75 years of age and older, received HUMIRA. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between these subjects and younger adult subjects.

The frequency of serious infection and malignancy among HUMIRA treated subjects 65 years of age and older was higher than for those less than 65 years of age. Consider the benefits and risks of HUMIRA in patients 65 years of age and older. In patients treated with HUMIRA, closely monitor for the development of infection or malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

### Infliximab-axxq (Avsola) [^112cyCd2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1	Other Biological Products

The combination of AVSOLA with other biological products used to treat the same conditions as AVSOLA is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

An increased risk of serious infections was seen in clinical studies of other TNF blockers used in combination with anakinra or abatacept, with no added clinical benefit. Because of the nature of the adverse reactions seen with these combinations with TNF blocker therapy, similar toxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra or abatacept with other TNF blockers. Therefore, the combination of AVSOLA and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

The concomitant use of tocilizumab with biological DMARDs such as TNF antagonists, including AVSOLA, should be avoided because of the possibility of increased immunosuppression and increased risk of infection.

7.2	Methotrexate and Other Concomitant Medications

Specific drug interaction studies, including interactions with methotrexate (MTX), have not been conducted. The majority of patients in RA or CD clinical studies received one or more concomitant medications. In RA, concomitant medications besides MTX were non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), folic acid, corticosteroids and/or narcotics. Concomitant CD medications were antibiotics, antivirals, corticosteroids, 6-MP/AZA and aminosalicylates. In PsA clinical trials, concomitant medications included MTX in approximately half of the patients as well as NSAIDs, folic acid and corticosteroids. Concomitant MTX use may decrease the incidence of anti-drug antibody production and increase infliximab product concentrations.

7.3	Immunosuppressants

Patients with CD who received immunosuppressants tended to experience fewer infusion reactions compared to patients on no immunosuppressants [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Serum infliximab concentrations appeared to be unaffected by baseline use of medications for the treatment of CD including corticosteroids, antibiotics (metronidazole or ciprofloxacin) and aminosalicylates.

### Prevalence and characteristics of adults with difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis in a large patient registry [^117LvFLA]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

An estimated 5–20% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fail multiple treatments and are considered 'difficult-to-treat' (D2T), posing a substantial clinical challenge for rheumatologists. A European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) task force proposed a definition of D2T-RA in 2021. We applied EULAR's D2T definition in a cohort of patients with established RA to assess prevalence, and we compared clinical characteristics of participants with D2T-RA with matched comparisons.

Methods

Data from the longitudinal Brigham and Women's Hospital Rheumatoid Arthritis Sequential Study (BRASS) registry were used. Participants were classified as D2T if they met EULAR's definition. A comparison group of non-D2T-RA patients were matched 2:1 to every D2T patient, and differences in characteristics were evaluated in descriptive analyses. Prevalence rates of D2T were estimated using Poisson regression.

Results

We estimated the prevalence of D2T-RA to be 14.4 (95% CI: 12.8, 16.3) per 100 persons among 1581 participants with RA, and 22.3 (95% CI: 19.9, 25.0) per 100 persons among 1021 who were biologic/targeted synthetic DMARD experienced. We observed several differences in demographics, comorbidities and RA disease activity between D2T-RA and non-D2T-RA comparisons. Varying EULAR sub-criteria among all participants in BRASS resulted in a range of D2T-RA prevalence rates, from 0.6 to 17.5 per 100 persons.

Conclusion

EULAR's proposed definition of D2T-RA identifies patients with RA who have not achieved treatment targets. Future research should explore heterogeneity in these patients and evaluate outcomes to inform the design of future studies aimed at developing more effective RA management protocols.

### Tocilizumab (Tofidence) [^1138ta4h]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Considerations for Administration

Not Recommended for Concomitant Use with Biological DMARDs

Tocilizumab products have not been studied in combination with biological DMARDs such as TNF antagonists, IL-1R antagonists, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and selective co-stimulation modulators because of the possibility of increased immunosuppression and increased risk of infection. Avoid using TOFIDENCE with biological DMARDs.

Baseline Laboratory Evaluation Prior to Treatment

Obtain and assess baseline complete blood count (CBC) and liver function tests prior to treatment.

RA, GCA, PJIA and SJIA – It is recommended that TOFIDENCE not be initiated in patients with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 2000 per mm, platelet count below 100,000 per mm, or ALT or AST above 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].
COVID-19 - It is recommended that TOFIDENCE not be initiated in patients with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 1000 per mm, platelet count below 50,000 mm3, or ALT or AST above 10 times ULN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Rheumatoid Arthritis

TOFIDENCE may be used as monotherapy or concomitantly with methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs as an intravenous infusion.

Recommended Intravenous Dosage Regimen:

The recommended dosage of TOFIDENCE for adult patients given as a 60-minute single intravenous drip infusion is 4 mg per kg every 4 weeks followed by an increase to 8 mg per kg every 4 weeks based on clinical response.

Reduction of dose from 8 mg per kg to 4 mg per kg is recommended for management of certain dose-related laboratory changes including elevated liver enzymes, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
Doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not recommended in RA patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

When transitioning from intravenous therapy with TOFIDENCE to subcutaneous therapy with another tocilizumab product, administer the first subcutaneous dose instead of the next scheduled intravenous dose.

Interruption of dose is recommended for management of certain dose-related laboratory changes including elevated liver enzymes, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].

Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer

During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV, the rate (95% confidence interval) of NMSC was 0.8 (0.52, 1.09) per 100 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.2 (0.10, 0.59) per 100 patient-years among control-treated patients. Examine all patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of prior prolonged immunosuppressant therapy or psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment for the presence of NMSC prior to and during treatment with IDACIO.

Lymphoma and Leukemia

In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF-blockers in adults, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated patients compared to control-treated patients. In the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV, 2 lymphomas occurred among 7973 adalimumab-treated patients versus 1 among 4848 control-treated patients. In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV with a median duration of approximately 0.7 years, including 24,605 patients and over 40,215 patient- years of adalimumab, the observed rate of lymphomas was approximately 0.11 per 100 patient- years. This is approximately 3-fold higher than expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race).1Rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of adalimumab cannot be compared to rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of other TNF blockers and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population. Patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at a higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF blockers. Post-marketing cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with TNF-blocker use in RA and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with RA may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia.

### Adalimumab (Humira) [^112D5atV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (HUMIRA is not approved for intravenous use). Following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics.

Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week.

Absorption

The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. The mean time to reach the maximum concentration was 5.5 days (131 ± 56 hours) and the maximum serum concentration was 4.7 ± 1.6 mcg/mL in healthy subjects following a single 40 mg subcutaneous administration of HUMIRA.

Distribution

The distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 4.7 to 6.0 L following intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg in RA patients.

Elimination

The single dose pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in RA patients were determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. The systemic clearance of adalimumab is approximately 12 mL/hr. In long-term studies with dosing more than two years, there was no evidence of changes in clearance over time in RA patients.

### Clinical and out-of-pocket cost outcomes after switching to biosimilar adalimumab-atto in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^111m9UZh]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited real-world studies have evaluated outcomes after switching treatment from a reference product (RP) to a biosimilar product. The objective of this real-world study was to assess the outcomes of switching from RP adalimumab to biosimilar adalimumab-atto in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Research Design and Methods

This was a propensity score matched, non-inferiority study assessing adult patients with RA who switched from RP adalimumab to adalimumab-atto (Switchers) between or received RP adalimumab continuously (Non-Switchers). One-year disease worsening, serious adverse events, and patient out-of-pocket cost outcomes were evaluated. An upper limit of 5% for adalimumab-atto was set as the non-inferiority margin.

Results

After matching, there were 1,172 patients in each group. 24.8% and 31.0% of patients in the Switcher and Non-Switcher groups, respectively, experienced the disease worsening (non-inferiority p < 0.01). The crude rates per 100 patient-years of the safety outcome and mean monthly changes in out-of-pocket costs were 5.6 (95% CI 4.2–7.5) and 7.2 (95% CI 5.2–9.2) (p = 0.21) and -$51 (± $164) and -$11 (± $152) (p < 0.01) in the Switcher and Non-Switcher groups, respectively.

Conclusions

These results provide evidence that switching from RP adalimumab to biosimilar adalimumab-atto did not result in disease worsening or increased adverse events but did deliver modestly lower patient out-of-pocket costs.

### Adalimumab-adbm [^113GyEwZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Adalimumab products bind specifically to TNF-alpha and block its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab products also lyse surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab products do not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with Adalimumab-adbm may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab products exert their clinical effects is unknown.

Adalimumab products also modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC50of 1–2 × 10–10M).

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in concentrations of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP concentrations was also observed in patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (adalimumab products are not approved for intravenous use). Following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics.

Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week.

### Cyclosporine (cycloSPORINE, modfied) [^117NoVe8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Care should be taken in using cyclosporine with nephrotoxic drugs (see PRECAUTIONS).

Rheumatoid Arthritis

Cyclosporine nephropathy was detected in renal biopsies of 6 out of 60 (10%) rheumatoid arthritis patients after the average treatment duration of 19 months. Only one patient, out of these 6 patients, was treated with a dose ≤ 4 mg/kg/day. Serum creatinine improved in all but one patient after discontinuation of cyclosporine. The "maximal creatinine increase" appears to be a factor in predicting cyclosporine nephropathy.

There is a potential, as with other immunosuppressive agents, for an increase in the occurrence of malignant lymphomas with cyclosporine. It is not clear whether the risk with cyclosporine is greater than that in rheumatoid arthritis patients or in rheumatoid arthritis patients on cytotoxic treatment for this indication. Five cases of lymphoma were detected: four in a survey of approximately 2,300 patients treated with cyclosporine for rheumatoid arthritis, and another case of lymphoma was reported in a clinical trial. Although other tumors (12 skin cancers, 24 solid tumors of diverse types, and 1 multiple myeloma) were also reported in this survey, epidemiologic analyses did not support a relationship to cyclosporine other than for malignant lymphomas.

Patients should be thoroughly evaluated before and during cyclosporine capsules (modified) treatment for the development of malignancies. Moreover, use of cyclosporine capsules (modified) therapy with other immunosuppressive agents may induce an excessive immunosuppression which is known to increase the risk of malignancy.

### New horizons in systemic sclerosis treatment: advances and emerging therapies in 2025 [^113EgGQf]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Methodology and literature search

This manuscript was developed as a narrative review with the objective of providing a comprehensive and clinically relevant synthesis of current organ-based management strategies and emerging therapeutic approaches in SSc. To inform the review, a targeted literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and the proceedings of major international rheumatology congresses (EULAR, ACR) up to April 2025. Search terms included combinations of: "systemic sclerosis", "scleroderma", "interstitial lung disease", "pulmonary arterial hypertension", "Raynaud's phenomenon", "digital ulcers", "renal crisis", "gastrointestinal involvement", "skin fibrosis", "emerging therapies", "clinical trials" and "precision medicine".

Priority was given to phase II–III clinical trials, recent international guidelines (including the 2023 EULAR recommendations), and ongoing trials investigating novel therapeutic targets in SSc. Foundational or landmark studies published prior to this time frame were also included where they remain essential to guiding current clinical practice. Additional references were identified through citation chaining and based on the authors' expertise in SSc clinical care and research.

Emerging therapies and novel therapies in SSc

Current treatment approaches largely focus on managing individual organ manifestations — targeting inflammation, fibrosis and vascular dysfunction — rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. Despite advances in immunosuppressive and antifibrotic therapies, the absence of truly disease-modifying treatments capable of altering the disease trajectory highlights a critical gap in care. Table 1 represents emerging and novel therapies in SSc.

Table 1
Emerging therapies in SSc

Given the pivotal role of B cells in SSc, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T19) therapy — a groundbreaking treatment originally developed for haematological malignancies — has emerged as a potential game-changer for autoimmune diseases, including SSc. CAR-T19 therapy selectively targets and depletes CD19+B cells, offering a more profound and potentially long-lasting immunomodulatory effect compared with conventional B-cell depletion therapies like RTX.

### Golimumab (Simponi aria) [^111vSk2p]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Golimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to both the soluble and transmembrane bioactive forms of human TNFα. This interaction prevents the binding of TNFα to its receptors, thereby inhibiting the biological activity of TNFα (a cytokine protein). There was no evidence of the golimumab antibody binding to other TNF superfamily ligands; in particular, the golimumab antibody did not bind or neutralize human lymphotoxin. Golimumab did not lyse human monocytes expressing transmembrane TNF in the presence of complement or effector cells.

Elevated TNFα levels in the blood, synovium, and joints have been implicated in the pathophysiology of several chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. TNFα is an important mediator of the articular inflammation that is characteristic of these diseases. Golimumab modulated the in vitro biological effects mediated by TNF in several bioassays, including the expression of adhesion proteins responsible for leukocyte infiltration (E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and GM-CSF). The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Following treatment with SIMPONI ARIA in patients with RA, decreases from baseline were observed in tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), resistin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1b), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), serum amyloid A (SAA), S100A12, and high sensitivity C-Reactive protein (hsCRP). Conversely, increases from baseline were observed in tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP-5b). The clinical relevance of this information is not known.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Golimumab exhibited approximately dose-proportional pharmacokinetics in patients with RA over the dose range of 0.1 to 10.0 mg/kg following a single intravenous dose.

Absorption

Following a single intravenous administration of 2 mg/kg SIMPONI ARIA, a mean Cmaxof 44.4 ± 11.3 mcg/mL was observed in patients with RA. Data directly comparing 2 mg/kg intravenous administration and 50 mg subcutaneous administration are not available.

### Deuruxolitinib phosphate (Leqselvi) [^113UHUcE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of deuruxolitinib PO (also known as Leqselvi):

- **Increased risk of mortality**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as another JAK inhibitor used in rheumatoid arthritis has been associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in patients aged ≥ 50 years with at least one cardiovascular risk factor.
- **Major cardiovascular events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as another JAK inhibitor used in rheumatoid arthritis has been associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients aged ≥ 50 years with at least one cardiovascular risk factor. Weigh the risks against benefits in patients with cardiovascular risk factors, including current or past smoking status.
- **Malignancy**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as another JAK inhibitor used in rheumatoid arthritis has been associated with an increased risk of malignancy (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer). Non-melanoma skin cancers have also been reported in patients treated with deuruxolitinib. Obtain periodic skin examinations in patients at risk for skin cancer.
- **Serious infections**: avoid using deuruxolitinib in patients with active serious infections, including localized infections, active hepatitis B or C, or tuberculosis. Evaluate for tuberculosis and viral hepatitis, and treat latent tuberculosis before initiating treatment. Monitor all patients for active tuberculosis during treatment. Weigh the risks against benefits of deuruxolitinib treatment in patients with chronic or recurrent infections, a history of serious or opportunistic infections, underlying conditions increasing the risk of infections, and patients exposed to tuberculosis or residing in or recently traveled to areas of endemic tuberculosis or mycoses. Complete all necessary immunizations, including herpes zoster, according to the current immunization schedule. Avoid using live vaccines during or immediately before treatment.
- **Thrombosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as deuruxolitinib has been associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, including DVT, PE, and arterial thrombosis. Avoid using deuruxolitinib in patients at increased risk for thrombosis.

### Rituximab (Rituxan) [^117NPXEE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid Arthritis

In RA patients, treatment with RITUXAN induced depletion of peripheral B lymphocytes, with the majority of patients demonstrating near complete depletion (CD19 counts below the lower limit of quantification, 20 cells/µl) within 2 weeks after receiving the first dose of RITUXAN. The majority of patients showed peripheral B-cell depletion for at least 6 months. A small proportion of patients (~4%) had prolonged peripheral B-cell depletion lasting more than 3 years after a single course of treatment.

Total serum immunoglobulin levels, IgM, IgG, and IgA were reduced at 6 months with the greatest change observed in IgM. At Week 24 of the first course of RITUXAN treatment, small proportions of patients experienced decreases in IgM (10%), IgG (2.8%), and IgA (0.8%) levels below the lower limit of normal (LLN). In the experience with RITUXAN in RA patients during repeated RITUXAN treatment, 23.3%, 5.5%, and 0.5% of patients experienced decreases in IgM, IgG, and IgA concentrations below LLN at any time after receiving RITUXAN, respectively. The clinical consequences of decreases in immunoglobulin levels in RA patients treated with RITUXAN are unclear.

Treatment with rituximab in patients with RA was associated with reduction of certain biologic markers of inflammation such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid protein (SAA), S100 A8/S100 A9 heterodimer complex (S100 A8/9), anti-citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), and RF.

Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (adalimumab products are not approved for intravenous use). Following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics.

Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week.

Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer

During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate (95% confidence interval) of NMSC was 0.8 (0.52, 1.09) per 100 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.2 (0.10, 0.59) per 100 patient-years among control-treated patients. Examine all patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of prior prolonged immunosuppressant therapy or psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment for the presence of NMSC prior to and during treatment with HULIO.

Lymphoma and Leukemia

In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF-blockers in adults, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated patients compared to control-treated patients. In the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, 2 lymphomas occurred among 7973 adalimumab-treated patients versus 1 among 4848 control-treated patients. In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV with a median duration of approximately 0.7 years, including 24,605 patients and over 40,215 patient-years of adalimumab, the observed rate of lymphomas was approximately 0.11 per 100 patient-years. This is approximately 3-fold higher than expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race).1Rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of adalimumab cannot be compared to rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of other TNF blockers and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population. Patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at a higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF blockers. Post-marketing cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with TNF-blocker use in RA and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with RA may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia.

### Sarilumab (Kevzara) [^117DJam7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1 Use with Other Drugs

Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of methotrexate (MTX) on sarilumab clearance. KEVZARA has not been investigated in combination with JAK inhibitors or biological DMARDs such as TNF antagonists [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

7.2 Interactions with CYP450 Substrates

Various in vitro and limited in vivo human studies have shown that cytokines and cytokine modulators can influence the expression and activity of specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and therefore have the potential to alter the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered drugs that are substrates of these enzymes. Elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration may down-regulate CYP activity such as in patients with RA and hence increase drug levels compared to subjects without RA. Blockade of IL-6 signaling by IL-6Rα antagonists such as KEVZARA might reverse the inhibitory effect of IL-6 and restore CYP activity, leading to altered drug concentrations.

The modulation of IL-6 effect on CYP enzymes by KEVZARA may be clinically relevant for CYP substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted. Upon initiation or discontinuation of KEVZARA, in patients being treated with CYP substrate medicinal products, perform therapeutic monitoring of effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., theophylline) and adjust the individual dose of the medicinal product as needed.

Exercise caution when co-administering KEVZARA with CYP3A4 substrate drugs where decrease in effectiveness is undesirable, e.g., oral contraceptives, lovastatin, atorvastatin, etc. The effect of KEVZARA on CYP450 enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Live Vaccines

Avoid concurrent use of live vaccines during treatment with KEVZARA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### Novel clinical trial designs emerging from the molecular reclassification of cancer [^114Tp2Cn]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials have undergone considerable evolution in recent years, from traditional drug‐centered, tissue‐specific trials; to tissue‐specific, genomically driven trials; to tumor‐agnostic, biomarker‐based trials; and, most recently, to patient‐centered, N‐of‐1 combination therapy trials, in which each patient receives a unique therapy based on their tumor landscape. In the latter types of trials, the robustness of the algorithm defining the match between tumors and drugs and its impact on outcome are evaluated, rather than the impact of any one drug or combination of drugs on a specific cancer type defined by its organ of origin (or, more recently, by its underlying genomic aberration). Determining safe, personalized doses is also critical in the era of individualized, novel combination therapy.

In the current review, we explore clinical trial designs and technologies that are enabling the development of molecularly targeted therapies and the advancement in precision medicine, patient‐centered approaches (Table 1). We also delve into crucial issues, such as addressing disparities and underserved populations, and we provide a patient's unique and moving perspective on novel precision medicine clinical trial approaches.

### Golimumab (Simponi aria) [^116yGmic]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There is no information regarding the presence of SIMPONI ARIA in human milk, the effects on breastfed infants, or the effects on milk production. Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk. Golimumab is present in the milk of lactating cynomolgus monkeys (see Data). If golimumab is transferred into human milk, the effects of local exposure in the gastrointestinal tract and potential limited systemic exposure in the infant to golimumab are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for SIMPONI ARIA and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed infants from SIMPONI ARIA, or from the underlying maternal condition.

Data

In the pre- and postnatal development study in cynomolgus monkeys in which golimumab was administered subcutaneously during pregnancy and lactation, golimumab was detected in the breast milk at concentrations that were approximately 400 fold lower than the maternal serum concentrations.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of SIMPONI ARIA for active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and PsA have been established in pediatric patients 2 years and older.

Use of SIMPONI ARIA in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of SIMPONI ARIA in adults with RA and PsA, pharmacokinetic data from adult patients with RA and PsA and pediatric patients with JIA with active polyarthritis, and safety data from a clinical study in 127 pediatric patients 2 to < 18 years of age with JIA with active polyarthritis. The observed pre-dose (trough) concentrations are generally comparable between adults with RA and PsA and pediatric patients with JIA with active polyarthritis, and the PK exposure is expected to be comparable between adult PsA and pediatric patients with PsA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.4)].

Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with golimumab and other TNF-blocking agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established in pJIA or in PsA. The safety and effectiveness of SIMPONI ARIA in pediatric patients with conditions other than pJIA and PsA have not been established.

### Effectiveness of JAK inhibitors in biologics-naïve patients with RA: a population-based study [^115oRyp3]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

We evaluated drug retention rates to compare the effectiveness of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors vs. tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) biologics and non-TNFi biologics in biologics-naïve rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, and assessed intra-class differences among JAK inhibitors.

Methods

We conducted a cohort study using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, including RA patients initiating TNFi biologics, non-TNFi biologics, or JAK inhibitors. We follow patients from index date until outcome, death, or end of 2-year study period. To evaluate retention rate, we used treatment change defined as discontinuation or switching of medication. We calculated hazard ratios of treatment change to compare the effectiveness of JAK inhibitors vs. biologics, using JAK inhibitors as reference group.

Results

Of 16,212 patients, 2,654 (16.37%) received JAK inhibitors, 10,080 (62.18%) received TNFi biologics, and 3,478 (21.45%) received non-TNFi biologics. We found TNFi biologics were associated with a higher risk of treatment change than JAK inhibitors (hazard ratio = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.25–1.53). We found no significant difference between JAK inhibitors and non-TNFi biologics. The risk of treatment change among JAK inhibitors (e.g., tofacitinib, baricitinib) was similar.

Conclusion

Our findings reflected drug effectiveness by the duration that patients maintained the regimen, considering both therapeutic effects and adverse events. We found JAK inhibitors had better effectiveness than TNFi biologics, with no significant difference compared to non-TNFi biologics in biologics-naïve patients. Intra-class comparison of JAK inhibitors indicated similar effectiveness for both tofacitinib and baricitinib. These findings supported the use of JAK inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis patients after failure of conventional DMARDs treatment.

### Ageism in rheumatology: the health care professional's perspective [^111uFVur]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The responses to our free response and multiple response questions highlighted multiple key geriatric principles, which is perhaps unsurprising, as ERA‐12 scores on average were quite high in our sample. Several of the 5Ms were identified as being particularly challenging aspects of caring for older adults with rheumatic diseases, including multicomplexity, polypharmacy, and cognitive impairment. The most commonly reported prescribing change when caring for older adults was reduced prescribing of NSAIDs and opioids, which is perhaps appropriate because these medications are listed as potentially inappropriate medications in the Beers criteria.

The need for an interdisciplinary team (geriatrics or collaborative care, physical or occupational therapy) was the most important provider identified element to improve the care of older adults. This aligns well with the ACR 2022 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the integrative management of RA, which stress the key role of physical and occupational therapy in caring for this patient group. Respondents highlighted the need for more time and frequent visits to improve care for older adults. Recent regulatory changes around outpatient billing allowing for the use of time‐ and complexity‐based billing may help to improve the care of medically complex older adults. Further changes to policy and reimbursement rates, along with innovative models of health care delivery, may be necessary to further improve access, equity, and interdisciplinary management of older adults with rheumatic disease.

### ​ did a non-medical biosimilar switching policy cause an increase in non-biologic / biosimilar health care resource utilization or cost in patients with inflammatory arthritis? [^116EPNTk]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a series of policies that mandated switching patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) from an originator biologic to a biosimilar in British Columbia, Canada, on health care resource use and cost.

Methods

The health data of patients with IA were obtained from five linked administrative databases held by Population Data BC from January 2013 to December 2022. Our analysis focused on trends in monthly average use and costs of four care resources: physician services, hospital services, emergency department visits, and concomitant drug use. Using interrupted time series analysis, we evaluated the impact of switching policies targeting (1) infliximab or etanercept and (2) adalimumab on total health care costs, excluding biologic and biosimilar costs.

Results

We included 3,150 patients in the study. Hospital and physician services accounted for the majority of the total care cost for patients with IA. We found no evidence of any increases in physician services, hospital services, emergency department visits, or concomitant drug use after either nonmedical switch policy. We also found no significant change in level and trend in total health care costs for both policies: infliximab or etanercept (level -$40, 95% confidence interval [CI] -$99 to $19; trend $5.42, 95% CI -$0.62 to $11.46) and adalimumab (level -$34, 95% CI -$139 to $70; trend -$8.97, -$17.94 to $0.00).

Conclusion

Nonmedical biosimilar switching policies did not lead to increases in other health care service use and costs.

### Impact of incident rheumatoid arthritis on earnings: a nationwide sibling comparison study [^116avAjG]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study, patients with RA experienced a decrease in taxable earnings of 5.4% after diagnosis, which was sustained for at least 5 years. This drop was driven by patients diagnosed between 2006 and 2010, while patients diagnosed between 2011 and 2017 did not display a difference in average earnings compared with their same-sexed siblings.

Previous studies have found that RA can negatively affect income and productivity. Studies from the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s typically lack appropriate comparators, are small and use self-reported outcome data. Our study is the first of its kind using large-scale register data comparing patients with same-sex siblings. It is also the first study to show a calendar period effect with lower earnings after diagnosis in the beginning of the biologic era and no difference among patients diagnosed between 2011 and 2017.

There were subgroup variations when assessing the association between RA and subsequent earnings. Older individuals and those with lower education levels experienced significantly lower earnings after their RA diagnosis relative to same-sex siblings, whereas younger individuals and those with higher education did not (or at least not to the same degree).

Furthermore, patients diagnosed between 2006 and 2010 experienced a statistically significant decline in earnings compared with their siblings. In contrast, patients diagnosed between 2011 and 2017 did not differ in post-diagnosis earnings compared with same-sex siblings, and the point estimate was near null, though negative. Our interpretation is that, despite the introduction of biologic therapies in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the positive treatment effect on earnings may not have been fully affected until about a decade later, at least not in Swedish patients. A contributing factor may be that the median disease duration at biologic treatment initiation fell for patients with RA during the first 10 years after the introduction of biologics. External factors such as the business cycle and institutional changes over time may also have played a role, but affect both patients and sibling controls simultaneously.

### Efficacy and safety of biosimilars in gastroenterology: a focus on inflammatory bowel disease management [^11325GPp]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The introduction of biosimilars changed the management of biologicals in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) since the approval of CT-P13, the first biosimilar to infliximab, by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in September 2013 and by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2016. Accumulating evidence in IBD suggests that biosimilar products have equivalent efficacy and safety to reference products and their use was associated with improved access and decrease in medication costs.

Areas Covered

This review discusses the current evidence on approved biosimilars of infliximab, adalimumab and ustekinumab in IBD. Authors review data on drug sustainability, efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, non-medical switch data and interchangeability of biosimilar agents.

Expert Opinion

The biosimilar concept seems to be successful and has led to increased use of biological/biosimilar agents in the treatment of IBD. Clinical trials with biosimilars in IBD and evidence from real world studies on infliximab and adalimumab biosimilars confirm that safety, efficacy and immunogenicity is comparable to the originator, and that switching from the originator or among biosimilars is safe. While payers are supporting mandatory biosimilar use, on the long run the price race can lead to obstacles and unaffordability of the development of new originator biological agents.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^116r5Drg]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Palonosetron — 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (RA) for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) — has a recommended dose of 0.075 mg administered over 10 seconds and an elimination half-life of 40 hours. Using a weight-based dosing strategy, 1mcg/kg palonosetron was more effective than ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg, and it has been suggested that the standardized dose of palonosetron 0.075 mg may lead to pharmacological underdosing in obese patients, with weight-based dosing adjustment more efficacious without an increase in side effects. Palonosetron 0.075 mg was found to be more effective than ondansetron 4 mg in both abdominal and renal transplant surgery patients, and patients who received subsequent redosing of ondansetron 8 mg had comparable PONV risk as those who received a single dose palonosetron, although more headaches were noted in the ondansetron arm (26% vs 8%). Overall, palonosetron appears to be more effective when compared to ondansetron 4 mg or 8 mg; however, when added doses of ondansetron are given, no differences were found between the two drugs (A3).
