## Question

chronic hip pain initial tx

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a stepwise approach to the initial treatment of chronic hip pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the differential diagnosis and clinical framework. Then, I should verify the initial assessment strategy including history, physical examination, and imaging. Next, I will consider core non-pharmacologic management, followed by first-line and second-line pharmacologic options. After that, I need to outline follow-up and reassessment timelines, and finally address escalation pathways, key contraindications, and a concise summary algorithm, ensuring alignment with major guidelines throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework and differential for chronic hip pain, because jumping straight to osteoarthritis can miss important mimics. The most common etiologies include hip osteoarthritis, femoroacetabular impingement syndrome and related intra-articular pathology, greater trochanteric pain syndrome, and referred pain from the lumbar spine or deep gluteal space, so I need to ensure localization by history and exam while keeping hip–spine overlap in mind [^113bw672] [^116RK2K8] [^1124MX3s].

> Wait, let me verify how to structure the initial assessment. Clinically, anterior or groin pain suggests intra-articular sources, lateral pain suggests greater trochanteric pain syndrome, and posterior pain suggests spine or deep gluteal sources, but I should also screen for red flags such as trauma with suspected fracture, fever, or malignancy signs that necessitate urgent imaging or referral before routine pathways are pursued [^113bw672] [^116pSqtB] [^115B8ZpS].

> I need to check the imaging sequence, because ordering advanced studies too early can create noise. First-line imaging for chronic hip pain after a targeted history and exam is weight-bearing anteroposterior radiographs of the pelvis/hips to evaluate joint space and bony morphology, and if radiographs are non-diagnostic but suspicion remains for intra-articular pathology such as labral tear or femoroacetabular impingement, then hip MRI or MR arthrography is appropriate next, ideally directed by the clinical question [^11669yDf] [^11369rqR] [^115P9F21] [^114U99L1].

> Next, I should review core non-pharmacologic treatments, since these are the foundation regardless of etiology. Exercise therapy with adequate dose and progression tailored to function and preference is recommended for all patients with hip osteoarthritis, supported by EULAR and AAOS guidance and by broader evidence from physiotherapist-led paradigms, even though single randomized trials have shown mixed results at short-term time points, which means I should set expectations and persist with a minimum 3-month program and home continuation [^111ujAhM] [^116by26H] [^116ATt5N] [^116AgUck] [^1135ALUp].

> Hold on, I should verify education and self-management components, because these influence adherence and outcomes. Individualized education on activity modification, joint protection, pacing, and weight management where relevant should be embedded early, consistent with EULAR's recommendation for multicomponent individualized care and health system emphasis on early, equitable access to first-line OA management strategies [^115JScrv] [^112sdg1e].

> I will now examine the role of assistive devices and environmental adaptations. Considering a cane or walking aid used contralaterally, appropriate footwear, and home or workplace adaptations can reduce pain and improve participation, and I should reassess their fit and instruction to ensure the patient actually benefits from them in daily tasks [^117Q6XKk].

> Let me consider complementary modalities, but I should be cautious not to overstate their effect size. Thermal interventions like heat or cold and acupuncture can be considered as adjuncts to facilitate participation in exercise and daily function, with the understanding that they are supportive rather than disease-modifying [^116TgwMj].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacologic therapy, and I need to ensure I am balancing efficacy with individual risk. Oral NSAIDs are recommended to reduce pain and improve function in symptomatic hip osteoarthritis unless contraindicated, with network meta-analyses indicating clinically relevant benefits at standard doses such as diclofenac 150 mg/day and celecoxib 200 mg/day, so I should use the lowest effective dose with gastroprotection and cardiovascular and renal risk assessment upfront [^116Udmoj] [^115utnQH] [^112QN9TR] [^114iassN].

> But wait, what if NSAIDs are contraindicated or not tolerated. In that case, acetaminophen is a reasonable alternative or adjunct for some patients, with guideline support for cautious use and dose adjustment in hepatic disease, malnutrition, or alcohol use disorder, and with the expectation of more modest analgesic effects than NSAIDs [^1132EYkT] [^113e72Hr].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought topical NSAIDs would be uniformly first-line for hip OA as they are for other superficial joints, but I should double-check penetration to the deep hip joint. Topical NSAIDs have favorable safety and are recommended for localized musculoskeletal pain, and network analyses show topical diclofenac benefits, yet for deep intra-articular hip OA their effect may be limited and they are more plausible for peri-trochanteric soft-tissue pain, so I should align expectations and consider them adjunctively rather than as sole therapy for deep joint pain [^112vYzRo] [^112QN9TR].

> Let me reconsider second-line options when first-line strategies are insufficient. Duloxetine at 60 mg/day can be considered after an adequate NSAID and non-pharmacologic trial, acknowledging mixed efficacy signals, including real-world data in primary care that showed no added value over usual care, so I should identify centrally mediated pain features and comorbid mood symptoms, counsel on benefits and adverse effects, and reassess early [^113Wbjyx] [^113NShKJ].

> I should confirm the role of intra-articular corticosteroid injection for persistent hip OA pain. Ultrasound- or fluoroscopy-guided intra-articular corticosteroids may provide short-term pain relief that can enable more effective participation in therapeutic exercise, and I need to ensure appropriate selection, sterile technique, and limitation of injection frequency [^115utnQH].

> Next, I should review follow-up cadence and outcome tracking to avoid therapeutic inertia. A practical approach is to reassess pain and function at about 6 weeks and again at 12 weeks using validated measures such as VAS for pain and WOMAC for function, integrating established response criteria to judge clinically meaningful change and to guide step-up or continuation decisions [^117GXGxX].

> Hold on, I should verify the re-evaluation pathway for refractory symptoms. If improvement is inadequate, I need to reconsider the diagnosis, including repeating or advancing imaging to MRI when structural intra-articular pathology is suspected, and using image-guided diagnostic injections to localize the pain generator, while also reassessing for hip–spine syndrome and considering referral to a non-operative musculoskeletal specialist for comprehensive evaluation [^115P9F21] [^11369rqR] [^1124MX3s] [^113Kh1PP].

> I will now examine indications for surgical consultation. Persistent, disabling pain with functional limitation despite 3 to 6 months of optimized conservative therapy warrants discussion of operative options such as total hip arthroplasty for advanced OA, but I need to ensure prehabilitation and optimization have been addressed because deficits at baseline are associated with worse patient-reported outcomes after surgery [^111FMCz6].

> Wait, let me verify key safety and stewardship points. Opioids should be avoided prior to completion of conservative management given minimal incremental functional benefit and substantially higher adverse event risks compared with NSAIDs, and if ever used, they should be short term with clear exit strategies in exceptional circumstances only [^113Kh1PP] [^113NGBBg].

> I need to ensure special populations and comorbidities are factored in. In older adults or those with cardiovascular, renal, or gastrointestinal comorbidities, I should prioritize non-pharmacologic therapy, use NSAIDs with extreme caution, and vigilantly screen for concomitant lumbar spine pathology, which commonly coexists and can mislead the clinical picture if not identified early [^115rVAJa] [^1124MX3s].

> Finally, let me synthesize a concise initial algorithm and double-check alignment with major guidelines. Start with education and a structured, adequately dosed exercise program, add oral NSAIDs if no contraindications, consider acetaminophen as adjunct or alternative, reassess at 6 to 12 weeks using standardized outcomes, and if inadequate response, consider duloxetine or image-guided intra-articular corticosteroid injection, with diagnostic re-evaluation and specialist referral for refractory cases, all consistent with AAOS, EULAR, ACR/AAFP, and ACR Appropriateness imaging criteria [^116Udmoj] [^111ujAhM] [^113e72Hr] [^1148WBpt] [^11669yDf].

Initial management of chronic hip pain should start with a **focused history and exam** to localize pain and identify red flags [^116pSqtB], followed by **standing AP pelvis and lateral hip X-rays** as first-line imaging [^11669yDf] [^11369rqR]. Begin with **NSAIDs as first-line** pharmacologic therapy unless contraindicated [^116Udmoj], and consider acetaminophen [^1132EYkT] or topical NSAIDs [^112QN9TR] for milder pain or higher risk patients [^113e72Hr] [^1148WBpt]. Implement a **structured exercise program** (strength, aerobic, flexibility) [^111ujAhM] tailored to patient function and preferences [^1135ALUp], and add physical therapy [^116by26H] for persistent symptoms. Use walking aids [^117Q6XKk] and weight loss as needed [^111ujAhM], and reserve intra-articular corticosteroid injections for refractory cases [^115utnQH]. Reassess at 4–6 weeks and escalate care if no improvement.

## Clinical evaluation and diagnosis

### History and physical examination

A thorough **history and physical examination** are essential to identify the cause of chronic hip pain [^113bw672]. Key historical features include:

- **Pain location**: Anterior (intra-articular), lateral (greater trochanteric pain syndrome), posterior (referred from lumbar spine or sacroiliac joint) [^113bw672] [^116pSqtB].

- **Pain characteristics**: Onset, duration, aggravating and relieving factors, associated symptoms (e.g. stiffness, swelling, systemic symptoms) [^115JTzsG].

- **Functional impact**: Limitations in daily activities, gait disturbances, use of assistive devices [^112sdg1e].

The **physical examination** should include:

- **Gait analysis**: Antalgic gait, Trendelenburg sign [^1124MX3s].

- **Range of motion**: Limited internal rotation suggests hip osteoarthritis (OA) [^1144eJSj] [^114W9aeM].

- **Special tests**: FABER, FADIR, Ober's test, straight leg raise to differentiate hip from lumbar spine pathology [^1124MX3s] [^113bw672].

---

### Imaging studies

Imaging is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment [^11669yDf], starting with **standing anteroposterior (AP) pelvis and lateral hip X-rays** [^116pSqtB]. If radiographs are nondiagnostic but suspicion remains for labral tears, femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), or soft tissue pathology, obtain MRI or MR arthrography [^115P9F21] [^114U99L1].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions are foundational for managing **chronic hip pain**:

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Exercise therapy (strength, aerobic, flexibility) | Strongly recommended for all patients with hip OA [^111ujAhM] [^1135ALUp] | High |
| Physical therapy | Recommended for mild-to-moderate symptoms [^116by26H] | High |
| Weight loss | Recommended for overweight/obese patients [^111ujAhM] [^115JScrv] | High |
| Walking aids (canes, crutches) | Recommended to reduce pain and improve function [^117Q6XKk] | High |
| Patient education and self-management | Recommended to improve adherence and outcomes [^111ujAhM] [^112sdg1e] | High |

---

## Pharmacological management

Pharmacological therapy should be **individualized** based on patient characteristics and comorbidities:

- **NSAIDs**: First-line therapy for hip OA unless contraindicated (e.g. gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal risks) [^112zJNkq] [^116Udmoj] [^1148WBpt].

- **Acetaminophen**: Alternative for patients with contraindications to NSAIDs or mild pain [^1132EYkT] [^113e72Hr].

- **Topical NSAIDs**: Consider for localized pain with lower systemic risk [^112QN9TR].

- **Duloxetine**: Consider after NSAID trial, particularly with central sensitization features [^113Wbjyx].

- **Intra-articular corticosteroid injections**: For refractory pain despite conservative measures [^115utnQH].

---

## Patient education and self-management

Patient education and self-management are **critical** for adherence and optimal outcomes, providing information about the diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis [^115JScrv]. Strategies include home exercise programs, weight management, and pain coping techniques, with shared decision-making to align treatment with patient preferences and goals [^112sdg1e].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is **essential** to assess treatment effectiveness and adjust the management plan; reassess at 4–6 weeks to evaluate pain, function, and adherence. If the response is inadequate, escalate therapy by adding pharmacologic agents, considering injections, or referring to specialists, and continue long-term monitoring for disease progression and complications [^116Udmoj].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Referral to **orthopedic or rheumatology specialists** is indicated when [^113bw672]:

- **Persistent pain**: Despite conservative management [^116by26H].

- **Suspected complex pathology**: Labral tears, FAI, advanced OA [^114U99L1].

- **Consideration of surgical interventions**: Arthroscopy, total hip arthroplasty [^116Udmoj].

---

Initial management of chronic hip pain involves a **comprehensive approach**, including clinical evaluation, imaging, non-pharmacological interventions, pharmacological therapy, patient education, and regular follow-up. This approach aims to reduce pain, improve function, and enhance quality of life [^115JScrv] [^116Udmoj].

### Effectiveness and safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid treatment for knee and hip osteoarthritis: Network meta-analysis [^114iassN]. BMJ (2021). High credibility.

This was a large network meta-analysis on pharmacological treatments for knee and hip osteoarthritis. Even after restricting our inclusion criteria to large trials only, our sensitive search strategy and careful search of the grey literature resulted in a 2.5-fold to fivefold increase in the number of trials and patients included compared with previous reviews specific to NSAIDs, opioids, or paracetamol [web-appendix 3]. The large number of trials and patients included allowed us to generate granular evidence of effectiveness and safety with enough statistical precision for several different types of interventions and doses. By excluding trials with small sample sizes, we minimized the risk of biases caused by small study effects. Web-appendix 12 shows that trials included in our analyses generally had a lower risk of bias, which is reassuring. Additionally, conclusions based on our analyses adjusted by risk of biases were in line with the unadjusted analysis.

The robustness and accuracy of our results are further supported by the low between-trial heterogeneity, no indication of inconsistency in the network, good model fit, and similar treatment effects for pain and function. The length of follow-up in about half of the included trials was three months or less, which we believe is an accurate representation of clinical practice, and is in line with clinical practice guidelines. Treatment effect estimates were consistent for one, six, and 12 weeks of follow-up, which is further evidence of the robustness of our findings.

### Effect of physical therapy on pain and function in patients with hip osteoarthritis: a randomized clinical trial [^116AgUck]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

There is limited evidence supporting the use of physical therapy for hip osteoarthritis. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of physical therapy on pain and physical function in patients with hip osteoarthritis.

The study design was a randomized, placebo-controlled, participant- and assessor-blinded trial involving 102 community volunteers with hip pain levels of 40 or higher on a visual analog scale of 100 mm (range, 0–100 mm; 100 indicates worst pain possible) and hip osteoarthritis confirmed by radiograph. Forty-nine patients in the active group and 53 in the sham group underwent 12 weeks of intervention and 24 weeks of follow-up from May 2010 to February 2013.

- **Interventions**: Participants attended 10 treatment sessions over 12 weeks. Active treatment included education and advice, manual therapy, home exercise, and gait aid if appropriate. Sham treatment included inactive ultrasound and inert gel. For 24 weeks after treatment, the active group continued unsupervised home exercise, while the sham group self-applied gel three times weekly.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcomes were average pain (0 mm, no pain; 100 mm, worst pain possible) and physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, 0 no difficulty to 68 extreme difficulty) at week 13. Secondary outcomes were these measures at week 36, as well as impairments, physical performance, global change, psychological status, and quality of life at weeks 13 and 36.

- **Results**: Ninety-six patients (94%) completed week 13 measurements, and 83 (81%) completed week 36 measurements.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: Lateral hip and thigh pain [^113Kh1PP]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The evaluation of lateral hip and thigh pain in an older adult can be challenging. Potential etiologies include local and referred causes, and clinicians must consider a myriad of lumbopelvic and hip conditions such as GTPS, ITBS, hip OA, lumbar radicular pain, and LSS. Identifying a patient's true pain generator(s) enables initiation of proper treatment and avoidance of unnecessary treatments and their potential adverse effects. Therefore, if a patient is not responding adequately to the conservative measures described in the algorithm, we recommend considering referral to a non-operative musculoskeletal specialist who has expertise in evaluating the entire lumbopelvic region. We do not recommend prescribing opioids before the patient has completed a trial of conservative management and has been evaluated by a specialist, as these medications often place the patient at risk of adverse drug reactions. These side effects may be avoided if the underlying etiology of the pain is addressed.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: Lateral hip and thigh pain [^1116VEYT]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

- **Approach to evaluation and management**: Optimal management of patients presenting with lateral hip and/or thigh pain requires a systematic approach for accurate diagnosis of underlying pathology contributing to symptoms. This section describes evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the most common causes of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults.

- **Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS)**: GTPS is defined as pain and tenderness to palpation over the greater trochanter (GT). Until the early 2000s, this entity was most frequently called "greater trochanteric bursitis"; however, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that approximately 20% of people with tenderness over the GT have imaging-proven bursitis. Non-inflammatory pathology is often seen on imaging, such as gluteal tendonosis, gluteal tendon tears, and/or enthesopathy at the GT. GTPS is often caused by relative weakness of the hip abductor muscles, especially the gluteus medius, which leads to excessive gluteal tendon shearing over the GT and eventual tendonopathy.

GTPS often coexists with other musculoskeletal lumbopelvic and hip conditions. Additionally, it is often a secondary pain generator resulting from suboptimal biomechanics. In fact, in people with low back pain, GTPS has a prevalence of up to 45% and it commonly occurs in people with knee OA as well. GTPS is more common in women, possibly because they have a wider pelvis structure. It may be associated with nighttime pain when lying on the affected side, pain with prolonged standing, and pain or paresthesias.

### Strategies to improve equitable access to early osteoarthritis diagnosis and management: An updated review [^112sdg1e]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) affects more than 300 million people worldwide, causing chronic joint pain and stiffness in areas such as the hands, lower back, neck, knees, hips, and feet, often impeding activities of daily living. OA is a debilitating disease that can lead to depression, diabetes, heart disease, and poor quality of life. Early diagnosis and management are key to preventing decline and optimizing patient health and quality of life. Though OA guidelines differ in treatment recommendations and what is considered early versus later intervention, first-line therapy for OA may include education, self-management (e.g. physical activity and weight loss), pain management, and physiotherapy. After a trial of first-line therapies, second-line therapy may include injections and joint replacement.

Intersectional factors, including social determinants, are associated with having chronic diseases and receiving recommended management. This is also true of OA. In a systematic review, fewer than half of 16,103 patients with OA received early diagnosis or management. Another review found that, of patients undergoing joint replacement, only 36% had been prescribed or advised of first-line therapy. Considerable accumulated research shows that age, race, gender, and rurality contribute to inequitable OA care. Women are far more likely than men to develop hand, knee, and hip OA; experience greater OA severity, pain, and disability; and suffer from a greater number and prevalence of OA-related comorbidities such as depression or hypertension. Furthermore, women are less likely…

### Effectiveness and safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid treatment for knee and hip osteoarthritis: Network meta-analysis [^116dDDGE]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

Our prespecified primary outcome was pain. If a trial presented pain outcomes on more than one scale, the following hierarchical list was used to extract data from the scale highest on the list: (1) global osteoarthritis pain assessed using visual analogue or numerical rating scales; (2) pain on walking; (3) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscore; (4) composite pain scores other than WOMAC; (5) pain on activities other than walking, such as stair climbing; (6) WOMAC global score; (7) Lequesne osteoarthritis index score; (8) other algofunctional composite scores; (9) patient's global assessment; (10) physician's global assessment. Data were extracted for several time points when available: 1 week (± 2 days), 2 weeks (± 2 days), 4 weeks (3–4.5 weeks), 6 weeks (± 1 week), 12 weeks (± 4 weeks), 24 weeks (± 4 weeks), 48 weeks (± 4 weeks), and at the end of treatment if not covered by the specific time points. The extraction of several time points allowed us to conduct advanced modelling to achieve more statistical precision. However, we only present results at six weeks (primary analysis), and one and 12 weeks (sensitivity analyses).

Our secondary outcome was physical function. If a trial presented function outcomes on more than one scale, the following hierarchical list was used to extract data: (1) global osteoarthritis function score; (2) walking disability; (3) WOMAC physical function subscore; (4) composite physical function scores other than WOMAC; (5) physical function on activities other than walking.

### Effectiveness and safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid treatment for knee and hip osteoarthritis: network meta-analysis [^113NGBBg]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis is a clinical syndrome that most commonly affects knee and hip joints in older people. It is a painful condition resulting in reduced physical function and quality of life, and an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Topical or oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), followed by paracetamol (acetaminophen) or opioids, comprise first-line pharmacotherapy. In the United States, 65% of patients with osteoarthritis are prescribed NSAIDs and 71% opioids for pain management; notably, opioid prescriptions for musculoskeletal pain increased by 70% between 2001 and 2010. In the UK, 84% of all patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis between 2000 and 2015 were prescribed opioids, with increasing numbers of prescriptions and prescribed doses in more recent years.

Clinicians face a myriad of options when prescribing pharmacotherapy, posing a challenge to clinical decision-making. Evidence suggests that improvements in pain and physical function could be similar for opioids and NSAIDs, but opioids cause considerably more adverse events. Furthermore, seven of the ten recommendations made in a recent guideline for opioid treatment in chronic non-cancer pain focus on harm reduction due to the substantial risks associated with opioid use. In addition to the immediate reactions after opioid use, such as nausea, vomiting, and drowsiness, chronic use is associated with an increased risk of fractures, cardiovascular events, opioid dependence, and mortality. Globally, opioid use disorder increased by 23% between 2005 and 2015. Over half of all global overdoses…

### No added value of duloxetine in patients with chronic pain due to hip or knee osteoarthritis: A cluster-randomized trial [^113NShKJ]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: In this study of patients with chronic osteoarthritis (OA) pain, we examined the effectiveness of duloxetine when added to usual care compared to usual care alone. Furthermore, we assessed whether a beneficial effect of duloxetine is seen predominantly in patients with symptoms of centrally sensitized pain. We did not find a clinically relevant or statistically significant effect of duloxetine on WOMAC pain scores at month 3 or other time points, nor was there an effect for the other outcomes, and we can therefore rule out a clinically relevant effect in the overall group (1.9‐point difference in WOMAC pain scores). Finally, we found no effect in the subgroup of patients with symptoms of centrally sensitized pain.

While other studies have identified a small‐to‐moderate effect of duloxetine, we did not find an effect of duloxetine in patients with OA pain. In our trial, patients' baseline pain scores were similar to the pain scores reported by patients in the other trials. This difference in outcome could be due to the fact that we studied the effectiveness of duloxetine in a primary care setting, while the other studies examined the efficacy in placebo‐controlled trials in secondary care. Furthermore, the patients in our trial were older, reported OA pain for a longer time, and had more comorbidities than those in the other studies. It is established that smaller effects are found in these real‐life primary care populations and in effectiveness studies rather than in highly controlled efficacy trials. We evaluated duloxetine as a third‐choice analgesic, i.e. one used when treat…

### OARSI recommendations for the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis, part II: OARSI evidence-based, expert consensus guidelines [^113QJjWY]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to develop concise, patient-focused, evidence-based, expert consensus recommendations for managing hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA). These guidelines are designed to be adaptable and to assist physicians and allied health care professionals in both general and specialist practice worldwide.

- **Methods**: Sixteen experts from four medical disciplines — primary care, rheumatology, orthopaedics, and evidence-based medicine — across two continents and six countries (USA, UK, France, Netherlands, Sweden, and Canada) formed the guidelines development team. A systematic review of existing guidelines for the management of hip and knee OA published between 1945 and January 2006 was conducted using the validated appraisal of guidelines research and evaluation (AGREE) instrument. A core set of management modalities was generated based on consensus between guidelines. Evidence prior to 2002 was gathered from a systematic review conducted by the European League Against Rheumatism. Post-2002 evidence was updated using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, the Cochrane Library, and HTA reports. The quality of evidence was evaluated, and, where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk or odds ratio, and cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were estimated. Consensus recommendations were produced following a Delphi exercise, and the strength of recommendation (SOR) for propositions relating to each modality was determined using a visual analogue scale.

- **Results**: Twenty-three treatment guidelines for the management of hip and knee OA were identified from the literature.

### Does this patient have hip osteoarthritis? The Rational Clinical Examination Systematic Review [^1144eJSj]. JAMA (2019). Low credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis (OA) is a common cause of pain and disability. The objective of this study is to identify the clinical findings most strongly associated with hip OA.

- **Data sources**: A systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL from inception until November 2019.
- **Study selection**: Included studies (1) quantified the accuracy of clinical findings (history, physical examination, or simple tests) and (2) used plain radiographs as the reference standard for diagnosing hip OA.
- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Studies were assigned levels of evidence using the Rational Clinical Examination scale and assessed for risk of bias using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. Data were extracted using individual hips as the unit of analysis and only pooled when findings were reported in three or more studies.
- **Main outcomes and measures**: Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs).

Results indicated that six studies were included, with data from 1,110 patients and 1,324 hips, of which 509 (38%) showed radiographic evidence of OA. Among patients presenting to primary care physicians with hip or groin pain, the affected hip showed radiographic evidence of OA in 34% of cases. A family history of OA, personal history of knee OA, or pain on climbing stairs or walking up slopes all had LRs of 2.1 (sensitivity range, 33%-68%; specificity range, 68%-84%; broadest LR range: 95% CI, 1.1–3.8). To identify patients most likely to have OA, the most useful findings were squat causing posterior pain (sensitivity, 24%; specificity, 96%; LR, 6.1 [95% CI, 1.3–29]), and groin pain.

### Effectiveness and safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid treatment for knee and hip osteoarthritis: Network meta-analysis [^112FV3bJ]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

Results - **Search results and characteristics of included trials**: We screened 21,713 references, of which 153 were found to be eligible (Fig 1). An additional twenty-eight trials were identified from the reference lists of relevant papers and in ClinicalTrials.gov. In total, we included data from 181 publications describing 192 trials. These trials involved 102,829 participants with a median sample size of 466 participants (interquartile range 309–718). Considering different drug preparations and doses, a total of 90 active intervention nodes (hereafter referred to as interventions) were examined for at least one of the outcomes of interest: 68 NSAIDs, 19 opioids, and three paracetamol. Additionally, three control interventions were included in the network: oral, topical, and oral plus topical placebo. Celecoxib 200 mg/day was the most frequently investigated intervention (44 trials). Only safety data were available for nine interventions. Appendix 9 shows the network of interventions included in the pain outcome analysis.

- **Study selection**: All variables are presented at the trial level, except for drugs, which are presented at the level of randomized treatment arms. Information on body mass index and disease duration was reported in less than 50% of the trials. For unpublished reports, the publication date was the date study data were made available online or the date reported in the official records.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic hip pain: 2022 update [^11369rqR]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Chronic hip pain is a frequent chief complaint for adult patients who present for evaluation in a variety of clinical practice settings. Following a targeted history and physical examination, imaging plays a vital role in elucidating the etiologies of a patient's symptoms, as a wide spectrum of pathological entities may cause chronic hip pain. Radiography is usually the appropriate initial imaging test following a clinical examination. Depending on the clinical picture, advanced cross-sectional imaging may be subsequently performed for further evaluation.

This document provides best practice for the imaging workup of chronic hip pain in patients presenting with a variety of clinical scenarios. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Improving function in people with hip-related pain: A systematic review and meta-analysis of physiotherapist-led interventions for hip-related pain [^111u3yXE]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal conditions, such as hip-related pain, are leading causes of pain and disability in the community and the second largest global contributor to years lived with disability. Hip and groin injuries are common in active individuals, accounting for up to 18% of professional male football injuries. The true prevalence of non-arthritic hip pain in the general population is unknown; however, the burden of hip pain is high. Younger adults with hip-related pain report poor patient-reported outcome scores for pain, physical activity, and quality of life at a time of life where work and family commitments are substantial.

Hip-related pain may be classified into three categories: femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome, acetabular dysplasia, and other pathology without morphological variants (labral, chondral, and ligamentum teres pathology). Of these, FAI syndrome is the most commonly diagnosed clinical condition and is evident in 49% of people with hip pain. Patients with FAI syndrome present with pain, a morphological variant in hip shape on radiographs, with or without intra-articular imaging findings such as labral and/or chondral pathology, and reduced activity and quality of life.

Non-surgical treatment approaches should be the first-line options for musculoskeletal pain conditions. This is evident from clinical guidelines for osteoarthritis (OA) and low back pain due to the far greater costs and risks associated with surgery. Establishing the efficacy of non-surgical treatments for hip pain is critical. Physiotherapist-led interventions have shown promise in treating these conditions.

### Physical therapy management of older adults with hip fracture [^117PFdYS]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hip fracture, more specifically with respect to management of pain, AOPT 2021 guidelines recommend implementing strategies to minimize fracture-related pain during physical therapy sessions to optimize the patient's mobility. Consider offering the following strategies for nonpharmacological pain management:

- **Appropriate timing of medication**: Align medication schedules with physical therapy sessions.
- **Consultation with the interprofessional team**: Ensure collaboration among healthcare professionals to enhance patient care.
- **Psychologically informed physical therapy approaches**: Integrate psychological aspects into therapy to improve outcomes.

### Effectiveness of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of pain in knee and hip osteoarthritis: A network meta-analysis [^112zJNkq]. Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the backbone of osteoarthritis pain management. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of different preparations and doses of NSAIDs on osteoarthritis pain in a network meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: For this network meta-analysis, we considered randomized trials comparing any of the following interventions: NSAIDs, paracetamol, or placebo for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the reference lists of relevant articles for trials published between Jan 1, 1980, and Feb 24, 2015, with at least 100 patients per group. The prespecified primary and secondary outcomes were pain and physical function and were extracted in duplicate for up to seven timepoints after the start of treatment. We used an extension of multivariable Bayesian random effects models for mixed multiple treatment comparisons with a random effect at the level of trials. For the primary analysis, a random walk of first order was used to account for multiple follow-up outcome data within a trial. Preparations that used different total daily doses were considered separately in the analysis. To assess a potential dose-response relation, we used preparation-specific covariates assuming linearity on log relative dose.

- **Findings**: We identified 8973 manuscripts from our search, of which 76 randomized trials with a total of 58,451 patients were included in this analysis. 23 nodes concerning seven different NSAIDs or paracetamol with specific daily doses of administration or placebo were considered.

### Comparative effectiveness of pain management interventions for hip fracture: A systematic review [^113sVQjb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Pain management is integral to the management of hip fracture. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the benefits and harms of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for managing pain after hip fracture.

Data sources included 25 electronic databases from January 1990 to December 2010, gray literature, trial registries, and reference lists, with no language restrictions. For study selection, multiple reviewers independently and in duplicate screened 9357 citations to identify randomized, controlled trials (RCTs); nonrandomized controlled trials (non-RCTs); and cohort studies of pain management techniques in older adults after acute hip fracture.

Independent, duplicate data extraction and quality assessment were conducted, with discrepancies resolved by consensus or through a third reviewer. Data extracted included study characteristics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, participant characteristics, interventions, and outcomes.

From the data synthesis, 83 unique studies (64 RCTs, 5 non-RCTs, and 14 cohort studies) were included, addressing various techniques: nerve blockade (n = 32), spinal anesthesia (n = 30), systemic analgesia (n = 3), traction (n = 11), multimodal pain management (n = 2), neurostimulation (n = 2), rehabilitation (n = 1), and complementary and alternative medicine (n = 2). Overall, moderate evidence suggests that nerve blockades are effective for relieving acute pain and reducing delirium. In contrast, low-level evidence suggests that preoperative traction does not reduce acute pain. Evidence was insufficient on the benefits and harms of most interventions, including spinal anesthesia and systemic analgesia.

### Willingness to undergo joint surgery following a first-line intervention for osteoarthritis: Data from the better management of people with osteoarthritis register [^113F3sHo]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Low credibility.

Pain was significantly associated with the willingness to undergo surgery at both follow-ups, suggesting that a reduction of 1 unit in the pain intensity can lead to 60–80% lower odds of being willing to undergo surgery. However, the presence of walking difficulties also showed a strong association, increasing by 3–5-fold the odds of being willing to undergo surgery. Despite the fact that pain is often considered the most important factor driving care-seeking behavior, qualitative evidence showed that patients with OA often consider the use of quantitative measures of pain to deem eligibility for surgery to be inappropriate due to the inability of these scales to capture the real impact of pain on a person's life. Thus, measures of walking difficulties and physical disabilities may help to capture the experience of a person with OA, explaining their strong association with the willingness to undergo surgery. Addressing perceived walking difficulties may lead to less surgery consideration.

Among the other factors analyzed, quality of life was not associated with the willingness to undergo surgery. Factors external to the joint disease may influence the quality of life without necessarily impacting the willingness to undergo surgery. On the other hand, higher levels of self-efficacy reduced the odds of being willing to undergo surgery. Focusing on function and participation rather than solely on symptom reduction may further reduce surgery consideration.

Patients with hip OA appear to benefit less from first-line interventions compared to patients with knee OA.

### Differential diagnosis of hip disease versus spine disease [^114W9aeM]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Many clinicians find it difficult to differentiate between symptoms caused by a spine disorder or a hip disorder. If surgery is indicated, the order in which these operations take place is an important factor in the patient's long-term outcome. A prospective evaluation and retrospective chart review of patients with lower extremity pain was performed at the principal investigator's clinic to determine which signs and symptoms best predict the primary source of pain in patients with hip and spine disorders. Medical histories, physical examinations, and diagnostic tests were done on 97 patients with lower extremity pain to determine which signs and symptoms were the best predictors of a primary source of the pain (a hip or a spine disorder).

- **Key findings**: The presence of a limp, groin pain, or limited internal rotation of the hip significantly predicted the diagnosis of a disorder as originating primarily from the hip, as opposed to originating from the spine. Patients with a limp were seven times more likely to have a hip disorder only or a hip and spine disorder than a spine-only disorder. Similarly, patients with groin pain or limited internal rotation of the hips were seven and 14 times, respectively, more likely to have a hip disorder only or a hip and spine disorder than a spine-only disorder.

These variables are of primary importance to the clinician when making a differential diagnosis between hip disease and spine disease.

### Consensus recommendations on the classification, definition and diagnostic criteria of hip-related pain in young and middle-aged active adults from the International Hip-related Pain Research Network, Zurich 2018 [^116BvBW2]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Young and middle-aged active adults with hip and groin pain often present with a confusing overlap of signs and symptoms. There is no consensus on how to define or classify hip disease, given the different and overlapping intra-articular and extra-articular contributors to symptoms in an anatomically complex region. Several researchers and consensus groups have previously attempted to define aspects of hip and groin pain.

In 2017, the International Hip Pain Research Network (IHiPRN) was established to facilitate collaboration across research groups and disciplines and to improve knowledge dissemination of hip-related pain to clinicians. In this paper, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, we first describe the general consensus process applied to all topics in this series. We then make recommendations on the first topic regarding how to classify, define, and diagnose hip disease in young and middle-aged active adults, with hip-related pain as the main symptom. Other papers in this series used this classification of hip-related pain in the assessment of (1) patient-reported outcome measures, (2) standardized measurement of physical capacity, and (3) physiotherapist-led treatment.

For this paper, the working group used a scoping review framework to search the literature for systematic reviews, intervention, and observational studies (prospective or retrospective) with a study population of at least 10 young and middle-aged active adults, published in English-language, peer-reviewed journals. Evidence summaries and consensus recommendations were then presented and discussed.

### Evaluation of the patient with hip pain [^115JTzsG]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Hip pain is a common and disabling condition that affects patients of all ages. The differential diagnosis of hip pain is broad, presenting a diagnostic challenge. Patients often express that their hip pain is localized to one of three anatomic regions: the anterior hip and groin, the posterior hip and buttock, or the lateral hip. Anterior hip and groin pain is commonly associated with intra-articular pathology, such as osteoarthritis and hip labral tears.

Posterior hip pain is associated with piriformis syndrome, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, lumbar radiculopathy, and, less commonly, ischiofemoral impingement and vascular claudication. Lateral hip pain occurs with greater trochanteric pain syndrome. Clinical examination tests, although helpful, are not highly sensitive or specific for most diagnoses; however, a rational approach to the hip examination can be used.

Radiography should be performed if acute fracture, dislocations, or stress fractures are suspected. Initial plain radiography of the hip should include an anteroposterior view of the pelvis and frog-leg lateral view of the symptomatic hip. Magnetic resonance imaging should be performed if the history and plain radiograph results are not diagnostic. Magnetic resonance imaging is valuable for the detection of occult traumatic fractures, stress fractures, and osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Magnetic resonance arthrography is the diagnostic test of choice for labral tears.

### What factors identified in initial osteoarthritis management are associated with poor patient-reported outcomes after THA? A register-based study [^111FMCz6]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2023). High credibility.

Some patients report long-term pain, no improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), or dissatisfaction after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, factors associated with these poorer patient-reported outcomes after surgery are inconsistent and have typically been studied in the late phase of hip osteoarthritis (OA) among patients already eligible for surgery. Earlier identification of risk factors would provide time to address modifiable factors, helping to improve patients' pain, HRQoL, and satisfaction after surgery, and reduce the burden on orthopaedic clinics by referring patients who are better prepared for surgery.

- **Questions/purposes**: We analyzed data from patients with hip OA referred to a first-line OA intervention program in primary healthcare at a stage when they had not been referred for THA. We asked: (1) What percentage of patients who proceed to THA report lack of improvement in pain, lack of improvement in HRQoL as measured by the EQ-5D, or are not satisfied with surgery 1 year after THA? (2) What associations exist between baseline factors at referral to this first-line OA intervention program and these poorer patient-reported outcomes 1 year after THA?

- **Methods**: We included 3,411 patients with hip OA (mean age 67 ± 9 years, 63% [2,160 of 3,411] women) who had been referred for first-line OA interventions between 2008 and 2015 and subsequently underwent THA for OA. All patients were initially identified through the Swedish Osteoarthritis Register, which follows and evaluates patients in a standardized national first-line OA intervention program.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^115Rx1bv]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Symptomatic hip OA is classically thought to present as anterior groin pain, but intra-articular hip pathology can also cause pain in the lateral hip, anterior thigh, knee, low back, buttock, and lower leg. The diagnosis and management of hip OA is discussed in depth in another article in this series, but it is still important to consider this diagnosis when older adults present with lateral hip and/or thigh pain. In a study of 369 patients (443 hips) with symptomatic hip OA proven by pain relief after total hip arthroplasty, 27% of these patients presented with lateral hip pain. Pain with passive hip range of motion while the patient is supine should prompt the clinician to consider the possibility of hip OA or other intra-articular hip pathology contributing to the patient's pain. If the patient is also tender to palpation over the GT, secondary GTPS is likely present and should be managed as detailed above.

- **Lumbar radicular pain**: Lateral hip and thigh pain may be referred from irritation of the lumbar nerve roots. Most commonly, the L2 through L5 nerve roots refer pain to this distribution, but the L4 and L5 nerve roots are more likely to also refer pain below the knee. Based on the path of nerve roots, disc herniations or bulges of any of the L1–2 through L5-S1 intervertebral discs can potentially refer pain to this area. When a patient is describing the location of his/her pain, radiation below the knee is also suggestive, but not definitive, for lumbar radicular pain.

### Current concepts review: Evaluation and management of posterior hip pain [^116RK2K8]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). High credibility.

Understanding the etiology and evolving research on intra- and extra-articular hip complaints requires comprehensive diagnosis and management of the spectrum of posterior hip diseases. Interest in posterior hip disorders has increased in recent years as new studies and theories have emerged regarding the disease process. Although most of the differential diagnoses around the posterior hip have traditionally been considered uncommon, recent reports suggest that these complaints have instead been commonly overlooked. Failure to identify the cause of posterior hip pain in a timely manner can increase pain perception, deteriorate the patient's hope, and consequently affect quality of life.

Posterior hip pain could be differentiated as intrapelvic and extrapelvic, and differential diagnosis is made based on a comprehensive history, physical examination, and imaging studies. Plain radiography, CT, MRI, 3T MRI, and imaging-guided injection tests are usually necessary for accurate diagnosis. Surgical intervention, whether endoscopic or open, is required for patients with long-standing symptoms for whom nonsurgical treatment has been unsuccessful and who have experienced temporary relief of their symptoms after injection. Orthopedic surgeons are uniquely trained in understanding the anatomy, biomechanics, clinical evaluation, and treatment of all five layers of the hip.

### Soft-tissue sources of extra-articular pain following total hip arthroplasty: A comprehensive review [^1147MVv9]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) stands as one of the most successful surgeries in orthopaedic care, offering unparalleled relief to patients suffering from hip osteoarthritis by restoring function and improving the quality of life. Over the years, advancements in surgical techniques and implant designs have continually refined the outcomes of this procedure.

Nevertheless, persistent pain after THA is a common condition with a reported prevalence ranging from 0.4% to 18.3%. The possible causes are vast, and after ruling out deep joint infection and aseptic loosening, an adequate diagnostic algorithm is key as multiple etiologies can be present.

Extra-articular causes of persistent hip pain after THA can present with differing areas of pain. Iliopsoas tendonitis is a common but underrecognized cause of anterior discomfort. Pain experienced over the lateral aspect of the hip is commonly referred to as greater trochanteric pain syndrome, which encompasses a wide spectrum of pain sources, including trochanteric bursitis and abductor to gluteus medius (GM) tendon tears. Alternatively, pain in the posterior hip or buttock may be referred from disease in the lumbar spine or, less frequently, from deep gluteal space (DGS) pathology, such as piriformis syndrome (PS) or proximal hamstring pathology. Addressing these pathologies promptly has been established to have a notable effect on the outcomes for this population.

The purpose of the present review is to detail the history, physical examination, and diagnostic workup of extra-articular sources of pain after THA.

### ACR appropriateness criteria chronic hip pain [^11716woS]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). High credibility.

Chronic hip pain is a common clinical problem whose cause is often elucidated by imaging. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria for chronic hip pain define best practices in image ordering. Clinical scenarios are presented alongside imaging choices and their appropriateness, organized in ordered tables with narrative explanations to guide physicians in ordering the correct tests. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel.

The guideline development and revision involve extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies, such as the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In cases where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Effectiveness and safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid treatment for knee and hip osteoarthritis: Network meta-analysis [^116DqX4k]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to prepare this article (see web-appendix 1 for protocol; PROSPERO registration CRD42020213656).

- **Eligibility criteria**: We considered large randomized trials of patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis that compared any of the following interventions for the pharmacological treatment of osteoarthritis pain: NSAIDs, opioids, paracetamol (acetaminophen), or placebo. Trials that included patients with other types of arthritis or joints other than the knee or hip were only included if ≥ 75% of the patients had confirmed knee or hip osteoarthritis. Additionally, trials were required to have at least one follow-up measurement of pain or another algofunctional outcome. To reduce small study bias, we only included trials with an average of ≥ 100 participants randomized per arm. No publication status or year restriction was applied, but we limited the publication language to English.

- **Identification of trials**: To identify eligible trials, we conducted searches on the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), from inception to 30 June 2021, and Medline and Embase from inception to 28 June 2021 (web-appendix 2). We also manually searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and systematic reviews (web-appendix 3).

### Review for the generalist: Evaluation of pediatric hip pain [^112zbtAf]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Children who have hip pathology may present with a variety of non-specific symptoms. Transient synovitis and septic arthritis have similar early symptoms, with the spontaneous onset of progressive hip, groin, or thigh pain; limp or inability to bear weight; fever; and irritability. Untreated intra-articular infection can lead to a permanent loss of hip function, making it extremely important to differentiate possible infection from benign cases of transient synovitis. Other causes of hip pathology are often related to skeletal maturity and are fairly specific to the age of the child. An awareness of developmental anomalies, as well as variation in skeletal maturation, will aid the physician in evaluation and management. This article reviews common musculoskeletal causes of hip and pelvis pain in the pediatric population.

- **Clinical history**: Children who have hip pathology may present with pain, refusal to bear weight, limp, or decreased movement of the lower extremity. If pain is present, it is important to determine where it is originating from, as pelvis and low back pathology may refer pain to the hip region, and hip pathology commonly presents with referred thigh or knee pain. Intra-articular hip pathology is usually localized to the groin. Once the pain is localized to the hip region, there is a limited differential diagnosis based on age and presentation. Diagnostic imaging is then useful to confirm the diagnosis. The clinical history should include a thorough description of the pain characteristics (location, character, onset, duration, change with activity or…).

### Exercise interventions and patient beliefs for people with hip, knee or hip and knee osteoarthritis: a mixed methods review [^1135ALUp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Chronic peripheral joint pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) is extremely prevalent and a major cause of physical dysfunction and psychosocial distress. Exercise is recommended to reduce joint pain and improve physical function, but the effect of exercise on psychosocial function — such as health beliefs, depression, anxiety, and quality of life — in this population is unknown.

- **Objectives**: To improve our understanding of the complex inter-relationship between pain, psychosocial effects, physical function, and exercise.

- **Search methods**: Review authors searched 23 clinical, public health, psychology, and social care databases, along with 25 other relevant resources including trials registers up to March 2016. We checked reference lists of included studies for additional relevant studies and contacted key experts regarding unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: To be included in the quantitative synthesis, studies had to be randomized controlled trials of land- or water-based exercise programs compared with a control group that received no treatment or a non-exercise intervention (such as medication or patient education). These studies needed to measure either pain or function alongside at least one psychosocial outcome (self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, or quality of life). Participants were required to be aged 45 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of OA (as defined by the study) or self-reported chronic hip or knee (or both) pain lasting more than six months. To be included in the qualitative synthesis, studies had to have reported people's opinions and experiences regarding exercise-based programs.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: A scoping review [^114sFpCe]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

The conclusion highlights that lateral hip pain was once a poorly defined condition, but advances in imaging and an increased focus on sports medicine have enhanced our understanding of its pathology, presentation, and management. An in-depth comprehension of the anatomy of the abductor musculature, along with specific clinical signs and imaging findings, is crucial for making an accurate diagnosis and implementing an effective management plan. Additionally, assessing baseline psychological impairment is essential for optimizing outcomes in this patient cohort.

### Effectiveness and safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid treatment for knee and hip osteoarthritis: Network meta-analysis [^112QN9TR]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

To assess the effectiveness and safety of different preparations and doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, and paracetamol for knee and hip osteoarthritis pain and physical function, a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials was conducted. This study aimed to enable the effective and safe use of these drugs at their lowest possible dose.

- **Design**: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials.

- **Data sources**: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Medline, Embase, regulatory agency websites, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to 28 June 2021.

- **Eligibility criteria for selecting studies**: Randomised trials published in English with ≥ 100 patients per group that evaluated NSAIDs, opioids, or paracetamol (acetaminophen) to treat osteoarthritis.

- **Outcomes and measures**: The prespecified primary outcome was pain. Physical function and safety outcomes were also assessed.

- **Review methods**: Two reviewers independently extracted outcomes data and evaluated the risk of bias of included trials. Bayesian random effects models were used for network meta-analysis of all analyses. Effect estimates are comparisons between active treatments and oral placebo.

- **Results**: A total of 192 trials comprising 102,829 participants examined 90 different active preparations or doses (68 for NSAIDs, 19 for opioids, and three for paracetamol). Five oral preparations (diclofenac 150 mg/day, etoricoxib 60 mg/day and 90 mg/day, and rofecoxib 25 mg/day and 50 mg/day) had ≥ 99% probability of more pronounced treatment effects than the minimal clinically relevant reduction in pain. Topical diclofenac (70–81 mg/day and 140–160 mg/day) had ≥ 92.3% probability of achieving significant treatment effects.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: A scoping review [^112gdB21]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Intra-articular hip arthroscopy has expanded rapidly over the last two decades in the management of pathology with an aim not only to treat but also to preserve the normal architecture of the joint. Furthermore, continual advances in technology and surgical techniques, coupled with a greater understanding of extra-articular pathologies, have contributed to the development of extra-articular hip endoscopy. Improvements in diagnostic interpretation of radiographs, dynamic ultrasound, MRI, and CT imaging have helped delineate the causes of anterior, lateral, and posterior hip pain, thereby assisting in identifying specific treatable pathology around the hip.

Lateral hip pain is a common symptom with which patients present to the hip clinic. Accurate identification of the pathology is vital to ensure appropriate treatment. The lateral compartment of the hip is defined as the space between the greater trochanter and the tensor fascia lata, and arthroscopy of this compartment is increasingly performed in addition to traditional hip arthroscopy. This extra-articular procedure provides a valuable tool for assessing and addressing pathology in the periarticular region of the hip.

The aim of this scoping review is to present an evidence-based update of the regional anatomy and the relevant literature, focusing only on the pathoanatomy, clinical assessment, and diagnosis of pathology in the peritrochanteric space.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^115rVAJa]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Many physicians assume that an older adult with low back pain (LBP) and concomitant lateral hip/thigh pain has lumbar spinal stenosis. However, there are myriad causes of lateral hip/thigh pain in older adults, and diagnosing this pain can be challenging due to pain referral patterns. The hip and nearby lumbopelvic structures share innervation from common nerve roots, resulting in overlapping pain referral patterns. Faulty mechanics of the lumbar spine and/or hip can lead to compensatory movement patterns and eventually result in multiple pain generators. These challenges are illustrated in a study by Sembrano and colleagues, where in a sample of 200 patients being evaluated by a spine surgeon, only 65% had isolated spine pain, while 17.5% had a combination of hip, spine, and/or sacroiliac (SI) joint pain.

Diagnosing the etiology of hip and lumbopelvic pain in older adults is particularly challenging due to structural abnormalities on imaging studies that are asymptomatic. For example, 93% of asymptomatic people aged 60–80 years have MRI evidence of disc degeneration, 36% have a herniated disc, and 21% have spinal stenosis. Additionally, only 46.5% of women aged 65 years and older with radiographic evidence of hip osteoarthritis (OA) report experiencing hip pain "on most days for at least 1 month".

### Patient-reported outcome measures for hip-related pain: A review of the available evidence and a consensus statement from the international hip-related pain research network, Zurich 2018 [^114KnKrU]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Hip-related pain is a well-recognized complaint among active young and middle-aged adults. People experiencing hip-related disorders commonly report pain and reduced functional capacity, including difficulties in executing activities of daily living. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are essential to accurately examine and compare the effects of different treatments on disability in those with hip pain. In November 2018, 38 researchers and clinicians working in the field of hip-related pain met in Zurich, Switzerland, for the first International Hip-related Pain Research Network meeting. Prior to the meeting, evidence summaries were developed relating to four prioritized themes. This paper discusses the available evidence and consensus process from which recommendations were made regarding the appropriate use of PROMs to assess disability in young and middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain.

Our process to gain consensus had five steps:

1. **Systematic review of systematic reviews**: Preliminary discussion within the working group.
2. **Update of the more recent high-quality systematic review**: Examination of the psychometric properties of PROMs according to established guidelines.
3. **Formulation of the recommendations**: Considering the limitations of the PROMs derived from the examination of their quality.
4. **Voting and consensus**: Out of 102 articles retrieved, 6 systematic reviews were selected and assessed for quality according to AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews). Two showed moderate quality.

We then updated the most…

### Which nonsurgical treatments do patients believe are most effective for hip and knee arthritis [^112Wo54o]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Global Research & Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

The questionnaire content asked respondents to focus only on the hip or knee causing the most pain at the time of the survey. It inquired whether a patient had tried specific nonsurgical treatments to reduce pain in their hip or knee. Respondents who indicated trying a treatment were asked to rate its effectiveness on a five-point Likert scale: one for not at all, two for a little, three for somewhat, four for very, and five for extremely. Some items included additional follow-up questions, such as which type of physician prescribed the treatment. The nonsurgical treatments surveyed included physical therapy (PT), acetaminophen, over-the-counter (OTC) NSAIDs, prescription NSAIDs, opioids, corticosteroid injections, hyaluronic acid injections, PRP injections, stem cell injections, and assistive walking devices. Each pharmaceutical treatment type listed examples of generic and brand names to help respondents recognize the pharmaceutical in question.

Through step-wise questioning of each treatment type, respondents were ultimately asked to choose the single most effective treatment for reducing pain in their hip or knee. The final portion of the questionnaire collected demographic information, including age, joint (hip or knee), sex, race and ethnicity, education level, and insurance type.

- **Statistical analyses**: Descriptive statistics provided the raw survey results. Statistical analyses included the Student t-test and Fisher exact test for categorical variables.

### Physiotherapist-led treatment for young to middle-aged active adults with hip-related pain: Consensus recommendations from the International Hip-related Pain Research Network, Zurich 2018 [^1123qmZy]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The 1st International Hip-related Pain Research Network meeting discussed four prioritized themes concerning hip-related pain in young to middle-aged adults: (1) diagnosis and classification of hip-related pain; (2) patient-reported outcome measures for hip-related pain; (3) measurement of physical capacity for hip-related pain; and (4) physiotherapist-led treatment for hip-related pain. Thirty-eight expert researchers and clinicians working in the field of hip-related pain attended the meeting. This manuscript relates to the theme of physiotherapist-led treatments for hip-related pain. A systematic review on the efficacy of physiotherapist-led interventions for hip-related pain (published separately) was conducted, finding that strong evidence for physiotherapist-led treatments was lacking.

Prior to the meeting, draft consensus recommendations based on the systematic review were developed for consideration. These draft recommendations were presented to all meeting participants via email at least one week before the meeting. During the meeting, the recommendations were discussed, revised, and voted on. Six recommendations for clinical practice and five for research were included, all gaining consensus.

Recommendations for clinical practice were: (i) exercise-based treatments are recommended for people with hip-related pain; (ii) exercise-based treatment should last at least 3 months; (iii) physiotherapist-led rehabilitation should be undertaken after hip surgery.

### Hip pain in adults: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113bw672]. American Family Physician (2021). High credibility.

Adults commonly present to their family physicians with hip pain, and diagnosing the cause is crucial for prescribing effective therapy. Hip pain is typically located anteriorly, laterally, or posteriorly.

- **Anterior hip pain**: This includes referred pain from intra-abdominal or intrapelvic causes, extra-articular etiologies such as hip flexor injuries, and intra-articular etiologies. Intra-articular pain is often caused by a labral tear or femoroacetabular impingement in younger adults or by osteoarthritis in older adults.

- **Lateral hip pain**: This is most commonly caused by greater trochanteric pain syndrome, which includes gluteus medius tendinopathy or tear, bursitis, and iliotibial band friction.

- **Posterior hip pain**: Includes referred pain from lumbar spinal pathology, deep gluteal syndrome with sciatic nerve entrapment, ischiofemoral impingement, and hamstring tendinopathy.

In addition to the history and physical examination, radiography, ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed for a definitive diagnosis. Radiography of the hip and pelvis should be the initial imaging test. Ultrasound-guided anesthetic injections can aid in the diagnosis of an intra-articular cause of pain. Since femoroacetabular impingement, labral tears, and gluteus medius tendon tears typically have good surgical outcomes, advanced imaging and/or early referral may improve patient outcomes.

### A comparison of the OARSI response criteria with patient's global assessment in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip treated with a non-pharmacological intervention [^117GXGxX]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2006). High credibility.

To compare the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) response criteria for clinical trials with patient's global assessment in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip receiving a non-pharmacological intervention, such as manual therapy or exercise therapy, data from a randomized clinical trial involving 109 patients were used.

Change scores of measures of hip function, range of joint motion, and pain were compared between patients differently classified by the OARSI response criteria and the patient's global assessment. This comparison was made using a t-test with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Furthermore, risk ratios (with 95% CI) were calculated for the contrast between treatment outcomes, distinguishing between using the OARSI criteria or patient's global assessment.

Results showed that few patients were classified as improved (i.e. responders) using the OARSI response criteria compared to the patient's global assessment. A significantly worse outcome for hip function and pain was observed in patients classified as non-responders by the OARSI criteria, but who considered themselves improved according to their own assessment. Risk ratios for the contrast between the two treatment programs (manual therapy vs. exercise therapy) were similar, regardless of whether the OARSI criteria or the patient's global assessment was used.

The validity of the OARSI response criteria has been previously demonstrated in OA patients treated with pharmacological interventions. The present study further demonstrates the validity of the OARSI response criteria in OA patients treated with non-pharmacological interventions.

### The young adult with hip pain: Diagnosis and medical treatment, circa 2004 [^115MDeps]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Hip pain in young adults (18–35 years old) often is characterized by nonspecific symptoms, normal imaging studies, and vague findings from the history and physical examination. In younger patients, pain is more likely to be caused by congenital hip dysplasia, athletic injuries, trauma, spondyloarthropathy, and by conditions that first appear during this stage of life, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, intravenous drug use, alcoholism, or corticosteroid use. The history and physical examination may narrow the diagnosis to intraarticular, extraarticular, or referred sources of pain. Plain radiography and magnetic resonance imaging are the preferred initial imaging procedures.

Analyses of the blood, urine, and synovial fluid can be helpful in diagnosing inflammation, infection, and systematic rheumatic disease. Fractures, infection, and ischemic necrosis should be ruled out early because they require immediate treatment to prevent damage to the joint. Hip trauma at a young age increases the risk of osteoarthritis with advancing age, and, unlike most older adults, young adults receiving total hip replacement can expect revision surgery. Medical treatment often involves patient education, physical therapy, and pharmacotherapy. Acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioids for pain and antibiotics for infection are the most often prescribed drugs for this population.

### Diagnostic criteria for early hip osteoarthritis: first steps, based on the CHECK study [^112VdfPW]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Although there is a general focus on early diagnosis and treatment of hip osteoarthritis (OA), there are no validated diagnostic criteria for early-stage hip OA. The study aimed to take the first steps in developing diagnostic criteria for early-stage hip OA, using factors obtained through history taking, physical examination, radiography, and blood testing at the first consultation in individuals presenting with hip pain, suspicious for hip OA, in primary care.

Data from 543 individuals with 735 symptomatic hips at baseline who had any follow-up data available from the prospective CHECK cohort study were used. A group of 26 clinical experts, including general practitioners (GPs), rheumatologists, and orthopaedic surgeons, evaluated standardized clinical assessment forms of all subjects on the presence of clinically relevant hip OA 5–10 years after baseline. Using the expert-based diagnoses as the reference standard, a backward selection method was used to create predictive models based on pre-defined baseline factors from history taking, physical examination, radiography, and blood testing.

The prevalence of clinically relevant hip OA during follow-up was 22%. Created models contained four to eight baseline factors (mainly WOMAC pain items, painful/restricted movements, and radiographic features) and obtained an area under the curve between 0.62 and 0.71.

Based on clinical and radiographic features of hip OA obtained at the first consultation with a GP for pain/stiffness of the hip, the prediction of clinically relevant hip OA within 5–10 years remains a challenge.

### Recommendations of the OARSI FDA osteoarthritis devices working group [^113dFZ4r]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis and a major cause of chronic musculoskeletal pain and functional disability. Both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic modalities are recommended in the management of OA. When patients with hip or knee OA do not obtain adequate pain relief and/or functional improvement, joint replacement surgery or other surgical interventions should be considered.

Total joint arthroplasties are reliable and cost-effective treatments for patients with significant OA of the hip and knee. Evidence from cohort and observational studies has confirmed substantial improvements in pain relief, with cumulative revision rates at 10 years following total hip (THA) and total knee arthroplasties (TKA) at 7% and 10%, respectively. Joint replacements have been used in almost every synovial joint, although results for joints other than hip and knee replacement have not been as successful.

The evolution of new device designs and surgical techniques highlights the need to better understand the risk-to-benefit ratio for different joint replacements. There is also a need to identify the appropriate methodology for evaluating the efficacy and optimal outcomes of these new devices designed to treat OA joints.

### Pharmacologic therapy for acute pain [^112vYzRo]. American Family Physician (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute pain, especially concerning non-opioid analgesics, the AAFP 2021 guidelines recommend offering NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or a combination of these for the initial management of acute pain syndromes. The choice of medication should be based on minimizing risks for each specific patient.

---

### Pharmacologic therapy for acute pain [^1167EhT3]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic management of acute pain should be tailored for each patient, including a review of treatment expectations and a plan for the time course of prescriptions. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-line treatment options for most patients with acute mild to moderate pain. Topical NSAIDs are recommended for non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries. Acetaminophen is well tolerated; however, lower doses should be used in patients with advanced hepatic disease, malnutrition, or severe alcohol use disorder. Nonselective NSAIDs are effective but should be used with caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular disease, or chronic renal disease. Selective cyclooxygenase-2 NSAIDs are a more expensive treatment alternative and are used to avoid the gastrointestinal adverse effects of nonselective NSAIDs.

Adjunctive medications may be added as appropriate for specific conditions if the recommended dose and schedule of first-line agents are inadequate (e.g. muscle relaxants may be useful for acute low back pain). For severe or refractory acute pain, treatment can be briefly escalated with the use of medications that work on opioid and monoamine receptors (e.g. tramadol, tapentadol) or with the use of acetaminophen/opioid or NSAID/opioid combinations. The opioid epidemic has increased physician and community awareness of the harms of opioid medications; however, severe acute pain may necessitate short-term use of opioids with attention to minimizing risk, including in patients on medication-assisted therapy.

### Differentiating hip pathology from lumbar spine pathology: Key points of evaluation and management [^1124MX3s]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of patients who have both hip and lumbar spine pathologies can be challenging due to overlapping symptoms, which may delay a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Common complaints of these patients include low back pain with associated buttock, groin, thigh, and possibly knee pain. A thorough patient history should be obtained, and a complete physical examination should be performed to identify the primary source of pain. Plain and advanced imaging studies, along with diagnostic injections, can further delineate the primary pathology and guide the appropriate sequence of treatment. Both the surgeon and the patient should understand that managing one pathology might necessitate subsequent management of the other due to persistent pain. Recognizing both entities can help reduce the likelihood of misdiagnosis, and managing both in the appropriate sequence may help alleviate persistent symptoms.
