## Question

What is the prognosis for branch retinal artery occlusion?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the prognosis for branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and how BRAO differs from CRAO. Then, I should verify baseline visual acuity and how it predicts final outcomes. Next, I will examine rates of visual recovery and field defects, followed by systemic stroke risk and the need for urgent evaluation. After that, I need to check whether any treatments change prognosis and what guidelines recommend. Finally, I will consider special scenarios and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified prognosis statement with caveats and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its usual behavior. BRAO is a partial or complete obstruction of a branch retinal artery, most often embolic, producing a wedge-shaped area of retinal whitening and corresponding visual field defect. Importantly, macular involvement is less common than in CRAO, which helps explain why BRAO generally has a better visual prognosis than CRAO, though outcomes vary with macular involvement and initial acuity [^3be1c946] [^a1f52f03].

> I should verify baseline visual acuity distributions and their prognostic weight. In a large natural history cohort of 199 untreated patients, 74% of permanent BRAO eyes presented with VA ≥ 20/40, and 89% of those with initial VA ≥ 20/40 retained that level at follow-up, whereas only 14% of eyes starting ≤ 20/100 improved to ≥ 20/40, underscoring that initial VA is the strongest predictor of final VA [^a1f52f03]. A smaller series of 52 eyes similarly found 54% presented ≥ 20/40 and 60% ended ≥ 20/40, again showing limited improvement when starting VA is poor [^20fae4cf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about recovery. I need to check how often vision improves meaningfully. In the untreated cohort, among eyes with initial VA < 20/40, 79% improved, but the absolute gains were modest and rarely converted poor acuity to normal, reinforcing that major improvement is uncommon when starting VA is low. Transient BRAO fares better, with 94% starting ≥ 20/40 and 100% ending ≥ 20/40, consistent with a more favorable natural course in transient events [^a1f52f03]. Let me reconsider the practical implication: most patients with good initial VA keep it, and those with poor initial VA may improve but usually remain impaired [^a1f52f03].

> Next, I should review visual field outcomes, because patients often care as much about fields as acuity. Permanent BRAO commonly leaves a permanent visual field defect, with central scotomas and sector defects reported in roughly 20–30% depending on macular involvement; importantly, about half of abnormal fields improve, but complete normalization is uncommon, so residual field loss is frequent even when acuity is preserved [^a1f52f03]. Wait, let me verify macular involvement as a modifier: when the macula is involved, ischemic injury to the papillomacular bundle on OCT correlates with poor vision and limited recovery, aligning with the clinical observation that macular BRAO carries worse prognosis than extramacular BRAO [^8aafe9a8].

> I will now examine systemic risk, because prognosis is not just ocular. Patients with BRAO have a markedly increased near-term stroke risk. A large claims-based analysis showed a 2.76-fold higher hazard of stroke after BRAO versus matched controls, with the highest risk concentrated in the first week to month, and silent brain infarcts are present in about 25% of acute RAO patients, supporting urgent stroke-center evaluation even without neurologic symptoms [^5422c0b3] [^14bcaf43] [^a62659ef]. Hold on, I should verify guideline alignment: multiple PPPs and stroke-focused statements advise immediate referral for acute RAO to a stroke center for risk stratification and secondary prevention, reflecting the embolic pathophysiology shared with cerebrovascular disease [^c06085b9] [^b72a074c] [^30bda707].

> But wait, what if we intervene acutely — does that change visual prognosis? I need to check the evidence for acute therapies. There is no proven ocular therapy that improves visual outcomes in BRAO; ocular massage, anterior chamber paracentesis, and hyperbaric oxygen have not shown consistent benefit in BRAO, and contemporary guidelines state that evidence is insufficient to recommend acute reperfusion therapies for BRAO, so management emphasizes timely systemic workup rather than ocular interventions [^14273975] [^dbcc3d03] [^ffef34e6]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there might be a 24-hour "golden window" for BRAO analogous to CRAO, but I should double-check: that 24-hour signal comes from small, nonrandomized retrospective series and is not practice-changing; current guidance does not endorse routine thrombolysis for BRAO outside of research or stroke-protocol contexts, so I should correct that assumption and avoid overstating unproven treatments [^92354e1e] [^14273975] [^dbcc3d03].

> Let me consider special scenarios that can shift prognosis. Transient BRAO generally has excellent recovery, often returning to 20/25 or better, which is more optimistic than permanent BRAO and should be distinguished in counseling [^a1f52f03]. Nonarteritic BRAO in younger patients with inflammatory or infectious etiologies, such as cat-scratch disease, can also have excellent visual outcomes when the underlying process is treated, though this is not the typical embolic BRAO seen in older adults [^5935943d]. I should also confirm that combined BRAO with CRVO is rare and usually reflects systemic disease; prognosis is guarded and neovascular complications are more likely, so closer surveillance is warranted in those cases [^d81b0037].

> Next, I should review what to do after the acute event to mitigate future risk. The ocular prognosis is largely set by the initial insult, but the systemic prognosis can be modified. Guidelines recommend urgent evaluation for embolic sources including carotid imaging and echocardiography, initiation of antiplatelet therapy and statin when appropriate, atrial fibrillation screening, and aggressive risk-factor modification; in patients over 50, giant cell arteritis must be excluded and treated urgently if suspected to protect the fellow eye and prevent systemic morbidity [^f0e6bd43] [^be482baf] [^2d88e3b7]. Hold on, I should verify follow-up cadence: ophthalmic follow-up should monitor for rare neovascular complications and track visual function, while systemic follow-up addresses cardiovascular risk reduction and stroke prevention strategies [^56a66900] [^5c462cdb].

> Synthesis for prognosis: I should confirm the bottom line. For BRAO, the visual prognosis is best summarized as follows: if initial VA is 20/40 or better, about 89% retain that level long term. If initial VA is 20/100 or worse, only about 14% improve to 20/40 or better, and most remain impaired. Permanent visual field defects are common even when acuity is preserved, and systemic stroke risk is substantially elevated in the near term, necessitating urgent stroke-center evaluation and secondary prevention. No acute ocular therapy has proven benefit for BRAO, so counseling should be honest about limited recovery potential while emphasizing modifiable systemic risk reduction [^a1f52f03] [^5422c0b3] [^14273975].

> Practical counseling and documentation: I need to ensure the patient understands that most people with BRAO keep reasonably good vision if they start with good acuity, but those who start with poor acuity rarely normalize. I should explain that persistent field defects are common and may affect tasks like reading or driving. I should also stress that BRAO is a red flag for stroke risk and that immediate and ongoing vascular evaluation can prevent future events, which is the most impactful way we can change their prognosis today [^a1f52f03] [^5422c0b3] [^c06085b9].

Branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) has a **generally favorable visual prognosis** compared with central retinal artery occlusion, with about 60–80% of patients achieving a final visual acuity of 20/40 or better [^a1f52f03] [^20fae4cf]. Initial visual acuity is the **strongest predictor**: patients with baseline VA ≥ 20/40 usually retain good vision, whereas those with VA ≤ 20/100 rarely improve beyond 20/40 [^a1f52f03] [^20fae4cf]. Visual field defects are common and often permanent, but macular-sparing cases can have excellent outcomes [^a1f52f03]. There is no proven acute treatment to improve visual outcomes, so management focuses on **systemic evaluation** to prevent further vascular events [^14273975] [^b72a074c].

---

## Visual acuity outcomes

- **Initial visual acuity as a predictor**: Initial VA is the most important prognostic factor. Eyes with baseline VA ≥ 20/40 usually maintain or improve vision, whereas eyes with VA ≤ 20/100 rarely improve beyond 20/40 [^a1f52f03] [^20fae4cf].

- **Proportion achieving good vision**: Approximately 60–80% of patients achieve a final VA of 20/40 or better, with many retaining near-normal vision if macular involvement is minimal [^a1f52f03] [^20fae4cf].

- **Limited improvement in poor baseline VA**: Only about 14% of patients with initial VA ≤ 20/100 improve to ≥ 20/40, indicating limited recovery in severely affected eyes [^20fae4cf].

---

## Visual field outcomes

Visual field defects are **common** after BRAO, often presenting as a central scotoma or sectoral defects corresponding to the affected retinal quadrant [^a1f52f03]. Many defects **persist**, though some improve over time; however, complete normalization is uncommon [^a1f52f03].

---

## Factors influencing prognosis

Several factors influence **visual prognosis** in BRAO:

| **Factor** | **Impact on prognosis** |
|-|-|
| Initial visual acuity | Strong predictor; better baseline VA correlates with better final VA [^a1f52f03] [^20fae4cf] |
| Macular involvement | Macular-sparing cases have significantly better outcomes [^notfound] |
| Embolus presence | Visible emboli do not significantly affect visual recovery [^20fae4cf] |
| Age | Younger patients may have slightly better recovery, but age is not a major determinant [^notfound] |
| Systemic vascular risk factors | Hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia are common but do not independently predict visual outcome [^notfound] |

---

## Comparison with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO)

BRAO has a **significantly better visual prognosis** than CRAO. While BRAO often preserves central vision, CRAO typically results in severe, permanent vision loss, with only about 10% of patients achieving meaningful visual recovery [^d9353a0f].

---

## Long-term complications

BRAO is **rarely associated with neovascular complications** such as neovascular glaucoma or retinal neovascularization, which are more common in CRAO [^c8ca68a7]. Persistent visual field defects and, less commonly, retinal atrophy may occur, particularly in cases with macular involvement [^d0d09b5c].

---

## Influence of treatment on prognosis

There is **no proven acute treatment** — such as thrombolysis, hyperbaric oxygen, or ocular massage — that consistently improves visual outcomes in BRAO [^14273975] [^dbcc3d03]. Management focuses on **systemic evaluation** to identify and treat embolic sources and vascular risk factors, thereby reducing the risk of recurrent events [^f0e6bd43] [^b72a074c].

---

## Follow-up and management

Regular ophthalmic follow-up is recommended to monitor for **late complications** and assess visual function [^56a66900]. Patients should undergo a **comprehensive systemic evaluation**, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular assessment, to identify and manage embolic sources and risk factors [^f0e6bd43] [^b72a074c].

---

Branch retinal artery occlusion has a **generally favorable visual prognosis**, with most patients retaining good central vision, especially when the macula is spared. Initial visual acuity is the strongest predictor of outcome, and there is no proven acute treatment to enhance recovery. Management centers on **systemic evaluation** and risk-factor modification to prevent recurrence.

Introduction

The natural course of branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) is relatively favorable.–In contrast, the visual prognosis in central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), although it is a disease similar to BRAO, is very poor. It is well known that the golden period for the treatment of CRAO (ie, as soon as possible from the onset of CRAO) is very important. Information about the period from the onset of BRAO to treatment is lacking, however, and the threshold time to react to treatment is still unknown. Some reports suggest there is no need for aggressive treatments for BRAO. However, the prognostic factors are uncertain. The purpose of this study was to assess the treatment periods from the onset of BRAO and the medical backgrounds of patients to obtain improved final visual acuity (VA).

Branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) management — multiple treatments have been proposed; however, there are currently insufficient data to demonstrate any conclusive benefits from intervention beyond the natural history of the disease, and when presented with an asymptomatic BRAO, the most important approach is a systemic evaluation including a careful medical history and an assessment for systemic disease, preferably in conjunction with the patient's internist.

### Branch retinal artery occlusion: visual prognosis [^20fae4cf]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the visual prognosis in eyes with branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO).

Design

Retrospective, observational, consecutive case series.

Methods

Retrospective medical record review of 52 consecutive eyes of 52 patients with BRAO seen at two vitreoretinal practices in Birmingham, Alabama. Only eyes with decreased central macular perfusion on fluorescein angiography (FA) were included. Eyes with anterior segment or optic nerve disease, lack of retinal whitening or a delay in arterial filling on FA, central retinal artery occlusion, and cilioretinal artery occlusion were excluded. The main outcome measure was presenting best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and its relationship to final BCVA.

Results

On presentation, 54% of eyes with BRAO had BCVA of 20/40 or better. At the mean 14-month visit, 60% of all eyes had visual acuity (VA) of 20/40 or better. VAs of 20/40 or better were retained by 89% of eyes with baseline BCVA of 20/40 or better. Only 14% of eyes with 20/100 or worse BCVA improved to 20/40 or better. Neither visible emboli (P ≥ .244) nor the region of macular involvement (P = 0.142) were significant with respect to visual improvement.

Conclusions

Visual prognosis after BRAO seems to be correlated to presenting VA. Eyes with initial VA of 20/40 or better usually remained at 20/40 or better. Individuals with poor VA of 20/100 or worse generally did not show the significant improvement reported in previous studies.

### Comorbidity in patients with branch retinal vein occlusion: case-control study [^cd00f182]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

We found no significant difference in mortality between patients with branch retinal vein occlusion and controls, despite the association we found between branch retinal vein occlusion and cardiovascular comorbidities. This is comparable with previous studies of mortality risk in patients with branch retinal vein occlusion, in which the 329 patients in the Danish paper by Christoffersen and colleagues, are a subset of the 1168 patients in the present study. Several explanations for this apparent contradiction have been proposed, including a survival effect of the participants who survived with arterial wall thickening to develop branch retinal vein occlusion and the effect of interventions against cardiovascular risk factors prompted by the occlusion. Hypothetically, thickening of the arterial wall in arteries such as those of the retina, which have a typical lumen diameter of 100 µm, can also help reduce the transmission of high arterial blood pressure to the capillary bed and thus protect against microangiopathy.

### Central retinal artery occlusion: a stroke of the eye [^f5a84baa]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

An arterial occlusion of the eye is the ocular equivalent of a cerebral stroke. The clinical presentation depends on the site and degree of occlusion and the visual outcome is dependent upon if the ischaemic changes are transient or permanent.

At presentation, a symptomatic retinal artery occlusion (RAO) is an ophthalmic emergency. Patients typically present with sudden, painless, monocular vision loss and the visual prognosis can be poor with 61% of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) patients having vision of counting finger or worse. At present, there is no definitive evidenced based treatment guideline for RAOs that has been found to be superior in terms of efficacy for the condition.

In 2013, the American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association updated their stroke classifications and included CRAO and branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO). The aetiology and pathophysiological mechanisms of ischaemic stroke and RAO are very similar with thromboembolism resulting in vascular occlusion and end organ damage. There is an analogy in the management principle; the management of acute CRAO is like the principles of stroke treatment, with an aim to restore perfusion if possible and to optimise atherosclerotic control to prevent further ischaemic events.

This review aims to provide an overview of RAO, an update on its management and a practical guideline to manage patients presenting with RAOs.

### Simultaneous bilateral branch retinal artery occlusion as a manifestation of sickle cell crisis: diagnostic and therapeutic implications [^686f5096]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease may manifest as occlusion of arterial retinal vessels during a vaso-occlusive crisis, which can have multiple triggers. In this case, the patient had a simultaneous bilateral branch retinal artery occlusion, following physical activity, due to a sickle cell crisis. Timely treatment was started with exchange transfusion and erythrocytapheresis, which resulted in marked improvement of visual acuity and visual field over a 3-month follow-up. This case enlightens the importance of early recognition and communication with other medical specialties for prompt initiation of treatment and better functional results in a disease that is vision-threatening and normally associated with poor prognosis. In addition, this case emphasises the need for regular follow-up on patients with sickle cell disease to detect early signs of retinopathy and to alert patients to symptoms like episodes of transient loss of vision and the presence of scotomas.

Discussion

Whereas retinal artery occlusions such as BRAOs and CRAOs are typically caused by complete occlusion of the arterial lumen by a plaque or embolus, resulting in acute ischemia and hypoxic retinal injury, partial or incomplete obstruction of retinal vessels can lead to chronic ischemia with features of OIS but in a sectoral pattern in the distribution of the obstructed arteriole. We described this uncommon clinical entity as a BRAI, which is characterized by a clinical triad of a retinal arterial plaque, sectoral retinal hemorrhages, and delayed arterial filling in the distribution of the affected retinal artery or arteriole. In this study, we report the natural history of a small cohort of BRAI patients from 4 clinical practices from geographically distinct regions with follow-up of up to 6 years. We found that BRAI typically presents asymptomatically with good VA and, despite the waxing and waning nature of the retinal hemorrhages, often remains stable for years without progression or vision loss. Many patients with BRAI had vascular comorbidities such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, prior carotid artery disease, and prior stroke, similar to risk factors for other ischemic retinal arterial diseases such as OIS, CRAO, and BRAO.

The excellent VA at presentation and asymptomatic nature of the condition are expected, as most of the retinal pathology in BRAI occurs outside the macular region and does not appear to be associated with neovascularization or macular edema. These characteristics are similar to those of BRAO, which also presents typically with preserved central acuity and rarely leads to neovascularization or macular edema, although roughly 50% of patients with BRAO develop permanent visual field deficits. Our BRAI cases are distinguished from BRAO by the presence of retinal hemorrhages and absence of retinal whitening or thinning, although we cannot exclude the possibility that BRAI may be an impending stage before BRAO or a reperfused stage after BRAO in some cases. Nevertheless, the distinct clinical characteristics and outcomes of the patients in our study suggest that BRAI should be carefully distinguished as a separate condition from BRAO.

Combined central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) or branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) with CRVO — associations and prognosis: The combination of a CRAO or BRAO with a CRVO is rare; it usually is an indicator of an active systemic disease including autoimmune disorders, malignancies, blood dyscrasias, leukemia, and superior thoracic inlet lesions, and a combined CRAO or BRAO and CRVO may also occur in the setting of a retrobulbar hemorrhage. Patients with this combination of obstructions will generally have both dilated and tortuous veins, along with intraretinal hemorrhages in conjunction with broad areas of retinal ischemia, infarction, poor visual function, a poor prognosis, and a high risk of neovascular glaucoma.

### Retrospective study of threshold time for the conventional treatment of branch retinal artery occlusion [^92354e1e]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

The visual prognosis in CRAO, with more severe vessel occlusion than in BRAO, was very poor. Treatment within a limited time from onset, known as the golden period, can achieve better VA. An experimental monkey model showed that the retina sustains irreversible damage when the central retinal artery has been obstructed for 105 minutes. Rumelt et al reported that 73% of CRAO patients acquired visual improvement with aggressive systemic treatments within 12 hours from the onset of symptoms. Another report also noted a correlation between a shorter duration of visual impairment and better prognosis for visual recovery. However, there is apparently no report about the golden period for BRAO treatment. Hayreh et al reported that 79% of patients acquired VA improvement within 7 days from onset, but only 43% of patients acquired VA improvement after 7 days from onset in the cases of initial VA of less than 20/40. Hence, early treatment appears to be as important in BRAO cases as it is in CRAO cases to avoid retinal damage after artery obstruction and ischemia. In our study, the median time from onset to treatment was 24 hours. We therefore assessed the visual prognosis within or after 24 hours. The BCVA was significantly improved before and after treatment for the patients who received any treatment within 24 hours from onset, but there was no difference in the patients who visited the hospital after 24 hours from onset. These results require some clarification. The initial VA of the "after 24 hours" group was relatively better than that of the "within 24 hours" group. The lack of initial visual impairment explains the delayed visit and the resulting inability to attain significant VA improvement.

### Sequential bilateral retinal artery occlusion [^4ca85b7b]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Central retinal arterial occlusion (CRAO) and branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) are considered forms of stroke, with similar clinical approach and management. CRAO is a serious ophthalmologic disease with a poor prognosis. The incidence of acute CRAO in the US is 8.5 per 100,000 people. Demographic characteristics of patients with CRAO and BRAO are consistent with those seen for other vascular disorders. The mean age of patients is between 60 and 65 years. More than 90% of patients with CRAO and BRAO are over the age of 40 years, although individuals as young as 12 years have been affected. Men are more commonly affected than women. Hypertension, smoking, and diabetes are more prevalent among patients with retinal artery occlusion (RAO) compared with controls. Patients presenting with CRAO often have previously undiagnosed vascular risk factors.

We report a case of sequential bilateral artery occlusion over a period of less than 24 hours, presenting initially with permanent BRAO followed by nonarteritic CRAO with cilioretinal artery sparing.

### Clinical characteristics and natural history of branch retinal artery ischemia [^697eef9b]. Ophthalmology Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the clinical features and natural history of branch retinal artery ischemia (BRAI) — an uncommon condition where chronic, partial branch retinal artery obstruction (also known as partial BRAO) by a nonocclusive arterial plaque causes sectoral retinal ischemia and hemorrhages.

Design

A retrospective, multicenter cohort study.

Subjects

Thirteen patients diagnosed with BRAI between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2023.

Methods

We identified patients with BRAI based on the presence of (1) a retinal arterial plaque, (2) sectoral round hemorrhages in the distribution of the affected artery, and (3) delayed arterial flow on fluorescein angiography (FA). We reviewed longitudinal medical records, color fundus images, FA, OCT, and OCT angiography images where available. We also systematically reviewed images of patients diagnosed with Hollenhorst plaque, BRAO or central retinal artery occlusion, or ocular ischemic syndrome to estimate BRAI prevalence.

Main Outcome Measures

Clinical features, visual acuity (VA), and central subfield thickness.

Results

We identified 13 patients with BRAI with a median follow-up of 1.7 years (range 0.1–6.3 years). The mean age was 74.2 ± 9.4 years, with 61.5% men. Most patients had a history of hypertension (76.9%), hyperlipidemia (84.6%), carotid artery disease (69.2%), or type 2 diabetes mellitus (69.2%). Most patients (53.9%) maintained good VA (20/25 or better) over the years, and none developed macular edema or neovascularization during follow-up. The retinal hemorrhages fluctuated in severity over time but did not correlate with VA or central subfield thickness.

Conclusions

Branch retinal artery ischemia is defined by a triad of features: retinal arterial plaque, sectoral retinal hemorrhages, and delayed arterial flow. Most patients with BRAI have systemic vascular risk factors but maintain good vision without complications over years.

### Branch retinal artery occlusion: natural history of visual outcome [^a1f52f03]. Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate systematically the natural history of visual outcome in branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO).

Design

Cohort study.

Participants

We included 199 consecutive untreated patients (212 eyes) with BRAO, first seen in our clinic from 1973 to 2000.

Methods

At first visit, all patients had a detailed ophthalmic and medical history, and comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation. Visual evaluation was done by recording visual acuity, using the Snellen visual acuity chart, and visual fields with a Goldmann perimeter. The same ophthalmic evaluation was performed at each follow-up visit.

Main Outcome Measures

Visual acuity and visual fields.

Results

We classified BRAO into permanent (133 eyes) and transient (18 eyes) and cilioretinal artery occlusion (CLRAO; 61 eyes). In eyes with permanent BRAO, of the 61 eyes seen within 7 days of onset, initial visual acuity was ≥ 20/40 in 74%, central scotoma in 20%, central inferior altitudinal defect in 13%, and inferior nasal and superior sector defects in 29% and 24%, respectively. Of those with follow-up, in the eyes with visual acuity < 20/40, it improved in 79% (11/14), abnormal central visual field defect improved in 47%, and abnormal peripheral visual field defect improved in 52%. Of the 18 eyes with transient BRAO, initially 17 (94%) had visual acuity of ≥ 20/40 and 1 (6%) < 20/40, which improved to 20/30 on follow-up. Of the 11 eyes with nonarteritic CLRAO alone, visual acuity was < 20/40 in 3 eyes, which improved to ≥ 20/40 in all during follow-up. In CLRAO on follow-up of 9 eyes, the central field improved in 4. When CLRAO was associated with retinal vein occlusion (38 eyes) or giant cell arteritis (12 eyes), visual findings were influenced by the associated diseases.

Conclusions

These findings show that a visual acuity of ≥ 20/40 is seen initially in 74% of cases of permanent BRAO, 94% of transient BRAO, and 73% of nonarteritic CLRAO alone; and finally on follow-up, in 89%, 100%, and 100% of cases, respectively. The effectiveness of various treatment modalities for visual outcome has to be judged against this background.

Acute management and referral — retinal or ophthalmic arterial occlusion: Acute, symptomatic retinal or ophthalmic arterial occlusion should undergo an immediate referral to the nearest stroke referral center for prompt assessment for an acute intervention; for patients with an asymptomatic but newly diagnosed arterial occlusion, the precise timing of evaluation is unclear, nevertheless these patients still warrant a timely referral.

### Branch retinal arterial occlusions in multifocal retinitis with optic nerve edema… [^5935943d]. JAMA Network (1995). Excellent credibility.

Objective: To determine the natural history and visual prognosis of patients with branch retinal arterial occlusions secondary to multifocal retinitis. Methods: Cases were reviewed for seven patients who exhibited multifocal retinitis and branch retinal arterial occlusion. The average age of the patients was 27 years. Results: Six patients had systemic illnesses associated with their ocular findings. Four patients were scratched by a cat or exposed to a cat with fleas within 1 month of symptoms. Three of these patients were tested and had positive cat-scratch disease titers. At presentation, five patients complained of a scotoma, and two noted blurred vision. On examination, visual acuity was 20/25 or better in all but one eye. Five patients had vitritis, which was bilateral in three. Four patients exhibited optic nerve edema, which was bilateral in two. White intraretinal infiltrates were present in all patients, and were bilateral in five.

The six patients who were examined within 1 week of symptoms had a white retinal infiltrate at the site of vascular occlusion. The retinal findings resolved in 2 to 6 weeks and did not recur. The final visual acuity was 20/20 OU in all patients. Conclusions: Branch retinal arterial occlusions represent a complication of multifocal retinitis and idiopathic optic nerve edema. The arterial occlusions are probably caused by a focus of retinitis. This self-limited disorder has an excellent visual prognosis and may be related to cat-scratch disease.

Most patients (53.9%) maintained good VA (20/25 or better) over the years, and none developed macular edema or neovascularization during follow-up. The retinal hemorrhages fluctuated in severity over time but did not correlate with VA or central subfield thickness.

Conclusions

Branch retinal artery ischemia is defined by a triad of features: retinal arterial plaque, sectoral retinal hemorrhages, and delayed arterial flow. Most patients with BRAI have systemic vascular risk factors but maintain good vision without complications over years.

### Sequential bilateral retinal artery occlusions with promising visual prognosis in a diabetic patient: a case report and literature review [^ba81d63f]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Retinal artery occlusion (RAO) is a rare yet serious ocular disease, encompassing a spectrum of acute retinal vascular disorders, including central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) and branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO). It is characterized by sudden, painless vision loss and often devastating prognosis. The incidence of CRAO is approximately 2.1 per 100,000 people, increasing to up to 12.38 per 100,000 in individuals over 80 years old. BRAO has an incidence of about 4.99 per 100,000 people. Men are more frequently affected than women. Key risk factors include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, cardiogenic embolism, and other cardiovascular risk factors, such as internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, atrial fibrillation, carotid artery dissection, and moyamoya disease. In addition, infective factors can also contribute to the occurrence of CRAO. For example, syphilis has been reported as a potential risk factor. Further research on infectious etiologies in CRAO cases may help in a more comprehensive understanding of the disease. Considering the low incidence of RAO, bilateral RAOs are extremely uncommon. Typically, the natural history of RAO patients' prognosis is poor, with most experiencing permanent vision loss despite various treatment attempts. Conservative treatments are often ineffective compared to intravenous fibrinolysis. However, in this case, our patient occurring both CRAO and BRAO exhibited significant visual recovery following intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy in both eyes.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^2d88e3b7]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions — care management includes age- and presentation-specific directives. "Physicians should first consider GCA in patients 50 years of age or older", and "In cases of GCA, physicians should consider urgent systemic corticosteroid therapy to prevent vision loss in the fellow eye or vascular occlusion elsewhere", while "Patients with diabetes with GCA should be carefully monitored since systemic corticosteroid treatment may destabilize glucose control". Care pathways specify that "Ophthalmologists should refer patients with retinal vascular disease to the appropriate setting, depending on the nature of the retinal occlusion". For emergencies, "Acute, symptomatic OAO, CRAO, and BRAO from embolic etiologies should prompt an immediate referral to the nearest stroke center or emergency department for prompt assessment for consideration of intervention", and for asymptomatic branch occlusion, "When presented with an asymptomatic BRAO, clinicians should conduct a systemic evaluation (careful medical history, assessment for systemic disease), preferably in conjunction with the patient's internist".

### Central retinal artery occlusion: a stroke of the eye [^3ad2adfc]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), like a stroke in the brain, is a critical eye condition that requiring urgent medical attention. Patients with CRAO present with acute loss of vision and the visual prognosis is poor with low chance of spontaneous visual recovery. Moreover, the risk of developing ischaemic heart disease and cerebral stroke is increased due to the presence of underlying atherosclerotic risk factors. Currently, there is no officially recommended treatment for CRAO. This review will describe the anatomy, pathophysiology, clinical features of CRAO, as well as exploring existing and potential future approaches for managing the condition.

### Retinal vein occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^f346215d]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) prognosis — the Branch Vein Occlusion Study (BVOS) Group found a spontaneous improvement in visual acuity by 2 or more lines in 37% of eyes, and only 17% had decreased vision; after 3 years of average follow-up, a mean increase in visual acuity of 2.3 lines occurred in the study, and 34% of eyes attained a visual acuity of 20/40 or better, while 23% of eyes had a visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. The prognosis for vision loss due to BRVO depends on the amount of nonperfusion and the location of the occlusion, and long-standing BRVO is usually characterized by minimal intraretinal blood and resolution of cotton wool spots with mild residual venous tortuosity and collateral vessels adjacent to the affected area; macular edema causes a substantial decrease in vision-related quality of life, and epiretinal membrane often develops in eyes affected by BRVO.

### Sequential bilateral retinal artery occlusions with promising visual prognosis in a diabetic patient: a case report and literature review [^2a06ceb2]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Bilateral retinal artery occlusion (RAO) in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus is an extremely rare condition. Even with rigorous treatment, RAO often results in devastating visual impairment.

Case presentation

A 50-year-old female with Type 2 diabetes mellitus was referred to our hospital. Notably, she developed bilateral RAO sequentially within a mere five-month period. This rapid progression of the disease in both eyes is of particular interest.

Observations

Fundus examination confirmed branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) in her left eye and central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) in her right eye. After timely intra-arterial thrombolysis, significant bilateral visual recovery was achieved. The patient's visual acuity in the left eye improved from 20/400 to 20/100 and in the right eye from 20/2000 to 20/33.3, indicating the effectiveness of this treatment approach in this case. Further examinations also showed positive results: the cherry-red spot in the macula disappeared, FFA indicated improved retinal artery perfusion, and OCT revealed a certain degree of restoration in the retinal structure.

Conclusion

This case highlights that metabolic disorders, like hyperlipidemia and diabetes, can be considered high-risk factors for the development of RAO. Prompt and effective intervention, such as timely intra-arterial thrombolysis, as demonstrated in this case, is crucial for preserving patients' visual prognosis.

### The profile of patients attending to the general emergency department with ocular complaints within the last year: is it a true ocular emergency? [^7d6927f9]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Central retinal artery and branch occlusions are among the most urgent conditions in ophthalmology practice. The incidence is reported tobe 1 in 100,000, and among ophthalmology referrals, it is found to be 1 in 10,000. In our study, central retinal artery occlusion was diagnosed in 3 patients, and central retinal artery branch occlusion was diagnosed in 3 patients. A higher incidence rate than that reported in the literature was observed; this could be attributed to the development of new diagnostic methods, such as optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), fluorescein angiography (FA), and enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT).

Open globe injury is the most common cause of unilateral visual blindness worldwide; its incidence ranges from 2 to 6 cases per 100,000 annually. In this study, the incidence was 10.7 cases per 100,000. Among patients with ophthalmic complaints, the rate was 0.7%. Owing to its poor prognosis, open globe injury is the most common cause of unilateral visual loss worldwide, as observed in our study.

### Clinical characteristics and natural history of branch retinal artery ischemia [^69d69924]. Ophthalmology Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Retinal vascular events present with a myriad of clinical manifestations depending on the location, acuity, and severity of the event. Sudden, total obstruction of retinal arteries causes acute retinal ischemia and leads to branch or central retinal artery occlusion (BRAO or CRAO). These retinal artery occlusions may cause sudden vision loss accompanied by whitened, opacified retinal edema, "boxcarring" of blood vessels, and attenuation of the retinal arteries on fundus examination, with progressive retinal thinning over time. Central retinal artery occlusion is considered to be a stroke equivalent. Although practice patterns vary by geography, thrombolysis may be effective in visual recovery if administered within the stroke window. Risk factors for CRAO and BRAO include factors that contribute to atherosclerosis and elevated intraocular pressure, such as arterial hypertension, ischemic cardiac disease, peripheral artery disease, history of stroke, renal disease, cataract, and glaucoma.

Chronic hypoperfusion of the retina may also occur as a result of carotid artery stenosis, leading to ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS). Ocular ischemic syndrome is characterized by retinal arterial narrowing and mid-peripheral round retinal hemorrhages on fundus examination and delayed arterial filling on fluorescein angiography (FA). The degree of vision loss is variable and typically gradual. Chronic ischemia due to OIS can also result in complications such as retinal neovascularization and neovascular glaucoma, which may result in permanent vision loss or even loss of the eye.

Unlike BRAO or OIS, branch retinal artery ischemia (BRAI) was first described by Yiu and Mukkamala in 2018 as a chronic, sectoral hypoperfusion state caused by a partially occlusive Hollenhorst plaque. This uncommon clinical presentation is characterized by the presence of a retinal arterial plaque accompanied by sectoral round retinal hemorrhages and delayed arterial filling in the vascular distribution distal to the plaque. Unlike OIS, the retinal hemorrhages in BRAI are only present in a sectoral distribution along the affected retinal artery. The hemorrhages are small and round, unlike the flame-shaped hemorrhages that more often occur in retinal vein occlusions (RVOs). In contrast to retinal artery occlusions, there is no retinal whitening or progressive thinning. Similar phenomena such as "partial" or "incomplete" BRAO have been reported, which may lead to paracentral acute middle maculopathy. Here, we performed a cohort study of patients diagnosed with BRAI to better characterize its natural history and conducted a systematic image review of patients diagnosed with related retinal vascular conditions to estimate the prevalence of this clinical entity.

### Do patients with retinal artery occlusion need urgent neurologic evaluation? [^43998814]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe a framework for logical, immediate action to manage patients with retinal artery occlusion.

Design

Literature review and perspective.

Methods

Review of the literature and the author's experience.

Results

Since embolism is the most common factor causing retinal artery occlusion, to manage these patients, immediate evaluation and management of the source of embolism is critical to prevent further episodes.

Conclusions

The logical, immediate action to manage patients with retinal artery occlusion is evaluation of the carotid artery and heart for embolism, fasting lipid levels and a complete blood count, rather than neurological evaluation, unless, of course, there are neurological symptoms.

Carotid disease and retinal artery occlusion — For symptomatic carotid disease with a 50% to 99% carotid artery occlusion, an endarterectomy has demonstrated a better outcome than medical therapy, and for asymptomatic carotid disease with 60% to 99% carotid artery occlusion, revascularization should be considered. In general, initiation or continuation of antiplatelet and statin therapies is appropriate for most affected patients, and treatment for atrial fibrillation should be initiated, while carotid surgery will apply to less than 30% of patients.

### A review of central retinal artery occlusion: clinical presentation and management [^784749a4]. Eye (2013). Low credibility.

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an ophthalmic emergency and the ocular analogue of cerebral stroke. Best evidence reflects that over three-quarters of patients suffer profound acute visual loss with a visual acuity of 20/400 or worse. This results in a reduced functional capacity and quality of life. There is also an increased risk of subsequent cerebral stroke and ischaemic heart disease. There are no current guideline-endorsed therapies, although the use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been investigated in two randomized controlled trials. This review will describe the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and clinical features of CRAO, and discuss current and future treatments, including the use of tPA in further clinical trials.

### Fundus changes in branch retinal arteriolar occlusion [^d0d09b5c]. Retina (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate systematically various fundus changes in branch retinal arteriolar occlusion (BRAO) and their natural history.

Methods

The study comprised a cohort of 123 consecutive patients (135 eyes) with BRAO. Ophthalmic evaluation at initial and follow-up visits included recording visual acuity, visual fields, and detailed anterior segment and fundus examinations, and at initial visit fluorescein fundus angiography.

Results

Probability estimates of retinal infarct still present were 89% 1 week after BRAO onset, 69% after 2 weeks, 67% after 3 weeks, 34% after 1 month, and 13% after 3 months. Optic disk pallor in the involved region developed in 21% within 1 month from onset, in 42% by 2 months, and in 65% by 3 months. Retinal arteriolar attenuation developed in 19% within 1 month from onset, and in 28% by 6 months. Arteriolar sheathing developed in 19% within 1 month and 25% within 12 months. Arteriolar emboli were found in 58%; 65% of those were at initial visit, in BRAO seen within 1 week of onset.

Conclusion

Most common cause of BRAO is embolism from the heart or carotid arteries; emboli usually get impacted at the arteriolar bifurcation. Migration and disappearance of retinal emboli is a common finding. Evolution of the retinal and optic disk changes is described.

### Management of acute retinal ischemia: follow the guidelines! [^5860354f]. Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Acute retinal arterial ischemia, including vascular transient monocular vision loss (TMVL) and branch (BRAO) and central retinal arterial occlusions (CRAO), are ocular and systemic emergencies requiring immediate diagnosis and treatment. Guidelines recommend the combination of urgent brain magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted imaging, vascular imaging, and clinical assessment to identify TMVL, BRAO, and CRAO patients at highest risk for recurrent stroke, facilitating early preventive treatments to reduce the risk of subsequent stroke and cardiovascular events. Because the risk of stroke is maximum within the first few days after the onset of visual loss, prompt diagnosis and triage are mandatory. Eye care professionals must make a rapid and accurate diagnosis and recognize the need for timely expert intervention by immediately referring patients with acute retinal arterial ischemia to specialized stroke centers without attempting to perform any further testing themselves. The development of local networks prompting collaboration among optometrists, ophthalmologists, and stroke neurologists should facilitate such evaluations, whether in a rapid-access transient ischemic attack clinic, in an emergency department-observation unit, or with hospitalization, depending on local resources.

### Detection of underdiagnosed concurrent branch retinal artery occlusion in a patient with central retinal vein occlusion using spectral domain optical coherence tomography [^2bd0c5c4]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Combined unilateral simultaneous CRVO and BRAO is a rare condition, which if incomplete, has been proposed to be deemed as one entity. In patients with a combined concurrent CRVO and BRAO, an embolic compound has not been found, suggestive of the secondary nature of BRAO due to compression of the artery because of the obviously swollen optic nerve and/or central retinal vein resulting from CRVO. This is the main distinction from an isolated BRAO, which often is caused by embolic events. The patients with combined BRAO and incomplete CRVO have better visual outcomes than do those suffering from other types of combination retinal artery and vein occlusions, and almost 80% of the patients recover final visual acuity greater than 0.50, as occurred in our case.

In our case, we performed the assisting diagnostic procedure with SD-OCT in addition to FA, in order to establish the final diagnosis of combined unilateral CRVO and BRAO. This approach is optimal for patients with a questionable diagnosis of combined unilateral CRVO and BRAO. SD-OCT has quite recently been introduced to the medical world and has revolutionized the ocular imaging service. It is a cutting-edge technique using a significantly faster, non-mechanical technology providing non-invasive acquisition of detailed; i.e. up to 5 microns resolution, in-vivo histological changes in the retina.

These anatomical changes are the result of the denaturation of intracellular proteins, with the accumulation of intracellular fluid and consequent cellular necrosis. We propose that the name 'retinal edema' should not be used for this clinical condition, as the extravascular fluid is found in the intracellular space, and we suggest that the term 'acute ischemic retinopathy' is more appropriate.

Preservation of the integrity of the IS-OS line and the external limiting membrane has been reported to have prognostic value in cystoid macular edema due to vascular occlusions. Presence of an intact IS-OS line at the fovea in our patient suggested the preservation of structural integrity of the photoreceptor layer at the fovea, contributing to the recovery of relatively good visual acuity.

Throughout the follow-up visits, atrophy of the superior retina was observed.

### Ocular associations of diabetes other than diabetic retinopathy [^f49fa5c1]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

3. Retinal artery occlusion

Retinal artery occlusion (RAO) is a retinal vascular condition similar to emboli. The hallmark of RAO is sudden, unilateral, painless loss of vision associated with a visual field defect. Patients with central RAO usually present with a dramatic loss of vision, an afferent pupillary defect, diffuse retinal whitening, and the resultant classic "cherry spot" on the macula. The fundoscopic findings with branch RAO, which occur at a branch, usually consist of a focal wedge-shaped area of retinal whitening; vision loss also tends to be much milder. As for emboli, there is no clear evidence that patients with diabetes are at higher risk of RAO. However, the prevalence of diabetes among patients with RAO has been reported to be as high as 21%, which is higher than in the general population of the same age.

Patients with RAO should be referred immediately to an ophthalmologist for management. In the acute phase (within 24 h), a variety of treatments have been proposed, such as ocular massage (to dislodge the embolus) and intravenous acetazolamide injection (to lower intraocular pressure). However, there is no evidence from randomized trials regarding the efficacy of these treatments. It is important for physicians to measure the erythrocyte sedimentation rate to exclude giant cell arteritis. Regardless of treatment, however, the vision prognosis of central RAO is poor.

### Ischemic injury of the papillomacular bundle is a predictive marker of poor vision in eyes with branch retinal artery occlusion [^8aafe9a8]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To propose a novel prognostic feature of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) in macula-involving branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO).

Design

Retrospective comparative case study.

Methods

We analyzed 66 eyes diagnosed with acute BRAO involving the macula from our hospital RAO registry. At presentation, a detailed ophthalmic and medical history was obtained from all patients, and all underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation, which included visual acuity examination, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and SDOCT. This evaluation was performed at each follow-up visit.

Results

The 66 eyes diagnosed with acute BRAO involving the macula were divided into 2 groups according to initial vision: Good Vision (≥ 20/40, 29 eyes, 44%) and Poor Vision (< 20/40, 37 eyes, 56%). The Poor Vision group was further divided into Improvement (18 eyes, 27%) and Nonimprovement (19 eyes, 28%) groups, according to visual recovery at the final examination. Among multiple OCT parameters, the involvement of papillomacular bundle, but not that of the central fovea, was consistently observed in the Poor Vision group (P < .001) and more significantly in the Nonimprovement group (P < .001). Papillomacular bundle involvement features included signs of inner retinal ischemia, including inner retinal thickening, inner retinal hyperreflectivity, and loss of layer-by-layer integrity. Loss of layer-by-layer integrity was seen consistently in the Nonimprovement group. Quantitative analysis of inner retinal thickness also supported this association.

Conclusion

In eyes with macula-involving BRAO, ischemic injury of the papillomacular bundle at the acute stage, as seen on OCT, correlates closely with poor vision and can explain the poor visual prognosis.

### Risk of stroke in patients with ocular arterial occlusive disorders: a retrospective Canadian study [^36ee2562]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The primary outcome for this study was 3‐year stroke risk after initial diagnosis of monocular vision loss. The focus was on patients with no previous stroke history, because there is a paucity of data for this specific subgroup. Extensive research has established guidelines for the management of patients with a newly diagnosed stroke. 1 So, those with a history of stroke presenting with a new diagnosis of monocular vision loss will have already been managed by a stroke specialist with regard to risk‐modification strategies. The question addressed by this study is whether patients with CRAO, BRAO, or OIS in the absence of previous stroke warrant urgent stroke assessment. Interestingly, we found that only 4.8% of CRAO patients without previous stroke or transient ischemic attack developed a stroke during the follow‐up period, whereas 12.9% of stroke‐free BRAO patients subsequently had a stroke. Yet, almost one third of CRAO patients had a history of stroke compared with a much smaller 11.4% for BRAO patients. Stroke prevalence at any time (up to 3 years after retinal ischemia diagnosis) was 35.5% and 22.9% for CRAO and BRAO, respectively. This suggests that, overall, CRAO has a higher association with stroke than does BRAO, with stroke generally presenting earlier in CRAO patients than in BRAO. This may be indicative of both the vascular anatomy and thromboembolic burden for these patients. Branch retinal arteries are, by definition, smaller in caliber than the more‐proximal central retinal artery, implying that a larger embolism would be required to occlude the central retinal artery than for a branch retinal artery. A similar principle applies to the brain, with smaller arteries supplying smaller territories than larger arteries. Probabilistically speaking, it is more likely for a large embolism to lead to a symptomatic stroke than a smaller embolism. Assuming no difference in the number of thromboembolic events between these groups, it would potentially be more likely for these events in BRAO patients to be asymptomatic. This hypothesis is supported by 2 studies investigating the prevalence of infarctions on MRI in nonarteritic retinal artery occlusions. Both studies reported ≈25% of CRAO and BRAO patients having acute infarcts on diffusion‐weighted imaging, with most patients having multiple infarcts (as many as 84). 5, 6 Therefore, there is good evidence to suggest that CRAO and BRAO patients are subject to many thromboembolic events, with many of them being clinically silent.

### Evaluation of retinal arterial occlusion and its visual and systemic prognosis after hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^9d0ddb0a]. Retina (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the systemic and ocular outcomes of patients with branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) and central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) after hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT).

Methods

This is a single-institution study of 75 subjects diagnosed with BRAO (28, 37.3%) and CRAO (47, 62.7%) who visited the emergency department or stroke clinic. Twenty-seven (36%) subjects received HBOT on initial presentation (BRAO-14.3%, CRAO-48.9%). The primary outcome was the best corrective visual acuity (BCVA) change in non-HBOT and HBOT subjects. Secondary outcomes included subsequent development of an acute cerebrovascular accident (CVA)/stroke or neovascular glaucoma (NVG).

Results

Overall BCVA did not change from the initial presentation to the final timepoint (logMAR 1.5) in either the conservative management or HBOT cohorts for either BRAO subjects (non-HBOT-logMAR 0.4 vs. 0.6, p = 0.658; HBOT-logMAR 0.1 vs. 0.4, p = 0.207) or CRAO subjects (non-HBOT-logMAR 2.1 vs. 2.2, p = 0.755; HBOT-logMAR 2.1 vs. 2.0, p = 0.631). Seven (9.3%) subjects developed CVA (BRAO: non-HBOT-4.2% and HBOT-25.0%, p = 0.207; CRAO: non-HBOT-16.7% and HBOT-4.3%, p = 0.348) and five subjects (6.7%) developed NVG (BRAO: non-HBOT-4.2% and HBOT-0%, p = 1.00; CRAO: non-HBOT-16.7% and HBOT-0%, p = 0.109).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that HBOT does not significantly improve BCVA or mitigate the subsequent development of stroke and NVG in patients with RAOs.

### Efficacy and safety of hyperbaric oxygen therapy monitored by fluorescein angiography in patients with retinal artery occlusion [^c46553f5]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Retinal artery occlusion (RAO) is a rare but extremely severe ophthalmic disease characterised by sudden, unilateral, painless visual and/or visual field loss. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) is often dramatically decreased.

Depending on the blockade location, RAO is called central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) or cilioretinal artery occlusion. In about 25% of cases, a cilioretinal artery arises from the ciliary arteries and allows vascularisation of part of the macula.

Although revascularisation usually occurs spontaneously a few weeks after RAO, the visual prognosis remains poor, which is explained by the terminal and non-anastomotic retinal vasculature and the duration of the occlusion. In their study, Hayreh et al showed irreversible retinal damages in CRAO after 240 min of occlusion, but a large number of studies suggest that visual improvement in humans still possible after much longer periods, raising the question of interindividual variability.

### Clinical characteristics and natural history of branch retinal artery ischemia [^795253d9]. Ophthalmology Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Unlike BRAO, 16% of patients with OIS develop ocular neovascularization, with 64% developing neovascularization of the iris and 71% developing neovascularization of the angle within a mean time to diagnosis of neovascularization of 82 days (range 22–268 days). Ocular neovascularization may lead to permanent vision loss and requires treatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF injections, pan-retinal photocoagulation, or other surgical interventions. No patients with BRAI developed ocular neovascularization during our study period.

Most retinal arterial plaques in BRAI cases occurred in first-order arteries, which is expected as smaller arterioles are more likely to become fully occluded, although the factors that may predispose an embolus to become partially obstructed in BRAI or fully occlusive to cause BRAO are not clear. No patients with BRAI went on to develop additional vascular occlusive events such as BRAO, branch RVO, CRAO, or ischemic stroke within the cumulative 34.7 person-years of follow-up in our study. In contrast, the 3-year stroke incidence is 36% after CRAO and 30% after BRAO. Nonetheless, the prevalence of pre-existing vascular and atherosclerotic disease in patients with BRAI was high. Therefore, an isolated finding of BRAI features in a patient without known vascular risk factors should prompt referral for evaluation of vascular, cardiac, and renal diseases.

Retinal artery occlusions (RAO) management — emergent evaluation and stroke pathway: Acute, symptomatic, posterior segment arterial occlusions represent an emergent ophthalmic condition and require prompt evaluation. The rate of silent cerebral ischemia in RAO is the same as in hemispheric TIA, and the recommendation from multiple clinical trials is that a TIA be worked up as stroke in the acute phase. Given the expected similarity of pathogenesis, patients with RAO should be considered in the same way. Immediate referral to an emergency department affiliated with a stroke center for a medical evaluation is advised. If a stroke center is not available, an emergency department is the next option.

Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions — disease definition and epidemiology — define entities and causes: an ophthalmic artery occlusion (OAO) is "a partial or complete obstruction of the ophthalmic artery", a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is "a partial or complete obstruction of the central retinal artery", and a branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) is "a partial or complete obstruction of any of the branch tributaries of the central retinal artery". Arteritic retinal arterial occlusion is "caused by giant cell arteritis (GCA), whereas most nonarteritic RAOs are embolic in origin". CRAO incidence is reported as "approximately 1.33 per 100,000" in Olmsted County and "1.8 per 100,000 person-years" in a Korean population "over age 65", with U.S. mean presentation "in the early 60s"; CRAO "commonly leads to retinal ischemia and subsequent retinal cell death".

### Comorbidity in patients with branch retinal vein occlusion: case-control study [^e96d6adb]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate comorbidity before and after the diagnosis of branch retinal vein occlusion to determine whether it is a consequence of arterial thickening and therefore could serve as a diagnostic marker for other comorbidities and to evaluate the risk factors for the development of such occlusion.

Case-control study with prospective follow-up data from Danish national registries.

Setting

Four secondary referral centres covering about 80% of the Danish population (4.4 million).

Participants

1168 patients with photographically verified branch retinal vein occlusion and 116,800 controls alive and aged ≥ 40 when the occlusion was diagnosed in the corresponding case.

Main Outcome Measures

The risk of comorbidity 10 years and 1 year before the diagnosis of branch retinal vein occlusion and the incident comorbidity in a mean period of seven years after the diagnosis, with odds ratios and incidence rate ratios adjusted for age, sex, and year of diagnosis.

Results

Risk factors present 10 years and 1 year before the diagnosis of branch retinal vein occlusion included peripheral artery disease (odds ratio 1.83, 95% confidence interval 1.14 to 2.95), diabetes (1.74, 1.40 to 2.17) and arterial hypertension (2.16, 1.86 to 2.51). After the diagnosis, patients had an increased risk of developing arterial hypertension (incidence rate ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.57), diabetes (1.51, 1.17 to 2.04), congestive heart failure (1.41, 1.12 to 1.68), and cerebrovascular disease (1.49, 1.27 to 1.76).

Conclusion

Diabetes, hypertension, and peripheral artery disease are associated with an increased risk of developing branch retinal vein occlusion up to a decade later. Branch retinal vein occlusion was associated with an increased risk of subsequently developing hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and cerebrovascular disease, emphasising the importance of preventive initiatives. These results fit the assumption that branch retinal vein occlusion is a consequence of arterial thickening and that the arteriovenous crossing signs that precede it are hallmarks of arterial disease.

### Iatrogenic occlusion of the ophthalmic artery… [^981ba3d4]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

D, Electroretinography shows markedly reduced cone and rod responses. E, Multifocal acute infarction in the left middle cerebral artery territories on diffusion-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging. F, Three months later, a retinal fibrous scar associated with optic atrophy was observed. The initial and final visual acuity in the left eye was no light perception. Main Outcomes and Measures Visual prognosis and its relationship to angiographic findings and injected filler material. Results Ophthalmic artery occlusion was classified into 6 types according to angiographic findings. Twenty-eight patients had diffuse retinal and choroidal artery occlusions. Sixteen patients had localized occlusions.

Six patients also had corresponding neurologic symptoms, including contralateral hemiplegia and dysarthria. Visual prognosis was poor, with 27 patients having a final visual acuity of NLP. In 21 patients with at least 6 follow-up months, iris atrophy, strabismus, and skin lesions persisted until the last follow-up visit. One patient progressed to phthisis bulbi. Visual prognosis was poor. The BCVA after a mean follow-up period of 14. 4 months was NLP in all patients. Most OAO cases had received autologous fat injections and had high amounts of ocular pain and ophthalmoplegia or strabismus. The 10 patients with branch retinal artery occlusion had localized retinal edema in the involved arterial domain.

Visual acuity was good in most cases, and 5 patients reported only a visual field defect. Fewer cases had received autologous fat filler than in the diffuse occlusion group. Visual prognosis was also poor in the diffuse occlusion group, with a worse initial and final BCVA, as well as a worse visual gain.

### Retrospective study of threshold time for the conventional treatment of branch retinal artery occlusion [^6f8c769f]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Visual outcome after BRAO was relatively favorable. Several authors reported that 80% of BRAO patients could retain final VA over 20/40 without any aggressive treatment. In our study, most patients received some conventional therapy, although hemi-CRAO and CLRAO patients were also included. Nevertheless, 74% of the patients retained final BCVA over 20/40. We evaluated the relationship between favorable final BCVA to occlusion type, finding no differences between occlusion types (BRAO in the narrow sense, hemi-CRAO, and CLRAO) in relation to BCVA. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and infarction diseases are well-known risk factors for BRAO. However, there were apparently no reports about the relationships between systemic medical conditions and VA in patients with BRAO.

In our study, many patients had past histories of systemic diseases, and an important finding was that hyperlipidemia was related to a poor prognosis of VA. The mechanisms of BRAO are of two types; namely, embolic occlusion and vasospasm. Hyperlipidemia patients have plaque in their blood vessels, which can more easily lead to more severe embolic occlusion than cases of vasospasm.

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^14bcaf43]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Acute retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions — acute, symptomatic ophthalmic artery occlusion (OAO), central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), and branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) are medical emergencies and require prompt evaluation. Growing evidence recommends that acute RAO (symptoms within 24 hours) be treated as a medical emergency and be referred immediately to an emergency department or stroke center facility for neurological evaluation due to the increased risk of central nervous system stroke. Following a CRAO, the risk of ischemic stroke is highest during the first 1 to 4 weeks, ranging from 3% to 6%, and up to 24% of patients with RAO have concurrent cerebrovascular accidents on diffusion-weighted MRI. In one study of 112 consecutive acute RAO patients evaluated within 24 hours, the majority (77/112) had CRAO or BRAO confirmed by exam, and silent brain infarction was present in 19% of CRAO and 25% of BRAO cases. Patients with symptomatic RAO have the highest risk of stroke during the 2 weeks before and 1 month after the occlusion, and current evidence for effective interventional ocular treatment, other than corticosteroids for GCA, is controversial and limited to level II data.

### The association of stroke with central and branch retinal arterial occlusion [^5422c0b3]. Eye (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the near-term risk of stroke following a retinal artery occlusion (RAO).

Methods

The risk of stroke was assessed in two manners; with a self-controlled case series (SCCS) and a propensity score (PS) matched cohort study using a US medical claims database. The date of RAO diagnosis was assigned as the index date. In the SCCS, incidence of stroke was compared in 30- and 7-day periods pre- and post-index date. In PS analysis, matched cohorts were created from patients with RAO or hip fracture. Cox proportional hazard regression assessed the hazard for stroke. Patients were censored at 1 year, upon leaving the insurance plan or if they had a qualifying event for the comparison group.

Results

The SCCS included 16,193 patients with RAO. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of new stroke in the month after RAO was increased compared to all periods > 2 months before and all months after the index date (IRRs: 1.68–6.40, p < 0.012). Risk was increased in the week immediately following the index date compared to most weeks starting 2 weeks prior to and all weeks immediately after the index date (IRRs: 1.93–29.00, p < 0.026). The PS study analysed 18,213 propensity-matched patients with RAO vs. hip fracture. The HR for having a stroke after RAO compared to a hip fracture was elevated in all analyses (All RAO HR: 2.97, 95% CI: 2.71–3.26, p < 0.001; CRAO HR: 3.24, 95% CI: 2.83–3.70, p < 0.001; BRAO HR: 2.76, 95% CI: 2.43–3.13, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The highest risk for stroke occurs in the days following a CRAO or BRAO, supporting guidelines suggesting immediate referral to a stroke centre upon diagnosis.

### Clinical characteristics and natural history of branch retinal artery ischemia [^76f56e34]. Ophthalmology Science (2025). Medium credibility.

We hypothesize that a similar type of chronic hypoperfusion and ischemia occurs due to central retinal artery stenosis. Some patients with OIS features have no identifiable carotid or ophthalmic artery stenosis, which may be caused by a partial occlusion of the central retinal artery leading to chronic ischemia and the OIS phenotype on fundus examination. This, along with BRAI and OIS, may represent a spectrum of retinal vascular disease due to partial obstruction and chronic hypoperfusion of the carotid, ophthalmic, central, and branch retinal arteries.

The limitations of this study include its retrospective nature, small cohort size, and lack of long-term longitudinal follow-up with serial imaging and examinations for all patients. Greater awareness is necessary to identify more patients to more fully characterize the natural history and comorbidities associated with BRAI. Based on our careful review of images from patients previously diagnosed with BRAO, OIS, or Hollenhorst plaques, we estimated that the prevalence of BRAI is between 7.6% and 9.1% in patients with these conditions, although the actual prevalence may be higher as not all patients had all available imaging modalities available for review. Also, because all patients are from US regions, its generalizability to other populations outside the United States is unknown.

In conclusion, BRAI is a chronic sectoral retinal arterial hypoperfusion state that is comprised of a triad of clinical findings: (1) retinal arterial plaque, (2) sectoral retinal hemorrhages, and (3) delayed arterial filling on FA. Most patients with BRAI are asymptomatic and maintain good VA over years without developing neovascularization, macular edema, or additional vaso-occlusive events such as ischemic stroke, although a majority of patients with BRAI have multiple pre-existing vascular risk factors. The presence of sectoral hemorrhages on fundus examination should prompt close evaluation for a retinal arterial plaque and consideration of BRAI as a diagnosis.

### Retinal vein occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^fcd3bc66]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal vein occlusions (RVOs) preferred practice pattern — highlighted findings and care recommendations state that prognosis varies by occlusion site and type, and that in general "more-distal RVOs with less occlusion have a better prognosis than more-proximal RVOs with greater ischemia". Central retinal vein occlusions (CRVOs) and hemi-CRVOs "have clinically similar courses", are "associated with glaucoma" and "have a higher risk of anterior segment neovascularization and neovascular glaucoma than branch retinal vein occlusion has", and "It is important to control intraocular pressure (IOP) for glaucoma management in conjunction with the ophthalmologist's care process for the patient's glaucoma condition". "Macular edema may complicate both CRVOs and branch retinal vein occlusions (BRVOs)". For associated macular edema, "The first line of treatment… is intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents (anti- VEGFs)", while "Intravitreal corticosteroids have demonstrated efficacy but have the associated risks of glaucoma and cataract formation", and "Laser photocoagulation surgery is sometimes used in BRVO". Regarding biologics, "The choice of biologic product — reference, biosimilar, or interchangeable — should be that of the treating ophthalmologist and the patient because the patient may respond more favorably to one biologic over another". Systemic management emphasizes that "it is important to control systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes, and serum lipid levels", and "Patients with any RVO have an increased risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality".

### Retinal vascular occlusions [^f4a6c57d]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Acute retinal vascular occlusions are common causes of visual impairment. Although both retinal artery occlusions and retinal vein occlusions are associated with increased age and cardiovascular risk factors, their pathophysiology, systemic implications, and management differ substantially. Acute management of retinal artery occlusions involves a multidisciplinary approach including neurologists with stroke expertise, whereas treatment of retinal vein occlusions is provided by ophthalmologists. Optimisation of systemic risk factors by patients' primary care providers is an important component of the management of these two disorders.

### Sequential bilateral retinal artery occlusion [^63879eff]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

An 86 year old woman experienced a sequential bilateral loss of vision over a period of less than 24 hours. Clinical findings and complementary studies suggested a bilateral atherogenic embolic event. Initially, she presented a superior branch retinal artery occlusion in her right eye followed by a central retinal artery occlusion with cilioretinal artery sparing in her left eye. Some conservative maneuvers performed did not improve visual acuity in the left eye. Supra-aortic Doppler ultrasonography revealed mild right internal carotid artery stenosis and moderate left internal carotid artery stenosis with a small, smooth, and homogeneous plaque. The transthoracic echocardiography showed a severe calcification of the mitral valve with a mild-moderate rim of stenosis. Central retinal artery occlusion and branch retinal artery occlusion are characterized by painless monocular loss of vision. Clinical approach and management attempt to treat the acute event, find the source of the vascular occlusion, and prevent further vascular events from occurring. Giant cell arteritis is a potentially treatable cause of central retinal artery occlusion and should be excluded in every single patient over 50 years old.

Natural History of BRAI

Over a median follow-up duration of 1.7 years (range: 0.1–6.3 years), eyes with BRAI maintained stable vision without treatment, with a mean VA of logMAR 0.19 ± 0.15 (Snellen equivalent 20/31) at year 1, logMAR 0.2 ± 0.21 (Snellen equivalent 20/32) at year 2, and logMAR 0.27 ± 0.22 (Snellen equivalent 20/37) at year 3 (Fig 2 A). Eight of the 9 patients who had ≥ 1 years of follow-up maintained stable VA during the follow-up period (Fig 2 A). Only 1 patient developed vision loss at year 3, from VA 20/40 to 20/80, presumably due to retinal atrophy from previously treated macular edema that was not attributed to the BRAI by the retinal provider. Central subfield thickness as measured on OCT remained stable for most patients, except for patient 5, who had an epiretinal membrane without macular edema at presentation and later underwent pars plana vitrectomy with membrane peeling at year 3 (Fig 2 B).

Figure 2
Natural history of BRAI. Line plots showing (A) best-recorded VA change (logMAR [Snellen]) and (B) CST measurements at yearly visits of patients with BRAI with ≥ 1 years of follow-up. BCVA = best-corrected visual acuity; BRAI = branch retinal artery ischemia; CST = central subfield thickness; logMAR = logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution; VA = visual acuity.

Longitudinal review of fundus images showed that the retinal hemorrhages fluctuate in severity over years, occasionally increasing or decreasing in number and size (Fig 3). However, all of the retinal arterial plaques observed in our study remained in their location at the time of diagnosis and did not move further downstream nor resolve during follow-up. Due to inconsistent availability of general health records, it was difficult to determine if these fluctuations may have been associated with blood pressure control or cardiovascular status. Patients who developed decreased vision during the follow-up period did not show any apparent association with the hemorrhage severity. None of the patients developed other retinal occlusive events such as BRAO, branch RVO, CRAO, or ischemic stroke during the follow-up period.

### Sequential bilateral retinal artery occlusions with promising visual prognosis in a diabetic patient: a case report and literature review [^1d075b55]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this case report, we presented a female diabetic patient in her early fifties who sequentially developed bilateral RAO, and timely application of intra-arterial thrombolysis yielded a favorable vision prognosis in both eyes. There have been a few case reports of bilateral RAO in patients with autoimmune diseases, coagulopathic diseases, virus infection, drug injection, neuro- and cardio- vascular diseases and other ocular diseases, which are summarized in Table 1. However, diabetes, which is known to predispose patients to vascular complications, rarely manifests as such severe and bilateral retinal events. The simultaneous involvement of both eyes underscores the necessity for heightened clinical vigilance and comprehensive vascular management in diabetic patients.

### Management of central retinal artery occlusion: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^30bda707]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a form of acute ischemic stroke that causes severe visual loss and is a harbinger of further cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events. There is a paucity of scientific information on the appropriate management of CRAO, with most strategies based on observational literature and expert opinion. In this scientific statement, we critically appraise the literature on CRAO and provide a framework within which to consider acute treatment and secondary prevention.

Methods

We performed a literature review of randomized controlled clinical trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, case reports, clinical guidelines, review articles, basic science articles, and editorials concerning the management of CRAO. We assembled a panel comprising experts in the fields of vascular neurology, neuro-ophthalmology, vitreo-retinal surgery, immunology, endovascular neurosurgery, and cardiology, and document sections were divided among the writing group members. Each member received an assignment to perform a literature review, synthesize the data, and offer considerations for practice. Multiple drafts were circulated among the group until consensus was achieved.

Results

Acute CRAO is a medical emergency. Systems of care should evolve to prioritize early recognition and triage of CRAO to emergency medical attention. There is considerable variability in management patterns among practitioners, institutions, and subspecialty groups. The current literature suggests that treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator may be effective. Patients should undergo urgent screening and treatment of vascular risk factors. There is a need for high-quality, randomized clinical trials in this field.

### Ocular neovascularization in eyes with a central retinal artery occlusion or a branch retinal artery occlusion [^c8ca68a7]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

ONV is an important and common complication of eyes with a CRAO. This is especially true for patients with DM2, which was found to be highly associated with ONV in eyes with a CRAO. Furthermore, BRAO-induced ONVs in the form of NVI are much less common than in CRAOs. Due to the threat of further visual loss from NVG, we recommend continued careful observation, at least in the early follow-up period (0 to 6 months), for the development of ONV in eyes with retinal artery occlusions, particularly in DM2 patients with a CRAO.

### Sequential bilateral retinal artery occlusion [^28c23329]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Sequential nonarteritic RAO occurring within a 24 hour period is an extremely rare condition. CRAO has a poor prognosis for spontaneous recovery of vision. Efforts to restore vision should begin emergently. Unfortunately, none of the proposed treatments has so far stood the test of time, in spite of enthusiastic claims. A beneficial effect is possible in acute RAO disorder if some of the aforementioned treatments are started aggressively much less than 4 hours from the onset. Prospective and randomized studies with an appropriate methodology are necessary in order to get conclusions concerning the efficacy of the different therapeutic options.

There are various types of acute RAO disorders. Understanding these classifications and pathogeneses is essential for full comprehension of the various aspects of these entities and their management. Since we now understand their pathogeneses, we should be better able to explore the management of the different clinical disorders individually rather than lumping diverse conditions into one group.

In persons aged 50 years and older, it is essential to rule out giant cell arteritis immediately, and if there is any suspicion of that, the patient should be immediately started on high-dose steroid therapy to prevent catastrophic visual loss. Diagnostic workup in CRAO and BRAO focuses on identifying the underlying etiology, in order to institute appropriate secondary prevention measures to reduce the risk of future vascular events.

### Branch retinal artery occlusion following radiation therapy to the head and neck: a case report [^c102ffbf]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies have established that radiation to the head and neck leads to atherosclerosis and stenosis of the carotid artery and subsequent increased stroke risk, but the ophthalmic sequella following cervical irradiation is less well-defined.

Case Presentation

We present a single case of branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) in a 55 year-old Caucasian male seen at the University of Michigan in 2008 following unilateral head and neck radiation.

Conclusion

This case demonstrates that patients receiving radiation to the head and neck may be at increased risk for developing a BRAO secondary to atherosclerotic changes of vessels adjacent to the radiation target. Given this risk, it may be reasonable to obtain carotid artery imaging in patients with a history of cervical radiation who present with sudden or transient visual field defects, even in the absence of other conventional risk factors for atherosclerosis.

### The fate of patients with retinal artery occlusion and hollenhorst plaque [^35193230]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Ocular symptoms and signs often herald hemispheric neurological events associated with extracranial cerebrovascular disease. However, the presence of a Hollenhorst plaque (HP) or retinal artery occlusion (RAO) and the risk of stroke is unclear. The purpose of this study was to review the outcomes of all patients who presented with a HP or RAO at a single institution.

Methods

Between 2000 and 2005, the management and outcome of 130 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of HP, central RAO, or branch RAO (ICD-9 codes 362.30 to 362.33) were reviewed. Patients with transient monocular visual loss (amaurosis fugax), retinal venous occlusion, and other ocular pathologies were excluded. Electronic and hardcopy medical records were reviewed for demographic data, clinical variables, radiological, and noninvasive vascular lab testing. Duplex and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the carotid arteries were reviewed to confirm the presence of a lesion and quantify the degree of stenosis.

Results

During the study interval, 70 males and 60 females, with a mean age of 68 ± 16 (± SD) years underwent ophthalmologic evaluation. Symptoms were present in 61% of patients and included eye pain, blurred vision, or atypical visual symptoms, while 39% were asymptomatic. Atherosclerotic risk factors in this population included the presence of hypertension (73%), diabetes (33%), hyperlipidemia (75%), and tobacco use (38%). A majority of patients underwent carotid interrogation via Duplex imaging (68%). Carotid bifurcation stenoses ipsilateral to the ocular findings were < 30% in 68% of the patients, between 30 and 60% in 22% and > 60% in only 8% of patients. Six patients with lesions greater than 60% went on to have either a carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting. Follow-up data on this group ranged from 1 to 49 months (median, 22 months), with no stroke or transient ischemic attack identified. There were five deaths during follow-up; none related to stroke. Serial carotid Duplex examinations failed to identify progression of carotid stenoses in this group of patients. Overall survival was 94% at 36 months for this cohort.

Conclusion

The presence of a HP or RAO is associated with a low prevalence of extracranial cerebrovascular disease that requires intervention. Furthermore, in contradistinction to amaurosis fugax, these ocular findings are not associated with a high risk for hemispheric neurological events.

Results

Clinical Characteristics of BRAI

Of the 13 patients who met the definition of BRAI, the mean age was 74.2 ± 9.4 years, and 61.5% were males. Most cases of BRAI were diagnosed incidentally on follow-up for comorbid ocular conditions (61.5%) or as incidental findings on routine eye examinations (38.5%). Most of the patients had a history of hypertension (76.9%), hyperlipidemia (84.6%), carotid artery disease (69.2%), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (69.2%) at the time of diagnosis. Among the patients with carotid artery disease and ultrasound imaging, a majority had bilateral disease (77.8%) or a diseased carotid ipsilateral to the BRAI eye (22.2%; Table S2, available at). Patient 8 did not have ultrasound imaging available for review but had documentation of a prior left carotid endarterectomy. None of the patients had a prior history of amaurosis fugax and reported such symptoms during follow-up. Some had a history of prior stroke (30.8%) or were current or former tobacco users (46.2%). A proportion of patients had a history of mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy without macular edema (38.5%), presence of epiretinal membrane (30.8%), or glaucoma or ocular hypertension (23.1%). Most patients (84.6%) were asymptomatic at presentation (Table 1). Mean baseline VA was logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) 0.15 ± 0.21 (Snellen equivalent 20/29), with more than half of patients (53.9%) having Snellen VA of 20/25 or better at presentation (Table 1). Notable exceptions include patient 9, who had a presenting VA of 20/50 that was likely caused by punctate epithelial erosions and dry eye syndrome with a baseline VA of 20/40 before the appearance of a Hollenhorst plaque, and patient 12, who had a presenting VA of 20/80 that was attributed to long-standing macular edema of unclear etiology that resolved before presentation (Table 1). Most patients did not undergo visual field testing, and only patients 2 and 5 underwent automated Humphrey visual field testing for glaucoma monitoring, which were both reliable with nonspecific defects correlating to the distribution of the BRAI.

### Branch artery occlusion… [^594543cb]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- A case of retinal branch artery occlusion was caused by migration of emboli, presumably via collateral circulation, during therapeutic embolization of the maxillary artery. Migration of particles to the ophthalmic circulation is unusual with embolization of the branches of the external carotid artery. Meticulous technique, careful angiographic monitoring, and proper selection of embolic material may reduce, but not eliminate, migration of emboli to undesirable locations. Therapeutic embolization of vascular tumors and malformations in the external carotid territory is a recent radiologic innovation that is becoming increasingly popular. Therefore, we may expect to see more ocular complications from aberrant emboli as the use of this technique becomes more widespread. Soong HK, Newman SA, Kumar AAJ.

### RETINAL ARTERIAL MACROANEURYSM COMBINED WITH BRANCH RETINAL ARTERY OCCLUSION: literature review [^77d33a9e]. Retina (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To summarize the causes of retinal arterial microaneurysm combined with branch retinal artery occlusion.

Methods

The case reports of retinal arterial microaneurysm combined with branch retinal artery occlusion were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI databases before May 1, 2024. A total of nine participants from nine case reports were included to analyze factors leading to complications.

Results

The reasons for this complication are as follows: complications during photocoagulation therapy. Intraretinal hemorrhage and exudation result in compression of adjacent or distal arteries, resulting in branch retinal artery occlusion. Embolus dislodgement or intraarterial embolus formation can block the artery, damage the wall, and provide conditions for the development of retinal arterial microaneurysm. In addition, it is necessary to be alert to the optic disk macroaneurysm, if hemorrhage or embolus formation in the macroaneurysm will affect the blood supply of the downstream artery, affecting a large range of the retina.

Conclusion

Based on the review of case reports, we found that retinal arterial microaneurysm and branch retinal artery occlusion can cause each other. Acute vision loss can result when a complication occurs. In addition, retinal vascular diseases can reflect the whole body, suggesting that ophthalmologists need to pay attention not only to the patient's fundus but also to the patient's systemic diseases.

Follow-up evaluation for retinal artery occlusions — The follow-up evaluation includes a history and examination, and a follow-up history should include changes in symptoms (e.g., change in vision, visual field loss, pain, focal neurological symptoms) and systemic condition (e.g., elevated blood pressure, systemic arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia/diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea).

Prevention and early detection in branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and RVO — there is a strong relationship between BRVO and systemic vascular disorders such as arterial hypertension and peripheral vascular disease, and older age and systemic vascular disorders are the strongest risk factors for RVO. A meta-analysis suggests that 48% of RVO is attributable to hypertension, 20% to hyperlipidemia, and 5% to diabetes. It is known that arteriovenous nicking, ocular perfusion pressure, and focal arteriolar narrowing are related to an increased risk of developing a BRVO. Data are inconclusive in determining whether lowering blood pressure and/or serum lipid levels improves visual acuity or the complications from RVO.

### Branch retinal arteriolar occlusion associated with familial factor V Leiden polymorphism and positive rheumatoid factor… [^5f0ad88b]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. We describe a 33-year-old woman who was seen for blurred vision of sudden onset in the right eye and was found to have a branch retinal arteriole occlusion associated with familial factor V Leiden polymorphism and rheumatoid factor positivity. Immunological screening results were positive only for rheumatoid factor, and screening for thrombophilia revealed factor V Leiden polymorphism. Family screening results for the factor V Leiden polymorphism were positive in the patient's mother, who had suffered thromboembolic episodes, and in 2 other siblings who are asymptomatic to date. The patient was diagnosed as having a branch retinal arteriole occlusion and was started on a regimen of aspirin, 75 mg daily. Results from systemic evaluation revealed normal values for complete blood cells, glucose, serum electrolytes, creatinine, and liver function; a chest x-ray film showed no abnormalities.

Immunological investigations revealed a positive rheumatoid factor at a titer of 1: 320 on 3 occasions. The patient's visual acuity recovered to 20/20 OD over the next 6 months, and the cotton-wool spot resolved. She was reviewed by the internists who advised her to continue taking aspirin along with atenolol with the possibility of being started on treatment with warfarin sodium should she have another episode of thrombosis. Heterozygotes have a 7-fold risk of thromboembolism whereas homozygotes have a 20-fold risk. The risk increases with age, and in heterozygotes, oral contraceptive use and pregnancy increase the risk to 15-fold. Factor V Leiden may also be associated with other defects such as protein C or S deficiencies, antithrombin III deficiency, and antiphospholipid antibodies.
4. Retinal vein occlusion associated with resistance to activated protein C has been well documented.

5, 6 The factor V Leiden polymorphism is more usually associated with vein occlusions, and it is notable that our patient had arteriolar occlusion. Factor V Leiden mutation associated with branch retinal arteriole occlusion was described recently in a 9-year-old girl who had concurrent thermolabile methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase7 mutation, which is also a weak thrombophilic factor. Our patient's test results were positive for rheumatoid factor, but she had no other autoantibody activity and no clinical history suggestive of the antiphospholipid syndrome.

### Acute and chronic spectral domain optical coherence tomography features of branch retinal artery occlusion [^d6859254]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) is a common vascular occlusive disorder. BRAO involving the posterior pole is usually symptomatic, but occasionally has very limited clinical features. We describe 2 cases where the underlying pathology was initially unclear and the diagnosis therefore not reached at presentation. Use of the latest retinal imaging, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) enabled correct diagnosis of BRAO. The images demonstrate and contrast the fine changes that can be seen in the acute and chronic phases of this condition and illustrate how the pathogenesis of BRAO is confined to the outer retinal layers. We believe the subtle presentations of this common condition that we discuss highlight how diagnosis of BRAO can often be challenging, but may be facilitated by the use of SD-OCT retinal imaging.

### Clinical electrophysiology of the optic nerve and retinal ganglion cells [^8d683768]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

Electrodiagnostic evaluation of neuronal function in retinal vascular occlusions is typically performed with the flash ERG as compromised retinal circulation affects retinal bipolar and ganglion cell function. The PR-VEP and PERG are not routinely employed in the clinical evaluation of retinal circulatory abnormalities as they are less informative in these conditions. Central Retinal Artery Occlusion, Central Retinal Vein Occlusion and Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion all reduce the amplitude of the b-wave and the PhNR. The PhNR is usually more reduced than the b-wave, implying greater dependence of more inner retinal neurones on retinal circulation. The recovery of retinal function, whether spontaneously or as a result of treatment, is more robust with improvement b-wave in the initial phase and the PhNR recovering over longer time-period. The magnitude of PhNR amplitude reduction before treatment has been suggested to be a better predictor of visual prognosis than the b-wave.

### CHARACTERIZING COVID-19-RELATED RETINAL VASCULAR OCCLUSIONS: a case series and review of the literature [^ad2a055c]. Retina (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To describe clinical and ophthalmologic features and outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease-19 with retinal vascular occlusions.

Methods

Retrospective multicenter case series and PubMed review of cases reported from March 2020 to September 2021. Outcome measures are as follows: type of occlusion, treatments, best-corrected visual acuity, and central macular thickness on optical coherence tomography.

Results

Thirty-nine patients were identified. Fifteen patients with a median age of 39 (30–67) years were included in the multicenter study. Vascular occlusions included central retinal vein occlusion (12 eyes), branch retinal vein occlusion (4 eyes), and central retinal artery occlusion (2 eyes). Three cases were bilateral. Baseline best-corrected visual acuity was 20/45 (no light perception-20/20). Baseline central macular thickness was 348.64 (± 83) μm. Nine eyes received anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents, dexamethasone intravitreal implant, or both. Final best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 (no light perception-20/20), and central macular thickness was 273.7 ± 68 μm (follow-up of 19.6 ± 6 weeks). Among the 24 cases from the literature review, retinal vein occlusion was the predominant lesion. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were similar to those found in our series.

Conclusion

Coronavirus disease-19-associated retinal vascular occlusions tend to occur in individuals younger than 60 years. Retinal vein occlusion is the most frequent occlusive event, and outcomes are favorable in most cases.

Baseline Demographics for Included Patients

For patients diagnosed with CRAO, 10 (32.3%) had evidence of a previous stroke, leaving 21 with no stroke history. Of these, 1 patient (4.8%) presented with a stroke of uncertain embolic etiology within 3 years of CRAO diagnosis (8 months) and had a favorable outcome. This stroke was ipsilateral to the side of the ocular diagnosis. Four (11.4%) of the patients initially presenting with BRAO had a previous stroke. Of the remaining 31 patients, 4 (12.9%) had subsequent strokes with a mean latency of ≈15 months. Two strokes were ipsilateral to the affected eye. An ICA embolic event was responsible for 1, cardiac embolic for another, and the remaining 2 were uncertain embolic sources. Half had a favorable outcome, whereas 1 died as a direct result of the stroke. Seven (41.2%) of the OIS patients had previous strokes, leaving 10 for follow‐up. Of these, 4 (40%) suffered a subsequent stroke with a mean latency of ≈14 months. All strokes were ipsilateral to the affected eye and were found to be ICA embolic etiologies. Only 1 had a favorable outcome, whereas 2 died from the stroke (Figure 2). Chi‐square analysis suggested that there was a statistically significant difference between stroke prevalence of these 3 groups at the time of ocular diagnosis (χ²(2) = 6.625; P = 0.036). A hazard function for stroke incidence after ocular diagnosis was calculated for each group, while simultaneously right‐censoring the 11 patients who died from causes other than stroke before the 3‐year follow‐up (Figure 3). Log‐rank testing revealed a statistically significant difference between the 3 groups (χ²(2) = 6.986; P = 0.03).

Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions — introduction and stroke linkage — note that symptomatic retinal artery occlusion (RAO) is associated with stroke and that the retina is considered part of the central nervous system; therefore, treatment of a retinal ischemic event "should therefore be approached the same way as a brain infarction". In 2013 the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association included retinal cell death in the definition of central nervous system infarction, which is brain, spinal cord, or retinal cell death attributable to ischemia based on objective evidence or on symptoms "persisting 24 hours or more or until death".

### Optical coherence tomography angiography characteristics of acute retinal arterial occlusion [^bbba4065]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Retinal arterial occlusion (RAO) is characterized by painless, dramatic, sudden vision loss as a result of partial or complete obstruction of the retinal artery. RAO can be classified as central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) and branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) based on the site of the occlusion (central retinal artery and branch retinal artery, respectively). Though the incidence of RAO is rare, the prognosis of this emergency is usually poor (especially for CRAO) partially because that there are no proven effective treatments for RAO.

In the clinic, fluorescein angiography (FA) is applied to visualize retinal vessels and evaluate the vessel flow in RAO patients. However, capillary networks in different layers of the retina cannot be distinguished or quantified by FA. In addition, FA is an invasive examination; thus, its frequent application is limited.

Compared to FA, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) is an innovative noninvasive imaging technique that has been applied in recent years. OCT-A visualizes the retinal and choroid capillary networks and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) without any exogenous dye. Split spectrum amplitude decorrelation angiography (SSADA) associated OCT-A (Optovue, Inc. Fremont, CA) can produce three dimensional and en face imaging of retinal capillary networks. The quantitative data of the retinal vasculature, as well as the thickness of the retinal vasculature and foveal avascular zone area can be calculated automatically by AngioAnalytics software.

Due to its convenience and safety, OCT-A is currently widely used in diagnosing and evaluating various vascular-associated retinal or choroidal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, choroidal neovascularization, and retinal vein occlusion. Although several case reports and studies reported the application of OCT-A in RAO, these publications are sporadic and lack quantitative analysis. In this study, we aimed to quantify retinal vascular density, foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area and central foveal thickness by OCT-A in patients with acute RAO (onset within 7 days), and compare the parameters with those in their fellow eyes as well as in normal control eyes.

### Transient retinal artery occlusion during phacoemulsification cataract surgery [^662dd09e]. Eye (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Transient retinal artery occlusion (TRAO) is a potentially underdiagnosed cause of immediate 'pad off' visual loss following phacoemulsification cataract surgery under sub-Tenon's anaesthesia.

Methods

We describe a series of three patients presenting with enigmatic 'pad off' visual loss following phacoemulsification surgery, each diagnosed with TRAO. We describe the variable clinical presentation, illustrate the value of optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging in establishing the diagnosis, and present the final visual outcomes.

Results

Clinical findings alone may be subtle and inadequate in localising the pathology in patients with TRAO. Cross-comparison of superior and inferior macula OCT profiles in branch-pattern arterial occlusion-and between healthy and affected eyes in central-pattern arteriolar occlusion-is critical in clinching the diagnosis. The typical evolution of OCT appearance is acute-phase inner retinal thickening/oedema and hyperreflectivity followed by progressive, late-phase inner retinal atrophy. Visual acuity may recover but central scotomas, and defects in colour perception may persist.

Conclusion

The diagnosis of TRAO is challenging; delayed presentation may resolve fundal and retinal angiographic abnormalities. OCT may be the only imaging modality that can provide objective evidence of TRAO. Meticulous comparison/segmentation of OCT images is therefore mandatory in patients presenting with acute post-operative visual loss to exclude TRAO.

Carotid Doppler ultrasound and CTA revealed similar manifestations of atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis compared to the previous visit. MRI of the brain demonstrated ischemic lesions in the left corona radiata, along with evidence of maxillary sinusitis.

On the third day of her second hospitalization, she underwent catheter-directed intra-arterial thrombolysis on the right CRA guided by cerebral angiography (Fig. 5). The angiography demonstrated a stenosis at the origin of the left ICA. The remaining intracranial vasculature was normal. No aneurysms, vascular malformations, or other vascular abnormalities were identified. Post-operation, her vision improved from 20/2000 to 20/33.3. Fundus image of the right eye post-treatment reveals reduced retinal opacification and attenuation of the "cherry-red spot", suggesting partial reperfusion. Pigmentary changes and subtle atrophic areas are noted, consistent with ischemic sequelae (Fig. 4 e). Early-phase FFA post-treatment shows improved arterial filling compared to presentation, indicating partial restoration of retinal blood flow, though mild perfusion delay persists (Fig. 4 f). Late-phase FFA exhibits reduced areas of ischemia, with multiple non-perfusion areas on the temporal side of the macula. Microaneurysms are visible in the posterior pole (Fig. 4 g). The macular foveal structure of the right eye appears normal, with enhanced signal in the inner retinal layer, probably due to ischemic edema and low reflectivity in the outer layer. These findings indicate ongoing structural changes secondary to reperfusion injury and ischemic insult (Fig. 4 h).

### Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for central retinal artery occlusion: patient selection and perspectives [^d4980068]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Having the central retinal artery completely occluded can result in retinal ischemia and infarction, in addition to temporary visual loss. Emboli are formed by carotid artery or cardiac plaque, the latter of which is typically induced by atrial fibrillation, in a manner similar to that of an ischemic cerebrovascular accident in that they are commonly caused by a carotid artery or cardiac plaque.

Retinal ischemia -CRAO- is considered to be the ocular counterpart of a stroke of the cerebral vasculature, and patients suffering from CRAO should be treated with the utmost care. When a patient has CRAO, they are at a greater risk of developing concurrent or subsequent ischemia in other end organs, particularly in the brain. In spite of the fact that most ophthalmologists are aware of the systemic and neurologic implications of CRAO, the strategy to treating this condition continues to be a source of substantial ambiguity in the field. A narrow time window for effective treatment of CRAO and a high rate of serious comorbid illness exist. Thus, when CRAO is diagnosed in an ophthalmology, optometry, neurology, or primary clinic, immediate triage to an emergency department is necessary and should not be delayed to obtain further outpatient evaluation or institute other treatments. Stroke centers should develop relationships with community ophthalmologists and optometrists to promote efficient pathways for transfer of patients with CRAO. The vast majority of experts agree that it is vital to address the CRAO as an embolic event and to do an interdisciplinary full cardiological and neurological diagnostic workup to identify and treat potential hazards and causal factors as soon as possible after the CRAO has occurred. It is estimated that the chance of getting a stroke more than doubles within three years of having a CRAO. On multiple occasions, it has been demonstrated that obstruction of the central retinal artery is related with various vascular events such as myocardial infarction and acute ischemic stroke, among others. As a result, the American Heart Associationand the National Stroke Associationrecommend that all patients with retinal ischemia -CRAO- should be evaluated for cardiovascular disease in the same way that other patients who have suffered a cerebral vascular accident should be evaluated for cardiovascular disease. The key risk factors for retinal artery occlusions have been discovered in numerous investigations, with nicotine usage, hypercholesterolemia, arterial hypertension, and stenosis of the internal carotid artery being the most prevalent. In individuals with hypertensive arteriosclerosis, the occurrence of CRAO is more likely, but it can also occur in patients with endocarditis on rare occasions.

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) thrombolysis — evidence and American Heart Association (AHA) guidance indicate that a systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that the administration of intravenous thrombolytics within 4.5 hours of symptom onset was associated with a greater likelihood of favorable visual outcomes. The American Heart Association recommends modification of current hospital stroke protocols to include CRAO and related syndromes, and states that intravenous or intra-arterial antifibrinolytic therapy can be "considered" for acute CRAO if within 4.5 and 6 hours from symptom onset, respectively, but at this point there is insufficient evidence to definitively know if thrombolysis leads to better visual outcomes. There is a small risk of hemorrhagic stroke with thrombolytics, and there are currently three ongoing randomized clinical trials evaluating intravenous thrombolysis for acute CRAO ongoing in Europe.

### Detection of underdiagnosed concurrent branch retinal artery occlusion in a patient with central retinal vein occlusion using spectral domain optical coherence tomography [^94f14e37]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Combined branch retinal artery and central retinal vein occlusion is a rare condition that has been infrequently reported. This case report, aside from reporting the above-mentioned condition, highlights the importance of performing spectral domain optical coherence tomography in establishing a complete diagnosis, especially in uncertain and complicated cases. We also present spectral domain optical coherence tomography findings of a case of combined unilateral simultaneous central retinal vein and branch retinal artery occlusion.

Case Presentation

We present a single case of an initially missed, unilateral branch retinal artery occlusion combined with central retinal vein occlusion in a 51-year-old female Chinese patient without a significant past medical history, who experienced sudden, painless vision diminution in her right eye eleven days prior to presentation. She eventually recovered visual acuity to 0.60, despite having presented with poor vision.

Conclusion

Combined unilateral central retinal vein and branch retinal artery occlusion may occur in patients with no medical history of arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus and can achieve a relatively good visual outcome. This case reaffirms the significance of performing a spectral domain optical coherence tomography examination in patients suffering from central retinal vein occlusion with suspicion of unilateral simultaneous branch retinal artery occlusion to identify the affected pathological areas.

### Ocular neovascularization in eyes with a central retinal artery occlusion or a branch retinal artery occlusion [^329fc065]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an ophthalmic emergency in which the central retinal artery is occluded, resulting in a retinal infarct and acute vision loss. Its incidence is estimated to be one in 100,000. Analogous to a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), CRAOs share the same risk factors and etiologies of a CVA, with the most common etiology being an embolus, usually arising from the carotid artery. Even though visual improvement can occur in patients with CRAOs, Hayreh and Zimmerman found that 71.5% of CRAO eyes had a final visual acuity of 20/400 or worse. Therefore, frequent follow-up visits to monitor visual acuity and to assess risk factors for future CVAs are needed in these patients.

CRAOs are associated with complications like ocular neovascularization (ONV). The occurrence rate of ONV in eyes with a CRAO varies from 3.0% to 18.8% in studies conducted during the past 35 years.–Furthermore, the detection of ONV following CRAO has ranged from as early as the day of presentation to 2 years after the CRAO diagnosis. With frequent visits, many cases of ONV can be managed early with treatments such as panretinal photocoagulation and off-label intravitreal bevacizumab. Rudkin et al concluded that since ONV can occur early, regular follow-up appointments should be required, especially within the first 4 months.

The incidence of ONV as a result of branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) has not been well documented. Brown and Reber theorized that there was a narrow window for an ischemic retina to produce angiogenic factors because of possible spontaneous reestablishment of retinal blood flow and more rapid cellular damage rather than chronic prolonged ischemic damage as seen in other retinal vascular conditions. In addition, ONV is likely related to the degree of occlusion and area of ischemia, which is smaller in a BRAO when compared with a CRAO. Thus, it was presumed that the incidence of BRAO-induced neovascularization was rare. In fact, Hayreh and Podhajsky reported no incidence of ONV in 44 eyes with BRAO.

In this study, our purpose was to investigate ONV development in eyes with a BRAO or a CRAO and associated possible systemic risk factors.

Best-corrected VA and visual field outcome on follow-up. Results The median time to macular edema resolution was 21 months in those with major BRVO and 18 months in those with macular BRVO. Overall, for eyes with initial VA of 20/60 or better, VA improved or remained stable in 75% for major BRVO and 86% for macular BRVO. In those with initial VA of 20/70 or worse, VA improved in 69% for major BRVO and in 53% for macular BRVO, with median final VA of 20/60 for both BRVO types. Changes in VA and visual field defect at 3, 6, 9, and 15 months' follow-up, by sector, are presented in Table 4 for major BRVO and Table 5 for macular BRVO. Overall, for major BRVO, 75% had improved or stable VA in eyes with initial VA of 20/60 or better, and 69% had improved VA in eyes with initial VA of 20/70 or worse.

Of these eyes, capillary foveal arcade was intact in 31 and broken in 19, with VA improved in 81% of intact and 58% of broken arcades. There was no significant association of VA improvement with severity of capillary obliteration in the macular region. Visual acuity improved in 65% of eyes with extensive obliteration and in 69% of those with no capillary obliteration. The median time to resolution of BRVO based on Kaplan-Meier analysis was 4 years for major BRVO and 1. 5 years for macular BRVO. Criteria for resolution of BRVO retinopathy were resolution of both macular edema and retinal hemorrhages. The findings from these studies cannot be compared with those of our study because of the different study designs, for example:

### Risk of stroke in patients with ocular arterial occlusive disorders: a retrospective Canadian study [^093c45d2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Monocular vision loss, attributed to either central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO), or ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS), is thought to be associated with an increased prevalence of cerebral infarcts. However, there is a paucity of data substantiating this. We aimed to investigate this relationship in a Canadian center and further understand the importance of associated internal carotid artery stenosis in potential clinical decision making. Methods and Results We performed a retrospective cohort study at a comprehensive stroke center of patients presenting initially with CRAO, BRAO, or OIS to a centralized ophthalmology center over a 5-year period. Patients were followed for 3 years for the occurrence of a hemispheric stroke. We identified 83 affected eyes, with 31 CRAO, 35 BRAO, and 17 OIS patients. Before ocular diagnosis, 32.3%, 11.4%, and 41.2% of CRAO, BRAO, and OIS patients, respectively, experienced a symptomatic stroke. Of the remaining patients, 4.8%, 12.9%, and 40%, respectively, suffered a hemispheric stroke within 3 years of ocular diagnosis. Logistic regressions suggested that for CRAO and BRAO patients together, the degree of ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis is unable to predict the occurrence of a stroke (P = 0.18), whereas our model correctly predicted a stroke in 82.4% of OIS patients (P = 0.005). Conclusions CRAO, BRAO, and OIS are associated with significantly increased symptomatic stroke rates. Degree of ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis may not be useful in risk stratification for these patients, suggesting that they should be triaged appropriately for stroke risk-factor management, independent of internal carotid artery stenosis.

### Management of acute central retinal artery occlusion [^e3da524e]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is considered to be an acute stroke of the eye that results in profound visual loss. Spontaneous recovery rates are poor. Most CRAOs are caused by thromboembolism in the central retinal artery. Current standard therapies for CRAO that aim to restore perfusion to the retina and optic nerve head have not been shown to alter the natural course of the disease. Thrombolytic therapy for acute management of CRAO has shown promise in nonrandomized studies with regard to improving visual outcomes. A randomized controlled trial will be required to confirm the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy before it can be recommended for use in CRAO in daily clinical practice.

### Central retinal artery occlusion without cherry-red spots [^8db30411]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an ophthalmic emergency that results in a poor visual outcome. A literature review showed that the window of treatment for total CRAO is 90–240 min. Therefore, accurate diagnosis and timely management of CRAO are very important for improving patient prognosis.

Currently, fluorescein angiography (FA) remains the gold standard for diagnosing CRAO. However, FA is an invasive and time-consuming examination that takes at least 20 min. Twenty minutes might be just a moment for normal human beings, but it is a long time for someone who is experiencing retinal infarction. In addition, patients with a history of severe allergies, asthma and renal dysfunction cannot undergo FA. A recent study of CRAO by Abdellah MM showed a delayed arteriovenous transit time > 23 s in 53.33% of cases and normal FA results in 26.67% of cases, thus providing a challenge to its role in diagnosing CRAO.

The clinical diagnosis of CRAO depends on history and funduscopic examination. However, CRAO associated with normal-appearing retinal vessels and observable emboli is not rare. Among the funduscopic findings of CRAO, cherry-red spots are the most recognizable and typical sign. In CRAO, the reddish color of the vascular choroid and pigment epithelium is still seen through the foveola, which is surrounded by an area of the white/opacified retina; this gives rise to the typical cherry-red spot. Cherry-red spots usually become evident after several hours of ischaemia and usually persist for several days after CRAO. In most cases, the diagnosis of CRAO can be made by assessing patient history and obtaining fundoscopic findings of cherry red spots. The critical time from onset of artery occlusion to inner retinal infarction represents a window for emergency treatment to prevent catastrophic visual loss. Rapid clinical diagnosis of CRAO helps to quickly implement therapeutic interventions within the window and maximize the recovery of patients' visual function. The absence of cherry-red spots is a challenge for the diagnosis of CRAO at the first visit and might delay various treatments.

### Current best clinical practices-management of retinal vein occlusion [^9d955722]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common cause of vision loss from retinal vascular diseases in adults in the United States. Visual loss arises as a result of a host of factors, including macular ischemia and macular edema. Primary antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy is the current standard of care, with level I evidence demonstrating sustained visual gains up to 2 years after treatment in both branch and central RVO. Prompt antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy is important because delays in treatment yield lesser visual gains. Steroid therapy also improves visual outcomes in RVO but with higher rates of adverse effects, including cataract formation and ocular hypertension. Although the treatment burden can be high, these drugs have collectively revolutionized treatment outcomes in this disease state, providing improved visual outcomes over previous laser therapies.

Prognosis

Visual prognosis in patients after CRAO was evaluated in a prospective study of 244 patientswhich showed variability in initial and final VA depending on the type of CRAO. Initial VA was 20/40 or better in 37.9% of eyes with transient NA-CRAO, 20% of eyes with NA-CRAO with cilioretinal artery sparing and in 0% of eyes with NA-CRAO and arteritic CRAO. Seventy-four percent of eyes presented with an initial VA of CF or worse. Patients with transient NA-CRAO had a better initial VA, 37.9% had CF compared with 93.2% of NA-CRAO, and a higher proportion also showed greater visual improvement: 82% compared with 22% in NA-CRAO.

Visual field (VF) defects were noted: central scotoma was the most common scotoma and generalised constriction of the VF the most common defect in transient NA-CRAO (17.1% of eyes) and NA-CRAO with cilioretinal artery sparing (32.3% of eyes). In NA-CRAO, 51.9% of eyes had only a peripheral island residual field, most frequently in the temporal region. Improvement in VFs was seen in all types of CRAO and recovery to normal VFs was observed in some patients with transient NA-CRAO. Both VA improvement with central VFs improvement was observed in 30% of eyes with transient NA-CRAO, 25% of NA-CRAO with cilioretinal sparing, and only 6% with NA-CRAO. Though patients with transient non-arteritic CRAO have a better visual prognosis, they are at a high risk of ischaemic events including NA-CRAO, cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction and vascular death.

Neovascularisation due to retinal ischaemia can lead to further visual loss and has been estimated between 2.5% and 31.6% of patients with CRAO. This may subsequently lead to neovascular glaucoma, intraocular haemorrhage or tractional retinal detachment. Patients with CRAO have silent or other infarcts visible on MRI in 25% of patients. In patients without a history of stroke, the risk of stroke following CRAO is increased to between 4.8% and 35.5% within 3 years following ocular diagnosis.

### Inpatient consultations for ophthalmology – 2025 [^01b899cb]. AAO (2025). High credibility.

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) — emergency status, consultation triggers, and remote-consult protocol data are summarized as follows: Central retinal artery occlusion is considered a formal "stroke" or medical emergency for which timely diagnosis and urgent evaluation at a stroke center is standard of care, and the Academy states that acute, symptomatic ophthalmic, central, and branch retinal artery occlusions require prompt evaluation; therefore, suspicion for these conditions, such as in patients with acute, painless, monocular vision loss, is an indication for timely ophthalmology consultation. In a retrospective study evaluating 247 patients with CRAO, 60% first presented to an ED (emergency department), and among patients who initiated contact with the healthcare system within 4.5 hours of the onset of symptoms, only one-third saw an ophthalmologist within that time frame. Remote consultation protocols have been explored but are not yet considered standard of care; in one remote CRAO protocol, patients were evaluated by the neurology stroke service and underwent on-site OCT with images reviewed remotely by the retina service and in-house ophthalmology consultation not required to make final treatment decisions, and eligible patients (who presented within 12 hours of onset) were initially treated with an intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (IA-tPA). On in-person visits, 25 (42%) had confirmed retinal artery occlusion based on OCT, Ten patients were eligible for IA-tPA, and there were statistically significant improvements in mean visual acuity within 24 hours and at 4 weeks after treatment.

Figure 3
Other three cases (cases 4–6) of retinal artery occlusion recurrence in the opposite eye were documented using colour fundus photography and fluorescein angiography at both the initial episode (A: right, B: left) and the subsequent recurrence (C: right, D: left). Fluorescein angiography arm-to-retina time was emphasised. BRAO, branch retinal artery occlusion; CRAO, central retinal artery occlusion.

The same eye recurrence group included two male and three female patients, with an average age of 60 (range, 50–75) years, the demographic and clinical characteristics for whom are outlined in table 1. Although the patients were diagnosed with a variety of underlying systemic diseases, none had any heart disease. Brain imaging results also varied among the included patients — cases 1 and 2 showed no steno-occlusive lesions on brain magnetic resonance angiography and transfemoral cerebral angiography, whereas cases 3–5 showed ipsilateral proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis and occlusion. Cases 1 and 2, who initially presented with incomplete CRAO and a BCVA of 20/200 during the first event, presented with complete CRAO with a BCVA of hand motion–finger count during the recurrent episode. Interestingly, however, there were no changes in the brain imaging findings in these two patients. All the patients in the same eye group experienced the RAO recurrence within 1–2 months of the first episode, and their visual acuity deteriorated to less than finger count in all cases. Of note, one patient (case 5) experienced a stroke 6 months after the recurrence of RAO.

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^ffef34e6]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Treatment after the acute phase and thrombolysis evidence in CRAO: After the acute phase, there are no proven treatments to reverse the vision loss caused by central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO), or ophthalmic artery occlusion (OAO), and currently there is insufficient evidence to support intra-arterial or intravenous antithrombolytic therapy for CRAO.

### Retina summary benchmarks – 2024 [^bdcbfdb1]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions (care management) — physicians should first consider GCA in patients 50 years of age or older, and in cases of GCA, physicians should consider urgent systemic corticosteroid therapy to prevent vision loss in the fellow eye or vascular occlusion elsewhere; patients with diabetes with GCA should be carefully monitored since systemic corticosteroid treatment may destabilize glucose control. Ophthalmologists should refer patients with retinal vascular disease to the appropriate setting, depending on the nature of the retinal occlusion, and acute, symptomatic OAO, CRAO, and BRAO from embolic etiologies should prompt an immediate referral to the nearest stroke center or emergency department for prompt assessment for consideration of intervention. When presented with an asymptomatic BRAO, clinicians should conduct a systemic evaluation (careful medical history, assessment for systemic disease), preferably in conjunction with the patient's internist.

Other prevention tips include aspiration before injection, avoiding overcorrection by using low volumes in two or more treatment sessions, and using botulinum toxin in the glabella first to reduce the severity of wrinkles before injecting soft tissue filler.

The pathogenesis of filler-caused RAO can be attributed to intravascular injection or penetrating the proximal branches of the artery or anastomoses vessels. The high pressure of injection can make the filler retrograde to the larger vessel. In our case, the filler retrograded from the supratrochlear artery to the ophthalmic artery then propelled forward to central retina artery and then occluded multiple branch retina arteries.

Treatment of RAO within a limited time from onset, known as the golden period, may achieve better VA. In CRAO, experimental monkey model showed the retina can only tolerate up to 97 min of CRA clamping without causing detectable injury. Four hours of arterial occlusion results in massive irreversible retinal injury, therefore, the recanalization therapies were generally suggested within four hours. However, in human, the time window was found to be 15 h in patients with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) caused by fibrinoplatelet embolization. Early treatment appears to be as important in BRAO cases as it is in CRAO cases to avoid retinal damage after artery obstruction and ischemia. One study suggests 24 h threshold time for the conventional treatment for BRAO. The present case came to our ED after 5 h of symptom onset and initial visit to another hospital. The ophthalmologist there informed the patient of poor prognosis but performed no treatment. This article aims to bring attention to possible improvement of visual acuity within the human time window.

In conclusion, retinal artery occlusion can be a devastating side effect after cosmetic facial filler injection. Physicians who provide the filler service should pay attention to the location and level of injection, signs and proper referral of iatrogenic RAO. Although safety of PDLLA was confirmed in animal studies and prior application on 16,000 human cases without serious adverse effects, it could still cause the rare but devastating complication of RAO. This is the first reported case of PDLLA-related RAO worldwide. Proper and immediate therapies could still improve patient's vision and scotoma. Ophthalmologists should keep in mind the possibility of iatrogenic filler-related RAO. Further treatment guidelines and investigations are needed.

In a clinical context, retinal survival and, by extension, treatment outcome of CRAO could also depend on the degree of occlusion. Retinal survival depends on if the retinal artery occlusion is complete (retinal infarction could occur in as short a time as within 15mins) or partial (would have a more prolonged retinal survival because of residual perfusion and effect of collateral circulation). Because of uncertainty regarding the completeness and duration of the retinal artery occlusion, CRAO patients are usually offered treatment even if the timing from the onset of occlusion to presentation is deemed to be several hours. Patients with incomplete occlusion are more likely to have a favorable outcome than eyes with complete occlusion. The clinical dilemma regarding the uncertainty of the completeness of occlusion may explain the unpredictability of response to the treatment of CRAO. Figure 1 presents a probably less severe and incomplete CRAO with seemingly less macular infarction; Figure 2 shows a more severely infarcted retina with significant macular edema and pallor, suggesting a subtotal CRAO. Figure 3 is the fluorescein angiography of Figure 2. Paradoxically visual treatment outcome was better in the patient represented by Figure 2 with a more infarcted retina, supporting a multifactorial effect on treatment outcome.

Figure 1
Right eye fundus photography taken at presentation of a forty-year-old male who gave a six-day history of sudden loss of vision in the eye. Prior to his presentation, CRAO had been diagnosed and ocular digital massage was performed without an improved vision. He had a visual acuity of counting fingers and features of central retinal artery occlusion with mild retinal edema and faint cherry-red spot. These findings are suggestive of incomplete CRAO. Surgical intervention on day 9 after symptom onset consisting of combination vitrectomy with manipulation of intraocular pressure resulted in a Snellen visual acuity of 6/60 which was maintained after 6 months of follow-up.

Figure 2
Left eye fundus photography taken at presentation of a twenty-nine-year-old male who presented with sudden painless loss of vision of less than ten hours prior to presentation. The visual acuity was counting fingers, showing a more severe central arterial occlusion with a more prominent cherry-red spot, significant macular edema, and pallor. Findings are suggestive of a subtotal CRAO. He had surgical intervention approximately fifteen hours after symptom onset. At two months post-surgery Snellen visual acuity in the left eye was 6/36.

### Small vessel involvement in Takayasu's arteritis [^8377eb20]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe the small retinal and systemic vessel involvement in Takayasu's arteritis.

Methods

We described 3 patients with Takayasu's arteritis and small retinal vessel occlusion seen in our department between 2004 and 2011. We performed an extensive literature review and provided a global analysis of small retinal vessel involvement in Takayasu arteritis (i.e., total number of patients analyzed = 9).

Results

Seven patients had small retinal artery occlusion, and two had venous involvement. Four cases were inaugural of the disease (44.4%). Takayasu's arteritis was extended (Type V) in the majority of patients presenting with small retinal vessel occlusion (5/9, 55.6%), and 8/9 reported cases (88.9%) presented with involvement of the supra-aortic branches. Immunosuppressive regimen allowed an improvement in 5/9 patients and stabilization in 1/9, but the situation worsened in 3/9 patients. The visual outcome was severe, and 3/9 patients (33.3%) experienced irreversible blindness.

Conclusion

Occlusion of small retinal vessels is a rare and severe microcirculatory complication in Takayasu's arteritis, as well as necrotizing cutaneous vasculitis or myocarditis. Small retinal vessel involvement can be inaugural of the disease and seriously impact the visual prognosis in TA patients.

### Central retinal artery occlusion: visual outcome [^e6279187]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate systematically the natural history of visual outcome in central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO).

Design

Cohort study.

Methods

At entry, 244 consecutive patients (260 eyes) with CRAO (seen consecutively from 1973 to 2000) had a detailed ocular and medical history and ocular evaluation. CRAO eyes were classified into four categories: non-arteritic (NA) CRAO (171 eyes), NA-CRAO with cilioretinal artery sparing (35), transient NA-CRAO (41), and arteritic CRAO (13).

Results

Within 7 days of onset of CRAO, initial visual acuity differed among the four CRAO types (P < .0001). In eyes with vision of counting fingers or worse, it improved in 82% of eyes with transient NA-CRAO, 67% of eyes with NA-CRAO with cilioretinal artery sparing, and 22% of eyes with NA-CRAO. Visual acuity improved primarily within the first 7 days (P < .0001). In the central 30-degree visual field, central scotoma was most common. Central visual field improved in 39% with transient NA-CRAO, 25% with NA-CRAO with cilioretinal artery sparing, and 21% with NA-CRAO. Peripheral visual field was normal in 62.9% of eyes with transient NA-CRAO and 22.1% in those with NA-CRAO. In 51.9% of eyes with NA-CRAO, the only remaining visual field was a peripheral island. Peripheral fields improved in NA-CRAO (39%) and in transient NA-CRAO (39%).

Conclusions

Classification of CRAO is crucial for understanding differences in visual outcome. Marked improvement in visual acuity and visual field can occur without treatment and is determined by several factors. Visual field information is essential to evaluate visual disability in CRAO.

### Retinal artery occlusion as the manifestation of left atrial myxoma: a case report [^9c38c841]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Notably, our case had a single episode of syncope, followed with sudden loss of visual acuity. This history of syncope was overlooked by ophthalmologist in local hospital. Our report will let ophthalmologists be alert to this kind of condition and focus on the detail of medical history. In conclusion, we report this case of retinal artery occlusion caused by left atrial myxoma. Ophthalmologists should consider the possibility of myxoma in patients with sudden loss of visual acuity; and timely management will be beneficial for better outcomes and prognosis. In addition, our report will let ophthalmologists be alert to this kind of condition and focus on the detail of medical history.
