## Question

Low dhea in female

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about low DHEA in females and how to evaluate and manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiology and measurement of DHEA/DHEAS and how age affects levels. Then, I should define what "low" means using age-specific ranges and clarify clinical significance. Next, I will map major etiologies of truly low DHEAS, outline a targeted clinical assessment, and specify a diagnostic algorithm. After that, I need to consider when DHEA therapy is indicated versus discouraged, including dose, monitoring, and safety. Finally, I should integrate special populations and follow-up, while continuously verifying claims against guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the physiological context so I don't misattribute normal aging to disease; DHEA is produced predominantly by the adrenal zona reticularis under ACTH control, largely circulates as DHEAS, and serves as a peripheral precursor to androgens and estrogens, with minor ovarian thecal synthesis of DHEA occurring as well, so DHEAS is a biomarker of adrenal androgen secretion while testosterone reflects more ovarian output in women [^115Hqxs2].

> Wait, I should verify age effects before labeling results abnormal; adrenarche increases DHEAS around age 10, peaks in early adulthood, and then declines substantially with aging such that older women often have low-normal DHEAS without pathology, so interpretation must be age- and sex-specific to avoid overdiagnosis [^112GL3Rd].

> Hold on, let me be precise about measurement; DHEAS is preferred for assessment because it is stable with minimal diurnal variation and is reliably assayed, whereas DHEA itself is less stable, so I should ensure any "low DHEA" impression is actually based on age-adjusted DHEAS using appropriate methodology, ideally LC-MS/MS when available, to reduce analytical error [^116rjEEv].

> I should confirm what "low" means clinically; there is no universal cutoff, but values below the age- and sex-adjusted reference interval suggest pathology, whereas values within the lower end of normal for age are often physiologic, and importantly, a normal age-adjusted DHEAS level essentially rules out adrenal insufficiency, making it a useful screening marker that can avert unnecessary dynamic testing when normal [^1135iuNx] [^116VVDEp].

> Let me consider etiologies systematically; profoundly low DHEAS occurs in primary adrenal insufficiency where DHEA synthesis fails along with cortisol and often aldosterone, in central adrenal insufficiency or hypopituitarism where ACTH deficiency lowers both cortisol and adrenal androgens, and in some chronic critical illnesses, while aging alone is common and not pathologic, and anorexia nervosa shows the paradox of elevated DHEA with reduced DHEAS and does not benefit from DHEA therapy for bone outcomes [^115aQ2Bk] [^113fL3UG] [^112GL3Rd] [^116Uazdy].

> Next, I should review symptom patterns without overinterpreting nonspecific complaints; fatigue, low energy, reduced libido, depressed mood, and decreased well-being are common and non-specific, whereas Addison's disease may show hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, volume depletion, abdominal pain, hyperpigmentation, or hypoglycemia, and central causes may present with amenorrhea, infertility, or other pituitary deficits, so clinical context is key before pursuing endocrine workups [^117TcpYS] [^112uCFEs] [^113fL3UG].

> I will now examine a pragmatic diagnostic approach; if DHEAS is clearly low for age, I should obtain morning cortisol and ACTH and, when indicated, perform ACTH stimulation testing to characterize primary versus central adrenal insufficiency, with additional evaluation such as plasma renin and aldosterone, 21-hydroxylase antibodies for autoimmune adrenalitis, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone when CAH is in the differential, and reserve adrenal CT for unclear etiologies after laboratory testing, aligning with endocrine guidelines [^116VVDEp] [^115aQ2Bk] [^1135iuNx].

> Hold on, I should verify one nuance about postmenopausal steroid sources; I almost said DHEA is the exclusive source of all sex steroids after menopause, but newer physiology shows persistent ovarian androgen production and complex peripheral activation, even though some studies argue circulating DHEA is the main substrate postmenopausally, so I need to interpret "exclusive" cautiously and anchor clinical decisions in current guideline physiology [^115Hqxs2] [^115Bo29v].

> Let me think about the role of DHEAS in excluding adrenal causes during androgen-excess evaluations; when assessing hirsutism, acne, or alopecia, low-normal DHEAS makes adrenal hyperandrogenism less likely, while markedly elevated DHEAS can signal an adrenal source and prompt imaging, but in the "low DHEAS" scenario, the task is primarily to exclude adrenal insufficiency rather than to localize androgen excess [^115Hqxs2] [^111YSQq2].

> I should double-check therapeutic indications; DHEA replacement is not standard for all women with low DHEAS, but in women with primary adrenal insufficiency who have persistent low libido, low energy, or depressive symptoms despite optimized glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid therapy, guidelines support considering a trial of DHEA with cautious monitoring, acknowledging only modest average benefits on quality of life measures in trials [^115aQ2Bk] [^1144UNK4].

> Next, I should review dosing and targets; trials typically used 50 mg daily of micronized DHEA, which raises DHEAS and downstream androgens in women, with testosterone rising to low-normal in females and occasional mild androgenic side effects, so I should titrate to keep DHEAS within the age-appropriate physiological range and measure morning DHEAS before the daily dose for surveillance per guidance [^112ku72n] [^116ZCicv].

> But wait, what about metabolic and bone outcomes; data in hypoadrenal women suggest improved insulin sensitivity and small lipid changes with DHEA, but broader older-adult trials do not show robust improvements in central adiposity or glucose metabolism and may reduce HDL, and bone benefits appear modest and likely mediated via estradiol increases rather than direct effects, so I should not overpromise systemic gains beyond symptom domains [^115mbDUS] [^1177CU7u] [^112sCDnB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about general use; for healthy peri- or postmenopausal women with age-related low DHEAS and normal adrenal function, systematic reviews and guidelines do not support routine systemic DHEA to improve sexual function, mood, cognition, metabolic health, or bone, and long-term RCTs in older women have not demonstrated clear benefit, so routine supplementation is discouraged outside specific adrenal failure contexts [^1157rq8n] [^114LPJZF] [^111S1Cxo] [^111XtyrJ].

> I need to ensure I flag special situations; in anorexia nervosa, despite low DHEAS, DHEA supplementation does not improve BMD and may be detrimental in younger adolescents, so it should be avoided, while in hypopituitarism, concomitant ACTH deficiency can markedly depress sex steroid precursors and warrants full pituitary and adrenal evaluation rather than empiric DHEA, and observational associations of low DHEAS with lung function or depressive phenotypes should not drive treatment decisions without pathology confirmation [^116Uazdy] [^113fL3UG] [^115bRar3] [^112yGcP6].

> I should confirm safety monitoring when a therapeutic trial is justified; monitor for acne, hirsutism, scalp hair changes, voice deepening, mood shifts, and lipid changes, consider that DHEA at 50 mg/day can raise estradiol and testosterone over months, so prolonged use may warrant watching for estrogen-sensitive tissues, and reassess benefit after 3 to 6 months, discontinuing if there is no meaningful symptomatic improvement or if adverse effects occur [^112ku72n] [^1152Aw9U].

> Finally, let me summarize the clinical path with self-checks; start by verifying assay quality and age-adjusted DHEAS, distinguish physiologic aging from true subnormal values, screen for adrenal insufficiency when DHEAS is low for age using morning cortisol, ACTH, and, when needed, stimulation testing, evaluate for autoimmune etiologies and other pituitary deficits if indicated, reserve DHEA therapy for women with established adrenal insufficiency and persistent symptoms despite optimized steroid replacement, and avoid routine DHEA in otherwise healthy older women, correcting any misinterpretations along the way to prevent overtreatment and missed adrenal failure [^116rjEEv] [^116VVDEp] [^115aQ2Bk] [^1144UNK4] [^1157rq8n].

Low DHEA in females is most often due to **adrenal insufficiency** [^1135iuNx] or **age-related decline** [^11142odu], and can present with fatigue, low libido [^112GL3Rd], mood changes, and reduced bone density [^112sCDnB]. Diagnosis relies on **morning DHEA-S** [^1135iuNx] with age/sex-adjusted reference ranges, and DHEA-S is a useful adjunct in assessing adrenal function [^116VVDEp]. DHEA replacement is considered [^115aQ2Bk] for women with **adrenal insufficiency** who have persistent low libido, mood, or energy despite optimized steroid therapy, with typical doses of **25–50 mg/day** [^112ku72n] and monitoring for androgenic side effects. Routine DHEA use in healthy women is **not recommended** due to limited evidence of benefit and potential risks [^1157rq8n] [^114LPJZF].

## Physiological role of DHEA in females

DHEA is a precursor to androgens and estrogens [^112sFAMG] that supports sexual function, mood, bone health, and metabolism, and its levels peak in early adulthood and **decline with age** [^11142odu].

---

## Causes of low DHEA levels in females

Low **DHEA** levels in females may result from:

- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency reduces adrenal androgen production [^112uCFEs] [^11469Efd].

- **Hypopituitarism**: ACTH deficiency lowers adrenal androgen synthesis [^113fL3UG].

- **Aging**: DHEA declines ~70% from ages 20 to 60 [^11142odu].

- **Chronic illness and stress**: Chronic disease and stress can suppress adrenal function.

- **Medications**: Long-term glucocorticoids and some antidepressants can lower DHEA.

---

## Clinical symptoms and health implications

Low **DHEA** in females is associated with the following:

- **Fatigue and low energy**: Common in adrenal insufficiency [^112uCFEs].

- **Reduced libido and sexual dysfunction**: Linked to lower androgens [^117TcpYS].

- **Mood disturbances**: Depression and anxiety are reported [^1144UNK4].

- **Bone health**: Lower BMD and higher fracture risk [^112sCDnB].

- **Metabolic effects**: Increased adiposity and insulin resistance.

- **Immune function**: Potential immune dysregulation [^116uvacN].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis relies on clinical assessment and biochemical testing, including evaluation of fatigue, libido, mood, and bone health. Morning **DHEA-S** should be measured using age- and sex-adjusted reference ranges [^1135iuNx]. Additional tests — such as cortisol and ACTH — and dynamic assessment (e.g. cosyntropin stimulation) help evaluate adrenal function [^11469Efd] [^115aQ2Bk].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment depends on the cause and severity, prioritizing correction of the underlying disorder and symptom relief [^115aQ2Bk]. DHEA supplementation at **25–50 mg/day** may be considered for women with adrenal insufficiency who have persistent symptoms despite optimized steroid therapy [^115aQ2Bk] [^112ku72n]. Estrogen/progestin hormone therapy may be used for menopausal symptoms and bone health, while exercise, stress reduction, and nutrition support overall adrenal function.

---

## Risks and side effects of DHEA supplementation

Potential **risks** include the following:

- **Androgenic effects**: Acne, hirsutism, hair loss [^112ku72n].

- **Hormonal imbalance**: Altered estrogen/testosterone levels [^1152Aw9U].

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Possible lipid changes and cardiovascular effects.

- **Long-term safety**: Limited data on prolonged use [^1157rq8n].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is **essential** and should include both clinical and laboratory parameters. Monitor DHEA-S [^116ZCicv], testosterone, and estrogen; reassess fatigue, libido, mood, and bone health at follow-up visits [^1144UNK4]. Watch for androgenic and metabolic adverse effects to guide dose adjustments or discontinuation if needed.

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Guidelines recommend **targeted supplementation** — consider DHEA for women with adrenal insufficiency and persistent symptoms despite optimized steroid therapy [^115aQ2Bk] — and advise against **routine use** [^1157rq8n] in healthy women due to limited benefit and potential risks [^111S1Cxo].

---

Low DHEA in females is linked to fatigue, low libido, mood changes, and bone loss; **evaluate with morning DHEA-S** [^1135iuNx] and **treat based on cause**, considering DHEA supplementation in adrenal insufficiency with symptom monitoring [^115aQ2Bk].

Regarding medical management for primary adrenal insufficiency, specifically in the context of DHEA replacement, the 2016 ES guidelines recommend considering a trial of DHEA replacement in women with PAI who experience low libido, depressive symptoms, and/or low energy levels, despite otherwise optimized corticosteroid and mineralocorticoid replacement.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone: A springboard hormone for female sexuality [^112GL3Rd]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

To determine the role of adrenal androgenic hormone precursors in female sexual function, a review of literature on sexual function and the androgen precursor hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) was conducted.

The C(19) steroid, DHEA, is both an ovarian and adrenal androgen precursor hormone, whereas DHEAS is only synthesized in the adrenal cortex. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate secretion begins at age 10, peaks at age 20, and then wanes. Low DHEAS levels occur in individuals with adrenal insufficiency and in the elderly. A dosage of dehydroepiandrosterone, 50 mg/d, increases DHEAS levels. In women, but not men, the increased DHEAS levels facilitate additional production of downstream androgens, including testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, as well as androstenediol glucuronide. With the improved female androgenic profile, women with adrenal insufficiency experience increased sexual thoughts and fantasies, as well as an enhancement in mood and well-being. In the elderly over age 65, DHEAS levels increase in both men and women with a DHEA dosage of 50 mg/d. However, only in women do the higher DHEAS levels coincide with a surge in testosterone levels. In women over age 70, this results in increased libido, enhanced sexual satisfaction, a 26% reduction in bone resorption, and a 10% decrease in skin pigmentation.

The female adrenal androgen deficiency syndrome, characterized by low serum DHEAS levels, may be corrected by DHEA supplements that increase levels of DHEAS and downstream androgens important to female sexuality.

### Androgen therapy in women: A reappraisal: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1157rq8n]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

To update practice guidelines for the therapeutic use of androgens in women, the Endocrine Society, along with the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE), and the International Menopause Society (IMS), appointed a Task Force. This group consisted of six experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.

The Task Force commissioned two systematic reviews of published data and evaluated several existing meta-analyses and trials. The GRADE methodology was employed, with the strength of recommendations indicated by a "1" for strong recommendations (we recommend) or a "2" for weak recommendations (we suggest).

To reach consensus, multiple email communications and conference calls were conducted. Committees from the Endocrine Society, ASRM, ACOG, ESE, and IMS reviewed and provided feedback on the drafts of the guidelines.

The conclusions continue to recommend against diagnosing androgen deficiency syndrome in healthy women, as there is no well-defined syndrome or data correlating androgen levels with specific signs or symptoms. There is a recommendation against the general use of testosterone for infertility, sexual dysfunction (other than hypoactive sexual desire disorder), as well as cognitive, cardiovascular, metabolic, or bone health, or general well-being. The routine use of dehydroepiandrosterone is not recommended due to limited data concerning its effectiveness and safety in normal women or those with adrenal insufficiency.

### Long-term DHEA replacement in primary adrenal insufficiency: a randomized, controlled trial [^112ku72n]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). High credibility.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) are the major circulating adrenal steroids and substrates for peripheral sex hormone biosynthesis. In Addison's disease, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiencies require lifelong replacement, but the associated near-total failure of DHEA synthesis is not typically corrected.

In a double-blind trial, we randomized 106 subjects (44 males, 62 females) with Addison's disease to receive either 50 mg daily of micronized DHEA or a placebo orally for 12 months. The aim was to evaluate the longer-term effects on bone mineral density, body composition, and cognitive function together with well-being and fatigue.

- **Results**: Circulating DHEAS as well as androstenedione rose significantly in both sexes, with testosterone increasing to low normal levels only in females. DHEA reversed ongoing loss of bone mineral density at the femoral neck (P < 0.05) but not at other sites. DHEA enhanced total body (P = 0.02) and truncal (P = 0.017) lean mass significantly, with no change in fat mass. At baseline, subscales of psychological well-being in questionnaires (Short Form-36, General Health Questionnaire-30), were significantly worse in Addison's patients vs. control populations (P < 0.001), and one subscale of SF-36 improved significantly (P = 0.004) after DHEA treatment. However, there was no significant benefit of DHEA treatment on fatigue or cognitive or sexual function. Supraphysiological DHEAS levels were achieved in some older females who experienced mild androgenic side effects.

Although further long-term studies are needed to corroborate these findings, the current study suggests potential benefits of DHEA replacement in specific areas for patients with Addison's disease.

### Biochemical diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency: The added value of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate measurements [^1135iuNx]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

To review biochemical tests used in establishing the challenging diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, we reviewed the relevant literature, including our own data, on various biochemical tests used to determine adrenal function. The advantages and limitations of each approach are discussed.

Baseline measurements of serum cortisol are helpful only when they are very low (≤ 5 μg/dL) or clearly elevated, whereas baseline plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels are helpful only when primary adrenal insufficiency is suspected. Measurements of baseline serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) levels are valuable in patients suspected of having adrenal insufficiency. Although serum DHEA-S levels are low in patients with primary or central adrenal insufficiency, a low level of this steroid is not sufficient by itself for establishing the diagnosis. A normal age- and sex-adjusted serum DHEA-S level, however, practically rules out the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Many patients require dynamic biochemical studies, such as the 1-μg cosyntropin test, to assess adrenal function.

In establishing the diagnosis of central adrenal insufficiency, we recommend measurements of baseline serum cortisol and DHEA-S levels. In addition to these, determination of plasma levels of aldosterone, ACTH, and renin activity is necessary when primary adrenal insufficiency is suspected. With a random serum cortisol level of ≥ 12 μg/dL in the ambulatory setting or a normal age- and sex-adjusted DHEA-S level (or both), the diagnosis can be refined further.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^115Hqxs2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

The zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex is responsible for adrenal androgen precursor synthesis, which is under the control of pituitary corticotropin (ACTH). The adrenal gland secretes several 19-carbon (C19) steroids, with DHEA and DHEAS produced in the greatest quantity. The majority of DHEA is converted to A4 via oxidation of the 3‐beta‐hydroxyl group through the action of 3β‐hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (3βHSD2). Small quantities of the active androgen testosterone (T) can also be produced from A4 in the adrenal glands through the activity of aldoketoredutase type 1 C3 (AKR1C3), but the bulk of circulating T in women is of ovarian origin (see below). DHEA and DHEAS are therefore considered biomarkers of adrenal androgen secretion, while A4 can originate from both ovaries and adrenals.

- **Ovarian androgen synthesis**: Androgen synthesis in the theca cells of the ovarian follicular unit is under tonic stimulation by pituitary luteinising hormone (LH). Ovarian thecal cells can generate DHEA de novo from cholesterol and pregnenolone through the actions of cholesterol side‐chain cleavage enzyme and 17α‐hydroxylase, and thereafter it is converted to A4 and T. Venous sampling studies have confirmed significant gradients between ovarian vein and peripheral samples for both T and A4, even after the menopause, with a significantly greater relative production of T from the ovary. Serum T in women is therefore considered an accurate biomarker of ovarian androgen generation, particularly if adrenal precursors such as DHEA or DHEAS are not simultaneously elevated.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone for women in the peri- or postmenopausal phase [^115QVnUc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

During menopause, a decreasing ovarian follicular response generally causes a fluctuation and eventual decrease in estrogen levels. This can lead to the development of various perimenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is one of the main precursors of androgens, which in turn are converted to testosterone and estrogens. It is possible that the administration of DHEA may increase estrogen and testosterone levels in peri- and postmenopausal women, thereby alleviating their symptoms and improving general wellbeing and sexual function, including libido, dyspareunia, and satisfaction. Treatment with DHEA is controversial as there is uncertainty about its effectiveness and safety. This review should clearly outline the evidence for DHEA in the treatment of menopausal symptoms and evaluate its effectiveness and safety by combining the results of randomized controlled trials.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of administering DHEA to women with menopausal symptoms in the peri- or postmenopausal phase.

- **Search methods**: The databases that we searched (as of 3 June 2014) without language restrictions included the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS. We also searched conference abstracts and citation lists in the ISI Web of Knowledge, and ongoing trials were searched in the trials registers. Reference lists of retrieved articles were checked.

### Wide distribution of the serum dehydroepiandrosterone and sex steroid levels in postmenopausal women: Role of the ovary [^115Bo29v]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

Because the exclusive source of sex steroids, at least estrogens, after menopause is recognized to be dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), this study examines the interindividual variability of serum DHEA and its metabolites as well as the contribution of the ovary to global sex steroid physiology in postmenopausal women. Serum levels of DHEA and 11 of its metabolites were measured by gas or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry in 442 intact and 71 ovariectomized postmenopausal women aged 42 to 74 years.

With a mean ± SD concentration of 2.03 ± 1.33 ng/mL, serum DHEA in intact postmenopausal women is highly variable, with 5th and 95th centiles at 0.55 and 4.34 ng/mL, respectively, indicating a 7.9-fold difference. Comparable variability is observed for the 11 metabolites of DHEA. The 22.3% higher serum DHEA in intact compared to ovariectomized women is accompanied by parallel differences for all the other steroids, thus indicating that all sex steroids originate from circulating DHEA in postmenopausal women, with no direct secretion of active estrogens or androgens by the postmenopausal ovary.

The 7.9-fold difference between low and high serum DHEA levels provides an explanation for the lack of signs of hormone deficiency in some women, whereas most of them have symptoms or signs. The approximately 20% contribution of the ovary to the total pool of DHEA, with no direct secretion of estrogens or androgens in the circulation, could possibly explain the reported negative effect of oophorectomy on longevity, especially from coronary heart disease.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline [^11469Efd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary adrenal insufficiency, specifically in evaluating the underlying etiology, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend the following tests in adult patients with PAI:

- **Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone level**: Used to test for congenital adrenal hyperplasia in infants and selected children and adults.

- **21-hydroxylase antibodies**: Applied to test for autoimmune adrenalitis.

- **Plasma VLCFAs**: Utilized to test for adrenoleukodystrophy in males with negative 21-hydroxylase antibodies.

- **CT scan of the adrenals**: Conducted to eliminate adrenal infiltrative processes or metastases in patients with an unknown etiology of adrenal insufficiency after laboratory testing.

### Low serum DHEA-S is associated with impaired lung function in women [^115bRar3]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

Considering that DHEA-S is almost the exclusive source of androgens in peripheral tissues in women, these data together suggest that DHEA-S, directly or indirectly through its androgenic metabolites, might contribute to sustaining respiratory function. Since androgens have known anabolic effects, one might speculate that DHEA-S deficiency contributes to respiratory muscle weakness, with simultaneous restrictive lung function impairment. In our study, low DHEA-S was associated with a restrictive pattern on spirometry only in the cross-sectional analysis, while it was not associated with FVC decline in the longitudinal analysis. If the association was causal, this might point toward a short-term, maybe reversible, effect of DHEA-S deficiency on pulmonary vital capacity. Noteworthy, among never-smokers or light smokers, one out of four women with a restrictive pattern was found to have low DHEA-S levels.

### Dhea in elderly women and dhea or testosterone in elderly men [^111XtyrJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and testosterone are widely promoted as anti-aging supplements, but the long-term benefits compared to potential harm are unknown.

- **Methods**: We performed a 2-year, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study involving 87 elderly men with low levels of sulfated DHEA and bioavailable testosterone and 57 elderly women with low levels of sulfated DHEA. Among the men, 29 received DHEA, 27 received testosterone, and 31 received placebo. Among the women, 27 received DHEA and 30 received placebo. Outcome measures included physical performance, body composition, bone mineral density (BMD), glucose tolerance, and quality of life.

- **Results**: As compared with the change from baseline to 24 months in the placebo group, subjects who received DHEA for 2 years had an increase in plasma levels of sulfated DHEA by a median of 3.4 micrograms per milliliter (9.2 micromol per liter) in men and by 3.8 micrograms per milliliter (10.3 micromol per liter) in women. Among men who received testosterone, the level of bioavailable testosterone increased by a median of 30.4 ng per deciliter (1.1 nmol per liter), compared to the change in the placebo group. A separate analysis of men and women showed no significant effect of DHEA on body-composition measurements. Neither hormone altered the peak volume of oxygen consumed per minute, muscle strength, or insulin sensitivity. Men who received testosterone had a slight increase in fat-free mass, and men in both treatment groups had an increase in BMD at the femoral neck. Women who received DHEA had additional unspecified results due to truncation.

### Clinical review: DHEA replacement for postmenopausal women [^111S1Cxo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

It has been proposed that because dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate, DHEAS, are important precursors for estrogen as well as androgen production, treatment with DHEA is a physiologically based strategy for alleviating hormone deficiency symptoms in postmenopausal women. This review summarizes the physiology of DHEA in women and examines findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding the effects of DHEA therapy on postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function.

- **Evidence acquisition**: The medical literature was reviewed for key papers on DHEA physiology and RCTs of DHEA use in postmenopausal women up to November 2010. The focus was on sexual function, well-being, metabolic parameters, and cognition as study endpoints.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Although cross-sectional studies have suggested a link between low DHEA levels and impaired sexual function, well-being, and cognitive performance in postmenopausal women, placebo-controlled RCTs do not show benefits of oral DHEA for any of these outcomes or favorable effects on lipids and carbohydrate metabolism.

- **Conclusions**: Findings from this literature review do not support the use of DHEA in postmenopausal women at this time.

### Screening for androgen deficiency in women: Methodological and interpretive issues [^116rjEEv]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

To appreciate the problems in obtaining and interpreting androgen levels in women, a review of the literature was conducted to compare various laboratories and methods of analysis of serum androgens.

Normal control populations were culled from the literature to compare with patients previously reported on by us; data from our laboratory quality control were compared with data from the literature. Investigators and laboratories disagree on the best methods of measuring testosterone (T) levels in women, although measuring DHEAS levels is much less controversial.

Serum T levels should be measured in the morning hours and during the middle third of the menstrual cycle in premenopausal women. DHEAS levels may be measured at any time. While androgens decrease with age, age-related levels are not accurate because control populations have never been screened for sexual dysfunction. Such control populations need to be obtained.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^112sFAMG]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Androgen metabolism in women involves a complex interplay between the ovaries, adrenal glands, and peripheral tissues. In the classic androgen pathway, androgenic precursors such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) as well as androstenedione (A4) are produced in large quantities by the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex. DHEA can be inactivated to its sulphated ester, DHEAS, by the action of DHEA sulfotransferase 2A1 (SULT2A1), which requires 3ʹ‐phosphoadenosine‐5ʹ‐phosphosulfate (PAPS) for its catalytic activity. Mutations encoding the gene for PAPS synthase 2 (PAPSS2) are associated with impaired DHEA sulfation, resulting in a monogenic syndrome that is phenotypically similar to PCOS, featuring androgen excess and oligomenorrhoea. DHEAS circulates in the micromolar range and represents the most abundant steroid in human circulation; DHEAS may also be converted back to DHEA by the action of steroid sulfatase (STS), thereby releasing DHEA into the androgen pool for peripheral activation into more potent metabolites.

- **Adrenal, ovarian and peripheral androgen metabolism**: Both classic and 11‐oxygenated androgen pathways are demonstrated. Androgenic precursors are secreted predominantly by the adrenal glands and activated to potent androgens in the ovaries and peripheral tissues. 11KA4, 11‐ketoandrostenedione; 11KT, 11‐ketotestosterone; 11OHA4, 11β‐hydroxyandrostenedione; 11OHT, 11β‐hydroxytestosterone; 17OHPreg, 17‐hydroxypregnenolone; A4, androstenedione; AKR1C3, aldoketoreductase type 1C3; CYP17A1, cytochrome P450 17A1; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone.

### Clinical review: The benefits and harms of systemic dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114LPJZF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Exogenous dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) therapy has been proposed to replenish the depletion of endogenous DHEA and its sulfate form, which occurs with advancing age and is thought to be associated with loss of libido and menopausal symptoms.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the evidence supporting the use of systemic DHEA in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus through January 2014. Pairs of reviewers, working independently, selected studies and extracted data from eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We used the random-effects model to pool across studies and evaluated heterogeneity using the I² statistic.

We included 23 RCTs with moderate to high risk of bias enrolling 1188 women. DHEA use was not associated with significant improvement in libido or sexual function (standardized mean difference, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, -0.02 to 0.73; P value = .06; I² = 62%). There was also no significant effect of DHEA on serious adverse effects, serum lipids, serum glucose, weight, body mass index, or bone mineral density. This evidence warranted low confidence in the results, mostly due to imprecision, risk of bias, and inconsistency across RCTs.

Evidence warranting low confidence suggests that DHEA administration does not significantly impact sexual symptoms or selected metabolic markers in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone status and efficacy of dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation for bone health in anorexia nervosa: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Uazdy]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

This study was designed to determine the status of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in women with anorexia nervosa (AN) and to assess the efficacy of DHEA supplementation as a treatment for bone health in women with AN.

- **Method**: Studies were retrieved from the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Scopus databases from inception to February 14, 2022. Observational studies that compared serum DHEA levels between women with AN and healthy controls were included for meta-analysis, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of DHEA supplementation on bone mass were reviewed.

- **Results**: Meta-analysis of 15 cross-sectional studies revealed that patients with AN had significantly elevated serum DHEA levels (mean difference (MD) = 311.63 ng/dl; 95% confidence interval (CI), 78.01–545.25) and reduced DHEAS levels (MD = -24.90 μg/dl; 95% CI, -41.72 to -8.07) compared with healthy controls. A systematic review of seven RCTs found that DHEA monotherapy does not improve bone mineral density (BMD) compared with placebo after adjusting for weight gain. While the combination of DHEA and conjugated oral contraceptives has led to increased bone strength and decreased bone loss, the beneficial effect appears to be limited to older adolescents and adults with closed physes. Potential detrimental effects on BMD were identified in younger adolescents with open physes in one study.

- **Discussion**: Due to the lack of apparent benefit of DHEA in women with AN and its potential detrimental effect on BMD in young patients with AN, evidence does not support the use of DHEA in this population.

### Fatty acid metabolism in the elderly: Effects of dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone replacement in hormonally deficient men and women [^111UPHeo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Aging, low dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and testosterone are associated with increased adiposity and metabolic risk. Treatment with these hormones may improve these abnormalities.

- **Objective**: The objective of the study was to determine the effects of aging, DHEA, or testosterone replacement on adiposity, meal fat partitioning, and postabsorptive lipolysis.

- **Design**: This was a cross-sectional, two-year, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted in the general community.

- **Patients**: Elderly women and men (≥ 60 years) with low DHEA sulfate (women and men) and bioavailable testosterone (men) concentrations and young adults.

- **Interventions**: Thirty elderly women each received 50 mg DHEA or placebo daily for two years. Thirty elderly men received 75 mg DHEA, 29 received 5 mg testosterone (patch), and 32 received placebo daily for two years. Thirty young women and 32 young men served as controls.

- **Main outcome measures**: In vivo measures of meal fat storage into subcutaneous fat, postabsorptive lipolysis, and regional adiposity at baseline and after treatment.

- **Results**: At baseline, the elderly had more body fat, greater systemic lipolysis (women, P = 0.0003; men, P < 0.0001) adjusted for resting energy expenditure, greater meal fat oxidation (women, P = 0.026; men, P = 0.0025), and less meal fat storage in subcutaneous fat (women, P = 0.0139; men, P = 0.0006). Although testosterone treatment increased meal fat storage into upper- vs. lower-body fat in elderly men, neither hormone affected regional adiposity, meal fat oxidation, or systemic lipolysis.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^1144gQ9Y]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Androgen excess is defined as clinical or biochemical evidence of increased production of androgenic steroids in women. It is observed in up to 10% of women of reproductive age and less commonly in postmenopausal women. Androgen excess typically manifests clinically as hirsutism or acne; more severe and prolonged exposure can lead to overt virilization, including clitoromegaly, deepening of the voice, female pattern hair loss (FPHL), or erythrocytosis.

Most adolescents and women of reproductive age who present to secondary or tertiary care with androgen excess will have underlying polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, other primary underlying pathologies must be excluded in a subset of patients harboring red flag clinical features. These include severe biochemical disturbances, rapidly progressive symptoms or signs, or presentation in the postmenopausal phase of life. This cohort of patients has an increased likelihood of underlying neoplastic ovarian, adrenal, or pituitary disease, or occasionally monogenic disorders of insulin signaling or androgen metabolism, compared to those with milder disturbances in the PCOS range.

A detailed clinical history, targeted physical examination, and careful interrogation of the pattern and severity of biochemical disturbances are critical to rationalize the requirement and strategy for further biochemical, radiological, and, where appropriate, genetic investigations. Although androgen excess in women with PCOS is closely correlated with adverse metabolic health outcomes throughout their life course, se

### Dehydroepiandrosterone substitution in female adrenal failure: No impact on endothelial function and cardiovascular parameters despite normalization of androgen status [^112AmN56]. Clinical Endocrinology (2007). Low credibility.

Female adrenal insufficiency implicates reduced production of the adrenal androgen precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and low androgen levels. Oral DHEA restores androgen deficit, but the clinical implications and safety of substitution therapy are uncertain. A putative DHEA receptor in vascular endothelium has been described, and in vitro studies have shown the involvement of DHEA in NO-dependent pathways.

- **Aim**: To evaluate the effects of DHEA substitution on cardiovascular parameters.

- **Design**: A six-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Treatment consisted of DHEA 50 mg or placebo. Each treatment period was followed by a two-month washout period.

- **Material and methods**: Ten females with documented adrenal failure were included. Androgen levels were measured. Cardiovascular evaluation was performed before and after every treatment period. Two patients left the study because of skin side effects and anxiety, respectively. All patients had low circulating androgens at baseline and normal range androgens during DHEA treatment. We examined patients with noninvasive endothelial cell function, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based cardiac output, echocardiography, ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure, and maximal oxygen consumption.

- **Results**: DHEA treatment normalized androgen status to levels seen in healthy women. DHEA and placebo treatment had no effect on echocardiographic parameters of myocardial dimensions or systolic and diastolic function, noninvasive endothelial cell function at the level of the brachial artery, 24-hour blood pressure, and heart rate.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone treatment in the aging male — what should the urologist know [^116CfsQ7]. European Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has attracted considerable attention as a means against the decrements of aging. This review summarizes clinical studies evaluating DHEA as a treatment option for age-related conditions and diseases.

- **Methods**: Literature search of PubMed documented publications and abstracts from meetings.

- **Results**: The collected data indicate that DHEA supplementation to counteract its gradual decrease with age is beneficial. Positive effects on the cardiovascular system, body composition, bone mineral density (BMD), skin, central nervous system (CNS), and immune system have been reported. Improvements in sexual function due to DHEA have also been demonstrated.

- **Conclusion**: Although long-term clinical trials, applying the standards of evidence-based methods, are not currently available, the consistency of the data and extensive practical experience may justify the use of DHEA in aging men. This is contingent upon the classical endocrinology principles being thoroughly followed, including diagnosis based on the clinical picture and biochemical evidence, adherence to periodic evaluations, and individual dose adjustment to maintain serum concentrations within the physiological range of young males. As one among several important hormonal factors, DHEA can delay and correct age-related disorders only to a certain degree.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^115dZb7s]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

Overall, comprehensive data directly comparing differing imaging approaches in the evaluation of severe androgen excess are lacking; therefore, clinical presentation in tandem with reasoned biochemical evaluation are crucial to determining which imaging modality is most appropriate.

- **Recommendations**: When there is a high index of suspicion for PCOS, transvaginal ultrasound is the first‐line imaging modality in selected patients and where culturally acceptable. Imaging is not necessary if two Rotterdam criteria are otherwise met (i.e. androgen excess and oligomenorrhea) unless there are otherwise atypical clinical and biochemical features. If clinical indications suggest non‐PCOS pathology, cross‐sectional imaging of the ovaries and/or adrenals should be undertaken as appropriate. MRI of the pelvis should be undertaken if an ovarian tumor is strongly suspected. Urgent cross‐sectional imaging (CT or MRI) should be undertaken if an adrenal pathology is suspected.

### Long-term low-dose dehydroepiandrosterone oral supplementation in early and late postmenopausal women modulates endocrine parameters and synthesis of neuroactive steroids [^116Sw3oK]. Fertility and Sterility (2003). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effects of low-dose DHEA supplementation on hormonal parameters in early and late postmenopausal women, a prospective case study was conducted involving postmenopausal women in a clinical research environment. Twenty postmenopausal women were divided into two groups according to age (50–55 and 60–65 years).

All patients underwent hormonal evaluation before and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of therapy, receiving 25 mg/d of DHEA orally. Pelvic ultrasound examinations and Kupperman scores were performed before and after 3, 6, and 12 months of therapy.

- **Main outcome measures**:

- **Androgenic and precursor hormones**: DHEA, DHEAS, androstenedione (A), testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone
- **Estrogenic hormones**: Estrone (E1), E2
- **Progestogenic hormones**: Progesterone (P), 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP)
- **Neuroactive steroids**: Allopregnanolone
- **Endocrine markers**: Cortisol (F), beta-endorphin, sexual hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)

Results indicated that the levels of all the steroids deriving from DHEA metabolism increased in plasma with DHEA administration. Neurosteroids, such as allopregnanolone, and endorphin also showed increased plasma levels, while both gonadotropins were significantly reduced. Endometrial thickness did not change throughout the study period.

In conclusion, the administration of low doses (25 mg) of DHEA positively modulated several endocrine parameters in early and late postmenopausal women. It induced an increase in the androgenic, estrogenic, and progestogenic milieu and reduced climacteric symptoms, similarly to estroprogestin replacement therapy.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^1125uLR4]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

The role of dynamic endocrine testing and venous sampling in the investigation of severe androgen excess broadly emphasizes the use of dynamic testing as an adjunct investigation. It assists in localizing the source of severe androgen excess in cases where:

- **The clinical and/or biochemical features**: are not consistent with PCOS or CAH.
- **Imaging has not identified**: a clear adrenal or ovarian mass.
- **The biochemical phenotype**: is equivocal for adrenal or ovarian‐derived disease.

Patients showing clinical and biochemical signs of severe androgen excess with a detected adrenal or ovarian tumor on cross-sectional imaging can typically proceed to surgical intervention without delay, particularly in cases of suspected ACC. However, incidental adnexal masses frequently occur in postmenopausal women, with a prevalence in asymptomatic women of 3.3%–18%. Similarly, adrenal incidentalomas are detected in at least 5% of the general population, most of which are benign and non‐functioning.

While androgen-producing adrenal tumors are typically apparent on imaging, ovarian tumors may remain radiologically occult due to their small size. Therefore, a detected incidental tumor may not be the source of androgen excess. Moreover, the poor sensitivity of cross-sectional imaging in detecting small ovarian tumors does not exclude neoplastic ovarian androgen excess. This underlines the potential importance of biochemical localization with additional dynamic testing in selected cases before surgical intervention.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American College of Endocrinology, and Androgen Excess and PCOS Society disease state clinical review: Guide to the best practices in the evaluation and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome — Part 1 [^1166eTPA]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is recognized as the most common endocrine disorder among reproductive-aged women worldwide. This document, produced by the collaboration of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AES), aims to highlight the most important clinical issues confronting physicians and their patients with PCOS. It summarizes the best practices as of 2015. PCOS has been defined using various criteria, including menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM).

- **Diagnosis criteria**: General agreement exists among specialty society guidelines that the diagnosis of PCOS must be based on the presence of at least two of the following three criteria: chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism (clinical or biological), and polycystic ovaries.

- **Clinical assessment**: There is a need for careful clinical assessment of women's history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation, emphasizing the accuracy and validity of the methodology used for both biochemical measurements and ovarian imaging.

- **Hormonal measurements**: Free testosterone (T) levels are more sensitive than the measurement of total T for establishing the existence of androgen excess and should ideally be determined through equilibrium dialysis techniques. The value of measuring levels of androgens other than T in patients with PCOS is relatively low.

- **Ultrasound diagnostics**: New ultrasound machines allow diagnosis of PCOM in patients having at least 25 small follicles (2 to 9 mm) in the whole ovary. Ovarian size at 10 mL remains the threshold between normal and increased ovary size.

### Prevalence of low bone mineral density in a low-income inner-city population [^116HK6Dt]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

Biochemical measurements were conducted in the Clinical Trials Unit at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Hormonal measurements included free testosterone (fT), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and estradiol, collected from morning serum samples between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m.

Free testosterone was measured by equilibrium dialysis (Esoterix, Inc, Austin, TX, USA), with a normal range of 52 to 280 ng/dL for men. Intraassay coefficients of variation (CV) ranged from 6.6% to 9.4%, and interassay CVs ranged from 9.1% to 11.9%. Males were considered hypogonadal if they had an fT level of less than 52 ng/dL or were on testosterone-replacement therapy. Estradiol was measured by radioimmunoassay (Esoterix, Inc.), with intra- and interassay CVs of 5.2% and 8.0%, respectively. This variable was divided into tertiles from lowest (1) to highest (3) when evaluating its relation to bone mineral density (BMD).

LH and FSH were measured by immunochemiluminometric assay (ICMA). The intra- and interassay CVs were 3.4% and 3.8% respectively for LH, and 3.2% and 6.7% respectively for FSH. Females were considered postmenopausal if they had an FSH concentration of less than 50 mIU/mL, were of age 51 years or greater, or if they self-reported menopause when the FSH level was greater than 30 and 50 mIU/mL or less.

### Opposing effects of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and free testosterone on metabolic phenotype in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^114v2iKr]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

To study the association of adrenal and ovarian androgen levels with metabolic parameters in a large cohort of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), this cross-sectional study was conducted at the outpatient clinic of an academic hospital with 622 women with PCOS as participants.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Main outcome measures**: The analysis focused on the association of endocrine dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and free testosterone (FT) parameters with metabolic measurements.

- **Results**: In multivariate adjusted logistic regression analyses, the odds ratio (OR) for insulin resistance was statistically significantly higher (4.42, range: 2.26–8.67) for women with PCOS who had elevated FT levels compared with women with normal DHEAS and FT levels (reference group). There were no statistically significant differences when comparing women with PCOS with elevated DHEAS or a combined elevation of DHEAS and FT levels to the reference group. Women with PCOS and a high DHEAS/FT ratio demonstrated a more beneficial metabolic profile compared with women with a low DHEAS/FT ratio. In multivariate adjusted binary logistic regression analyses, a statistically significantly lower risk for insulin resistance was found in women with PCOS in the highest DHEAS/FT-ratio quartile compared with those in the lowest quartile (OR 0.35, range: 0.14–0.89).

- **Conclusions**: These findings suggest that distinguishing between adrenal and ovarian hyperandrogenism is crucial when evaluating metabolic risk in PCOS.

### Low neuroactive steroids identifies a biological subtype of depression in adults with human immunodeficiency virus on suppressive antiretroviral therapy [^112yGcP6]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

High cortisol/dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) ratio is associated with high depressive symptoms in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected adults receiving antiretroviral therapy.

- **Volcano plots**: In the discovery set (n = 55) and validation set (n = 44), they illustrate statistical significance of the fold change for neuroactive steroid metabolites (blue data points) and cortisol/steroid ratios (red data points) in participants with high versus low depressive symptoms.

- **Beeswarm plots**: Display individual participant levels of cortisol (left panels), DHEA-S (middle panels), and cortisol/DHEA-S ratios (right panels) in participants with low versus high depressive symptoms in discovery (top panels) and validation (bottom panels) cohorts. DHEA-S levels are lower in participants with high versus low depressive symptoms, while cortisol levels are similar. Low DHEA-S accounts for high cortisol/DHEA-S ratios observed in participants with high depressive symptoms (P < .01). Horizontal bars represent means; error bars indicate standard deviations. Significance was calculated using unpaired t tests, and P values are shown for comparisons.

- **ROC curve analysis**: From logistic regression models assessing classification of participants with low versus high depressive symptoms using cortisol/DHEA-S ratio (z score) or cortisol/DHEA-S ratio with androstenediol (3β,17β) monosulfate (1) (androstene) and pregnenolone sulfate in the discovery (left panels) and validation (right panels) cohorts.

### Effect of dehydroepiandrosterone replacement on insulin sensitivity and lipids in hypoadrenal women [^115mbDUS]. Diabetes (2005). High credibility.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) replacement is not part of the standard of care in hypoadrenal subjects. Animal studies have shown that DHEA administration prevents diabetes. To determine the physiological effect of DHEA replacement on insulin sensitivity in adrenal-deficient women, we performed a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 28 hypoadrenal women (mean age 50.2 ± 2.87 years) who received a single 50-mg dose of DHEA daily or placebo. After 12 weeks, insulin sensitivity was assessed using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.

DHEA replacement significantly increased DHEA-S (sulfated ester of DHEA), bioavailable testosterone, as well as androstenedione and reduced sex hormone-binding globulin levels. Fasting plasma insulin and glucagon were lower with DHEA (42 ± 4.94 vs. 53 ± 6.58 pmol/l [P = 0.005] and 178 ± 11.32 vs. 195.04 ± 15 pmol/l [P = 0.02], respectively). The average amount of glucose needed to maintain similar blood glucose levels while infusing the same insulin dosages was higher during DHEA administration (358 ± 24.7 vs. 320 ± 24.6 mg/min; P < 0.05), whereas endogenous glucose production was similar. DHEA also reduced total cholesterol (P < 0.005), triglycerides (P < 0.011), LDL cholesterol (P < 0.05), and HDL cholesterol (P < 0.005).

In conclusion, replacement therapy with 50 mg of DHEA for 12 weeks significantly increased insulin sensitivity in hypoadrenal women, thereby suggesting that DHEA replacement could have a potential impact in preventing type 2 diabetes.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^114HCSmr]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

In PCOS, there is evidence of not only increased ovarian androgens but also increased adrenal androgen secretion. Distinct ovarian and adrenal androgen excess phenotypes may coexist. Women with PCOS show a greater decline in androgen concentrations after the suppression of adrenal steroidogenesis using dexamethasone than controls without PCOS. Adrenal-derived 11-oxygenated androgens are a significant androgenic subclass in women with PCOS. Additionally, androgen concentrations increase more after synthetic ACTH stimulation in women with PCOS than in controls without PCOS. Animal models have demonstrated that the steroidogenic cells of the adrenal zona reticularis, like the theca cells of the ovary, have an increased capacity to synthesize androgens. Insulin may act as a co-factor in adrenal as well as ovarian androgen synthesis.

- **Congenital adrenal hyperplasia**: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) comprises a group of autosomal recessive disorders that result from monogenic defects in selected critical steroidogenic enzymes. Mutations in the CYP21A2 gene on chromosome 6 cause 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD), which accounts for 95% of cases. 21OHD may be subclassified into classic and non-classic phenotypes according to the severity of loss in enzymatic activity. The classical form is characterized by severely reduced or absent enzymatic activity, resulting in cortisol deficiency, which can be associated with impaired aldosterone production in 75% of cases. Classic CAH typically manifests clinically in the neonatal period, presenting with ambiguous genitalia.

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^1152Aw9U]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

Our findings align with previous research indicating that a 50 mg/day dose of DHEA significantly elevates both testosterone and estradiol levels. A narrative review reported that supplementation with 50 mg of DHEA led to peak estradiol levels that may offer estrogenic benefits, such as improved bone health and protection against bone loss. These results are further supported by other meta-analyses that reported similar hormonal increases following DHEA supplementation.

Our review also observed a significant increase in testosterone levels with DHEA supplementation administered for ≥ 26 weeks. In line with this, the review conducted by Wierman et al. evaluated the effect of DHEA over a long period in older women and found that both estradiol and testosterone levels significantly increased. A prospective clinical trial found that 50 mg/day of DHEA led to a higher estradiol concentration and testosterone levels after 6 months of treatment. These findings highlight the dynamic, time-dependent hormonal response to DHEA supplementation.

Biochemically, DHEA serves as a precursor to both estrogens as well as androgens. Once converted to DHEA sulfate in the liver, it undergoes further enzymatic transformation in peripheral tissues, where it contributes to the synthesis of active estrogens as well as androgens, including estradiol and testosterone.

It is important to note that elevated levels of estradiol can have adverse effects, such as stimulating the endometrium. Consequently, prolonged high estradiol levels may increase the risk of developing endometrial carcinoma. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor these levels during extended supplementation.

### Increases in bone mineral density in response to oral dehydroepiandrosterone replacement in older adults appear to be mediated by serum estrogens [^112sCDnB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). High credibility.

The mechanisms by which dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) replacement increases bone mineral density (BMD) in older adults are not known. The aims were to determine the effects of DHEA therapy on changes in sex hormones and IGF-I and their associations with changes in BMD.

A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at an academic research institution. Participants were 58 women and 61 men, aged 60–88 years, with low serum DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) levels. The intervention was oral DHEA 50 mg/d or placebo for 12 months.

- **Main outcome measures**: BMD and serum DHEAS, testosterone, estradiol (E(2)), estrone (E(1)), SHBG, IGF-I, and IGF binding protein 3 were measured before and after intervention. Free testosterone and estrogen (FEI) indices were calculated.

The average changes in hip and spine BMD (DHEA vs. placebo) ranged from 1.1 to 1.6%. Compared with placebo, DHEA replacement increased serum DHEAS, testosterone, free testosterone index, E(1), E(2), FEI, and IGF-I (all P < 0.001) and decreased SHBG (P = 0.02) in women; in men, increased DHEAS, E(1), FEI (all P < 0.001), and E(2) (P = 0.02) and decreased SHBG (P = 0.037). The changes in total and regional hip BMD were associated with 12-month E(2) (all P ≤ 0.001) and FEI (all P ≤ 0.013). The effects of DHEA treatment were eliminated by adjustment for 12-month E(2).

The significant increases in hip BMD in older adults undergoing DHEA replacement were mediated primarily by increases in serum E(2) rather than DHEA.

### Society for endocrinology UK guidance on the initial evaluation of an infant or an adolescent with a suspected disorder of sex development (revised 2015) [^1155XWp5]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

46, XY DSD with low testosterone and high steroid precursors occurs due to several variants of CAH, primarily 17α-hydroxylase (CYP17A1) deficiency, PORD, and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (3βHSD2) deficiency. These conditions result from inactivating mutations in the CYP17A1, POR, and HSD3B2 genes, respectively. Additionally, 46, XY DSD with low testosterone and increased precursors is found in individuals with 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 (17βHSD3) deficiency, caused by HSD17B3 mutations.

Deficiency of CYP17A1 results in CAH in about 1% of 46, XY DSD cases. Affected individuals typically present with female genitalia and low levels of DHEA, androstenedione, and testosterone. There is an increase in mineralocorticoid synthesis, and although cortisol deficiency is rare, corticosterone can bind and activate the glucocorticoid receptor. In PORD, sex steroids are low or sometimes low-normal, while pregnenolone, progesterone, and their metabolites accumulate due to the combined block of CYP21A2 and CYP17A1 activities. Although there is often a relative preponderance of mineralocorticoid over glucocorticoid metabolites in affected cases, hypertension only appears in adolescence or later. Baseline glucocorticoid secretion is generally sufficient; however, in most cases, the stress response to ACTH is significantly impaired, necessitating at least stress dose hydrocortisone cover or permanent glucocorticoid.

### Effects of DHEA replacement on bone mineral density and body composition in elderly women and men [^116DGA23]. Clinical Endocrinology (2000). Low credibility.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a precursor for both estrogens as well as androgens. Its marked decline with aging may influence age-related changes in tissues influenced by sex hormones. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of DHEA replacement on bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition in elderly women and men with low serum DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) levels.

- **Design**: Prospective 6-month trial of oral DHEA replacement, 50 mg/day.

- **Patients**: Experimental subjects were 10 women and eight men, aged 73 ± 1 years. Control subjects were 10 women and eight men, aged 74 ± 1 years.

- **Measurements**: BMD, body composition, serum markers of bone turnover, serum lipids and lipoproteins, oral glucose tolerance, serum IGF-I, total serum estrogens, and testosterone.

- **Results**: BMD of the total body and lumbar spine increased (mean ± SEM; 1.6 ± 0.6% and 2.5 ± 0.8%, respectively; both P ≤ 0.05), fat mass decreased (-1.3 ± 0.4 kg; P < 0.01), and fat-free mass increased (0.9 ± 0.4 kg; P ≤ 0.05) in response to DHEA replacement. DHEA replacement also resulted in increases in serum IGF-I (from 108 ± 8 to 143 ± 7 µg/l; P < 0.01) and total serum testosterone concentrations (from 10.7 ± 1.2 to 15.6 ± 1.8 nmol/l in the men and from 2.1 ± 0.2 to 4.5 ± 0.4 nmol/l in the women; both P ≤ 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: The results provide preliminary evidence that DHEA replacement in elderly women and men with very low serum DHEAS levels can partially reverse age-related changes in fat mass, fat-free mass, and BMD, and raise the possibility of further investigation.

### Androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone or testosterone) for women undergoing assisted reproduction [^115TaAgw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Infertility is a condition affecting 10% to 15% of couples of reproductive age. It is generally defined as "the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse". The treatment of infertility may involve manipulation of gametes or of the embryos themselves. These techniques are collectively known as assisted reproductive technology (ART). Practitioners consistently seek alternative or adjunct treatments in the hope of improving ART outcomes. This Cochrane review focuses on the adjunct use of synthetic versions of two naturally-produced hormones, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and testosterone (T), in assisted reproduction. DHEA and its derivative testosterone are steroid hormones proposed to increase conception rates by positively affecting follicular response to gonadotropin stimulation, leading to greater oocyte yields and, in turn, an increased chance of pregnancy.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of DHEA and testosterone as pre- or co-treatments in subfertile women undergoing assisted reproduction.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases, trial registers, and websites up to 12 March 2015: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, electronic trial registers for ongoing and registered trials, citation indexes, conference abstracts in the Web of Science, PubMed, and OpenSIGLE.

### Plasma testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in male and female patients with dysthymic disorder [^117YCpRf]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Depressive symptomatology has been connected with activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and, in several studies, with reduced androgen levels, while administration of androgens, usually in older subjects, may have positive effects on mood both in males and females. Regarding dysthymic disorder (DD), low serum testosterone levels have been reported in older males, while information on younger male or female patients is lacking.

- **Methods**: We assessed the serum levels of testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and cortisol in male and female patients with DD and compared them to the levels of sex- and age-matched controls. Eighteen male and 43 female patients in the age range of 22 to 71 years were studied and diagnosed according to the Scheduled Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders (SCID). Depressive symptomatology was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Subgroups with subjects below or over 50 years of age were also built and compared.

- **Results**: Serum T levels were lower than controls mainly in the subjects aged below 50 years, in both genders. More pronounced were reductions in DHEAS levels both in male and female patients, while cortisol levels were normal or reduced. T levels were positively correlated to both DHEAS and cortisol. The negative correlations of DHEAS and T to age were significant for all groups and subgroups, except in the group of male patients. Four male patients (22%) had T levels below 2.0 ng/ml.

- **Conclusions**: Male and female patients with DD aged below 50 years show reduced levels of testosterone and DHEAS compared to controls. The findings suggest a significant correlation between reduced androgen levels and dysthymic disorder, particularly in younger patients.

### Society for Endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^111YSQq2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Adrenal imaging should urgently be undertaken in premenopausal women with severe biochemical disturbance characterized by a significant elevation of adrenal androgens (DHEAS and A4) and testosterone, as well as in all postmenopausal women with new-onset clinical and/or biochemical androgen excess. The recommended first-line investigation is an urgent unenhanced CT of the adrenal glands to better characterize a potential adrenal mass. CT imaging has a 99% sensitivity for ACC with a cut-off of over 20 HU; however, its specificity is poor. This can lead to increased detection of adrenal incidentalomas, particularly in older patients, necessitating multidisciplinary team involvement to guide decision-making to prevent unnecessary surgical intervention.

MRI can also be used to assess for adrenal gland neoplasia. Chemical-shift imaging can differentiate benign from malignant tumors by examining for signal loss on in-and-out-of-phase MRI. 18 FDG-PET is another imaging modality that can help differentiate between benign and malignant adrenal masses. This modality is highly sensitive to detecting metabolic changes but has poor spatial resolution for anatomical localization and specificity, with a significant proportion of benign adenomas demonstrating tracer uptake.

Case studies have demonstrated the utility of iodine-131 6-beta-monomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NP-59) scintigraphy in localizing pathologic sources of ovarian and adrenal androgen excess. In documented cases, androgen-secreting ovarian and adrenal tumors were successfully identified.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials of DHEA treatment effects on quality of life in women with adrenal insufficiency [^1144UNK4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). High credibility.

Women with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency report a decreased health-related quality of life (HRQOL) despite traditional adrenal replacement therapy. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been studied as an agent to improve HRQOL in these patients.

- **Objective**: We sought to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of DHEA effects on HRQOL in women with adrenal insufficiency.

- **Data sources**: We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycInfo) and reference lists of eligible studies through July 2008.

- **Study selection**: Eligible trials randomly assigned women with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency to either DHEA or control and measured the effect of treatment on HRQOL.

- **Data extraction**: Reviewers working independently and in duplicate assessed the methodological quality of trials and collected data on patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes.

- **Data synthesis**: We found 10 eligible trials that measured HRQOL and depression, anxiety, and sexual function. Random-effects meta-analysis showed a small improvement in HRQOL in women treated with DHEA compared with placebo [effect size of 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.08 to 0.33; inconsistency (I²) = 32%]. There was a small beneficial effect of DHEA on depression; effects on anxiety and sexual well-being were also small and not statistically significant.

- **Conclusions**: DHEA may improve, in a small and perhaps trivial manner, HRQOL and depression in women with adrenal insufficiency. There was no significant effect observed on anxiety and sexual well-being.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^114kXfbP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations**:

- **Measurement of testosterone, female sexual dysfunction, and endogenous androgen levels**: Recommendations pertaining to the measurement of circulating testosterone in women suggest that testosterone may act directly via the androgen receptor, nongenomic androgenic action, or by reduction to the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone and/or aromatization to estradiol and their metabolites.

	- Testosterone concentrations decline during the reproductive years (Level IIB). However, testosterone concentrations appear to be maintained in women beyond the age of 65 years, but whether this confers a benefit is yet to be understood (Level IIB).

	- Total testosterone can be measured with high accuracy and reproducibility using liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assays (Grade B). Direct assays for the measurement of total and free testosterone are highly unreliable in the female range (Grade A). Reference laboratories should be harmonized with biological standards in coordination with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Expert Opinion).

	- Measurement of testosterone using direct assays in clinical practice is appropriate if liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assay is not available, to exclude high baseline concentrations, and also to exclude supraphysiological concentrations during treatment (Expert Opinion). Research into testosterone physiology and clinical effects should mainly focus on measuring total testosterone as the main biomarker rather than "free" testosterone, because evidence that "free" testosterone is the biological form is lacking.

### Approach to androgen excess in women: Clinical and biochemical insights [^111XiV8b]. Clinical endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

- **DHEAS**: DHEAS is water soluble and is present in large quantities, circulating in the micromolar range in serum. It may be measured with either RIA or LC-MS/MS; however, the use of the latter is not critical due to its significantly higher circulating concentration than serum T in women. Severe DHEAS elevation in premenopausal women is still most likely attributable to PCOS, but in the postmenopausal phase of life, the likelihood of ACC is extremely high (Figures 3 and 4). Nonetheless, we recommend imaging all premenopausal women with DHEAS elevations > 20 μmol/L, and all postmenopausal women with levels in excess of 5 μmol/L presenting with androgen excess.

- **11-oxygenated androgens**: 11-oxygenated androgens are currently not routinely available in most clinical biochemistry laboratories. Their wider clinical availability in the future may represent an additional diagnostic tool for the clinician in the evaluation of androgen excess. Areas for future research include the utility of 11-oxygenated androgens to differentiate between adrenal and ovarian hyperandrogenism, as biomarkers of disease control in CAH, and in discriminating between nonclassic CAH and more severe forms of PCOS. It also remains to be elucidated whether 11-oxygenated androgens may play a role as surrogate markers of metabolic risk in women with PCOS. 11OHA4 can only be generated by adrenal CYP11B1 activity and, therefore, in theory, should be helpful in discriminating between underlying adrenal and ovarian pathology in the workup of androgen excess.

- **Dexamethasone suppression testing**:

### The hypoandrogenic woman: Pathophysiologic overview [^117TcpYS]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

To review the pathophysiologic changes associated with androgen insufficiency in females, a review of the English-language literature from 1940 to 2001 was conducted. Data suggest that diminished androgen levels, most frequently noted in surgically menopausal patients, may be associated with a number of symptoms including reduced sexual libido and desire, loss of motivation, flat affect, and reduced energy. The lack of consensus in defining abnormally low values for free and total serum androgen levels has made the definition of hypoandrogenic states difficult.

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^115eSUxm]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

- **Search strategy**: A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify relevant studies published prior to June 11, 2024, using the PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. No restrictions were placed on publication year. The search strategy combined Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and free-text terms, including the following keywords and Boolean combinations: ("DHEA" OR "Prasterone" OR "Dehydroepiandrosterone" OR "DHEAS") AND (Postmenopause OR Postmenopausal) AND ("clinical trials" OR "single-blind method" OR "double-blind method" OR "cross-over studies" OR "controlled trial" OR "RCT" OR "random allocation" OR "intervention studies" OR "intervention" OR "randomized" OR "randomised" OR "randomly" OR "random" OR "assignment" OR "placebo"). Additionally, the reference lists of all identified articles were manually screened by two independent reviewers to ensure a thorough search.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) Participants were postmenopausal women; (2) The study included an intervention group receiving DHEA supplementation and a control group not receiving DHEA; (3) The study reported mean and standard deviation (SD) values for serum estradiol and/or testosterone concentrations.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Editorials, commentaries, letters, case reports, and family-based studies; (2) Studies for which relevant data could not be obtained; (3) Articles not published.

### Improvement in mood and fatigue after dehydroepiandrosterone replacement in Addison's disease in a randomized, double blind trial [^114QZruq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2000). High credibility.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) are adrenal precursors of steroid biosynthesis and centrally acting neurosteroids. Glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiencies in Addison's disease require lifelong hormone replacement, but the associated failure of DHEA synthesis is not corrected. We conducted a randomized, double-blind study in which 39 patients with Addison's disease received either 50 mg oral DHEA daily for 12 weeks, followed by a 4-week washout period, then 12 weeks of placebo, or vice versa.

After DHEA treatment, levels of DHEAS and Delta(4)-androstenedione rose from subnormal to within the adult physiological range. Total testosterone increased from subnormal to low normal with a fall in serum sex hormone-binding globulin in females, but with no change in either parameter in males. In both sexes, psychological assessment showed significant enhancement of self-esteem with a tendency for improved overall well-being. Mood and fatigue also improved significantly, with benefits being evident in the evenings.

No effects on cognitive or sexual function, body composition, lipids, or bone mineral density were observed. Our results indicate that DHEA replacement corrects this steroid deficiency effectively and improves some aspects of psychological function. Beneficial effects in males, independent of circulating testosterone levels, suggest that it may act directly on the central nervous system rather than by augmenting peripheral androgen biosynthesis. These positive effects, in the absence of significant adverse events, suggest a role for DHEA replacement therapy in treating Addison's disease.

### Androgens in women: Androgen-mediated skin disease and patient evaluation [^111zMuoC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Androgens are produced throughout the body in steroid-producing organs, such as the adrenal glands and ovaries, and in other tissues, like the skin. Several androgens are normally found in women, including dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, as well as androstenedione. These androgens are essential in the development of several common cutaneous conditions in women, such as acne, hirsutism, and female pattern hair loss (FPHL). These are categorized as androgen-mediated cutaneous disorders (AMCDs). However, the role of androgens in the pathophysiology of these diseases is complicated and incompletely understood.

In the first article in this Continuing Medical Education series, we discuss the role of the skin in androgen production and the impact of androgens on the skin in women. Specifically, we review the necessary but insufficient role that androgens play in the development of acne, hirsutism, and FPHL in women. Dermatologists face the challenge of differentiating physiologic from pathologic presentations of AMCDs in women. There are currently no dermatology guidelines outlining the indications for endocrinologic evaluation in women presenting with acne, hirsutism, or FPHL. We review the available evidence regarding when to consider an endocrinologic workup in women presenting with AMCDs, including the appropriate type and timing of testing.

### The value of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate measurements in the assessment of adrenal function [^116VVDEp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfated ester (DHEA-S) are corticotropin-dependent adrenal androgen precursors that are uniformly low in treated patients with corticotropin deficiency. There are no data investigating the diagnostic value of DHEA-S measurements in the prospective assessment of adrenal function. This study examined serum DHEA-S levels as possible markers for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function in patients with large pituitary adenomas.

Patients were characterized to have normal HPA (n = 47) or abnormal HPA (ABN-HPA, n = 35) function based on their respective responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Patients also underwent low-dose Cortrosyn (1 micro g, LDC) and standard-dose Cortrosyn stimulation testing. All patients with abnormal HPA had very low age- and gender-matched serum DHEA-S levels. When the normal response to LDC was set at a cortisol level of at least 18.1 micro g/dl, 10 of 31 patients with abnormal HPA exhibited normal responses.

Receiver operating characteristic curves for baseline DHEA-S and for maximal cortisol responses to LDC had areas of 0.984 (confidence interval, 0.962–1.000) and 0.893 (confidence interval, 0.817–0.969), respectively. LDC- or SDC-stimulated serum cortisol levels have significant limitations in defining HPA function. A normal age- and gender-specific serum DHEA-S level makes the diagnosis of corticotropin deficiency extremely unlikely. However, when serum DHEA-S levels are low, further testing is necessary to define HPA function.

### Oral dehydroepiandrosterone replacement in older adults: Effects on central adiposity, glucose metabolism and blood lipids [^1177CU7u]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). High credibility.

To determine the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) therapy on changes in central adiposity, insulin action, and blood lipids, researchers conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Many of the actions of DHEA in humans are thought to be mediated through its conversion to sex hormones, which are modulators of adiposity, muscularity, and insulin sensitivity.

- **Design**: The intervention involved oral DHEA at 50 mg/day or a placebo for 12 months.
- **Participants**: The study included fifty-eight women and 61 men, aged 60–88 years, with low serum DHEA sulphate (DHEAS) levels at study entry.
- **Measurements**: Computed tomography measures of abdominal fat areas, thigh muscle and fat areas, DXA-derived trunk fat mass, serum glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose challenge, and fasted serum total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides were assessed before and after the intervention.

Results indicated no significant differences (P > 0.05) between the DHEA and placebo groups in changes in regional tissue composition or glucose metabolism. However, HDL-cholesterol (P = 0.01) and fasted triglycerides (P = 0.02) decreased in women and men taking DHEA.

The conclusion suggests that restoring serum DHEAS levels in older adults to young adult levels for one year does not reduce central adiposity or improve insulin action. The benefit of DHEA on decreasing serum triglycerides must be weighed against the HDL-lowering effect.

### Approach to investigation of hyperandrogenism in a postmenopausal woman [^117NNqfZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

When a patient is not a suitable candidate for surgery for a benign ovarian cause of severe hyperandrogenism, treatment with GnRH analogs is an alternative. Depending on the menopausal status of the patient, she may experience symptoms of estrogen withdrawal; in this situation, estrogen add-back therapy could be considered. Estrogen substitution is also important to consider during long-term treatment with GnRH analogs, given the risk of accelerated bone loss.

The primary treatment for androgen-secreting adrenal tumors is adrenalectomy for histopathological diagnosis of malignant or benign tumor. Complete surgical resection can be sufficient therapy. In cases of malignancy, adjuvant therapy with mitotane, chemotherapy, or radiation may be used. Adrenal function must be closely monitored after surgery for the detection of adrenal insufficiency or tumor recurrence.

Postmenopausal women with testosterone levels below 5 nmol/L and a history of PCOS with persistent or aggravating hyperandrogenic symptoms are treated with antiandrogen therapy. There are different types of antiandrogens with various mechanisms of action and potential side effects. Ovarian androgen overproduction can be inhibited by GnRH analogues, as mentioned above; androgen effects can be blocked by androgen receptor blockers (spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, flutamide), or by a 5α-reductase inhibitor (finasteride) blocking the conversion of testosterone to DHT, which is the most potent androgen in peripheral tissue. However, treatment of metabolic symptoms with metformin or other substances has limited effect on hyperandrogenism.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^111jUCQF]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Virilising ovarian tumours (VOTs) are predominantly benign tumors that can present at any age, with 25% presenting post-menopausally. The prevalence of VOTs in post-menopausal women with hyperandrogenism is approximately 2.7%. About 5%–8% of ovarian tumours are hormonally active, and 1% secrete androgens. Androgen-secreting tumours derive from sex-cord and stromal cells of the ovary.

- **Who classification of primary ovarian tumours**: Primary ovarian tumours can be grouped into epithelial and non-epithelial categories according to the WHO classification. Androgen-secreting tumours typically arise from the sex-cord and stromal cells of the ovary.

- **Clinical algorithm for the investigation of androgen excess in women**: The diagnostic approach should be divided into routine or urgent pathways based on the presence or absence of a number of central clinical and biochemical factors. Baseline biochemical work up includes FSH, LH, oestradiol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP), testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), androstenedione (A4), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and prolactin (PRL). Other relevant tests include FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), LH (luteinising hormone), OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test), ONDST (overnight dexamethasone suppression test), PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), PET (positron emission tomography), and UFC (urinary free cortisol).

Sertoli-Leydig cell tumours (SLCT) are the most common type in premenopausal women, whereas Leydig cell tumours (LCT) are the most common pathology after menopause. Granulosa cell tumours (GCT) account for 70% of primary ovarian neoplasms in general.

### Diagnosing and treating hair loss [^112bdEqK]. American Family Physician (2009). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for androgenetic alopecia, specifically in relation to laboratory evaluation, the AAFP 2009 guidelines recommend obtaining a targeted endocrine evaluation. This includes measuring testosterone, DHEAS, and prolactin levels in female patients who present with hair loss associated with abnormal menses, a history of infertility, hirsutism, unresponsive cystic acne, virilization, or galactorrhea.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1136CcxY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those with a body mass index > 25 kg/m² and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations.

Clinicians are faced with the question of whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### Approach to androgen excess in women: Clinical and biochemical insights [^117VSXg4]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Androgen excess in women typically presents clinically with hirsutism, acne, or androgenic alopecia. In the vast majority of cases, the underlying etiology is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common chronic condition that affects up to 10% of all women. Identification of women with non-PCOS pathology within large cohorts of patients presenting with androgen excess represents a diagnostic challenge for endocrinologists. Rare pathologies, including nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, severe insulin resistance syndromes, Cushing's disease, or androgen-secreting tumors of the ovary or adrenal gland may be missed without a pragmatic screening approach.

Detailed clinical history, physical examination, and biochemical phenotyping are critical in risk-stratifying women at the highest risk of non-PCOS disorders. Red flag features, such as rapid onset symptoms, overt virilization, postmenopausal onset, or severe biochemical disturbances, should prompt investigations for underlying neoplastic pathology, including dynamic testing and imaging where appropriate. This review outlines a proposed diagnostic approach to androgen excess in women, introduces androgen metabolism, and provides a suggested algorithmic strategy to identify non-PCOS pathology according to clinical and biochemical phenotype.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone restores hepatocellular function and prevents liver damage in estrogen-deficient females following trauma and hemorrhage [^116uvacN]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2001). Low credibility.

Recent studies have shown that the administration of the sex steroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in males following trauma-hemorrhagic shock has beneficial effects on the depressed cardiovascular and immunological functions under those conditions. Given the gender-specific effects of sex steroids, we examined the potential benefits of DHEA on hepatocellular function in female rats with low estrogen levels following trauma-hemorrhage.

- **Methods**: Ovariectomy was performed in female Sprague-Dawley rats 14 days prior to the experiments. The animals then underwent a 5-cm midline laparotomy and were subjected to hemorrhagic shock (40 mm Hg for 90 minutes). This procedure was followed by fluid resuscitation with Ringer's lactate over 60 minutes and the subcutaneous administration of DHEA (30 mg/kg BW) or vehicle at the end of resuscitation. At 24 hours post-resuscitation, hepatocellular function, measured by the clearance of indocyanine green (ICG), and hepatocyte damage, assessed by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), were evaluated. Plasma levels of DHEA and 17beta-estradiol were also assayed.

- **Results**: Vehicle-treated rats displayed significantly reduced hepatocellular function, increased ALT activity, and decreased levels of 17beta-estradiol following trauma-hemorrhage compared to sham-operated animals (P < 0.05, ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls test). In contrast, animals receiving DHEA post-trauma-hemorrhage showed hepatocellular function and ALT activity akin to sham-operated animals. However, DHEA administration did not affect plasma levels of 17beta-estradiol.

- **Conclusions**: Administration of DHEA restores hepatocellular function and mitigates liver damage in estrogen-deficient female rats following trauma and hemorrhage, although it does not alter plasma 17beta-estradiol levels.

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^11142odu]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

In humans and other mammals, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a vital prohormone primarily produced by the adrenal glands. It serves as a precursor to biologically active androgens and estrogens. After being synthesized in the adrenal cortex, DHEA is taken up by various tissues, including the liver, gonads, kidneys, and brain, where it is metabolized into different steroid hormones depending on the specific tissue context. In the bloodstream, DHEA is largely converted into its sulfated form, DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), which circulates at much higher concentrations and can be further metabolized into active sex hormones as needed.

DHEA levels decline significantly with age, decreasing by approximately 70% between the ages of 20 and 60, primarily due to reduced adrenal production. DHEA supplementation has been explored as an adjunct therapy for postmenopausal women, alongside hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and has demonstrated potential benefits in improving metabolic and endocrine function, as well as sexual health. DHEA exerts androgenic, estrogenic, and steroidal effects and has been associated with various biological functions, including antioxidant properties, neuroprotection, and anticancer activity. Supplementation may help maintain hormonal balance, enhance mood, support brain function, and potentially mitigate age-related decline.

Estradiol, the most potent female sex hormone, fluctuates throughout a woman's life and menstrual cycle. It plays a critical role in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by modulating the secretion of gonadotropins.

The 2016 ES guidelines recommend obtaining diagnostic testing to exclude PAI in acutely ill patients with otherwise unexplained symptoms or signs suggestive of PAI. These symptoms include volume depletion, hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, fever, abdominal pain, hyperpigmentation, or, especially in children, hypoglycemia.

### Sex steroid levels in women with hypopituitarism: A case-controlled observational study [^113fL3UG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Women with hypopituitarism remain at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Insufficient replacement of sex steroids has been suggested as a contributing factor, but sex steroid levels in women with hypopituitarism have not been comprehensively mapped.

- **Objective**: To quantify sex steroids in women with hypopituitarism by a high-sensitivity assay.

- **Methods**: Using a combination of clinical and biochemical criteria, women with hypopituitarism (n = 104) who started GH replacement from 1995 to 2014 at a single center were categorized as eugonadal or having hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). A population-based cohort of women (n = 288) served as controls. Eugonadal women and controls were categorized as pre-/postmenopausal, and HH women were categorized as younger/older (≤ or > 52 years). Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenedione, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, progesterone, 17αOH-progesterone, estradiol, and estrone were analyzed by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay.

- **Results**: Among both premenopausal/younger and postmenopausal/older women, those with HH had lower levels of sex steroid precursors (DHEA, androstenedione) as well as androgens (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone) than controls. Progesterone, 17αOH-progesterone, estrone, and estradiol showed similar patterns. Women with HH and ACTH deficiency had markedly lower concentrations of all sex hormones than those without ACTH deficiency.

- **Conclusion**: This study demonstrates for the first time a broad and severe sex steroid deficiency in both younger and older women with HH, particularly in those with additional ACTH deficiency.
