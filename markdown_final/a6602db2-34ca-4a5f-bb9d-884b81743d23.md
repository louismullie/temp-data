## Question

Cava filter in afib indications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for placing an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in a patient with atrial fibrillation (AF). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of AF-related thromboembolism and whether IVC filters can address it. Then, I should verify the established indications for IVC filters in venous thromboembolism (VTE) and whether AF changes those indications. Next, I will review contemporary guideline recommendations to ensure alignment. After that, I need to check the evidence base for IVC filters, including randomized trials and observational data. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and outline alternatives for AF stroke prevention, including anticoagulation and left atrial appendage occlusion where appropriate [^113metcE].

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology. AF predisposes to arterial embolism from the left atrial appendage that can cause ischemic stroke; this is an arterial thromboembolic process, not venous, so the embolic source is upstream of the aorta and not amenable to caval filtration, which only catches venous clots traveling from the legs/pelvis to the lungs. Wait, let me verify that I'm not conflating mechanisms: IVC filters are designed to trap venous thrombi en route to the pulmonary circulation, whereas AF emboli originate in the left heart and travel to the cerebral or systemic arteries, so an IVC filter cannot prevent AF-related stroke. Therefore, IVC filters have no role in AF-related stroke prevention, and AF alone is not an indication for filter placement [^1167puAU].

> Next, I should review the accepted indications for IVC filters in VTE. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check the guidelines. The strongest, recurrently endorsed indication is acute VTE (DVT and/or PE) with an absolute contraindication to therapeutic anticoagulation; some guidance also allows consideration after major complications of anticoagulation or, rarely, recurrent VTE despite appropriate anticoagulation once anticoagulation failure has been addressed. I should confirm that none of these scenarios hinge on AF status; indeed, AF is not listed as an indication, and filters are not recommended for patients who can receive therapeutic anticoagulation. Let me double-check: ACCP 2016 and the 2020 multisociety SIR/ACC/ACCP/AHA/SVS/SVM guideline align on these points, emphasizing restraint and timely retrieval when used [^111cE1G6] [^116d1Zy6] [^116bnTdQ] [^111Wg3Ph].

> I will now examine the evidence base to ensure I'm not over- or under-stating benefit. The PREPIC randomized trial showed that permanent IVC filters reduced PE but increased DVT without affecting mortality; PREPIC-2 in anticoagulated patients showed no reduction in recurrent PE at 3 months, reinforcing that filters add risk without clear benefit when anticoagulation is feasible. But wait, what if the patient has a contraindication to anticoagulation — does mortality improve then? Observational data in patients with VTE and a contraindication to anticoagulation have associated IVC filter placement with higher 30-day mortality after adjustment, underscoring uncertainty and the need for randomized data in that subgroup. Taken together, the net clinical benefit is narrow and largely limited to the scenario of acute VTE with a true, temporary contraindication to anticoagulation, with prompt filter removal once anticoagulation can be resumed [^116VpriD] [^113oLUfU] [^111mdpr9] [^116Xgrjo].

> Let me consider guideline nuance and edge cases. Initially, I thought there might be a role for filters in patients with AF who also have concomitant VTE and a bleeding risk; wait, I should verify that nuance. The multisociety guidance supports considering a retrievable filter in acute VTE when a contraindication to anticoagulation develops and there is ongoing significant PE risk, but it explicitly recommends against routine filters in patients already on therapeutic anticoagulation and emphasizes addressing anticoagulation failure rather than defaulting to a filter. So, even if AF coexists with VTE, the indication remains the same: only if there is a contraindication to anticoagulation and a compelling short-term need, with a plan for early retrieval once anticoagulation is safe again [^114th5fQ] [^112zoJ23] [^111Wg3Ph].

> Next, I should review alternatives for AF stroke prevention to avoid misdirected therapy. The appropriate strategy is antithrombotic therapy targeting the left atrial source: oral anticoagulation with warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) is first-line, and in selected patients with long-term contraindications to anticoagulation, left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) can be considered. Hold on, I should verify that LAAO is the device-based approach referenced alongside filters in bleeding guidance; yes, the ACC bleeding pathway notes LAAO devices and retrievable IVC filters as nonpharmacologic options in different contexts, reinforcing that LAAO — not IVC filters — is the mechanical strategy for AF stroke prevention when anticoagulation is unsuitable [^113metcE].

> I need to ensure practical safety steps are addressed if, despite all this, a filter was placed for a venous indication. If a retrievable filter is used, there must be a structured plan for early retrieval once anticoagulation can be initiated, ideally within weeks, because prolonged dwell time increases complications and lowers retrieval success. Let me double-check: SIR recommends structured follow-up programs to improve retrieval, and FDA communications have highlighted the importance of timely removal; real-world data show low retrieval rates without proactive systems, so embedding a retrieval workflow at the time of placement is essential [^115CyCZt] [^113bxVgo] [^111YDBj6] [^114a9nRA].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. AF alone is not an indication for an IVC filter, and placing a filter in AF without a venous indication is inappropriate. IVC filters should be reserved for well-defined venous indications — primarily acute VTE with an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation — with a plan for prompt retrieval once anticoagulation is feasible. For AF stroke prevention, use guideline-directed anticoagulation or consider LAAO when anticoagulation is permanently contraindicated, and avoid conflating venous and arterial thromboembolic pathways [^111cE1G6] [^116bnTdQ] [^113metcE].

IVC filters are **not indicated for atrial fibrillation (AF) alone** [^notfound]. They are only considered when AF coexists with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) and there is a **contraindication to anticoagulation** [^111cE1G6] or a major bleeding risk that precludes anticoagulation [^113metcE]. Routine use in AF without VTE is not supported by guidelines or evidence [^notfound], and filters should be removed as soon as anticoagulation is feasible to minimize complications [^113bxVgo] [^114VqKjX].

---

## Pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation and thromboembolism

AF is characterized by **atrial fibrillation** with stasis and endothelial dysfunction, which promotes thrombus formation — most often in the left atrial appendage — and leads to systemic embolization, notably stroke [^notfound]. The embolic source is **arterial**, not venous; therefore, IVC filters, which only intercept venous clots en route to the lungs, do not address AF-related embolism [^113bBDu4].

---

## Indications for IVC filter placement

IVC filters are indicated for **venous thromboembolism** when anticoagulation is contraindicated or has failed [^111cE1G6] [^113bBDu4]. The main indications include:

- **Acute VTE with contraindication to anticoagulation**: Acute DVT or PE when anticoagulation cannot be used due to bleeding risk or active bleeding [^111cE1G6] [^113WMr1L].

- **Failure of anticoagulation**: Recurrent VTE despite therapeutic anticoagulation [^113bBDu4].

- **High-risk surgical patients**: Temporary contraindications to anticoagulation in high-risk surgical patients [^117EMdhP].

Routine use in patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation is **not recommended** [^111Wg3Ph] [^116d1Zy6].

---

## Evidence and guidelines regarding IVC filters in AF

There is **no evidence or guideline support** for IVC filters in AF without VTE [^notfound]. Major society guidelines (ACC, AHA, ACCP, SIR) do not recommend IVC filters for AF alone [^notfound]. The ACCP 2016 guidelines explicitly recommend IVC filters only for acute VTE with a contraindication to anticoagulation [^111cE1G6], not for AF without VTE [^notfound]. The 2020 multisociety guideline similarly restricts filters to acute VTE with contraindications to anticoagulation and advises against routine placement in anticoagulated patients [^111Wg3Ph] [^117MYNKY].

---

## Risks and complications of IVC filters

IVC filters carry **significant risks**, including:

- **Thrombosis**: IVC thrombosis and lower-extremity DVT [^114a9nRA].

- **Migration and embolization**: Filter migration or embolization [^113DGtK8].

- **Fracture**: Filter fracture with embolization [^113DGtK8].

- **Retrieval complications**: Procedural risks during retrieval [^114VqKjX].

These risks outweigh any hypothetical benefit in AF without VTE, where there is no venous clot to intercept [^notfound].

---

## Alternative strategies for stroke prevention in AF

Effective, evidence-based alternatives exist for **stroke prevention in AF**. Anticoagulation with warfarin or DOACs is first-line and reduces stroke risk by about two-thirds [^notfound]. Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is a catheter-based option for patients with contraindications to long-term anticoagulation [^113metcE]. These therapies target the **arterial source** of emboli, unlike IVC filters [^111ey8VF].

---

## Clinical scenarios where IVC filters may be considered in AF patients

IVC filters may be considered in AF patients only when **AF coexists with acute VTE** and there is a contraindication to anticoagulation, such as active bleeding or a very high bleeding risk [^111cE1G6]. Even then, filters should be **retrieved promptly** once anticoagulation is feasible to minimize complications [^113bxVgo] [^114VqKjX].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

IVC filters are **not indicated for AF alone** [^116d1Zy6]. They are only for acute VTE when anticoagulation is contraindicated or has failed [^111cE1G6]. AF-related embolism is arterial; therefore, filters do not address the pathophysiology [^notfound]. Use anticoagulation or LAAO for stroke prevention in AF, and reserve IVC filters for appropriate venous indications with a plan for timely retrieval [^113bxVgo].

### Inferior vena cava filter use and patient safety: legacy or science? [^115rrHDQ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

There has been a dramatic increase in vena cava filter (VCF) use over the past 20 years in the absence of evidence that filters provide a net patient benefit or are required in most cases. This increase is largely attributable to the availability of retrievable filters and expanded indications, particularly as primary prophylaxis in patients thought to be at high risk of pulmonary embolism. Substantial variability in VCF use, unrelated to patient clinical factors, has been shown between hospitals, from region to region, and among various countries. Despite the lack of direct evidence for the benefit of VCFs for any indication, it is appropriate to insert a retrievable VCF in patients with a recent proximal deep vein thrombosis and an absolute contraindication to therapeutic anticoagulation and then to remove the filter once the bleeding risk decreases and the patient has been anticoagulated. Unfortunately, a high proportion of retrievable filters are not removed, even after the reason for their placement has long passed. Retrievable filters are associated with substantial rates of complications if they are not removed, including penetration of the vena caval wall, fracture and embolization of filter fragments, and caval occlusion. Patient safety priorities and medical-legal concerns mandate careful selection of patients for VCF placement and removal shortly after anticoagulation has been initiated.

### Retrievable vena cava filters: key considerations [^116sPSQb]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

Retrievable filters are a new generation of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters and represent an attractive option because they may be either left in place permanently or safely retrieved after a quite long period when they become unnecessary. In this review the currently available literature regarding retrievable IVC filters is summarized and their efficacy and safety is discussed. Moreover, the appropriate indications for their use are reviewed. Retrievable filters are becoming safer and easier to use; in fact the bioengineering research has optimized the technical characteristics of these devices, in order to reduce the incidence of possible complications. However, there are important unresolved issues, including the appropriate maximum implantation time, the possibility to safely and efficaciously remove the filters without being compromised by entrapped clots, and the use of anticoagulation during the implantation and periremoval periods. Large prospective cohort studies or randomized trials are strongly warranted to definitely clarify the beneficial role of these devices.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize currently available literature regarding indications for inferior vena cava filters, potential problems associated with the different filters available, and the efficacy and safety of retrievable inferior vena cava filters.

Recent Findings

The placement of permanent filters may present a number of long-term complications such as filter occlusion and an increased risk of recurrent deep vein thrombosis. Furthermore, patients who require inferior vena cava interruption often have short-term contraindications to anticoagulant therapy, and thus only require filters for temporary indications. Four different retrievable filters have recently received approval for temporary insertion, and preliminary data suggest that the use of these filters is associated with a low rate of pulmonary embolism and complications related to filter insertion. Retrieval was uneventful in almost all patients. No randomized clinical trials have yet been performed, and available information is based on the results of either retrospective or prospective cohort studies.

Summary

Retrievable filters are a very attractive alternative to either permanent or temporary filters when inferior vena cava interruption becomes necessary, thanks to the advantages of very easy management and the possibility of their being left in place for a long time and removed when they become unnecessary.

### Inferior vena cava filters: past, present, and future [^115Dg1np]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters have existed as a treatment option for VTE for decades. Advances in medical technology have provided physicians with several options for devices that can be placed on either a permanent or temporary basis; however, there are limited data from randomized, controlled trials on the appropriate use of IVC filters. This contemporary review summarizes the history of IVC filters and the types that are available in clinical practice. It reviews the literature on the use of IVC filters and discusses the indications that professional societies have endorsed for their use. In addition, it outlines the complications of IVC filter placement and future research directions.

### Inferior vena cava filters: a framework for evidence-based use [^111p7UGB]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality. Although most patients can be managed safely with anticoagulation, inferior vena cava filters (IVCFs) represent an important alternative to anticoagulation in a small subset of patients. IVCF use has expanded exponentially with the advent of retrievable filters. Indications for IVCFs have liberalized despite limited evidence supporting this practice. Because indiscriminate use of IVCFs can be associated with net patient harm, knowledge of the risks and benefits of these devices is essential to optimal evidence-based practice. Patients with acute VTE and absolute contraindications to anticoagulation or major complications from anticoagulation are universally agreed indications for IVCFs. However, the reliance on IVCFs for primary VTE prophylaxis in high-risk patients is not substantiated by the available literature. This review examines trends in IVCF use, practice-based recommendations on IVCF use in various clinical scenarios, complications associated with indwelling IVCFs, and indications for IVCF retrieval.

### Inferior vena cava filters in the management of venous thromboembolism [^114JLqaL]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters, both retrievable and permanent, are indicated for the prevention of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients contraindicated for anticoagulant therapy, in those with anticoagulant therapy complications, and perhaps for those with recurrent PE despite therapeutic anticoagulation. Because of the lack of randomized controlled trials (only 1 has been published), clinicians have little evidence-based information to assist them in determining proper use of IVC filters. The introduction of retrievable filters and the ease of insertion have stimulated increased use of these devices without strong evidence or follow-up to assess either efficacy or longer-term clinical outcomes. Current evidence-based guidelines recommend IVC filter insertion only in patients with proven venous thromboembolism and an absolute contraindication for anticoagulation.

### Inferior vena cava filters [^116JTtbW]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Use of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters has increased dramatically in recent decades, despite a lack of evidence that their use has impacted venous thromboembolism (VTE)-related mortality. This increased use appears to be primarily driven by the insertion of retrievable filters for prophylactic indications. A growing body of evidence, however, suggests that IVC filters are frequently associated with clinically important adverse events, prompting a closer look at their role. We sought to narratively review the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of IVC filter placements. Inferior vena cava filters remain the only treatment option for patients with an acute (within 2–4 weeks) proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism and an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation. In such patients, anticoagulation should be resumed and IVC filters removed as soon as the contraindication has passed. For all other indications, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of IVC filters and high-quality trials are required. In patients where an IVC filter remains, regular follow-up to reassess removal and screen for filter-related complications should occur.

### Inferior vena cava filters in venous thromboembolism [^1148SQNL]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Vena cava filters have been used for the prevention of pulmonary embolism in patients with venous thromboembolism since the 1930s. Historically, vena cava filters were used in patients with either a contraindication to or a complication of systemic anticoagulation or in those with recurrent pulmonary embolism despite adequate anticoagulation. However, indications for placement have broadened even in the absence of support from randomized controlled trials as the deployment procedure became less complex. With more recently available optional retrievable filters, physicians have another valuable tool to use for the treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients who are not candidates for systemic anticoagulation or, perhaps, more importantly, have only a temporary indication for filtration. As with permanent filters, there is a clinical need for robust clinical studies to establish appropriate indications and define long-term outcomes because there are only case series to guide the current usage of such filters.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113metcE]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

High bleeding risk or contraindication management — nonpharmacological and temporary strategies include that "Prophylactic doses of parenteral anticoagulants (e.g., subcutaneous unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin) may reduce the risk of further bleeding more than therapeutic doses", and "temporary use of prophylactic doses with close clinical monitoring is a reasonable strategy to balance bleeding and thrombotic risk in this setting". Devices "may be considered", such as "left atrial appendage closure/occlusion devices… or retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filters… in consultation with the appropriate specialists". For left atrial appendage closure/occlusion, "an endocardial device may require therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 45 days following insertion; in contrast, an epicardial device generally does not". For IVC filters, "Randomized trials have demonstrated the potential for procedural complications and increased risk of deep vein thrombosis, with no benefit in preventing pulmonary embolism or reducing mortality", and "IVC filters should be removed as soon as therapeutic anticoagulation is achieved, preferably prior to hospital discharge".

### Inferior vena cava filter retrieval: patient selection, procedural planning, and postprocedural complications [^114VqKjX]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2020). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. Utilization of retrievable inferior vena cava filters (rIVCFs) has come under increased scrutiny because of historically high rates of placement, generalized lack of retrieval when the inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) is no longer indicated, and reports of device-related complications. These events have led to an increased interest in IVCF retrieval, including the development of advanced endovascular retrieval techniques and the proliferation of specialized clinical practices for rIVCFs. We aim to describe the indications for IVCF retrieval, patient selection, procedural planning, and procedural complications and management. CONCLUSION. IVCFs continue to have a role in the prevention of pulmonary embolism in select patients. Rising awareness of device-related complications paired with historically low retrieval rates has prompted renewed emphasis and interest in filter retrieval. Diligent follow-up and procedural planning permit prompt and safe filter retrieval.

### A single center 9-year experience in IVC filter retrieval-the importance of an IVC filter registry [^114QZD1x]. CVIR Endovascular (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The removal of IVC filters, when indication for insertion has past, is no longer the sole responsibility of the referring physician but also the responsibility of the Interventionalist. Our retrieval rates of 92.5% of eligible IVC filters highlights the value of maintaining a prospective IVC filter registry with regular communication to referring physicians and patients.

### Indications for inferior vena cava filter placement: do physicians comply with guidelines? [^117GFjbm]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement has increased significantly over the past few decades, but indications for filter placement vary widely depending on which professional society recommendations are followed, and it is uncertain how compliant physicians are in adhering to guidelines. This study assessed documented indications for IVC filter placement and evaluated compliance with standards set by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR).

Materials and Methods

A single-center, retrospective medical record review in a metropolitan, 652-bed, acute care, teaching hospital. Inpatient filter placement over a 26-month period was reviewed. The study measured compliance with established guidelines, relationship of medical specialty to filter placement, and evaluation of self-referral patterns among physicians.

Results

Compliance with established ACCP guidelines was poor regardless of whether the IVC filter insertion was performed by interventional radiology (IR; 43.5%), vascular surgery (VS; 39.9%), or interventional cardiology (IC; 33.3%) staff. Compliance with the less restrictive SIR guidelines was better (77.5%, 77.1%, and 80% for IR, VS, and IC, respectively). There was a greater degree of guideline compliance when filter placement was recommended by internal medicine (IM)-trained physicians than by non-IM-trained physicians: 46.3% of IR-placed filters requested by IM physicians met ACCP criteria whereas only 24.0% of filters recommended by non-IM specialties were compliant with criteria (P = 0.03). In the VS group, these compliance rates were 45.8% and 31.5%, respectively (P = 0.03). Among IR-placed filters, 84.0% of IM-recommended filter placements were compliant with SIR guidelines, versus only 48.0% of non-IM-recommended placements (P ≤ .001). In the VS group, these compliance rates were 87.8% and 69.6%, respectively (P ≤ .001).

Conclusions

There is poor physician compliance with guidelines for IVC filter placement. Most filter indications meeting SIR guidelines are for patients classified as "falls risks", failures of anticoagulation, patients with limited cardiopulmonary reserve and patients non compliant with anticoagulation medications. This single-center study suggests a need for harmonization of current guidelines espoused by professional societies.

### Inferior vena cava filters [^113bBDu4]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism is common. Most pulmonary emboli arise as thromboses in the deep veins of the lower extremities and may result in serious complications. Inferior vena cava filters (IVCF) are intended to prevent the passage of deep vein thrombosis to the pulmonary arteries. Accepted indications for IVCF placement include the presence of acute venous thromboembolism with inability to administer anticoagulation medication or failure of anticoagulation. Despite these clear indications, IVCF have been commonly placed in patients for primary prevention of pulmonary emboli in patients deemed to be at high risk, along with several other "soft" indications. As a result, IVCF use has been rising over the past 2 decades, especially given the retrievable nature of modern devices. Nonetheless, IVCF are not free of complications, which may occur during implantation and retrieval and while retained in the body. Despite this increase in use, the long-term efficacy remains unclear, and the management of patients with retained filters is often controversial. Finally, filter retrieval in eligible patients is relatively infrequent, suggesting that systems must be in place to improve appropriate filter use and to increase retrieval.

### Spanish multicenter real-life registry of retrievable vena cava filters (REFiVeC) [^113oLUfU]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Medium credibility.

The PREPIC 1 study (Decousus et al.) reinforced by the PREPIC 2 study, (PREPIC Study Group) based on IVCF, initially it decreases PE but increases the rate of DVT and does not influence the mortality of VTD. Current guidelines do not recommend IVCF in anticoagulated patients with VTD (Recommendation 1B) (Dalen).

Even though retrievable filters have largely replaced permanent filters, there is still not enough clinical evidence to increase IVCF indications and modify current guidelines (Uberoi et al.). The use of a retrievable IVCF with a prompt removal is theoretically consistent with the conclusions of both PREPIC studies (Decousus et al; PREPIC Study Group). Recoverable filters could potentially be effective in the prevention of life-threatening PE in the short-term. IVCF should be removed as soon as possible when their presence is no longer needed, and avoid filter-related complications including long-term post-thrombotic syndrome. In this study, the 2016 ACCP filter guidelines (Kearon et al.) were closely followed and the indications for filter placement were absolute in 66.2%, in contrast to the CIRSE Registry where absolute indications were only 40% (Uberoi et al.).

Anticoagulation in patients with indwelling inferior vena cava (IVC) filters — panel stance: Given the paucity of evidence, the panel favors appropriate anticoagulation that is based on the venous thromboembolism (VTE)-related indication rather than the presence of an IVC filter. In addition, the panel stresses the importance of assessing the ongoing need for the IVC filter and endorses prompt IVC filter retrieval when the need has resolved. The panel judged that the harms (excess bleeding risk) of adding anticoagulation when the VTE-related indication has resolved outweigh potential benefits.

### Long-duration temporary vena cava filter: a prospective 104-case multicenter study [^1151q3fz]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Nonpermanent caval filters are placed in critical thromboembolic situations in which anticoagulation therapy is transiently contraindicated, ineffective, or the source of complications. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of a second-generation long-duration temporary caval filter in these situations and compare its utility with that of other temporary filters.

Methods

This prospective study, including patients who underwent temporary caval filtration with the Tempofilter II, was conducted in nine European centers. All filters were successfully implanted. The filter was removed when the indication for caval filtration ceased.

Results

A total of 104 filters were inserted in 103 patients with an average age of 60 ± 15.5 years (range, 22–92 years). Most patients (85%) had pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, or both. The main indications for caval filter placement were complications of or contraindications to anticoagulation therapy (n = 85; 82.5%) or for ineffectiveness of anticoagulation therapy (n = 12; 11.7%). The average duration of implantation was 29.5 ± 14.0 days (range, 2–86 days). One filter migrated in the right atrium, followed by pulmonary embolism. No other case of pulmonary embolism or of infectious or mechanical complications related to the filter was observed. Thrombus was trapped within the filter in 24 cases (23.3%). All filters but one were removed, regardless of whether thrombus had been trapped. Retrieval was always successful after implantation periods up to 12 weeks. In 16 cases (15.5%), the filter was replaced by a permanent filter.

Conclusions

The Tempofilter II is safe, effective, and useful in critical thromboembolic situations. It offers a valuable alternative to retrievable optional filters.

Key Points

Question

What is the association of inferior vena cava filter placement with 30-day mortality in patients with venous thromboembolic disease and a contraindication to anticoagulation?

Findings

In this cohort study, using 2 different statistical methods with adjustment for immortal time bias, inferior vena cava filter placement in patients with venous thromboembolic disease and a contraindication to anticoagulation was associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality.

Meaning

Randomized clinical trials are needed to define the role of inferior vena cava filter placement in patients with venous thromboembolic disease and a contraindication to anticoagulation.

### European guidelines on perioperative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis: inferior vena cava filters [^117EMdhP]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

The indications for the use of an inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) in the context of deep venous thrombosis to prevent pulmonary embolism remain controversial. Despite wide use in clinical practice, great variation exists in national and international guidelines in regard to the indications. In addition, clinical practice is based on poor-quality data from trauma and bariatric surgery with a high incidence of complications. It is often difficult to assess their efficacy and lack of filter retrieval appears to be a substantial issue compared with a potential benefit by insertion of these devices. Complications usually refer to increased risk of deep venous thrombosis, filter perforation, filter penetration, filter migration, inferior vena cava occlusion and subsequently failure in pulmonary embolism prevention. Evidence from low-quality studies or registries, with small numbers of patients and conflicting findings, does not allow for a strong recommendation for or against the use of IVCFs. IVCFs should only be considered in cases of very high risk of pulmonary embolism and in perioperative situations at very high risk of bleeding, resulting in a prolonged contra-indication to pharmacological prophylaxis.

### Vena cava filter retrieval rates and factors associated with retrieval in a large US cohort [^111YDBj6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In this national study of VCF retrieval, less than 1 of every 4 filters was retrieved within 1 year. Retrieval rates differ based on patient characteristics but increased over the study time period (2010–2014), while retrieval and initiation of anticoagulation were poorly correlated. Physicians should consider ongoing indications for indwelling VCFs and timing of retrieval with anticoagulation initiation throughout follow‐up to optimize patient care.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter — retrieval after failed standard snare techniques: In patients undergoing filter retrieval/conversion whose filter could not be removed/converted by using standard techniques, we suggest attempted removal with advanced techniques, if appropriate and if the expertise is available, after reevaluation of risks and benefits. In patients undergoing initial filter retrieval or conversion with standard techniques after the first procedure fails, a subsequent attempt by using advanced techniques is often successful (59), and careful patient counseling is required, including the option of leaving the filter intact (if not causing harm to the patient). The panel judged that the intervention of advanced removal techniques would be associated with moderate costs for additional procedures and resource utilization, and that the intervention is feasible to implement but requires identification of physicians or institutions that can provide advanced filter retrieval/conversion procedures. Filter retrieval may be associated with decreased symptomatic filter-related complications over time.

### Update on inferior vena cava filters [^117LkGAV]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

The ravages of thromboembolic disease continue to plague patients despite improvements in diagnostic imaging and anticoagulation regimens. In certain cases, standard medical therapy for thromboembolism is contraindicated, results in complications, or fails to adequately protect patients from embolic insults. These patients are treated with insertion of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters. Although it appears that IVC filters do reduce long-term pulmonary embolism (PE) rates, there may be a higher associated incidence of IVC thrombosis and lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) than with anticoagulation alone. This article will address attributes of the theoretical ideal IVC filter, recently introduced IVC filters, complications of use of IVC filters, and results of recent IVC filter studies. Alternative sites for filter placements are then reviewed, along with use of temporary and retrievable IVC filters and use of IVC filters for prophylactic situations.

### Vena cava filters: uses and abuses [^1154eRgv]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Currently, there are more than 10 permanent and optional retrievable vena cava filters in use in North America and Europe. Indications for inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement are intuitive and filters are used in patients who have deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and contraindications to anticoagulation, or in patients who hemorrhage while anticoagulated for DVT. Multiple studies have proposed broadening the use of IVC filters as primary venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in certain patient populations. Many permanent IVC filters have been well studied and have superior performance characteristics. On the other hand, optional retrievable IVC filters are attractive in the patient with a well-defined, short-term risk for VTE and contraindications to anticoagulation. Filter retrieval after the patient can be anticoagulated would eliminate the long-term risk of DVT associated with permanent IVC filter placement. Unfortunately, most optional retrievable filters are relatively new and have little to no data on their long-term performance when used as permanent filters, and the percentage of retrievable filters actually removed is less than 50%. The spirited debate concerning which patient should get which filter is just beginning. More prospective, randomized trials evaluating optional retrievable filters are needed to answer these important questions.

Conclusions

This analysis suggests that patients with a contraindication to anticoagulation who receive an IVC filter have an increased risk of death at 30 days after adjustment for baseline differences, comorbidities, immortal time bias, and propensity score compared with similar patients who did not receive an IVC filter. Randomized clinical trials are required to determine the efficacy of IVC filter placement in patients with VTE and a contraindication to anticoagulation.

### Procedural complications of inferior vena cava filter retrieval, an illustrated review [^113DGtK8]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Inferior vena cava filters are employed in a variety of clinical scenarios (Table 1) (DeYoung and Minocha). Complications of in situ filters include cardiac migration, leg fracture with or without embolization, caval thrombosis and symptomatic caval penetration by filter legs (Grewal et al.). Because of the increased recognition of in situ filter complications and advances in retrieval techniques, filter retrieval rates have increased over the years (Angel et al; Ahmed et al.) To avoid complications of in situ filters, removal is indicated when the filter is no longer needed (Table 2). Maintenance of patients on therapeutic anticoagulation at the time of retrieval is recommended (Kaufman et al.) and is not associated with increased risk of retrieval complications (Schmelzer et al.).

Table 1
Indications for IVC filter placement a Filter used as an adjunct to anticoagulation

Table 2
Indications for Filter Removal (Kaufman et al.)

The reported procedural complication rates of filter retrieval range from 0% (Tashbayev et al.) to 20% (Brahmandam et al.). Complication rates depend on multiple factors including whether advanced techniques were used and filter position (Table 3). In this paper we examine risk factors for complications from filter retrieval, discuss approaches to avoid such complications and provide possible treatment approaches for when complications do occur.

### Vena cava filter retrieval rates and factors associated with retrieval in a large US cohort [^114a9nRA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vena cava filters (VCFs) are used to mechanically prevent thrombi from migrating to the pulmonary circulation. Generally, VCFs are reserved for patients who have absolute or relative contraindications to anticoagulation and who are at a high risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). 1, 2, 3 With the advent of retrievable VCFs, there has been a marked increase in overall use. 4, 5, 6 Retrievable VCFs differ in that they can be removed once contraindications have subsided and patients can be initiated on anticoagulation.

In real‐world settings, retrieval rates of VCFs have been dismal, with reports ranging from 10% to 50% and an estimated average near 30%. 7, 8 Poor retrieval rates correspond to an increase in reported adverse events. 7 Complications associated with VCFs include increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), inferior vena cava thrombosis, inferior vena cava penetration, VCF fracture, and VCF embolization. 7, 9, 10, 11 Given these trends, the US Food and Drug Administration has issued a safety communication highlighting the need to remove VCFs once the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) has subsided based on modeling studies showing that VCFs are most clinically beneficial if retrieved within 90 days after implantation. 11, 12

Given the continued growth in VCF use and the variation that has been observed between institutions, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 assessment of what factors drive retrieval rates and timing of anticoagulation on a national scale is needed to evaluate clinical practice. 18 This study sought to evaluate the trend in retrieval rates and patient factors associated with retrieval as well as the association between retrieval and anticoagulation. While retrieval rates were expected to increase over time, we hypothesized differential retrieval based on indication and patient characteristics. Furthermore, we hypothesized there would be a weak association between retrieval and anticoagulation, although treatment with anticoagulation generally indicates there would no longer be a continued need for an indwelling VCF.

### Which caval diameter? Clarification manufacturer's instructions for inferior vena cava filter use and implications for practice [^113RgBGn]. Clinical Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To clarify manufacturer's instructions for inferior vena cava (IVC) filter use and implications for practice.

Materials and Methods

Three vendors of IVC filters were contacted for clarification, with all stating that caval diameter limits are to be true maximum and true minimum cross-sectional diameters. To determine the implications of this, measurements were performed on 302 abdominal computed tomography studies in four transaxial dimensions perpendicular to the long axis including true maximum and minimum diameters, and measurements reflecting those typically taken on fluoroscopic cavography.

Results

Based on the true maximum and true minimum caval diameter limits as clarified by vendors, 22% of patients who would typically be considered suitable for IVC filter insertion based on frontal and lateral fluoroscopic cavography would be contraindicated, and 40% of patients who would typically be considered suitable for IVC filter insertion based on only frontal fluoroscopic cavography (as lateral projection is often not performed) would be contraindicated.

Conclusion

There is a marked discordance between the vendor-clarified caval diameter limits of three common IVC filter devices and real-world caval geometry. Given the rarity of complications, this suggests a pressing need for revision of manufacturers' instructions for use statements to better reflect current safe routine clinical use, particularly from a medicolegal perspective.

### The role of inferior vena cava filters in pulmonary embolism [^116kyJt9]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality, with an estimated 600,000 cases of clinically significant PE in the United States annually, and roughly 200,000 deaths per annum directly attributable to PE. By far the most frequent cause of PE is deep vein thrombosis originating in the lower extremities, which travels to the pulmonary vasculature. The mainstay of treatment is anticoagulation, but multiple additional treatments exist for patients in whom anticoagulation is inadequate or contraindicated. The absolute indications for inferior vena cava (IVC) filtration are narrow, but many filters are placed in patients with relative indications. There is growing concern for overuse of IVC filters, with a relatively low rate of retrieval. It is essential for interventional radiologists to understand the appropriate and correct use and retrieval of IVC filters. Familiarity with placement techniques, protocols and techniques for retrieval, current and emerging technologies, and the clinical model for management of venous thromboembolism, will ensure that interventional radiologists remain an integral member of the care team for these often complex patients.

### Vena cava filter practices of a regional vascular surgery society [^113v4KNg]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Vena cava filter (VCF) use in the United States has increased dramatically with prophylactic indications for placement and the availability of low-profile retrievable devices, which are overtaking the filter market. We surveyed the practice patterns of a large group of vascular surgeons from a regional vascular surgery society to see whether they mirrored current national trends.

Methods

A 17-question online VCF survey was offered to all members of the Southern Association of Vascular Surgery. The responses were analyzed using the χ(2) goodness of fit tests.

Results

Of the 276 members surveyed, 126 (46%) responded, with 118 (93%) indicating that they placed filters during their practice. Highly significant differences were identified with each question (at least P < 0.002). Regarding the inferior vena cava, the preferred permanent filters were the Greenfield (31%), the TrapEase (15%), the Vena Tech (5%), and a variety of retrievable devices (49%). Fifty percent of the respondents placed retrievable filters selectively; 26% always placed them; and 24% never did. Filters were placed for prophylactic indications < 50% of the time by 63% of the respondents. Overall, retrievable filters (when not used as permanent filters) were removed < 25% of the time by 64% of the respondents and < 50% of the time by 78% of the respondents. The femoral vein was the preferred access site for 84% of the respondents. Major complications were few but included filter migration to the atrium (one), atrial perforation (one), abdominal pain requiring surgical filter removal (two), inferior vena cava thrombosis (12 vena cava thrombosis — 4 due to TrapEase filters), strut fracture with embolization to heart or lungs (three Bard retrievable filters), and severe tilting precluding percutaneous retrieval and protection from pulmonary emboli (8 filters with severe tilt — 7 of which were Bard). Of the respondents, 59% had never placed a superior vena cava filter, and 28% had placed five or fewer.

Conclusions

Although VCF insertion overall appears safe, some complications are specific to biconical and certain retrievable filters. Given the low removal rate and lack of long-term experience with retrievable filters, routine use of these devices as permanent filters should be questioned. If used on a temporary basis, there should be a plan for filter removal at the time of implantation.

### Indications, complications and outcomes of inferior vena cava filters: a retrospective study [^115cThT8]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Inferior vena cava filters are used to prevent embolization of a lower extremity deep vein thrombosis when the risk of pulmonary embolism is thought to be high. However, evidence is lacking for their benefit and guidelines differ on the recommended indications for filter insertion. The study aim was to determine the reasons for inferior vena cava filter placement and subsequent complication rate.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective cohort of patients receiving inferior vena cava filters in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada from 2007 to 2011. Main outcome was the indication of inferior vena cava filter insertion. Other measures include baseline demographic and medical history of patients, clinical outcomes and filter retrieval rates.

Results

464 patients received inferior vena cava filters. An acute deep vein thrombosis with a contraindication to anticoagulation was the indication for 206 (44.4%) filter insertions. No contraindication to anticoagulation could be identified in 20.7% of filter placements. 30.6% were placed in those with active cancer, in which mortality was significantly higher. Only 38.9% of retrievable filters were successfully retrieved.

Conclusions

Inferior vena cava filters were placed frequently in patients with weak or no guideline-supported indications for filter placement and in up to 20% of patients with no contraindication to anticoagulation. The high rates of cancer and the high mortality rate of the cohort raise the possibility that some filters are placed inappropriately in end of life settings.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement techniques — evidence summary and committee guidance: A low-quality observational study comparing fluoroscopic guidance with bedside intravascular ultrasound (US) guidance reported 117 intravascular US–placed filters versus 571 fluoroscopically placed filters, with procedural-related complications occurring more frequently with intravascular US (4.3% vs 0.4%, respectively; p = 0.006) and no difference in indwelling complications (IVC thrombosis, DVT, or PE). Given insufficient evidence, the committee cannot recommend one placement method over another, and regardless of technique, the method employed should clearly demonstrate vena caval anatomy and diameter(s), the location of the renal and iliac veins, and the presence or absence of thrombus in the vena cava at or near the planned implantation site. Evidence is also insufficient to guide choice of venous access (jugular versus femoral or other), which is likely dependent on operator experience and expertise and patient-specific characteristics, including the site and extent of venous thrombosis and previous operations or instrumentation. The panel judged that the benefits and harms of each technique are closely balanced; that the outcomes are meaningful with probably no important uncertainty in how people value them; that no cost-effectiveness studies were identified but there are moderate costs associated with increased resource utilization; and that any insertion method is acceptable and probably feasible to implement.

### Association of inferior vena cava filter placement for venous thromboembolic disease and a contraindication to anticoagulation with 30-day mortality [^1148trMi]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes both pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with an incidence of 117 cases per 100 000 person-yearsand a 1-year mortality for PE of at least 22% in patients with Medicare. Treatment of patients with VTE is based on anticoagulation, but for many patients, this therapy is contraindicated owing to recent surgery or underlying coagulopathies. In patients with VTE and a contraindication to anticoagulation, major professional societies, including the American College of Chest Physicians, American Heart Association, Society of Interventional Radiology, American College of Radiology, and the British Committee for Standards in Haematologyrecommend consideration of IVC filter placement. While IVC filters have been widely available since the 1960s, their use in the United States has steadily and dramatically increased from 2000 procedures in 1979 to more than 100 000 procedures in 2005. More recently, rates have begun to decline with approximately 96 000 procedures in 2014. This use has occurred despite the absence of data on a mortality benefit associated with IVC filter placement. An early randomized clinical trial showed a reduction in the number of symptomatic PEs but no reduction in mortality after IVC filter insertion. Importantly, this trial excluded patients with a contraindication to anticoagulant therapy, which is, to our knowledge, the most widely accepted indication for IVC filter placement and the only indication for which the several professional societies agree. Retrievable IVC filters were analyzed in a randomized clinical trialof patients with PE and a high likelihood of recurrence. In this trial, IVC filters did not lower recurrent PE, but patients with a contraindication to anticoagulation were excluded. Thus, the findings of existing randomized clinical trials are not applicable to a large segment of the VTE population.

### Laser-assisted removal of embedded vena cava filters: a first-in-human escalation trial in 500 patients refractory to high-force retrieval [^1118jt1d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This 8.5‐year prospective study supports a new indication for excimer laser sheath use in experienced centers for removal of embedded vena cava filters refractory to high‐force retrieval attempts. This percutaneous technique was overall safe and effective in removing a variety of filter types regardless of implantation length, using a minimally invasive protocol that avoids excessive force, thereby avoiding the need for invasive open surgery. In a patient population experiencing an epidemic of filter‐related complications, laser‐assisted retrieval has the potential to prevent and alleviate filter‐related morbidity by safely removing embedded IVC filters in tens of thousands of patients per year.

### Current controversies in inferior vena cava filter placement: expert panel narrative review [^116S5BpU]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite inferior vena cava (IVC) filter practice spanning over 50 years, interventionalists face many controversies in proper utilization and management. This article reviews recent literature and offers opinions on filter practices. IVC filtration is most likely to benefit patients at high risk of iatrogenic pulmonary embolus during endovenous intervention. Filters should be used selectively in patients with acute trauma or who are undergoing bariatric surgery. Retrieval should be attempted for perforating filter and fractured filter fragments when imaging suggests feasibility and favorable risk-to-benefit ratio. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered when removing filters with confirmed gastrointestinal penetration. Anticoagulation solely because of filter presence is not recommended except in patients with active malignancy. Anticoagulation while filters remain in place may decrease long-term filter complications in these patients. Patients with a filter and symptomatic IVC occlusion should be offered filter removal and IVC reconstruction. Physicians implanting filters may maximize retrieval by maintaining physician-patient relationships and scheduling follow-up at time of placement. Annual follow-up allows continued evaluation for removal or replacement as appropriate. Advanced retrieval techniques increase retrieval rates but require caution. Certain cases may require referral to experienced centers with additional retrieval resources. The views expressed should help guide clinical practice, future innovation, and research.

### Risk factors of nonretrieval of retrievable inferior vena cava filters [^1175FQP1]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal use of retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filters is an important health care issue, and despite an exponential rise in the use of retrievable IVC filters, national trends suggest that most of these filters are not removed. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors associated with nonretrieval of retrievable IVC filters at our institution.

Methods

A retrospective institutional review of all patients undergoing IVC filter placement from June 2010 to June 2012 was performed. A number of patient parameters were studied, including relevant demographics, indication for filter placement, clinical history, related hospitalization, and whether filter retrieval was performed. Patient parameters were compared by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.

Results

There were 605 retrievable IVC filters placed over a 24-month period by vascular surgery, intervention radiology, and interventional cardiology. The follow-up retrieval rate was 25%. By indication, 272 (45%), 53 (9%), and 280 (46%) filters were placed for absolute, relative, and prophylactic indications, respectively. Independent predictors for nonretrieval by multivariate analysis were age > 80 years (hazard ratio [HR], 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.7–20; P < 0.001), acute bleed (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4–5; P < 0.001), current malignancy (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3–3.3; P = 0.011), postfilter anticoagulation (HR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.28–0.9; P = 0.017), and history of pulmonary embolism and/or venous thromboembolism (HR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.28–0.35; P < 0.001). Filter placement team and indication were not identified as independent predictors of nonretrieval of IVC filters.

Conclusions

Patient variables identified by univariate and multivariate analyses as risk for nonretrieval of retrievable IVC filters have several implications: first, some of these patients may represent a group of patients with a low life expectancy or unresolvable underlying condition in which filter retrieval has diminishing returns and may indicate the clinical option for permanence of the filter; second, identification of risk factors for nonretrieval in patients before filter placement will help to optimize use of retrievable IVC filters and enhance retrieval rates.

### Safety and efficacy of inferior vena cava filter retrieval: a 5-year single center retrospective review from a tertiary care center [^1163jBvU]. CVIR Endovascular (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Indications for insertion of IVC filters were separated into 7 categories and are listed in Table 1. Of the 536 filters, 31 filters were permanent, nonretrievable, while 505 were classified as retrievable. Ten complications occurred during the removal of permanent filters, while 22 occurred during the removal of retrievable filters, yielding complication rates of 32.3% and 4.4%, respectively. The complication rates associated with the removal of specific types of permanent filters and retrievable filters are summarized in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. At the time of removal, approximately 18 filters were already fractured. Three minor complications were observed during the retrieval of these fractured filters. Overall, 97.9% (525/536) of the filters were successfully removed, with a 6.0% complication rate (32/536). Filters that were not successfully removed were left in the IVC. The standard snare technique was attempted in 347 retrievals, isolated forceps were utilized in 105 cases, and a combination of both standard snare technique and forceps was used in 68 cases. Removal was not attempted in seven cases due to chronic thrombus where risks of removal outweighed benefits and/or recurrent pulmonary embolism. Success rates and graded complication rates for these different retrieval techniques are summarized in Tables 4 and 5.

### A review of interventions to increase vena cava filter retrieval rates [^116i7k9P]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Inferior vena cava filters (IVCFs) are indicated for therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients when anticoagulation has failed or is contraindicated. Retrievable IVCFs are not always retrieved despite clinical recommendations. The purpose of this review is to compare results in the literature regarding interventions and to improve IVCF retrieval rates.

Methods

Articles were identified via the search terms "vena cava filters" and "inferior vena cava filters" in conjunction with "retrieval". Searches were repeated in MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane database. Exclusion criteria included duplicates, misidentified subject matter, study period before 2008, and lack of control group. Two independent reviewers screened key elements in the identified manuscripts, including the targeted intervention population, study design, IVCF retrieval rates, and other outcomes. A third reviewer corroborated results and consolidated findings.

Results

Seventeen articles were identified for review. Of these, 12 were physician-targeted interventions, and 8 were patient-targeted interventions (3 studies included both). IVCF retrieval rates varied substantially for each study, but all reviewed studies reported improvement in retrieval rate following intervention. Only 5 studies reported decreased IVCF indwell times in intervention groups. Reported complication rates from IVCF retrievals were low, ranging from 0 to 2%.

Conclusions

IVCF retrieval rates were improved by all interventions in the reviewed studies. Findings suggest that IVCF retrieval rates can be best improved by tracking patients typically lost to follow-up. Literature suggests that successful tracking requires an individual or team of individuals who have been assigned dedicated clinical responsibility for coordinating care following IVCF placement.

### Predictors of retrieval and long-term mortality in patients treated with inferior vena cava filters [^116BekWG]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: An observational, retrospective, multicenter study
- **Key Findings**: We included 739 patients with thromboembolic disease and a contraindication for anticoagulation who received an inferior vena cava filter in two community hospitals in Argentina. The long-term mortality was 53%. Filter retrieval was performed for 33% of the patients.
- **Take Home Message**: Patients with thromboembolic disease treated with optional inferior vena cava filters have high long-term mortality. The predictors of mortality are cancer, older age, and deep vein thrombosis. The retrieval rate is low (on average, one third of cases). The predictors for retrieval are a contraindication to surgery-related anticoagulation, the absence of cancer, and a younger age.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the most common cause of pulmonary thromboembolism (PE). The incidence of DVT is reported to be 422 per 100,000 persons, 40% of whom will develop PE if left untreated. More than 650,000 people develop PE each year in the United States, ∼20% of whom will have fatal complications.PE is the third leading cause of cardiovascular death (after acute myocardial infarction and stroke) and the leading cause of preventable in-hospital death.

The treatment of DVT is anticoagulation, which prevents PE in ≤ 95% of cases. However, 5% of the patients will have a permanent or transitory contraindication to anticoagulation therapy. Vena cava filters (VCFs) are an alternative treatment for patients with thromboembolic disease and permanent or temporary contraindications to full-dose anticoagulation. The use of VCFs is controversial, because, to the best of our knowledge, no randomized trials supporting the use of VCFS have been reported. No agreement has been reached between different scientific societies regarding the indications for VCFs. The only use for which a consensus has been reached (ie, thromboembolic disease with a contraindication to anticoagulation) has been excluded from all trials.

In 2003, the market launch of optional or retrievable VCFs occurred to reduce the burden of complications related to VCFs, including migration, fracture, penetration into the vein, caval thrombosis, and so forth. However, the retrieval rates reported in the literature are low and vary considerably among regions and worldwide.

The aims of the present study are to report the retrieval rate of previously placed optional VCFs and the long-term mortality in this group of patients and to identify the predictors for successful retrieval and all-cause mortality during follow-up in two hospitals from the city of Buenos Aires.

### Patterns of referral for inferior vena caval filtration: delays and their impact [^112ogf9Q]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to study the referral patterns for inferior vena caval filtration and explore the relationship between delays in filter insertion and clinical outcomes.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 101 consecutive inferior vena caval filters inserted in 101 patients in a university hospital between the June 2000 and July 2001. A time line was created listing the time of diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, contraindication or complication of anticoagulation therapy, and time of insertion of inferior vena caval filter.

Results

The average elapsed time between the clinical indication for caval filtration and filter placement in all patients was 1.64 days (range, 0–17 days). Two patients (2%) sustained pulmonary emboli after being diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis before receiving a filter. The lengths of time between filter indication and insertion for these patients were 2 and 8 days.

Conclusion

In our hospital, there are wide variations in perceived urgency of vena caval filtration. In two patients, delays longer than 24 hr between indication and insertion of inferior vena caval filters resulted in symptomatic pulmonary emboli.

### Appropriateness guidelines for inferior vena cava filter utilization: a contemporary review [^1172ckVS]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Concern regarding the exponential increase in optional utilization of inferior vena cava filters (IVCFs) in the early 2000s with a persistent low retrieval rate nationwide has resulted in increased scrutiny regarding clinical application of IVCFs. IVCFs are used in a variety of clinical scenarios, ranging from thromboembolic protection in patients with deep venous thrombosis and contraindication to anticoagulation to prophylactic deployment in multitrauma and critically ill patients. Evidence supporting IVCFs as mechanical thromboembolic protection in certain clinical scenarios has been established through evidenced-based guidelines. As an adjunct to evidence-based guidelines, appropriateness criteria to address specific clinical scenarios and facilitate clinical decision making when considering placement of an IVCF have been developed. In this review, current evidence-based and appropriateness guidelines are summarized.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters during anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism — In patients undergoing anticoagulation for acute VTE (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] or pulmonary embolism [PE]) who develop a contraindication, "we suggest that an IVC filter be considered in the setting of ongoing significant clinical risk for PE", and for those receiving extended anticoagulation after acute treatment for VTE with a new contraindication, "we suggest that an IVC filter not be placed, with rare exceptions", both labeled "Strength of Recommendation: Consensus statement ✰✰✰" with "Strength of evidence (certainty of evidence): Expert opinion". Evidence was absent: "No studies met our inclusion criteria… during acute (≤ 3 mo) or extended therapy (> 3 mo) VTE (DVT, PE)", and the panel judged that benefits vs harms "were judged to favor the comparison (ie, no IVC filter)", routine filter placement "would lead to moderate increase in costs", and acceptability "probably varies" among stakeholders.

### The CIRSE retrievable IVC filter registry: retrieval success rates in practice [^111cxxs2]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

CIRSE established a registry of retrievable filter use with the primary aim of determining the success of IVC Filter retrieval and associated complications. Secondary endpoints included filter indications, imaging strategies before retrieval, filter dwell times, and anticoagulation status. A web-based electronic registry was hosted between 01/12/2010 and 30/06/2012. Data entry occurred at the date of IVC filter retrieval and included items such as filter type, indication for filter insertion, access route, dwell time, retrieval success, complications, reasons for failed retrieval, and anticoagulation status. 671 filter retrievals were entered (male:female 333:295, mean age 55, median 57). Retrieval data were not entered in 43/671 leaving 628 patients for analysis. The 4 commonest retrievable filters used were the Celect in 182 patients, the OPTEASE in 161, ALN in 120, and Gunther Tulip in 98. Filters were inserted for absolute indications 40%, relative indications in 31%, and prophylactic in 24%, with 5% missing. Mean filter dwell time was 90 days. Filters were successfully retrieved in 576/628 patients (92%). The mean dwell time for successful retrievals was 85 days versus 145 days for unsuccessful retrievals (p = 0.001). Major complications occurred in 2 patients (0.03%). In summary, the CIRSE retrievable filter registry demonstrates a retrieval rate of 92% across a range of filter types, with a low major complication rate, reflecting current practice. There is an increase in trend of retrievable filter use for relative and prophylactic indications.

### Increasing use of vena cava filters for prevention of pulmonary embolism [^111Bd7nw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To test whether the use of vena cava filters continues to increase in the era of retrievable filters, suggesting that indications for insertion are broadening.

Methods

Data from 1979 through 2006 are from the National Hospital Discharge Survey.

Results

From 1979 through 1984, 17,000 vena cava filters were inserted; 8000 in patients with pulmonary embolism, 4000 in patients with deep venous thrombosis only, and 5000 in patients at risk of pulmonary embolism who had neither. From 1985 through 2006, 803,000 vena cava filters were inserted: 285,000 in patients with pulmonary embolism, 360,000 in patients with deep venous thrombosis only, and 158,000 in patients who had neither. The largest proportional increases in the use of vena cava filters since the introduction of retrievable filters was in patients at risk of pulmonary embolism but who had neither pulmonary embolism nor deep venous thrombosis. The trend toward increased use in this group began before retrievable filters were introduced. There was a 3-fold increase from 2001–2006.

Conclusion

Extensive use of permanent and retrievable vena cava filters in the US indicates liberalization of indications. It would seem that a more discriminate use of vena cava filters would be appropriate at the present time, keeping an open mind for broadened indications as data accrue.

### Predictors of inferior vena cava filter retrieval in a population-based Canadian cohort [^117BzGN8]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Future direction of study

The current study serves to define the baseline for characterizing IVC filter retrieval within Canada. Given its limitations, additional work is needed to discern accuracy of administrative data codes for IVC filter placement and retrieval. Furthermore, assessment of trends and practice patterns using this data would be more meaningful if additional data could be collected regarding IVC filter types, indication for placement, reasons for nonretrieval, and whether any attempts were made at retrieval, to assess appropriateness of practice patterns. This, in turn, would inform quality improvement initiatives, and minimize harm associated with IVC filter use. Examples of methods that have seen success include IVC filter registries, automatic booking of follow-ups at the time of insertion, automatic reminder letters for follow-up, periodic assessment of retrieval candidacy, and implementation of a multidisciplinary surveillance team. Dedicated filter retrieval clinics have also shown success in increasing retrieval rates.

Complications associated with indwelling inferior vena cava (IVC) filters — management is: In patients with complications attributed to indwelling IVC filters, we suggest filter removal be considered after weighing filter- versus procedure-related risks and the likelihood that filter removal will alleviate the complications (Strength of Recommendation: Consensus statement ☆☆☆). The panel agreed that symptomatic complications conclusively related to an IVC filter such as penetration, moderate to severe pain, filter migration, filter fragment embolization, or infection are unlikely to improve with conservative management. In these cases, assessment for filter retrieval is warranted. These procedures should therefore be performed by physicians who have experience performing them and with access to the necessary equipment and devices (eg, laser sheath, forceps) for advanced retrieval techniques. When considering one of these procedures, the patient's ongoing venous thromboembolism (VTE) and PE risk should be assessed, and measures to treat or prevent recurrent VTE included in the management plan after filter removal. Based on this, the panel judged that the balance between benefits and harms varies.

### Laser-assisted removal of embedded vena cava filters: a first-in-human escalation trial in 500 patients refractory to high-force retrieval [^114VYL2Q]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Ninety‐six percent of patients were referred or self‐referred from outside our institution. There were 225 men and 275 women (mean age, 49 years; range, 15–90 years). In all patients, IVC filtration was no longer needed, and the indications for filter removal were classified into 3 categories: (1) symptomatic patients with filter‐related morbidity; (2) physically asymptomatic patients with anxiety over the potential risks from an indwelling filter who wished to prevent filter‐related complications; and (3) anticoagulated patients among groups 1 and 2, to potentially eliminate the need for ongoing filter‐related anticoagulation previously prescribed to mitigate thrombotic risks associated with long‐term filter implantation. 3

All patients were informed of the potential risks and benefits of advanced laser‐assisted retrieval maneuvers versus the risks and benefits of keeping a permanent filter and provided consent. Patients with permanent filters were also informed that their filter types were not designed, FDA‐approved, or originally intended for removal. Before retrieval, acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis was excluded and acute caval thrombus was removed with thrombolysis as previously described. 5

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Acute DVT without PE — In patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) without pulmonary embolism (PE) and a contraindication to anticoagulation, "we suggest that an IVC filter be considered based on various clinical risk factors, as outlined in the rationale". This recommendation is labeled "Strength of Recommendation: Consensus statement", and the evidence base notes "No studies were identified in the systematic review that met the inclusion criteria for this question". Despite limited evidence, "the panel agreed that most, but not all, patients with an acute proximal DVT and a contraindication to anticoagulation should receive an IVC filter", considering "cardiopulmonary status/reserve, extent and location of DVT, ongoing thrombotic risk, and expected duration of contraindication to anticoagulation". "In selected circumstances… it may be reasonable to not place an IVC filter", and "Monitoring for recurrence or extension of lower-extremity clot is recommended in such patients". The panel further judged that benefits "probably outweighs the harms", there is "probably no important uncertainty or variability in how patients value outcomes", there were no identified cost-effectiveness studies and routine placement/removal "entails moderate costs", and "acceptability of IVC filter placement varies among different stakeholders".

### Advanced techniques for removal of retrievable inferior vena cava filters [^113PEyqD]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters have proven valuable for the prevention of primary or recurrent pulmonary embolism in selected patients with or at high risk for venous thromboembolic disease. Their use has become commonplace, and the numbers implanted increase annually. During the last 3 years, in the United States, the percentage of annually placed optional filters, i.e., filters than can remain as permanent filters or potentially be retrieved, has consistently exceeded that of permanent filters. In parallel, the complications of long- or short-term filtration have become increasingly evident to physicians, regulatory agencies, and the public. Most filter removals are uneventful, with a high degree of success. When routine filter-retrieval techniques prove unsuccessful, progressively more advanced tools and skill sets must be used to enhance filter-retrieval success. These techniques should be used with caution to avoid damage to the filter or cava during IVC retrieval. This review describes the complex techniques for filter retrieval, including use of additional snares, guidewires, angioplasty balloons, and mechanical and thermal approaches as well as illustrates their specific application.

### Guideline compliance and indications for inferior vena cava filter placement at a quaternary care medical center [^116kFQcb]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study investigated physician compliance with indications for inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement according to the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the 2011 Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) guidelines.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective medical record review of 231 retrievable IVC filters placed between August 15, 2016, and December 28, 2017, at a large urban academic medical center. Guideline compliance to the 2012 ACCP and the 2011 SIR guidelines, and indications for IVC filter placements were assessed through an adjudication protocol. Filter retrieval and complication rates were also examined.

Results

Compliance to guidelines was low (60.2% for ACCP; 74.0% for SIR), especially for non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients (ICU 74.6% vs non-ICU 54.8%, p = 0.007 for ACCP; ICU 82.5% vs non-ICU 70.8%, p = 0.092 for SIR). After adjudication, 8.2% (19/231) of filters were considered non-indicated but reasonable, 17.7% (41/231) non-indicated and unreasonable, and 13.9% (32/231) SIR-indicated but not ACCP-indicated. The most common indication was venous thromboembolism with contraindication to anticoagulation. The most common reasons for non-compliance were distal deep venous thrombosis with contraindication to anticoagulation (19/60, 31.6%) and clot burden (19/60, 31.6%). One-year filter retrieval and 90-day complication rates were 32.0% (74/231) and 6.1% (14/231), respectively.

Conclusion

Compliance to established guidelines was low. Reasons for non-compliance included limitations or discrepancies in guidelines, as well as non-evidence-based filter placements.

Clinical Impact

Despite increasing utilization of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters, guideline compliance for IVC filter placement among providers is unclear. The results of this study indicate that physician compliance to established guidelines is poor, especially in non-intensive-care-unit patients. Noncompliance stems from non-evidence-based filter placement as well as differences and limitations in guidelines. Avoiding non-indicated IVC filter placement and consolidation of guidelines may significantly improve guideline compliance. The critical insights gained from this study can help promote judicious use of IVC filters and highlight the role of venous thromboembolism experts in navigating complex cases and nuances of guidelines.

### Retrievable versus permanent caval filter procedures: when are they cost-effective for interventional radiology? [^113zFAL4]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Because many retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are placed without ever being removed, placement of a retrievable device that is not removed incurs greater technical cost for the institution than a cheaper permanent filter (PF), with no clinical benefit for the patient and no additional professional or technical revenue for the interventional radiologist and institution. The purposes of this study are to identify patient characteristics associated with lack of removal of a retrievable filter (RF) and to develop a cost-effective strategy for placement of a retrievable IVC filter.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective evaluation of 160 consecutive patients who underwent IVC filter placement with or without removal in our interventional radiology (IR) unit over a period of 31 months was performed. Patient characteristics were identified that were associated with lack of removal of retrievable IVC filters, and the cost savings were calculated in the event that a PF had been substituted for an RF in these patients.

Results

A total of 160 consecutive IVC filters were placed during the study period. Of these, 42 (26%) were PFs and 118 (74%) were RFs. During the study period, only 27 of the 118 RFs (23%) were subsequently removed. Factors associated with lack of removal of an RF included patient age (P = 0.003), presence of ongoing malignancy (P = 0.04), and indication for filter placement (P = 0.01). Retrospectively, the use of retrievable devices only in the presence of two of the three selection criteria (ie, age < 65 years, no ongoing malignancy, prophylactic indication) would have resulted in a net incremental benefit of $59,562 for the IR service.

Conclusions

The preferential use of retrievable versus permanent devices for filter placement is financially advantageous for an IR unit only if at least 41% of them are eventually removed. The use of clinical criteria to select device type allows significant cost savings.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters — routine placement during therapeutic anticoagulation for acute venous thromboembolism (VTE): In patients with acute VTE (deep vein thrombosis [DVT], pulmonary embolism [PE]) who are being treated with therapeutic anticoagulation, we recommend against routine placement of an IVC filter (Strength of Recommendation: Moderate). The panel considered data from 3 large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 1 observational retrospective comparative study, and taken together these data suggest that IVC filters in addition to anticoagulation may reduce the risk of PE but increase the risk of DVT, with no difference in mortality. Benefits and harms were judged to favor the comparison (no IVC filter), and the panel judged that there is probably important uncertainty or variability in how patients value outcomes. The panel judged that routine IVC filter placement would lead to a moderate increase in costs and resources used to evaluate and treat IVC filter complications, that acceptability to stakeholders probably varies, and that placement is probably feasible except in communities where interventionalists may not be available to place an IVC filter. Given the high efficacy of contemporary anticoagulation, future research should focus on whether IVC filter placement is beneficial in patients with acute VTE who have contraindications to therapeutic anticoagulation.

### Spanish multicenter real-life registry of retrievable vena cava filters (REFiVeC) [^114tWuah]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Medium credibility.

Until the publication of H Decousus, et al. in 1998 (Decousus et al.), even with little clinical evidence, no one questioned the usefulness of inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) for the prophylaxis and treatment of VTD (Proctor and Greenfield; Athanasoulis et al; Stein et al; Dalen and Stein). It was Decousus, et al. and the PREPIC study (PREPIC Study Group) that demonstrated that IVCF represents a potential benefit with protection against life-threatening pulmonary embolism in a short-term; however, with a higher risk of symptomatic DVT in a long-term without mortality difference at 8 years of follow-up. Therefore, the use of IVCF decreased in Europe (PREPIC Study Group; Reddy et al; Wadhwa et al.). The arrival of new retrievable IVCF increased the indications for filter placement, to provide protection against PE in the short-term while avoiding the long-term DVT risks by removing the filter in a short period. In the past decade, it has encountered a rising complication in the IVCF placement reported in the United States, MAUDE database (Amendola and Acosta), that resulted in a Safety Alert issued by the FDA in 2010 (Morales et al.). This safety alert encourages physicians and clinicians responsible for the care of patients with IVCF, to consider removing the filters when there was no longer an indication of inferior vena cava interruption. (Amendola and Acosta; Food and Drug Administration) However, in daily clinical practice, it may be difficult to follow patients closely and prompt filter removal.

We present the results of a multicenter prospective registry involving 15 tertiary Spanish hospitals using a protocol to facilitate close patient follow-up for prompt filter removal.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate all the inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) retrieval rate of implanted IVC filters. Secondary objectives were to analyze the causes of failed retrieval, procedure-related complications, and outcomes at a 12-month follow-up.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116VpriD]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in addition to anticoagulation for acute DVT or PE — The PREPIC randomized trial showed that placement of a permanent IVC filter increased DVT, decreased PE, and did not influence VTE (DVT and PE combined) or mortality. The published PREPIC 2 randomized trial found that placement of an IVC filter for 3 months did not reduce recurrent PE, including fatal PE, in anticoagulated patients with PE and DVT who had additional risk factors for recurrent VTE. It is also stated that it is uncertain if there is benefit to placement of an IVC filter in anticoagulated patients with severe PE (eg, with hypotension), and that the recommendation against insertion of an IVC filter in anticoagulated acute PE may not apply to this select subgroup.

### Inferior vena cava filters for the treatment of patients with venous thromboembolic disease… [^111ey8VF]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Venous thromboembolism is a continuum of disease states ranging from deep vein thrombosis to pulmonary embolism. Mortality from VTE is significant, reported to be as high as 40% at 10 years. 1 Although anticoagulation represents a mainstay of treatment, inferior vena cava filters are sometimes used for both prophylactic and therapeutic purposes. Current guidelines are inconsistent regarding appropriate indications for filter placement, largely due to limited high-quality data to support utilization of IVC filters and an increased awareness of filter-related complications related to prolonged implantation.

2. Forest Plot of Relative Risk of Mortality With Use of Inferior Vena Cava Filter vs No IVC Filters in Trauma Patients. Objective To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the comparative effectiveness of prophylactic IVC filters in trauma patients, particularly in preventing PE, fatal PE, and mortality. Data Sources. Results Eight controlled studies compared the effectiveness of no IVC filter vs IVC filter on PE, fatal PE, deep vein thrombosis, and/or mortality in trauma patients.

Evidence showed a consistent reduction of PE and fatal PE with IVC filter placement, without any statistical heterogeneity. We found no significant difference in the incidence of deep vein thrombosis or mortality. The number needed to treat to prevent 1 additional PE with IVC filters is estimated to range from 109 to 962, depending on the baseline PE risk. Conclusions and Relevance The strength of evidence is low but supports the association of IVC filter placement with a lower incidence of PE and fatal PE in trauma patients. Which patients experience benefit enough to outweigh the harms associated with IVC filter placement remains unclear. Additional well-designed observational or prospective cohort studies may be informative.

However, a small proportion of patients who are at the highest risk of VTE owing to severe injury also have definite or relative contraindications to low-molecular-weight heparin therapy because of an ongoing risk of life-threatening bleeding. In certain patients with traumatic brain injury, solid-organ injury, or retroperitoneal hematoma, the benefit of preventing VTE with low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis may be overshadowed by the risk of excess bleeding. The increased use of IVC filters in general10 and in trauma patients specifically11 is well documented, with wide variation between trauma centers in the rates of IVC filter placement. 12 This practice variation may result from conflicting guidelines. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management guideline promotes IVC filters in certain patients.

5 The American College of Chest Physicians has a more recent guideline stating that "for major trauma patients, we suggest that an IVC filter should not be used for primary VTE prevention. "6 For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we critically evaluated the data regarding the safety and efficacy of prophylactic IVC filters in trauma patients with the goal of providing evidence to guide practice and further research about their use. We classified results by outcome into the following 4 grades: high, moderate.

### A population-based study of inferior vena cava filters in patients with acute venous thromboembolism… [^116kfE5H]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Methods A retrospective chart review of inpatient and outpatient medical records was conducted. Recorded indication for IVC filter placement was determined among a subset of cases from 3 Worcester tertiary care hospitals. Three thrombosis specialists assessed the appropriateness of IVC filter placement. Results. Conclusions In this community-based study, IVC filters were frequently used in the treatment of patients with acute VTE. Placement was deemed to be appropriate in approximately 50% of the patients but was not appropriate or debatable in the remaining cases. Given the increasing use of IVC filters, prospective studies are clearly needed to better define the indications for, and efficacy of, IVC filter placement. Three experts in the field of thromboembolism independently reviewed the data pertaining to rationale or indication for filter placement for each of the patients in whom an IVC filter was placed; each of these cases was categorized as meeting or not meeting 2001 ACCP guidelines. The criteria for appropriate filter placement were documented recurrent VTE during adequate anticoagulant therapy; presence of a contradiction or complication of anticoagulation in a patient with, or at high risk of, a proximal lower-extremity DVT; chronic recurrent embolism with pulmonary hypertension; and concurrent performance of surgical pulmonary embolectomy or pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. Of the patients who were discharged from the hospital, those with an IVC filter were much less likely to be discharged on a regimen of anticoagulant therapy.

In-hospital mortality was significantly higher among patients who received an IVC filter compared with those who did not receive a filter. The incidence of major bleeding was not significantly different between the 2 groups. All-cause mortality was significantly higher in patients in whom an IVC filter was placed compared with patients who did not receive an IVC filter. The indications for filter placement were determined in 160 of 165 patients who had an IVC filter placed in 1 of 3 area hospitals. In 5 patients, some or all of the chart information required was not available.

Based on medical record review, 57 patients were deemed to be at high risk for bleeding, 39 patients had a history of recent bleeding, 26 patients had major bleeding after starting anticoagulant therapy, and 9 patients had minor bleeding after starting anticoagulant therapy. Overall, the 3 reviewers agreed that there was an indication for IVC filter placement in 81 of 160 patients, but they also agreed unanimously that an IVC filter was not indicated in 41 patients. In 20 cases, 2 of the reviewers thought that an IVC filter was indicated, but 1 reviewer disagreed. The Fleiss κ score was consistent, with substantial agreement between multiple raters. Table 2 shows the agreement and disagreement between the reviewers about whether the indication for IVC filter placement was consistent with the ACCP 2001 guidelines.
