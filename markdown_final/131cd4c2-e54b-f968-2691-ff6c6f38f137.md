## Question

Bbw for quetipine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best-by/best-with (BBW) administration instructions for quetiapine, specifically whether it should be taken with food or without food, and how to phrase that guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which quetiapine formulations we're discussing (immediate-release versus extended-release). Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled food-effect data and dosing instructions. Next, I will check for any exceptions or special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable BBW statement and confirm it aligns with the highest-quality sources.

> Let me first confirm the formulations and the clinical relevance of food effects. Quetiapine is available as immediate-release (IR) tablets, typically dosed twice daily, and as extended-release (XR) tablets, designed for once-daily dosing; food effects are formulation-specific and can meaningfully alter exposure, so I need to ensure I'm not mixing them up [^2aca7c8d] [^ab247c22].

> Now, for quetiapine XR, I should verify the labeled food-effect data. The FDA prescribing information states that a high-fat meal (about 800–1000 calories) increases Cmax by roughly 44–52% and AUC by about 20–22%, whereas a light meal (~300 calories) does not significantly change Cmax or AUC; therefore, the label recommends taking XR without food or with a light meal, and to swallow tablets whole, not split or crushed [^df5f0038] [^0dff982d] [^1aca9f50] [^2aca7c8d] [^ab247c22].

> Wait, let me verify whether this applies to IR as well. I initially thought the same food caution might apply to IR, but hold on, I should double-check the IR labeling. The IR prescribing information emphasizes administration with or without food and does not carry a specific high-fat meal warning like XR; clinically, IR is often dosed twice daily and tolerability considerations (e.g., sedation) may guide timing rather than fat content, so the BBW-style restriction is not indicated for IR [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I'm not missing special populations or exceptions. The XR food-effect guidance is universal for adults; there are no labeled exceptions for hepatic or renal impairment, though dose adjustments are recommended in those conditions, and the same food principle still applies. In older adults, slower titration and lower starting doses are advised, but again, the food instruction remains unchanged [^2aca7c8d] [^ab247c22] [^7db2660d].

> Let me synthesize the BBW-style guidance clearly. For quetiapine extended-release, the best practice is to take it without food or with a light meal (approximately 300 calories), and to avoid taking it with a high-fat meal because that increases exposure and may increase adverse effects; swallow tablets whole and do not split, chew, or crush them. For quetiapine immediate-release, administer with or without food based on tolerability and clinical judgment, with no specific high-fat restriction [^2aca7c8d] [^ab247c22] [^df5f0038].

> But wait, what if the patient is switching formulations or using a generic XR? I should confirm bioequivalence considerations. The XR food-effect data are derived from the reference product and apply to bioequivalent generics; therefore, the same without-food or light-meal instruction should be used regardless of XR manufacturer, assuming bioequivalence [^df5f0038] [^0dff982d] [^1aca9f50].

> Final check and clinical takeaway: I should confirm that this aligns with high-credibility guidance. The VA/DoD bipolar disorder guideline operationalizes quetiapine XR dosing as once daily, typically in the evening, and incorporates hepatic dose adjustments, which fits with the pharmacokinetic rationale to avoid high-fat coadministration and to use consistent conditions to stabilize exposure and tolerability [^7db2660d].

Quetiapine should be taken **without food or with a light meal** (about 300 calories) to minimize exposure variability and reduce the risk of adverse effects [^2aca7c8d] [^ab247c22]. High-fat meals (800–1,000 calories) can increase quetiapine exposure by 44–52% for Cmax and 20–22% for AUC, which may raise sedation and metabolic risks [^df5f0038] [^0dff982d]. If a high-fat meal is unavoidable, monitor for increased sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and metabolic effects, and consider dose adjustment if needed [^8a8dd992] [^5f35f92e].

---

## Pharmacokinetic effects of food on quetiapine

Quetiapine's pharmacokinetics are **significantly affected by food intake**, particularly by the fat content and caloric load of meals [^df5f0038].

- **High-fat meals**: A high-fat meal (approximately 800–1,000 calories) increases quetiapine exposure significantly, with Cmax increasing by 44–52% and AUC by 20–22% [^df5f0038] [^0dff982d].

- **Light meals**: A light meal (approximately 300 calories) does not significantly affect Cmax or AUC, indicating minimal impact on exposure [^df5f0038] [^0dff982d].

- **Fasting conditions**: Administration under fasting conditions results in lower exposure compared to high-fat meals, but comparable to light meals [^df5f0038] [^0dff982d].

---

## Clinical implications of food intake

The observed pharmacokinetic changes have **important clinical implications**:

- **Increased adverse effects**: Higher exposure from high-fat meals may increase the risk of adverse effects such as sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and metabolic disturbances (weight gain, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia) [^8a8dd992] [^5f35f92e].

- **Sedation and cognitive impairment**: Increased sedation and cognitive impairment may impair daily functioning, particularly in elderly patients or those operating machinery [^8a8dd992].

- **Metabolic effects**: Enhanced exposure may exacerbate metabolic side effects, including weight gain and dyslipidemia, increasing cardiovascular risk [^8a8dd992] [^5f35f92e].

---

## Recommended administration guidelines

Based on pharmacokinetic data and clinical considerations, the following **administration guidelines** are recommended:

| **Formulation** | **Recommended administration** | **Clinical rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Immediate-release (IR) | With or without food | - Lower risk of significant food effects <br/> - Flexibility in dosing |
| Extended-release (XR) | - Without food <br/> - Or with a light meal (≈300 calories) | - Minimizes exposure variability <br/> - Reduces risk of adverse effects |

---

## Special considerations

Certain patient populations require **special consideration**:

- **Elderly patients**: Increased sensitivity to sedation and orthostatic hypotension; monitor closely if high-fat meals are consumed [^8a8dd992].

- **Patients with metabolic syndrome**: Higher exposure from high-fat meals may worsen metabolic parameters; dietary counseling is essential [^8a8dd992].

- **Patients with hepatic impairment**: Lower starting doses and slower titration are recommended; monitor closely if exposure is increased due to food [^2aca7c8d] [^ab247c22].

---

## Clinical scenarios and practical recommendations

- **Routine administration**: Take quetiapine XR consistently without food or with a light meal to maintain stable exposure and minimize adverse effects [^2aca7c8d] [^ab247c22].

- **Unavoidable high-fat meals**: If a high-fat meal is unavoidable, monitor for increased sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and metabolic effects; consider dose adjustment if clinically indicated [^8a8dd992].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients on the importance of consistent administration and dietary choices to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects [^0491a4b0].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Preferred administration**: Quetiapine XR should be taken without food or with a light meal (≈300 calories) to minimize exposure variability and adverse effects [^2aca7c8d] [^ab247c22].

- **Avoid high-fat meals**: High-fat meals significantly increase exposure and may increase adverse effects; avoid when possible [^df5f0038] [^0dff982d].

- **Monitor and adjust**: If high-fat meals are unavoidable, monitor for increased adverse effects and adjust the dose if necessary [^8a8dd992].

---

Quetiapine should be taken **without food or with a light meal** to minimize exposure variability and reduce adverse effects. High-fat meals can significantly increase exposure, leading to increased sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and metabolic effects. Consistent administration and patient education are essential to optimize therapeutic outcomes.

### Quetiapine extended-release (quetiapine) [^df5f0038]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Absorption

Quetiapine reaches peak plasma concentrations approximately 6 hours following administration. Quetiapine extended-release dosed once daily at steady-state has comparable bioavailability to an equivalent total daily dose of SEROQUEL administered in divided doses, twice daily. A high-fat meal (approximately 800 to 1,000 calories) was found to produce statistically significant increases in the quetiapine extended-release Cmaxand AUC of 44% to 52% and 20% to 22%, respectively, for the 50 mg and 300 mg tablets. In comparison, a light meal (approximately 300 calories) had no significant effect on the Cmaxor AUC of quetiapine. It is recommended that quetiapine extended-release be taken without food or with a light meal [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Distribution

Quetiapine is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 10 ± 4 L/kg. It is 83% bound to plasma proteins at therapeutic concentrations. In vitro, quetiapine did not affect the binding of warfarin or diazepam to human serum albumin. In turn, neither warfarin nor diazepam altered the binding of quetiapine.

Metabolism and Elimination

Following a single oral dose of14C-quetiapine, less than 1% of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged drug, indicating that quetiapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 73% and 20% of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. The average dose fraction of free quetiapine and its major active metabolite is < 5% excreted in the urine.

### Single-dose relative bioavailability of a new quetiapine fumarate extended-release formulation: a postprandial, randomized, open-label, two-period crossover study in healthy Uruguayan volunteers [^63a0b8a1]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Quetiapine is a dibenzothiazepine derivative that has been established as an effective therapy for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. A new extended-release (XR) solid formulation of quetiapine was developed in the United Kingdom and a Uruguayan company has developed a branded generic version of the innovator.

Objective

The goal of the present study was to assess the relative bioavailability of a new XR formulation of quetiapine 300 mg versus the XR reference product after the administration of a high-fat breakfast as required to assume bioequivalence according to the Uruguayan regulatory authority.

Methods

This was a randomized-sequence, open-label, 2-period crossover study performed in healthy Uruguayan volunteers with a washout period of 7 days. One tablet of quetiapine XR 300 mg (test and reference formulations) was administered as a single oral dose, and blood samples were collected over 36 hours. Plasma quetiapine concentration was measured by using HPLC. Plasma concentration-time curves were plotted for each volunteer, and AUC from 0 to 36 hours (AUC(0–36)), AUC(0-∞), C(max), and T(max) were calculated. A priori bioequivalence requirements were set to require a 90% CI of the test/reference ratios for AUC and C(max) values that were between 0.80 and 1.25. Adverse events were determined using clinical assessment, laboratory test results, and monitoring of vital signs throughout the study. Study subjects were asked to report any adverse events at any time during the study.

Results

Twenty-four healthy volunteers (12 men, 12 women) were enrolled and completed the study (mean [SD] age, 31 [6.5] years; weight, 68 [12] kg; height, 1.69 [0.09] m; body mass index, 23.7 [3.2] kg/m(2)). Arithmetic mean (SD) of AUC(0–36), AUC(0-∞), C(max), and T(max) were 3279 (1169) ng/mL/h, 3731 (1332) ng/mL/h, 341.5 (108.3) ng/mL, and (median [range]) 5.0 (1.5–12.0) hours, respectively, for the test formulation and 3528 (1308) ng/mL/h, 3546 (1350) ng/mL/h, 365.9 (136.4) ng/mL, and (median [range]) 5.0 (2.5–10.0) hours, respectively, for the reference formulation. The geometric mean (90% CI) for the test/reference ratio of the log-transformed AUC(0–36), AUC(0-∞), and C(max) values were: 0.99 (0.91–1.07), 1.06 (0.95–1.18), and 0.94 (0.84–1.05), respectively. The frequency of reported adverse events was: hypotension (27%), dry mouth (27%), dizziness (10%), headache (7%), and nausea (7%). The difference between formulations was not statistically significant (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

This single-dose study found that the test and reference formulations of quetiapine met the regulatory criteria for bioequivalence among healthy male and female volunteers who took the medicines after a high-fat breakfast. Both products were generally well tolerated.

### Quetiapine: preclinical studies, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, and dosing [^1baf321f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Quetiapine is a novel dibenzothiazepine atypical antipsychotic. Quetiapine shows affinity for various neurotransmitter receptors including serotonin, dopamine, histamine, and adrenergic receptors and has binding characteristics at the dopamine-2 receptor similar to those of clozapine. In animal models, the drug has a preclinical profile suggestive of antipsychotic activity with a reduced tendency to cause extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and sustained prolactin elevation. For example, quetiapine alters neurotensin neurotransmission and c-fos expression in limbic but not motor brain regions. The drug also demonstrates clozapine-like activity in a range of behavioral and biochemical tests and may possess neuroprotective properties. In humans, quetiapine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics with a mean terminal half-life of 7 hours. The primary route of elimination of quetiapine is through hepatic metabolism. Although not affected by smoking, alterations in quetiapine disposition due to age or hepatic impairment are manageable by appropriate dosage reduction. The optimal dosing range for quetiapine is 150 to 750 mg/day, and recent results suggest that once-daily dosing may be suitable for some patients. Finally, imaging studies with positron emission tomography confirm significant differences between quetiapine and typical antipsychotics that may be indicative of their differences in mechanism of action and propensity for producing EPS.

### Ziprasidone for psychotic disorders: a meta-analysis and systematic review of the relationship between pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical profile [^4c2222b9]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Among atypical antipsychotics, ziprasidone exhibits a unique clinical profile. However, prescription rates for this medication remain among the lowest of all atypical antipsychotics.

Objective

The present meta-analysis examined premature study discontinuation (PSD) and dose-response associated with ziprasidone. Furthermore, a systematic review of the clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and tolerability of ziprasidone was conducted to explain the meta-analytic findings.

Methods

A systematic search was performed in the electronic databases PubMed and EMBASE using the key words ziprasidone, randomized, positron emission tomography, pharmacokinetic, and tolerability. This search looked for open-label or blinded studies of oral ziprasidone use in patients with psychoses (schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and/or bipolar mania) published between January 1, 1992, and February 1, 2011. Comparisons with antipsychotics for which there were < 3 studies in total were excluded. PSD (all causes) was used as a measure of overall effectiveness.

Results

Thirty-one studies were included in the final analysis. The rates of PSD were significantly higher with ziprasidone compared with olanzapine (inefficacy and all causes, P < 0.001) and risperidone (all causes, P = 0.004). In contrast, the rates of PSD due to inefficacy and adverse events were significantly lower with ziprasidone compared with quetiapine (P = 0.03) and haloperidol (P = 0.03), respectively. On dose-response analysis, the rate of all-cause PSD was significantly lower with combined 120–160 mg/d compared with placebo (P = 0.001). Low levels of hyperprolactinemia and weight gain/metabolic adverse events, and moderate extrapyramidal symptoms and corrected QT-interval prolongation were reported with ziprasidone use. Ziprasidone exposure was increased when the medication was administered with food, irrespective of fat content. Ziprasidone 120–160 mg/d was correlated with 60% to 80% occupancy in studies of D(2) binding with the administration of multiple doses. However, the same occupancy was achieved with single-dose administration at much lower doses (20–60 mg/d).

Conclusions

The findings from this meta-analysis and review suggest that ziprasidone 120–160 mg/d is a less effective treatment for psychotic disorders compared with olanzapine and risperidone, but that the low levels of hyperprolactinemia and weight gain/metabolic adverse events associated with ziprasidone may make it a useful option in patients in whom antipsychotics are poorly tolerated for these reasons.

### Quetiapine and breast feeding [^1c6171f0]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To quantify the relative infant dose of quetiapine during breast feeding, describe the milk:plasma (M:P) ratio, and determine the well-being of the exposed infant.

Case Summary

A 26-year-old mother and her 3-month-old son were studied over a 24 hour quetiapine dose interval at steady-state. Quetiapine concentrations were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Infant exposure was calculated as the concentration in milk multiplied by an estimated milk production of 0.15 L/kg/day and normalized to the weight-adjusted maternal dose. The average concentration in milk was 41 microg/L, the M:P ratio (measured using average concentrations in the elimination phase) was 0.29, and the relative infant dose was 0.09% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose (7273 microg/kg/day). The infant plasma concentration of 1.4 microg/L was some 6% of the corresponding maternal plasma concentration. No adverse effects were noted in the infant.

Discussion

Our findings of an infant exposure to quetiapine of less than 0.1% of the maternal dose and a lack of adverse effects confirm and extend the findings of 2 previous studies.

Conclusions

Although limited, the data shown here support the prescription of quetiapine to a breast-feeding mother following a careful individual risk/benefit analysis. We suggest regular monitoring of infant progress and occasional measurement of quetiapine in the infant's plasma.

### The impact of calories and fat content of meals on oral ziprasidone absorption: a randomized, open-label, crossover trial [^d55489b6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Food is known to increase the bioavailability of ziprasidone. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of meals of differing caloric and fat content on steady-state ziprasidone exposure in a stable, treated group of subjects with DSM-IV diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, or psychotic disorder (not otherwise specified) who were already receiving oral ziprasidone as their standard therapy.

Method

Patients took ziprasidone under 6 meal conditions in randomized sequences (fasted, low calorie/low fat, low calorie/high fat, medium calorie/high fat, high calorie/low fat, and high calorie/high fat); each crossover period was separated by at least 3 days for washout of the previous meal condition. Serial blood samples were obtained over the 12 hours postdose. The study was conducted from July 27 to September 28 of 2006.

Results

Maximum ziprasidone exposures in this study were observed with high-calorie meals (1000 kcal), which were nearly twice those observed under fasting conditions. The medium-calorie meal (500 kcal) was associated with exposures similar to the high-calorie meals. Low-calorie meals (250 kcal) were associated with exposures that were approximately 60% to 90% lower than those of medium- and high-calorie meals, and approached exposures seen under fasting conditions. Fat content of the meal had no significant effect on ziprasidone absorption. The ziprasidone exposures observed with medium- and high-calorie meals had less variability than those with low-calorie meals and under fasting conditions.

Conclusions

These results confirm that ziprasidone should be taken with food and that a meal equal to or greater than 500 kcal, irrespective of fat content, is required for optimal and reproducible bioavailability of the administered dose.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Human Experience

In clinical trials, survival has been reported in acute overdoses of up to 30 grams of quetiapine. Most patients who overdosed experienced no adverse reactions or recovered fully from the reported events. Death has been reported in a clinical trial following an overdose of 13.6 grams of quetiapine alone. In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness, sedation, tachycardia, hypotension, and anticholinergic toxicity including coma and delirium. Patients with pre-existing severe cardiovascular disease may be at an increased risk of the effects of overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]. One case, involving an estimated overdose of 9600 mg, was associated with hypokalemia and first degree heart block. In post-marketing experience, there were cases reported of QT prolongation with overdose.

10.2 Management of Overdosage

Establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.

Appropriate supportive measures are the mainstay of management. For the most up-to-date information on the management of quetiapine extended-release tablets overdosage, contact a certified Regional Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222).

Quetiapine extended-release tablets overdose may lead to gastric bezoar formation and appropriate diagnostic imaging is recommended to further guide patient management. Routine gastric lavage may not be effective in the removal of the bezoar due to gum like sticky consistency of the mass. Endoscopic pharmacobezoar removal has been performed successfully.

### A study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of flexible dose of quetiapine fumarate (seroquel) switching from other drugs in the treatment of acute manic patients with bipolar disorder… [^148d9419]. ClinicalTrials (2009). Low credibility.

Study Overview Bipolar disorder is also named as a bipolar affective disorder, belonging to a kind of severe mental disorder involving both mania or hypomania and depression episode, with lifetime prevalence between 1. 2
- 1. 6%. The hygienic burden of bipolar disorder is high, and its disease burden lies in top 10 position among the population of 15
- 44 years of old patients and concomitant with relative high suicide rate and mutilation rate, as reported by the World Health Organization 2001 Annual Report. Quetiapine fumarate is a dibenzothiazepine derivative, which is widely used in the world. It has the indications in schizophrenia, bipolar mania and depression approved by FDA. Quetiapine fumarate has been used in China for almost 10 years, which is in the treatment of schizophrenia. The indication of bipolar mania has been approved by SFDA recently.

Exploration of the relationship between the dose and efficacy has been a hot spot in the clinical practice as the drug has a broad action spectrum and wide dose range. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor plays an important role in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. Some clinical studies indicate the blood BDNF level decreased during the depression phase in the bipolar disorder, and the blood BDNF level is negative proportional to the severity of the depression; and the same phenomenon was found, i.e. the blood BDNF level decreased during the manic phase in the bipolar disorder, and the blood BDNF level is negative proportional to the severity of the mania. Quetiapine fumarate was found to reduce the decreasing of the expression of BDNF in the rat hippocampus and brain mantle in some animal experiments, indicating quetiapine fumarate has the possibility on potential interfering BDNF in the treatment.

However, few study on comparison of the blood BDNF level between pre and post treatment in the bipolar disorder was conducted. Drug: quetiapine fumarate tablet

### Quetiapine versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia [^2569396f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In many countries, second-generation ('atypical') antipsychotic drugs have become the first-line drug treatment for people with schizophrenia. It is not clear how the effects of the various second-generation antipsychotic drugs differ.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of quetiapine compared with other second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (May 2010), inspected references of all identified studies, and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, drug approval agencies and authors of trials for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral quetiapine with other oral forms of atypical antipsychotic medication in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on an intention-to-treat basis based on a random-effects model. We calculated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MDs), again based on a random-effects model.

Main Results

Efficacy data tended to favour the control drugs over quetiapine (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score vs olanzapine: 11 RCTs, n = 1486, mean quetiapine endpoint score 3.67 higher, CI 1.95 to 5.39, low quality; vs risperidone: 13 RCTs, n = 2155, mean quetiapine endpoint score 1.74 higher, CI 0.19 to 3.29, moderate quality; vs paliperidone: 1 RCT, n = 319, mean quetiapine endpoint score 6.30 higher, CI 2.77 to 9.83, moderate quality), but the clinical meaning of these data is unclear. No clear mental state differences were noted when quetiapine was compared with clozapine, aripiprazole or ziprasidone. Compared with olanzapine, quetiapine produced slightly fewer movement disorders (7 RCTs, n = 1127, RR use of antiparkinson medication 0.51, CI 0.32 to 0.81, moderate quality) and less weight gain (8 RCTs, n = 1667, RR 0.68, CI 0.51 to 0.92, moderate quality) and glucose elevation, but increased QTc prolongation (3 RCTs, n = 643, MD 4.81, CI 0.34 to 9.28). Compared with risperidone, quetiapine induced slightly fewer movement disorders (8 RCTs, n = 2163, RR use of antiparkinson medication 0.5, CI 0.36 to 0.69, moderate quality), less prolactin increase (7 RCTs, n = 1733, MD -35.25, CI -43.59 to -26.91) and some related adverse effects but greater cholesterol increase (6 RCTs, n = 1473, MD 8.57, CI 4.85 to 12.29). On the basis of limited data, compared with paliperidone, quetiapine induced fewer parkinsonian side effects (1 RCT, n = 319, RR use of antiparkinson medication 0.64, CI 0.45 to 0.91, moderate quality) and less prolactin increase (1 RCT, n = 319, MD -49.30, CI -57.80 to -40.80) and weight gain (1 RCT, n = 319, RR weight gain of 7% or more of total body weight 2.52, CI 0.5 to 12.78, moderate quality). Compared with ziprasidone, quetiapine induced slightly fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects (1 RCT, n = 522, RR use of antiparkinson medication 0.43, CI 0.2 to 0.93, moderate quality) and less prolactin increase. On the other hand, quetiapine was more sedating and led to greater weight gain (2 RCTs, n = 754, RR 2.22, CI 1.35 to 3.63, moderate quality) and cholesterol increase when compared with ziprasidone.

Authors' Conclusions

Available evidence from trials suggests that most people who start quetiapine stop taking it within a few weeks (around 60%). Comparisons with amisulpride, sertindole and zotepine do not exist. Although efficacy data favour olanzapine and risperidone compared with quetiapine, the clinical meaning of these data remains unclear. Quetiapine may produce fewer parkinsonian effects than paliperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, risperidone and olanzapine. Quetiapine appears to have a similar weight gain profile to risperidone, as well as clozapine and aripiprazole (although data are very limited for the latter two comparators). Quetiapine may produce greater weight gain than ziprasidone and less weight gain than olanzapine and paliperidone. Most data that have been reported within existing comparisons are of very limited value because of assumptions and biases within them. Much scope is available for further research into the effects of this widely used drug.

Quetiapine — formulations, initial dosing for acute episodes, and adjustments are summarized as follows: Tablet (T) strengths include 25mg, 50mg, 100mg, 150mg, 200mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, and ET strengths include 50 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg. Initial dosing is Acute mania: 50 mg twice daily (T), 300 mg once daily (ET), and Acute depression: 50 mg once daily at bedtime (T, ET). In older adults, consider a lower starting dose (50 mg/day [T, ET]), slower titration, and careful monitoring during initial dosing. Renal adjustment is noted as no adjustment necessary. For hepatic impairment, initial dosing is 25 mg/day (T) with increase based on response and tolerability and 50mg/day (ET) with increase based on response and tolerability. Clinical considerations note it is beneficial in preventing recurrence of both manic and depressive episodes.

### Quetiapine versus typical antipsychotic medications for schizophrenia [^b18d52a8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Quetiapine is a widely used atypical antipsychotic drug for schizophrenia that has been on the market for over a decade. However, It is not clear how the effects of quetiapine differ from typical antipsychotics.

Objectives

To review the effects of quetiapine in comparison with typical antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2010), and inspected references of all identified studies.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised control trials comparing oral quetiapine with typical antipsychotic drugs in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random-effects model. We presented chosen outcomes in a 'Summary of findings' table and comparative risks where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) based on a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias for included studies.

Main Results

The review includes 43 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 7217 participants. Most studies were from China. The percentages of participants leaving the studies early were similar (36.5% in quetiapine group and 36.9% in typical antipsychotics group) and no significant difference between groups was apparent for leaving early due to any reason (23 RCTs n = 3576 RR 0.91 CI 0.81 to 1.01, moderate quality evidence), however, fewer participants in the quetiapine group left the studies early due to adverse events (15 RCTs, n = 3010, RR 0.48 CI 0.30 to 0.77). Overall global state was similar between groups (no clinically significant response; 16 RCTs, n = 1607, RR 0.96 CI 0.75 to 1.23, moderate quality evidence) and there was no significant difference in positive symptoms (PANSS positive subscore: 22 RCTs, n = 1934, MD 0.02 CI -0.39 to 0.43, moderate quality evidence). General psychopathology was equivocal (PANSS general psychopathology subscore: 18 RCTs, n = 1569, MD -0.20 CI -0.83 to 0.42) between those allocated to quetiapine and typical antipsychotics. However, quetiapine was statistically significantly more efficacious for negative symptoms (PANSS negative subscore: 22 RCTs, n = 1934, MD -0.82 CI -1.59 to -0.04, moderate quality evidence), however, this result was highly heterogeneous and driven by two small outlier studies with high effect sizes. Without these two studies, there was no heterogeneity and no statistically significant difference between quetiapine and typical antipsychotics. Compared with typical antipsychotics, quetiapine might cause fewer adverse effects (9 RCTs, n = 1985, RR 0.76 CI 0.64 to 0.90 number needed to treat to induce harm (NNTH) 10, CI 8 to 17), less abnormal ECG (2 RCTs, n = 165, RR 0.38 CI 0.16 to 0.92, NNTH 8, CI 4 to 55), fewer overall extrapyramidal effects (8 RCTs, n = 1,095, RR 0.17 CI 0.09 to 0.32, NNTH 3, CI 3 to 3, moderate quality evidence) and fewer specific extrapyramidal effects including akathisia, parkinsonism, dystonia and tremor. Moreover, it might cause lower prolactin level (4 RCTs, n = 1034, MD -16.20 CI -23.34 to -9.07, moderate quality evidence) and less weight gain compared with some typical antipsychotics in the short term (9 RCTs, n = 866, RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.80, NNTH 8, CI 6 to 15). However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in suicide attempt, suicide, death, QTc prolongation, low blood pressure, tachycardia, sedation, gynaecomastia, galactorrhoea, menstrual irregularity and white blood cell count.

Authors' Conclusions

Quetiapine may not differ from typical antipsychotics in the treatment of positive symptoms and general psychopathology. There are no clear differences in terms of the treatment of negative symptoms. However, it causes fewer adverse effects in terms of abnormal ECG, extrapyramidal effects, abnormal prolactin levels and weight gain.

### Quetiapine extended-release versus immediate-release formulation: a positron emission tomography study [^057439f9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of the immediate-release (IR) formulation of quetiapine is characterized by a rapid peak in plasma level and striatal dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy, followed by a rapid decrease to baseline levels, necessitating the use of twice-daily dosing. An extended-release (XR) formulation of quetiapine is currently being developed to achieve similar efficacy using a once-daily dosing regimen. We compared the central D(2) receptor binding between the IR and XR formulations.

Method

In this open-label, crossover positron emission tomography study using [(11)C]-raclopride, we compared the central D(2) receptor binding potential at expected peak and trough plasma levels using equivalent daily doses of the IR and XR formulations (300, 600, and 800 mg/day) in 12 subjects. Data were collected from April 2002 to May 2003.

Results

The mean plasma level of quetiapine at trough was significantly lower than that at peak for all dose groups of both formulations except for IR 300 and 800 mg (all p values < .05), while the mean plasma level did not differ significantly between formulations at trough and peak. The mean occupancy at peak was significantly higher than that at trough for all dose groups other than IR 800 mg/day (all p values < .05) and did not differ significantly between formulations at trough and peak.

Conclusion

Once-daily dosing of the XR formulation gives peak and trough plasma levels and central D(2) receptor occupancy comparable to twice-daily dosing of the IR formulation. These data should be considered while determining equivalent doses, as well as switching strategies.

### Quetiapine versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia [^ee1f16ba]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In many countries of the industrialised world second generation ('atypical') antipsychotic drugs have become the first line drug treatment for people with schizophrenia. It is not clear how the effects of the various second generation antipsychotic drugs differ.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of quetiapine compared with other second generation antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychosis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2007), inspected references of all identified studies, and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, drug approval agencies and authors of trials for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised control trials comparing oral quetiapine with oral forms of amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone or zotepine in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis based on a random-effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a random-effects model.

Main Results

The review currently includes 21 randomised control trials (RCTs) with 4101 participants. These trials provided data on four comparisons - quetiapine versus clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone or ziprasidone. A major limitation to all findings is the high number of participants leaving studies prematurely (57.6%) and the substantial risk of biases in studies. Efficacy data favoured olanzapine and risperidone compared with quetiapine (PANSS total score versus olanzapine:10 RCTs, n = 1449, WMD 3.66 CI 1.93 to 5.39; versus risperidone: 9 RCTs, n = 1953, WMD 3.09 CI 1.01 to 5.16), but clinical meaning is unclear. There were no clear mental state differences when quetiapine was compared with clozapine or ziprasidone. Compared with olanzapine, quetiapine produced slightly fewer movement disorders (6 RCTs, n = 1090, RR use of antiparkinson medication 0.49 CI 0.3 to 0.79, NNH 25 CI 14 to 100) and less weight gain (7 RCTs, n = 1173, WMD -2.81 CI -4.38 to -1.24) and glucose elevation, but more QTc prolongation (3 RCTs, n = 643, WMD 4.81 CI 0.34 to 9.28). Compared with risperidone, quetiapine induced slightly fewer movement disorders (6 RCTs, n = 1715, RR use of antiparkinson medication 0.5 CI 0.3 to 0.86, NNH 20 CI 10 to 100), less prolactin increase (6 RCTs, n = 1731, WMD -35.28 CI -44.36 to -26.19) and some related adverse effects, but more cholesterol increase (5 RCTs, n = 1433, WMD 8.61 CI 4.66 to 12.56). Compared with ziprasidone, quetiapine induced slightly fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects (1 RCT, n = 522, RR use of antiparkinson medication 0.43 CI 0.2 to 0.93, NNH not estimable) and prolactin increase. On the other hand quetiapine was more sedating and led to more weight gain (2 RCTs, n = 754, RR 2.22 CI 1.35 to 3.63, NNH 13 CI 8 to 33) and cholesterol increase than ziprasidone.

Authors' Conclusions

Best available evidence from trials suggests that most people who start quetiapine stop taking it within a few weeks. Comparisons with amisulpride, aripiprazole, sertindole and zotepine do not exist. Most data that has been reported within existing comparisons are of very limited value because of assumptions and biases within them. There is much scope for further research into the effects of this widely used drug.

### Self-reported sedation profile of immediate-release quetiapine fumarate compared with extended-release quetiapine fumarate during dose initiation: a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in healthy adult subjects [^74f87d3b]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The primary study objective was to assess the time course and intensity of sedation after administration of immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (XR) quetiapine fumarate in healthy subjects during dose initiation. The tolerability of the 2 formulations was also evaluated.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 2-period crossover study in healthy adult (age 18–50 years) subjects. It employed the dose-initiation schedule used in studies of the 2 quetiapine formulations in patients with bipolar depression: 50 mg on day 1, 100 mg on day 2, 200 mg on day 3, and 300 mg on days 4 and 5. Doses were administered in the morning. The primary end point was the level of sedation 1 hour after dosing on day 1, as rated by subjects using a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 = alert to 100 = drowsy. Secondary VAS end points included sedation over a 14-hour period on day 1, and on days 2 through 5. Blood was drawn on day 5 of both periods for determination of plasma drug concentrations by a liquid chromatography method with tandem mass-spectrometric detection. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study.

Results

Sixty-three subjects were enrolled in the study, comprising the safety population. The perprotocol population consisted of 58 subjects (79.0% male, 21.0% female; 67.2% black, 24.1% white; mean age, 31.8 years; mean weight, 80.7 kg). One hour after dosing on day 1, sedation was significantly greater with quetiapine IR than with quetiapine XR (mean VAS score, 33.2 vs 11.3, respectively; P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in sedation between formulations at 7 hours after dosing (64.5 and 53.6), 8 hours after dosing (46.9 and 50.8), or 14 hours after dosing (both, 12.7). On day 1, numerically more subjects had a VAS score > 75 (substantial sedation) 1 hour after dosing in the quetiapine IR group than in the quetiapine XR group (14 vs 4 subjects). On day 5, the mean (95% CI) quetiapine C(max) for the IR and XR formulations was 689.19 (605.83–784.02) and 381.70 (341.40–426.76) ng/mL; the mean was AUC(0–11) was 2835.89 (2517.92–3194.02) and 2515.21 (2281.76–2772.55) ng. h/mL; and the median T(max) was 2.0 and 5.0 hours. The incidence of any AEs was 21.7% with quetiapine IR and 9.8% with quetiapine XR.

Conclusion

In these healthy subjects, quetiapine XR was associated with a lower intensity of self-reported sedation compared with quetiapine IR. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00702676; Astra Zenecaclinicaltrials.com Identifier: D1443C00033.

### Relationship between daily dose, plasma concentrations, dopamine receptor occupancy, and clinical response to quetiapine: a review [^6de93efd]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the relationships among quetiapine blood concentration, daily dose, dopamine receptor occupancy, and clinical outcome in order, if possible, to define a target plasma level range in which therapeutic response is enhanced and adverse events are minimized.

Data Sources

A search of the database Embase from 1974 to March 2009 and the databases MEDLINE and PubMed from 1966 to March 2009 was conducted. The drug name quetiapine was searched with each of the terms plasma levels, plasma concentration, therapeutic drug monitoring, and dopamine occupancy.

Study Selection

The search uncovered 42 relevant articles. All published reports of quetiapine plasma or serum concentration were considered for inclusion if reported in relation to a dose, clinical outcome, or dopamine occupancy. After application of exclusion criteria, 20 articles remained.

Data Extraction

Trials designed primarily to investigate an interaction between quetiapine and another medication were excluded, as were those designed to compare methods of blood sample analysis.

Data Synthesis

There was a weak correlation between quetiapine dose and measured plasma concentration (from trough samples). Quetiapine dose was correlated with central dopamine D(2) occupancy, although the relationship between plasma level and D(2) occupancy is less clear.

Conclusions

The dose-response relationship for (immediate-release) quetiapine is established. Data on plasma concentration-response relationships are not sufficiently robust to allow determination of a therapeutic plasma level range for quetiapine. Therapeutic drug monitoring procedures are thus probably not routinely useful in optimizing quetiapine dose. Further examination of the relationship between peak quetiapine plasma concentration and clinical response is necessary.

### Quetiapine fumarate [^0491a4b0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking quetiapine.

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death compared with placebo. Quetiapine is not approved for elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)].

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

Patients should be advised to report to their physician any signs or symptoms that may be related to NMS. These may include muscle stiffness and high fever [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)].

Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus

Patients should be aware of the symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and diabetes mellitus. Patients who are diagnosed with diabetes, those with risk factors for diabetes, or those that develop these symptoms during treatment should have their blood glucose monitored at the beginning of and periodically during treatment [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

Hyperlipidemia

Patients should be advised that elevations in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides and decreases in HDL-cholesterol may occur. Patients should have their lipid profile monitored at the beginning of and periodically during treatment [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

### Association of low-dose quetiapine and diabetes [^69a90370]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the use of quetiapine in low doses associated with increased risk of diabetes?

Findings

In this nationwide cohort study that included 57 701 new users of quetiapine in low doses and without severe mental illness, the incidence of diabetes was approximately 9 cases per 1000 person-years, similar to that of a reference population treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for other psychiatric disorders.

Meaning

Quetiapine used in low doses was not associated with an increased risk of diabetes among individuals with nonsevere mental illness in comparison with use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

### Quetiapine (quetiapine fumarate) [^8bed4e3d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

 Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for quetiapine extended-release tablets should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

 Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, including quetiapine extended-release tablets, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.

5.3 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks), including fatalities, compared to placebo-treated subjects.

### Antipsychotic medication for women with schizophrenia spectrum disorders [^933c543d]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Sex differences in the pharmacokinetics of antipsychotics

Body composition differs significantly between the sexes: women have smaller organs, more fatty tissue and less muscle tissue, which changes the volume of distribution, especially for lipophilic drugs (Seeman). In addition, women have some 10–15% greater blood flow to the brain, which makes it easier for a drug to reach their target receptor (Fig. 1) (Gur & Gur). Castberg, Westin, Skogvoll, and Spigset included 43 079 blood samples of patients between 18 and 100 years old using olanzapine, risperidone or quetiapine and concluded that women generally have 20–30% higher dose-adjusted concentrations, which is a proxy for bioavailability, compared to men. Another study, including 26 388 patients of all ages, reported higher dose-adjusted concentrations in women for 11 out of 12 antipsychotics (Jönsson, Spigset, & Reis,), with the largest differences for olanzapine and clozapine (59.0% and 40.4% higher in women, respectively), whereas for quetiapine, dose-adjusted concentrations were 6.4% lower in women. Similarly, Eugene and Masiak reported dopamine receptor occupancy rates of 70% for male and female patients (mean age: 25.6 ± 7.9 for men; 28.9 ± 9.1 for women), whereas men were taking a higher dose (20 v. 10 mg/day). Since women are often treated with multiple psychotropic medications (Sommer et al.), drug interactions are especially relevant for this sex and become even more crucial when women are overmedicated. For example, clinically relevant effects on serum levels of several antipsychotics have been reported for the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine (Spina & De Leon). In addition, sex differences in the pharmacokinetics of antidepressants should be taken into account in women with SSD who are also being treated for depression, which are discussed in detail in a review by Damoiseaux, Proost, Jiawan, and Melgert.

### Open-label study of the effect of combination quetiapine / lithium therapy on lithium pharmacokinetics and tolerability [^49b9627b]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of oral quetiapine on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of lithium.

Methods

This was an open-label trial in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder who had demonstrated tolerability to combination lithium/ antipsychotic therapy. Patients received lithium for at least 1 week before screening and throughout the 18-day trial. Quetiapine was coadministered in fixed, stepwise, increasing doses of 25 to 250 mg TID on days 4 through 11, and maintained at 250 mg TID on days 12 through 14. Blood samples were drawn to monitor plasma concentrations of lithium and quetiapine. Psychiatric assessments included the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Clinical Global Impression severity of illness item, and the modified Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms. Neurologic function was assessed using the Simpson-Angus Scale and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. Other assessments included clinical laboratory testing, electrocardiography, physical examinations, and monitoring for spontaneously reported adverse events.

Results

Nine men and 1 woman (mean [SE] age, 32.8 [1.9] years; mean [SE] body weight, 87.6 [3.3] kg) entered and completed the 18-day trial. Eight patients had bipolar disorder, 1 had paranoid schizophrenia, and 1 had schizoaffective disorder. Morning trough concentrations of lithium in serum (days 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 17), as well as quetiapine and 2 of its metabolites in plasma (days 12, 13, and 14), did not appear to vary noticeably. Small increases were observed in the mean values of the area under the 12-hour serum lithium concentration-time curve and the maximum and minimum observed serum lithium concentrations when quetiapine was added to the lithium regimen. However, the increases were not considered clinically relevant by the investigators and were not statistically significant. A total of 91 adverse events were reported, 67 (73.6%) of which were not attributed to trial treatment. The most commonly reported adverse events during coadministration of lithium and quetiapine were somnolence (90.0% [9/10]), asthenia (70.0% [7/10]), dry mouth (30.0% [3/10]), nausea (30.0% [3/10]), vomiting (30.0% [3/10]), dizziness (30.0% [3/10]), tremor (30.0% [3/10]), and insomnia (20.0% [2/10]). There were no serious adverse events.

Conclusions

Measures of lithium and quetiapine concentrations did not vary significantly during combination therapy. Coadministered lithium and quetiapine were well tolerated in the patients studied.

### Self-reported sedation profile of quetiapine extended-release and quetiapine immediate-release during 6-day initial dose escalation in bipolar depression: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase IV study [^fcb37763]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A human-volunteer study reported lower sedation intensity during escalation of the extended-release formulation of quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) than the immediate-release (IR) formulation.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that the profile of initial tolerability, including sedation, differs between the extended-release (XR) and immediate-release (IR) formulations of quetiapine in patients with bipolar depression.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, Phase IV study, male and female inpatients aged 18 to 50 years with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision) diagnosis of bipolar I or II depression were randomized after washout to receive placebo on day 1 and quetiapine XR or IR at escalating doses of 50, 100, 200, 300, and 300 mg once daily on the evenings of days 2 to 6, with hospital discharge on day 7. Sedation intensity was assessed by a self-reported modified Bond-Lader visual analog scale (VAS) score.

Results

Of 139 randomized patients, 134 completed the study. Mean patient age was 39.0 years; mean weight, 91.3 kg; and mean body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), 31.0. Sedation intensity 1 hour after administration of the 50-mg dose (the primary study measure) was statistically significantly lower with quetiapine XR versus IR (mean [SD] VAS score: 33.4 [26.92] vs 44.0 [31.76]; least squares mean difference: 12.55, P = 0.009; modified intention-to-treat population). Sedation intensity was found in secondary analyses to be significantly lower with quetiapine XR than with quetiapine IR 1, 2, and 3 hours after each dose on days 2 to 6 (P ≤ 0.05), with similar sedation intensity between the treatment groups 4 to 14 hours postdose. Rates of treatment-related adverse events were 47.1% with quetiapine XR versus 59.4% with quetiapine IR. Three serious adverse events (4.3%) occurred in the quetiapine XR group. Adverse events led to study discontinuation in 1 patient (1.4%) in the quetiapine XR group and in 2 patients (2.9%) in the IR group.

Conclusions

During the initial dose-escalation period studied, patients with bipolar depression reported statistically significantly lower sedation intensity in the 1 to 3 hours after taking quetiapine XR compared with the IR formulation. Overall tolerability for both formulations was consistent with the known profile of quetiapine. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00926393.

### Can authorities appreciably enhance the prescribing of oral generic risperidone to conserve resources? Findings from across Europe and their implications [^e841183c]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Health authorities across Europe are increasingly struggling to fund growing drug volumes and their associated costs within available resources, as a result of ageing populations and new premium-priced drugs. This is already resulting in some countries no longer funding new premium-priced drugs, which is not in the best interest of any stakeholder group. Improved knowledge of pharmacogenomics, leading to improved management of patients with improved targeting of treatments, is one way forward. However, there is a still an appreciable number of challenges to address before such approaches become routine.

In the meantime, there are considerable opportunities for authorities across Europe to realise appreciable savings from the increased use of low-cost generics. The availability of generic risperidone provides a further opportunity for authorities to achieve considerable savings. This is because worldwide sales of atypical antipsychotic drugs were over $US 5 billion per year in the early 2000s, reaching $14.6bn in the US alone in 2009. In addition, medicine costs can be an appreciable component of the overall cost of treating patients with schizophrenia, as pharmacological treatments represent the backbone of managing these patients.

We acknowledge that there is continuing debate about the relative merits of atypical versus typical antipsychotics in the management of patients with schizophrenia. Recent studies have suggested that pharmacological treatments should be tailored, in view of the considerable variation in their effectiveness between individual patients. In addition, there are also considerable differences in side-effects between the different atypical antipsychotic drugs, including weight gain, hyperlipidaemia and type 2 diabetes. The risk of QT prolongation and subsequent arrhythmia-related events, i.e. torsade de pointes (TdP) and sudden cardiac death, has also become increasingly important. Previously, atypical antipsychotic drugs were generally perceived as having a more favourable safety profile in terms of cardiac and extrapyramidal side-effects. However, this is changing, with post-marketing studies and meta-analyses challenging the definition of typical (first generation) or atypical (second generation) antipsychotic drugs. Recent studies have also shown that the risk of mortality in patients with schizophrenia is highest with quetiapine and lowest with clozapine. However, there have been concerns regarding patient selection in this cohort study. Haloperidol and risperidone had slightly lower adjusted hazard ratios than quetiapine.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Human Experience

In clinical trials, survival has been reported in acute overdoses of up to 30 grams of quetiapine. Most patients who overdosed experienced no adverse reactions or recovered fully from the reported reactions. Death has been reported in a clinical trial following an overdose of 13.6 grams of quetiapine alone. In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness, sedation, tachycardia, hypotension, and anticholinergic toxicity including coma and delirium. Patients with pre-existing severe cardiovascular disease may be at an increased risk of the effects of overdose [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.12)]. One case, involving an estimated overdose of 9600 mg, was associated with hypokalemia and first-degree heart block. In post-marketing experience, there were cases reported of QT prolongation with overdose.

10.2 Management of Overdosage

Establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.

Appropriate supportive measures are the mainstay of management. For the most up-to-date information on the management of quetiapine overdosage, contact a certified Regional Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222).

### Effects of food on bioavailability of analgesics; resulting dosage and administration recommendations [^a2994ee1]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate currently approved analgesics, that is, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anticonvulsants, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) used as analgesics, for 1) differences in pharmacokinetic parameters under fed vs fasting conditions and 2) factors involved in dosage recommendations in relation to food.

Design

Systematic review.

Results

Food effect on the rate, extent of absorption, or shape of concentration-time profile can alter the onset of action, duration of action, or tolerability of a medication. Based on 79 analgesic products reviewed, food effect dosage recommendations depend on whether an analgesic will be dosed on a regular interval around-the-clock vs on an as-needed basis, the shape of concentration-time profile, steady-state concentrations, the type of meals used in the pharmacokinetic study, and drug administration with regard to food in clinical trials. Overall, most opioids do not have food restriction and are taken without regard to food, with the exception of OPANA products and XTAMPZA ER. For many NSAIDs, food does not affect absorption characteristics, with the exception of ZORVOLEX and CELEBREX. Although NSAIDs are commonly to be taken without regard to food, prescribers recommend administering them with food to reduce their propensity for gastrointestinal adverse events. A larger percentage of anticonvulsants and SNRIs used as analgesics are taken with food to improve their tolerability. Of all analgesic products, seven NSAIDs and six opioids lack food effect information, maybe due to their approval before Food and Drug Administration food effect guidance.

Conclusions

Overall, because food effects could alter the onset and/or duration of pain relief, analgesic medication should be used as per labeled recommendations for proper pain management.

### Effects of food intake on the relative bioavailability of amifampridine phosphate salt in healthy adults [^dc1d01bd]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Amifampridine (3,4-diaminopyridine) has been approved in the European Union for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Amifampridine has a narrow therapeutic index, and supratherapeutic exposure has been associated with dose-dependent adverse events, including an increased risk for seizure. This study assessed the effect of food on the relative bioavailability of amifampridine in healthy subjects and informed on conditions that can alter exposure.

Methods

This randomized, open-labeled, 2-treatment, 2-period crossover study enrolled 47 healthy male and female subjects. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 2 single oral doses of amifampridine phosphate salt (20 mg base equivalents per dose) under fed or fasted conditions separated by a washout period. Blood and urine samples for pharmacokinetic analyses were taken before and after dosing. Plasma concentrations of amifampridine and an inactive 3-N-acetyl metabolite were determined. The relative bioavailability values of amifampridine and metabolite were assessed based on the plasma PK parameters AUC0-∞, AUC0-t, and Cmax in the fed and fasted states using noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. Parent drug and metabolite excretion were calculated from urinary concentrations. A food effect on bioavailability would be established if the 90% CI of the ratio of population geometric mean value of AUC0-∞, AUC0-t, or Cmax between fed and fasted administration was not within the bioequivalence range of 80% to 125%. Tolerability was assessed based on adverse-event reporting, clinical laboratory assessments, physical examination including vital sign measurements, 12-lead ECG, and concurrent medication use.

Findings

Food slowed and somewhat decreased the absorption of amifampridine. There was a decrease in exposure (Cmax, 44%; AUC, 20%) after oral administration of amifampridine phosphate salt in the presence of food, and mean Tmax was 2-fold longer in the fed state. The extent of exposure and plasma elimination half-life of the major metabolite was greater than those of amifampridine in the fed and fasted conditions. Mean AUCs in the fed and fasted states were slightly greater in women than men, with no difference in mean Cmax. Orally administered amifampridine was renally eliminated (> 93%) as the parent compound and metabolite within 24 hours. Single oral doses of 20 mg of amifampridine phosphate salt were considered well tolerated in both the fed and fasted conditions. High intersubject variability (%CVs, > 30%) in amifampridine pharmacokinetic parameter values was observed.

Implications

At the intended dose under fasting conditions, amifampridine exposure may be increased. European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials identifier: 2011-000596-13.

5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analysis of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Quetiapine extended-release tablets are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning].

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Human Experience

In clinical trials, survival has been reported in acute overdoses of up to 30 grams of quetiapine. Most patients who overdosed experienced no adverse reactions or recovered fully from the reported reactions. Death has been reported in a clinical trial following an overdose of 13.6 grams of quetiapine alone. In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness, sedation, tachycardia, hypotension and anticholinergic toxicity including coma and delirium. Patients with pre-existing severe cardiovascular disease may be at an increased risk of the effects of overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]. One case, involving an estimated overdose of 9600 mg, was associated with hypokalemia and first-degree heart block. In post-marketing experience, there were cases reported of QT prolongation with overdose.

10.2 Management of Overdosage

Establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking SEROQUEL XR.

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementia-related psychoses treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death compared with placebo. SEROQUEL XR is not approved for elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Pharmacobezoar associated prolonged clinical course in a patient with immediate release quetiapine overdose [^c9653e01]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Quetiapine is available in both immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (XR) formulations. Quetiapine XR overdose is known to cause delayed increase in serum quetiapine concentrations. However, it is not certain whether quetiapine IR overdose would similarly cause a delayed increase in serum quetiapine concentrations.

Case Report

A 57-year-old woman with depression who was taking half a tablet of 25 mg quetiapine IR daily was transported to our emergency department with a complaint of disturbance of consciousness 12 h after a quetiapine IR overdose. On arrival, her initial vital signs were heart rate of 116 beats per minute, blood pressure of 77/43 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 91% under 10 L oxygen administration. Whole body plain computed tomography showed a large amount of gastric hyperdense content suggesting pharmacobezoar with a volume of 71.2 ml. After treatment with respiratory and circulatory support, gastric lavage was performed. Her disturbance of consciousness persisted until day 5, and she was extubated on day 7. The serum concentrations of quetiapine were 2690 ng/mL at 12 h after overdose, 5940 ng/mL at 40 h, and 350 ng/mL at 124 h after overdose. Serum concentrations of other co-ingestions were all below lethal levels.

Conclusion

A massive quetiapine IR overdose with pharmacobezoars can cause a delayed increase in serum quetiapine concentrations.

### Association of low-dose quetiapine and diabetes [^422dce77]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Prediabetes at baseline was associated with the highest IRs observed for both users of low-dose quetiapine (33.8–34.5 cases/1000 PY) and SSRIs (32.8–33.2 cases/1000 PY). This finding must be interpreted cautiously as the number of individuals with HbA 1C measurements at baseline was low in both groups. Furthermore, there was no clear difference between users of low-dose quetiapine and SSRIs and the high IR more likely reflects a natural progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes, regardless of exposure to medications.

We found no association of increased type 2 diabetes risk with increasing cumulative dose, when exposure was confined to use of small tablets alone. However, there was a clear association between use of higher cumulative doses and risk of diabetes, when considering higher tablet strengths as proxy for higher daily doses (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.13–1.84). Therefore, the daily dose is likely to be a more important risk factor than cumulative dose alone.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^27f04a99]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — antipsychotic prescribing and dosing are outlined as follows: Accepted clinical practice is to use standing doses and oral administration is generally preferred, with intramuscular injection reserved for emergencies or when oral intake is not possible. Low starting doses are recommended (0.25–0.5 mg/day haloperidol; 0.25–1.0 mg/day risperidone; 12.5 mg/day clozapine; 1.25–5.0 mg/day olanzapine; 12.5–50 mg/day quetiapine); starting dosages for aripiprazole and ziprasidone are not known, though 5 mg/day of aripiprazole may be safe for most patients, and doses can be increased based on target-symptom response. Usual maximum dosages are 2 mg/day haloperidol, 1.5–2 mg/day risperidone, 75–100 mg/day clozapine, 200–300 mg/day quetiapine, 10 mg/day olanzapine, and 15 mg/day aripiprazole; risperidone causes fewer extrapyramidal symptoms at 1 mg/day than at higher doses. Clinicians should keep in mind that these medications take time to work and rapid dose escalation may produce side effects; although most patients do best below these maxima, some younger or very severely agitated patients may need higher doses, and antipsychotic agents must be used with extreme caution in dementia with Lewy bodies or Parkinson's disease.

### Quetiapine for schizophrenia [^2eaea437]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic with, theoretically, a low propensity for movement disorder adverse effects. It is used for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychoses.

Objectives

To determine the effects of quetiapine for schizophrenia in comparison to placebo, and other antipsychotics.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials (February 2003), Biological Abstracts (1982–2000), CINAHL (1982–2000), the Cochrane Library (2000, Issue 1), EMBASE (1980–2000), MEDLINE (1966–2000), PsycLIT (1974–2000), SIGLE on CD (1980–1997), SocioFile (1974–1997) and many conference proceedings and hand searches of specific journals were undertaken. We contacted AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals for information regarding unpublished trials. The review was updated in February 2003.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials where adults with schizophrenia or similar illnesses were assigned to quetiapine, placebo or other neuroleptic drugs and where clinically relevant outcomes were reported.

Data Collection and Analysis

Citations and, where possible, abstracts were inspected independently by reviewers, papers ordered, re-inspected and quality assessed. We independently extracted data. We analysed data using fixed effects relative risk (RR) and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI). Only homogeneous data were interpreted as favouring treatment or control. Where possible we calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) or number needed to harm statistics (NNH). We calculated relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data, and weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous data.

Main Results

Despite the fact that 3443 people were randomised in 12 quetiapine studies, there are almost no data on service utilisation, economic outcomes, social functioning and quality of life. Over half of those within the quetiapine versus placebo comparison were lost to follow up (53% quetiapine vs 61% placebo, n = 716, 4RCTs, RR 0.84 CI 0.7 to 0.9, NNT 11 CI 7 to 55) so it is impossible to interpret any ratings of global or mental state within this comparison with confidence. People allocated quetiapine, however, did not have more movement disorders than those given placebo (n = 395, 2 RCTs, RR needing medication for EPSE 0.62 CI 0.3 to 1.2). The same applies to the comparison of ≥ 250 mg/day quetiapine with < 250 mg/day quetiapine (49% dropout ≥ 250 mg/day vs 58% < 250 mg/day, n = 1066, 3 RCTs, RR 0.84 CI 0.8 to 0.9, NNT 11 CI 7 to 29). It should be noted that two deaths occurred in the higher dose group (n = 618, 1 RCT, RR 0.1 CI 0.0 to 2.1). When quetiapine was compared with typical antipsychotics, about 36% of both groups failed to complete the short-term studies (n = 1624, 6 RCTs, RR 0.87 CI 0.8 to 1.0). Average change in global state was heterogeneous and equivocal (n = 762, 3 RCTs, WMD in short term 0.19 CI 0.00 to 0.38, I squared 76%). Mental state measures were also equivocal (n = 1247, RR not improved 0.97 CI 0.9 to 1.1) including specific measures of negative symptoms (n = 305, 1 RCT, MD change in SANS short term 0.94 CI -0.2 to 2.0). Movement disorders were less prevalent for those allocated quetiapine (n = 1117, 4 RCTs, RR needing medication for extrapyramidal adverse effects 0.47 CI 0.4 to 0.6, NNT 4 CI 4 to 5, I squared 88%). Dry mouth (n = 649, 2 RCTs, RR short term 2.85 CI 1.5 to 5.6, NNH 17 CI 7 to 65) and sleepiness (n = 959, 3 RCTs, RR 1.51 CI 1.1 to 2.2, NNH 18 CI 8 to 181) may also be more prevalent for people given quetiapine compared with the older drugs. In the quetiapine versus risperidone comparison, over 30% of people left the study before completion (n = 728, 1 RCT, RR 0.94 CI 0.7 to 1.2). Four people, all treated with quetiapine, died during the study (n = 728, 1 RCT, RR 2.86 CI 0.2 to 52.8). Continuous mental state measures did not show clear differences between the two drugs (n = 637, 1 RCT, MD PANSS 1.2 CI -2.0 to 4.4). However, considerably fewer people given quetiapine needed medication for extrapyramidal side effects compared with those allocated to risperidone (n = 712, 1 RCT, RR 0.27 CI 0.2 to 0.5, NNT 11 CI 10 to 16). Quetiapine caused more dizziness (n = 728, 1 RCT, RR 1.85 CI 1.0 to 3.3, NNH 18 CI 7 to 487), more dry mouth (n = 728, 1 RCT, RR 2.11 CI 1.2 to 3.8, NNH 14 CI 6 to 82) and more sleepiness than risperidone (n = 728, 1 RCT, RR 2.03 CI 1.4 to 2.9, NNH 7 CI 4 to 17).

Reviewers' Conclusions

Quetiapine is effective for the treatment of schizophrenia, but it is not much different from first-generation antipsychotics and risperidone with respect to treatment withdrawal and efficacy. In comparison to first-generation antipsychotics and risperidone, quetiapine has a lower risk of movement disorders but higher risks of dizziness, dry mouth and sleepiness. More clearly reported pragmatic randomised controlled trials should be carried out to determine its position in everyday clinical practice. Studies of medium and long-term effects, including cost-effectiveness, quality of life, social functioning and service utilisation, in comparison with the effects of typical and atypical antipsychotics should be priority areas.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^1b3d1f7e]. DoD/VA (2023). High credibility.

Bipolar disorder — maintenance and acute mania pharmacotherapy considerations emphasize that "Priority should be given to treatments effective for maintenance treatment to prevent the return of mood episodes; maintenance treatment is the cornerstone of treatment for BD". Evidence suggests that aripiprazole has potentially less efficacy compared with other agents. Valproate shows a small effect size (0.26) with liver toxicity and coagulopathy risks, its use "should be considered carefully", and "Valproate should be prescribed only as a last resort to individuals of childbearing potential" due to teratogenic and developmental harms. Carbamazepine poses severe risks to women of childbearing potential, has a Black Box warning recommending genomic testing (for HLA-B✱1502) in certain populations — specifically for those of Chinese descent — because of risk of a deadly rash (Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis [SJS/TEN]) and also has many drug–drug interactions. Patient preferences vary given side effect profiles: haloperidol has a higher risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects, and cariprazine had a 29% incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and a 21% incidence of akathisia in trials in BD. Asenapine requires sublingual administration for several minutes (twice daily) with unclear feasibility in more severely ill manic patients, and there is a lack of evidence for effectiveness of the asenapine transdermal patch. Ziprasidone must be taken twice daily with 500 kilocalories of food for proper absorption, and the intramuscular formulation takes increased time to administer secondary to preparation. The Work Group categorized the evidence as Reviewed, New-added with low confidence and noted limitations; benefits of these drugs in acute mania slightly outweighed harms, and because these treatments have no evidence preventing recurrence of mania or depression, "these drugs are not recommended as preferred treatments for acute mania".

Quetiapine for psychosis and agitation in dementia — placebo-controlled trials — showed variable outcomes: In a 10-week multicenter trial versus haloperidol among elderly nursing home patients, a subgroup of 284 with Alzheimer's disease had a mean daily haloperidol dosage of 2 mg/day and about 120 mg/day for quetiapine, with neither treatment differing on the primary psychosis outcome while one secondary agitation measure improved with both active drugs but not placebo; a subsequent placebo-controlled study in 333 nursing home residents tested 100 mg/day (achieved by day 4) or 200 mg/day (achieved by day 8) and found 200 mg/day superior to placebo on numerous outcomes with less benefit at 100 mg/day; however, a separate placebo-controlled trial in 93 subjects with Alzheimer's disease and agitation failed to show any benefit over placebo.

### Pharmacological management of obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^9fa9ddc1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — antipsychotic selection and weight effects recommends using weight-neutral antipsychotic alternatives when clinically indicated and employing shared decision-making with quantitative estimates of expected weight effects (1|⊕⊕⊕○). Evidence shows variable but often substantial changes: many of the new atypical antipsychotic agents have weight gain as a side effect, and with clozapine, weight gain continued for as long as 46 months with a 37% increase in the incidence of T2DM over the 5-year period of observation; in a randomized trial across five agents, a weight gain of > 7% from baseline occurred in 30% taking olanzapine, 16% quetiapine, 14% risperidone, 12% perphenazine, and 7% ziprasidone; in a 6-week, double-blind trial, patients were assigned to ziprasidone (n = 136) or olanzapine (n = 133) and body weight increased 3.6 kg with olanzapine compared with 1.0 kg with ziprasidone; a review of nine randomized controlled trials found ziprasidone produced less weight gain than olanzapine (five RCTs; n = 1659; mean difference, −3.82; 95% CI, −4.69 to −2.96), quetiapine (two RCTs; n = 754; relative risk, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.74), and risperidone (three RCTs; n = 1063; relative risk, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.74); in youth with psychotic and bipolar disorders across 34 trials, weight gain ranged from 3.8 to 16.2 kg with olanzapine, 0.9 to 9.5 kg with clozapine, 1.9 to 7.2 kg with risperidone, 2.3 to 6.1 kg with quetiapine, and 0 to 4.4 kg with ziprasidone.

Drug Formulation

The formulation of an antiretroviral drug could be another factor determining the onset and magnitude of interaction with food. For didanosine, in studies of enteric-coated capsules instead of tablets, less distinct postprandial changes in pharmacokinetic parameters occurred. Moreover, for enteric-coated capsules taken with or without food, similar antiretroviral activity was reported after 28 days. The enteric-coated formulation may be preferable over tablets, as it protects didanosine from hydrolysis in the presence of gastric acid and improves its AUC as well.

Lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil, and doravirine tablets (single or combined with other antiretroviral agents) were absorbed more slowly after the meal, whereas no significant postprandial changes in t max were observed for coated and uncoated granules. Moreover, our findings suggest that ingesting lamivudine granules in the fasting state may slightly improve its bioavailability, while the impact of food on the AUC of lamivudine tablets remains neutral.

For tenofovir alafenamide and rilpivirine, the food effect was lower when both drugs were given with other antiretroviral agents as a combined tablet.

In the case of darunavir, a positive food influence on bioavailability was observed only for tablets. No significant deviations were reported when the oral suspension was administered with a standard meal, except for the delay of t max. For lopinavir tablets, contrastingly, the food effect was diminished, possibly due to the presence of hydrophilic excipients in a formulation.

For ritonavir, the bioavailability of an oral solution and capsules remained unchanged in the presence of meals rich in fat, whereas tablets and oral powder had slightly lower values of AUC and C max when taken with a high-fat meal.

Patient's Age

Age-related differences in pharmacokinetics between children and adults may influence the food effect. For example, unlike in adults, in HIV-positive children, co-intake of didanosine with a standard meal did not produce significant changes in AUC but delayed the absorption.

Black Box warnings are the strongest warning the FDA issues, and they are 'designed to call attention to serious or life‐threatening risks' 3. These warnings must be issued with all prescriptions of the drug in question. The FDA's only escalation after a Black Box warning is to force a drug to be recalled or withdrawn from the market. Black Box warnings indicate either when there is a serious adverse reaction with 'some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event' or to 'highlight important information for prescribers' 3.

### Use of quetiapine in elderly patients [^c620295f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Behavioral problems associated with psychosis in the elderly have a significant negative impact on patients' quality of life and can lead to placement in a nursing home. Because of their decreased propensity to produce extrapyramidal symptoms, atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine hold promise in the treatment of these vulnerable patients. Quetiapine may, in theory, be particularly advantageous in this regard because of its lack of anticholinergic activity and its relatively loose binding to dopamine receptors. This article reviews the somewhat limited number of clinical studies of the use of quetiapine in treating older patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies, and patients with Parkinson's disease and drug-induced psychosis.

5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analysis of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Quetiapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning].

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^e4df7652]. DoD/VA (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD bipolar disorder — Acute mania monotherapy when lithium or quetiapine are not selected: If lithium or quetiapine is not selected based on patient preferences and characteristics, we suggest olanzapine, paliperidone, or risperidone as monotherapy for acute mania. This is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low; the benefits of these drugs outweighed the potential harms (e.g., weight gain, sedation, metabolic side effects), and patient values and preferences varied because of the potential for adverse effects. Olanzapine is included in this recommendation rather than in Recommendation 5 because of concerns about the burden of side effects and the risk for adverse reactions, and the metabolic effects of olanzapine are ultimately the reason why the Work Group decided to suggest this drug alongside (and not higher than) risperidone and paliperidone.

Second-generation antipsychotics in dementia — cerebrovascular and metabolic adverse effects are described: There is evidence of an increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse events with at least aripiprazole, olanzapine, and risperidone when used in patients with dementia, and pooled risperidone trials showed "cerebrovascular events" of 4% versus about 2% with placebo. Company warnings reported olanzapine 1.3% versus placebo 0.4% for cerebrovascular adverse events with increased mortality 3.5% vs. 1.5%, and aripiprazole 1.3% vs. 0.6% when given placebo; available data suggest greater risk among those with pre-existing cerebrovascular risks. No warning has been issued regarding quetiapine; reported event rates were 0.8% for quetiapine and 1.9% for placebo. Metabolic adverse effects with second-generation antipsychotics include hyperlipidemia, weight gain, and diabetes mellitus.

### Effectiveness of the extended release formulation of quetiapine as monotherapy for the treatment of acute bipolar depression [^ecbb04ae]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background: To evaluate the effectiveness of quetiapine extended release once daily in bipolar depression. Methods: Double-blind, placebo-controlled study in acutely depressed adults with bipolar I or II disorder, with or without rapid cycling. Patients were randomized to 8 weeks of quetiapine extended release(XR) 300 mg daily monotherapy or placebo. The primary out come measure was changed from baseline to Week 8 in MADRS total score. Results: Quetiapine XR 300 mg once daily(N = 133)showed significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms compared with placebo (N = 137) from Week 1(p < 0.001)through to Week 8 (p < 0.001). Mean change in MADRS total score at Week 8 was 17.4 in the quetiapine XR group and -11.9 in the placebo group(p < 0.001). Response (≥ 50% reduction in MADRS total score)and remission (MADRS total score ≤ 12)rates at Week 8 were significantly higher with quetiapine XR compared with placebo (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). Quetiapine XR improved core symptoms of depression. The most common adverse events associated with quetiapine XR were dry mouth, somnolence, and sedation. Greater weight gain was observed inpatients on quetiapine XR relative to placebo. Limitations: Fewer patients with bipolar II disorder included, only one fixed dose tested and the lack of an active comparator. Conclusions: Quetiapine XR(300 mg)once daily monotherapy was significantly more effective than placebo for treating episodes of depression in bipolar I disorder, throughout the 8-week study, with significance observed as early as Day 7. Adverse events were consistent with the known effects of quetiapine.

### Oral semaglutide: dosage in special situations [^549a3856]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Ramadan Fasting

Ramadan fasting is characterized by month-long fasting from dawn to dusk, during which faithful believers abstain from food and water. Oral semaglutide can be taken 30–60 min before the suhur (early morning) meal, but this may be inconvenient for many. Another option is to take the drug before the iftar (evening) meal, but this will extend the fasting period by a half hour to one hour, and will not be welcome.

Another option is to take oral semaglutide half an hour before midnight snacks, which can be taken before or after Tarawih prayers. Consuming semaglutide tablet with up to half a glass of water, offering the prayer, and then taking a small snack may be an effortless way of taking the drug without intruding into one's lifestyle. It is advisable to always keep a minimum of 6 h of fasting before taking oral semaglutide to achieve the desired bioavailability.

The following key dosing instructions should also be followed during Ramadan fasting.
The drug should be taken with minimal water not exceeding 120 mL or 4 oz.
The patient should wait 30 min after taking the drug before consuming any food/drink/medication.
It is also suggested that, although a patient should wait 30 min before consuming food, the patient ideally eat a snack/food within 30–60 min after taking this drug.
It is recommended that tablet semaglutide remain in the blister pack till consumption and not be placed in a pill box.
Co-administration of oral semaglutide may have a small impact on certain drugs like metformin, furosemide, rosuvastatin, and thyroxine, and their effect should be monitored from time to time.

### Population pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir in African children: results from the CHAPAS-4 trial [^a9908048]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

We observed no difference in bioavailability between the FCT and the DT. Chandasana et al reported higher bioavailability of DT compared with FCT in a cohort of young children who mostly took dolutegravir without food. This aligns with the 76% increased DT bioavailability compared with FCT in children without food in the ODYSSEY trial. In our analysis, this formulation effect was not observed. We hypothesize that food intake may be 1 potential explanation for this observation, since children in our study all took dolutegravir with breakfast. While food might facilitate the dissolution of the FCT, enhancing absorption, DT might fully dissolve even without food, possibly negating any difference seen between the formulation taken on an empty stomach. Our values of CL/F for dolutegravir in combination with SOC (0.722 L/h) were similar to those of Chandasana's 1-compartment model (0.700 L/h at 30 kg), despite our model structure identifying 2-compartment disposition. The difference in model structure may be due to differences in the sampling schedule between the studies and or our handling of the additional uncertainty in the pre-dose samples. These samples, after an unobserved dose, may suffer from additional uncertainty and variability arising from imprecisely reported dosing times and varying dosing conditions at home (eg, food intake). By including extra variability for the pre-dose sample in our model, we were able to better characterize the kinetics based on the more "reliable" samples collected after the observed dose. Furthermore, 2-compartment kinetics has been reported in adult dolutegravir models.

### Atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride [^6828be66]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets, fixed-dose combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride is an antimalarial agent [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Cardiac Effects

The effect of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride on the QT interval is unknown in humans.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Atovaquone is a highly lipophilic compound with low aqueous solubility. The bioavailability of atovaquone shows considerable inter-individual variability.

Effect of Food: Atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride should be taken with food or a milky drink. Dietary fat taken with atovaquone increases the rate and extent of absorption, increasing AUC 2 to 3 times and Cmax5 times over fasting. The absolute bioavailability of the tablet formulation of atovaquone when taken with food is 23%.

Distribution

Atovaquone is highly protein bound (> 99%) over the concentration range of 1 to 90 mcg/mL. A population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that the apparent volume of distribution of atovaquone (V/F) in adult and pediatric patients after oral administration is approximately 8.8 L/kg.

Proguanil is 75% protein bound. A population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that the apparent V/F of proguanil in adult and pediatric patients older than 15 years with body weights from 31 to 110 kg ranged from 1,617 to 2,502 L. In pediatric patients 15 years and younger with body weights from 11 to 56 kg, the V/F of proguanil ranged from 462 to 966 L.

### The effect of food composition on serum testosterone levels after oral administration of andriol testocaps [^7876997b]. Clinical Endocrinology (2007). Low credibility.

Many studies have shown that food can have a marked effect on drug pharmacokinetics by increasing, decreasing and/or delaying drug absorption. A study with oral TU in men has suggested that, if taken with a meal, the TU molecules are included in chylomicrons. As a result, a significant part of the administered TU bypasses the liver and gains access to the peripheral circulation through the intestinal lymphatic system, thereby further increasing serum testosterone levels. Recently, the effect of food on the bioavailability of oral TU was investigated in more detail. In a single-dose, randomized crossover study, the effect of a standardized meal on the pharmacokinetics of oral TU was compared with administration in a fasting state. It was found that in the fasting state hardly any TU was absorbed and oral administration of TU with food dramatically enhanced the bioavailability of TU. It was concluded that for optimal absorption, oral TU capsules must be taken with food. However, as this study contained only one standardized type of meal, the optimal amount of food and which meal composition would be optimal for adequate absorption of TU after oral administration could not be determined. In the absence of clear guidelines, the advice has often been to take oral TU capsules with a 'fatty meal' to ensure optimal absorption of the active ingredient. From the patient's perspective, this issue is relevant because twice daily administration of the capsules with a 'fatty meal' is undesirable.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of food composition on the bioavailability of oral TU.

### Reproductive safety of lurasidone and quetiapine: update from the national pregnancy registry for psychiatric medications [^100fb23b]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Background: Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), also called atypical antipsychotics, are common therapies for women with a spectrum of psychiatric disorders. No systematically ascertained human reproductive safety data are available for lurasidone, and prospective data for quetiapine are limited, making decisions regarding use of these medications during pregnancy complicated. Materials and Methods: The National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications is a prospective cohort study designed to collect reproductive safety data relative to SGAs. Pregnant women aged 18–45 years, with psychiatric illness and prenatal psychotropic medication exposure completed three phone interviews during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Cases of presumed malformations are abstracted from medical records for adjudication by a teratologist blinded to medication exposure. Results: Of 2,293 women enrolled at the time of analysis, 134 in the lurasidone group, 264 in the quetiapine group, and 886 controls completed the postpartum interview and were therefore eligible for inclusion. Dropped or lost-to-follow-up participants (13%) and those currently pregnant were excluded. Participants were predominantly White, college-educated, and married (lurasidone = 88.1%, 76.9%, 77.6%; quetiapine = 89.8%, 71.2%, 75.0%; controls = 92.7%, 86.7%, 89.1%). Absolute risks of major malformations were 2.19% (lurasidone), 1.85% (quetiapine), and 1.77% (controls). Odds ratios comparing lurasidone and quetiapine with controls were 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.36–4.32) and 1.04 (95% CI = 0.38–2.85), respectively. Conclusions: No specific patterns of malformations were observed in infants exposed to the medications of interest. Lurasidone and quetiapine did not appear to be major teratogens, but further information is needed to refine risk estimates. Food and Drug Administration guidance underscores the importance of pregnancy registries. Clinical trial number: NCT01246765.

### Effectiveness of the extended release formulation of quetiapine as monotherapy for the treatment of acute bipolar depression [^c85112eb]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Background

To evaluate the effectiveness of quetiapine extended release once daily in bipolar depression.

Methods

Double-blind, placebo-controlled study in acutely depressed adults with bipolar I or II disorder, with or without rapid cycling. Patients were randomized to 8 weeks of quetiapine extended release (XR) 300 mg daily monotherapy or placebo. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to Week 8 in MADRS total score.

Results

Quetiapine XR 300 mg once daily (N = 133) showed significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms compared with placebo (N = 137) from Week 1 (p < 0.001) through to Week 8 (p < 0.001). Mean change in MADRS total score at Week 8 was -17.4 in the quetiapine XR group and -11.9 in the placebo group (p < 0.001). Response (≥ 50 reduction in MADRS total score) and remission (MADRS total score ≤ 12) rates at Week 8 were significantly higher with quetiapine XR (p < 0.001) compared with placebo (p < 0.05). Quetiapine XR improved core symptoms of depression. The most common adverse events associated with quetiapine XR were dry mouth, somnolence, and sedation. Greater weight gain was observed in patients on quetiapine XR relative to placebo.

Limitations

Fewer patients with bipolar II disorder included, only one fixed dose tested and the lack of an active comparator.

Conclusions

Quetiapine XR (300 mg) once daily monotherapy was significantly more effective than placebo for treating episodes of depression in bipolar I disorder, throughout the 8-week study, with significance observed as early as Day 7. Adverse events were consistent with the known effects of quetiapine.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^c1800875]. DoD/VA (2023). High credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BD) maintenance — evidence and adverse effects for lithium, quetiapine, and olanzapine: Evidence suggests that treatment with lithium, quetiapine, or olanzapine can help prevent the recurrence of depressive episodes in individuals with BD. Evidence regarding which of the three medications is the most efficacious is mixed, though there is some evidence that quetiapine and olanzapine performed better than other SGAs in the prevention of depression. Of note, the studies referenced above included individuals with BD 1 and BD 2 and did not distinguish between the groups when presenting the results. These medications have side effect profiles that include sedation, risk of prolonged QTc intervals, and metabolic syndrome; however, olanzapine carries a much higher metabolic risk than quetiapine or lithium, and the metabolic effects of olanzapine are a strong counterbalance to its efficacy as monotherapy and are ultimately the reason why the Work Group decided to suggest this drug as a less favorable alternative than lithium and quetiapine.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^217d729b]. DoD/VA (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD bipolar disorder maintenance — olanzapine is provided "some support" for preventing recurrence of mania but this is "weaker than that for lithium and quetiapine", and it "seemed as or more effective in preventing mania (RR for mania: 0.35) when compared with lithium (RR: 0.54) and quetiapine (RR: 0.56)". For bipolar depression, "the effect size for olanzapine is smaller than for quetiapine", and it "is not FDA-approved as a monotherapy for this indication". The Work Group found "more severe weight gain and related metabolic side effects than quetiapine or lithium", with studies showing "significantly greater weight gain with olanzapine than with lithium" and "substantially more weight gain and metabolic side effects" versus lithium or quetiapine; therefore, its metabolic effects were "the reason why the Work Group decided to suggest this drug alongside (and not higher than) the other medications in this recommendation".

The recommendation is "based on evidence from randomized controlled trials and on expert opinion", including a "42-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial" in which "421 outpatients with Alzheimer's disease and psychosis, aggression, or agitation were randomly prescribed one of three atypical antipsychotic medications (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone) or placebo".

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^3939b7f9]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — selection among second-generation antipsychotics is typically based on side effects rather than efficacy differences: There are few relative efficacy data; the CATIE-AD trial did not find significant differences in efficacy or tolerability among olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone, although time to discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was longer for olanzapine and risperidone than for quetiapine. The choice is most often guided by side effect profiles, with second-generation agents usually selected first, and practice is to match an agent's common side effects to patient vulnerabilities (e.g., avoid clozapine for anticholinergic sensitivity or choose agents with fewer motor side effects — aripiprazole, clozapine, or quetiapine — for Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies).

### The safety of quetiapine: results of a post-marketing surveillance study on 1728 patients in england [^cd775966]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

The safety of the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine as used in general practice in England was examined by prescription-event monitoring (PEM). Patients were identified from dispensed National Health Service (NHS) prescriptions issued by general practitioners (GPs) for quetiapine between October 1997 and July 1999. The outcome data were event reports obtained by sending questionnaires ('green forms') to the prescribing doctor at Least 6 months after the first prescription for an individual patient. Green forms with clinically useful information on 1728 patients (median age 39 years (IQR 30–56); 53% female) were received. The most frequently reported event during the first month of treatment was 'drowsiness/sedation' (47; 3% cohort). This was also the most frequently reported specified adverse drug reaction (ADR) to quetiapine (7; 11% of 65 reported ADRs) and the highest reported clinical reason for stopping quetiapine (51; 6% of the 734 reported reasons for stopping). There was a low incidence of extrapyramidal disease (21 during treatment, 1% of cohort) and hyperprolactinaemia (three during treatment, 0.2%) in this study. Three cases of diabetes mellitus in this cohort were reported to be a new diagnosis. Six pregnancies were reported during treatment with quetiapine, five of which were exposed during the first trimester only. There were four Live births with no reported congenital abnormaLities. Fifty-six deaths were reported during this study (3% cohort). The most frequently reported causes of death reLated to the cardiovascular (18) and respiratory (15) systems. The results of this post-marketing surveillance study demonstrated that quetiapine is generally well-tolerated when used in general practice.

quetiapine in pediatric patients. The main focus of this review is pediatric deaths and pediatric reports of serious unlabeled adverse events with quetiapine fumarate. The consult request highlighted the following serious adverse events; high blood pressure, QT prolongation, metabolic effects, neuromuscular and neuropsychiatric. events, neutropenia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis. Quetiapine fumarate is an atypical antipsychotic indicated to treat schizophrenia and bipolar mania in pediatric patients. The Adverse Event Reporting System database was searched for all reports of. pancreatitis and diabetic ketoacidosis, and cardiac arrest in transplacental exposure at six weeks gestation. Across all 157 cases of non-fatal serious outcomes, cases of central nervous system and metabolic adverse events were reported most frequently, and are well-described in the quetiapine label. Additional clinical categories also included reports of cardiac events.

### Use of low-dose quetiapine increases the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events: results from a nationwide active comparator-controlled cohort study [^cdc26a5c]. World Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

At standard doses used for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, quetiapine has been associated with weight gain and increased levels of triglycerides, to-tal cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which are risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, this drug is also commonly used off-label at low doses for anxiolytic or hypnotic purposes, and its cardiovascular safety at these doses is unknown. We aimed to assess the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events with use of low-dose quetiapine compared to use of Z-drug hypnotics in a nationwide, active comparator-controlled cohort study. The cohort included new users of either drugs in Denmark from 2003 to 2017, aged 18–85 years, without history of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, cancer, and severe mental illness. The main outcome was the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were used as an alternative comparator in sensitivity analyses. Altogether, we compared 60,566 low-dose quetiapine users with 454,567 Z-drug users, followed for 890,198 person-years in intent-to-treat analysis, and 330,334 person-years in as-treated analysis. In intention-to-treat analysis, low-dose quetiapine was associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio, aHR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.02–1.24, p = 0.014) and cardiovascular death (aHR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.11–1.43, p < 0.001). In as-treated analysis, continuous low-dose quetiapine use was associated with increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (aHR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.35–1.70, p < 0.001), non-fatal ischemic stroke (aHR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.13–1.68, p = 0.002) and cardiovascular death (aHR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.64–2.19, p < 0.001). The risk of major adverse cardiovascular events was greater in women (aHR = 1.28, p = 0.02) and those aged ≥ 65 years at initiation (aHR = 1.24, p < 0.001). Compared to SSRIs, low-dose quetiapine use was associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (aHR = 1.42, p < 0.001), non-fatal ischemic stroke (aHR = 1.27, p = 0.0028) and cardiovascular death (aHR = 1.72, p < 0.001). So, we conclude that the use of low-dose quetiapine is associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, especially in women and the elderly. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that use of off-label low-dose quetiapine for sedative or hypnotic purposes should be discouraged.

Figure 1gives reasons for discontinuation. Adverse events that occurred in more than one case were fatigue, sedation, or tiredness (n = 9; 7 in quetiapine group, 2 in placebo group), dizziness (n = 7; all in quetiapine group), nausea (n = 2; both in quetiapine group), limb weakness (n = 2; both in quetiapine group), and insomnia (n = 2; 1 in quetiapine group, 1 in placebo group). Three serious adverse events occurred. One patient taking quetiapine was admitted to hospital after impulsive self-laceration following an argument with a partner, and one assigned to placebo was admitted after a non-fatal overdose of hypnotics during an adjustment reaction to financial difficulties. Both were discontinued. A third patient in the placebo group had transient repetitive imagery for three days and was briefly admitted for observation, but continued. The rate of discontinuation for both adverse events and serious adverse events was higher for the quetiapine group (18%; 16/89) than the placebo group (8%; 7/89) (relative risk 2.29, 95% confidence interval 0.99 to 5.28; χ² = 3.20, df = 1; P = 0.07).

Other reasons for discontinuation included need for a mood stabiliser (n = 3; 2 in quetiapine group, 1 in placebo group), inability to tolerate the transition protocol (n = 7; 4 in quetiapine group, 3 in placebo group), and unwillingness to attend the study assessments (n = 1; in placebo group). Discontinuation for all causes did not differ significantly between the quetiapine group (31%; 28/89) and the placebo group (20%; 18/89) (relative risk 1.32, 0.98 to 1.77; χ² = 2.38, df = 1; P = 0.12).
