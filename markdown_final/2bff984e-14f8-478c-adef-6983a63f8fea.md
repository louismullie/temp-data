## Question

Difference between AML, acute B-ALL and acute T-ALL

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differences between acute myeloid leukemia (AML), B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational lineage and cell of origin distinctions. Then, I should verify the diagnostic immunophenotypic criteria and how to handle ambiguous cases. Next, I will examine epidemiology and clinical presentation. After that, I need to review genetic and molecular landscapes. Then, I should compare treatment principles and MRD strategies. Finally, I will consider prognosis, special entities like MPAL, and synthesize practical clinical implications with citations to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental lineage distinction, because everything downstream depends on it. AML arises from malignant transformation of myeloid progenitors and is defined by myeloperoxidase (MPO) positivity or monocytic differentiation markers, whereas ALL arises from lymphoid progenitors and is subdivided into B-ALL and T-ALL based on B- versus T-lineage markers; this lineage split drives different treatment paradigms, so I need to ensure I anchor on this before proceeding [^1144MiUP] [^111GyGeA].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic immunophenotypic criteria so I don't overgeneralize. For AML, MPO or monocytic markers (for example, CD14, CD64, CD11c) establish myeloid lineage; for B-ALL, CD19 with cytoplasmic CD79a, CD10, and/or CD22 define B lineage; for T-ALL, cytoplasmic or surface CD3 establishes T lineage, and TdT is typically positive in ALL but can be seen in a minority of AML, so I should not rely on TdT alone to assign lineage; importantly, myeloid-associated antigens like CD13 or CD33 can be expressed in ALL and do not by themselves reclassify the disease as MPAL, so I need to be cautious not to mislabel such cases [^111GyGeA] [^112MiPbR] [^115nbNfi].

> Hold on, I should verify how to handle ambiguous cases because misclassification alters therapy. Mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) is diagnosed when blasts show commitment to more than one lineage or lack clear single-lineage commitment; WHO 2022 and ICC 2022 provide criteria, and in such cases, therapy selection is challenging and often benefits from expert hematopathology input and consideration of lineage-matched approaches; I initially thought myeloid antigen expression in ALL might imply MPAL, but wait, that is not correct — myeloid antigen expression alone does not meet MPAL criteria and should not change ALL classification [^111uUNAt] [^111jy9Wr] [^112MiPbR].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and clinical context to frame pretest probabilities. B-ALL predominates in children, comprising roughly 80% of pediatric ALL, whereas T-ALL accounts for about 15–20% of pediatric ALL and a higher proportion in adults; AML is the most common acute leukemia in adults and is relatively less frequent in children, which helps explain why adult protocols often diverge from pediatric ones in AML more than in ALL [^115PFpJn] [^115SDyZW].

> I will now examine clinical presentation patterns, but I need to check for exceptions. T-ALL more often presents with mediastinal masses and CNS involvement, reflecting thymic origin and trafficking patterns, while B-ALL more commonly shows lymphadenopathy and extramedullary disease; AML typically presents with cytopenias and bleeding or infection due to marrow failure, though extramedullary myeloid sarcoma can occur; I should confirm that CNS disease is less common at diagnosis in AML than in ALL, which aligns with standard teaching [^115SDyZW].

> Let me think about the genetic and molecular landscapes, because these shape risk and targeted options. In B-ALL, hyperdiploidy, ETV6::RUNX1, TCF3::PBX1, and BCR::ABL1 are canonical, with IKZF1 alterations and BCR::ABL1-like signatures conferring higher risk; in T-ALL, NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations are frequent, and early T-cell precursor (ETP) ALL has a distinct immunophenotype and genomic profile with myeloid/stem features; in AML, recurrent cytogenetic groups such as t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16)/t(16;16), and molecular categories like NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, and TP53 guide prognosis and therapy; I should double-check that ETP-ALL is now recognized in WHO/ICC and carries distinct implications for risk and management [^114A1RsN] [^111sKhpF] [^115u1dpE] [^111CXHbW].

> Hold on, I should verify treatment philosophies because they differ materially. ALL therapy relies on multiagent induction, consolidation, CNS prophylaxis, and prolonged maintenance, with MRD guiding intensification and transplant decisions; T-ALL historically carried worse outcomes but modern protocols have narrowed the gap, and nelarabine is a T-lineage–selective nucleoside used in relapsed/refractory T-ALL; AML therapy is built around intensive induction and consolidation tailored to cytogenetic/molecular risk, with growing roles for targeted agents and MRD assessment, and APL requires immediate ATRA to mitigate coagulopathy; I need to ensure I note that MRD timing and thresholds differ between ALL and AML and are protocol-specific [^114ic769] [^116bwGuN] [^1113d3nf] [^111rCKxQ] [^113M6GPY] [^111CXHbW].

> I should confirm MRD strategies and thresholds, since they influence transplant decisions. In ALL, flow cytometry and NGS-based Ig/TCR assays detect MRD down to 10⁻⁴ to 10⁻⁶, with post-induction and post-consolidation MRD strongly prognostic; in AML, flow-based MRD using leukemia-associated immunophenotypes and molecular assays for mutations like NPM1 or fusion transcripts are increasingly used, though standardization and sensitivity vary; I need to emphasize that MRD positivity at the end of induction in ALL predicts high relapse risk and should trigger transplant evaluation, whereas AML MRD interpretation must consider clonal hematopoiesis and evolving phenotypes [^113M6GPY] [^111b7piV] [^1111i785] [^112UcRX5].

> Let me reconsider prognosis so I don't overstate uniformity. Historically, pediatric B-ALL has the best outcomes with cure rates around 80–90%, T-ALL slightly lower but improving with modern therapy, and adult outcomes lag across all subtypes; AML outcomes are highly dependent on genetics, with favorable-risk cytogenetics doing well with chemotherapy alone, whereas adverse-risk disease has poor survival and often requires allogeneic transplant; relapse biology differs, with clonal evolution documented in AML and implications for retesting at relapse; I should double-check that contemporary pediatric T-ALL survival approaches 90% in many trials, reflecting intensified regimens and better MRD-guided therapy [^114L5VPU] [^114ic769] [^111CXHbW] [^115XRJLY] [^115SDyZW].

> But wait, what about special entities that blur lines and complicate decisions. MPAL is rare and heterogeneous; genomic studies suggest AML-like and ALL-like subsets, and some data support choosing therapy that matches the dominant molecular phenotype, though evidence is limited; ETP-ALL behaves more like a myeloid/lymphoid hybrid and may respond differently to induction; I should confirm that guidelines recommend expert review and, when feasible, enrollment on trials for these ambiguous cases [^11772G9P] [^111uUNAt] [^111sKhpF].

> Next, I should review practical diagnostic steps to avoid misclassification. The initial workup should include morphology, comprehensive cytogenetics, molecular testing, and a sufficiently broad flow cytometry panel to distinguish AML, B-ALL, T-ALL, and MPAL; if MPAL is suspected, I need to ensure the panel captures both myeloid and lymphoid markers and that results are interpreted in the context of WHO/ICC criteria; I should double-check that aberrant antigen expression is common and that myeloid markers in ALL do not equal MPAL [^1144MiUP] [^111jy9Wr] [^112MiPbR].

> Finally, I need to synthesize the clinical implications so the distinctions translate to bedside decisions. AML versus ALL dictates entirely different induction backbones, CNS prophylaxis is mandatory in ALL but not AML, and transplant thresholds and MRD interpretation differ; T-ALL requires vigilance for mediastinal disease and CNS involvement and may benefit from nelarabine in relapse; recognizing MPAL prevents defaulting to AML therapy when an ALL-directed or hybrid approach might be superior; I should confirm that early involvement of leukemia centers and clinical trials is emphasized in guidelines for optimal outcomes [^114ic769] [^111rCKxQ] [^1113d3nf] [^111uUNAt].

AML, B-ALL, and T-ALL are **distinct acute leukemias** defined by lineage, immunophenotype, genetics, and clinical behavior [^1144MiUP]. AML is a **myeloid-lineage** disease with myeloperoxidase positivity and frequent FLT3, NPM1, or TP53 mutations [^111rCKxQ]; B-ALL is a **B-lineage** disease with CD19/CD10 expression and common BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1, or hyperdiploidy [^114A1RsN]; T-ALL is a **T-lineage** disease with CD3/CD7 expression and frequent NOTCH1, TLX1, or TLX3 alterations [^1162Jcwu]. These differences drive **treatment choices**: AML uses anthracycline/cytarabine with targeted agents, B-ALL uses vincristine, steroids, and asparaginase with CD19-directed immunotherapies, and T-ALL uses similar chemotherapy plus nelarabine [^114ic769] [^1113d3nf]. Prognosis varies: pediatric B-ALL has the highest cure rates, T-ALL outcomes have improved but remain inferior, and AML has lower survival, especially in adults [^114L5VPU] [^114ic769].

| **Feature** | **AML** | **B-ALL** | **T-ALL** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Lineage | Myeloid | B-lymphoid | T-lymphoid |
| Immunophenotype | CD13, CD33, MPO, HLA-DR | CD19, CD10, TdT | CD3, CD7, TdT |
| Common mutations | FLT3, NPM1, TP53, CEBPA | BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1, hyperdiploidy | NOTCH1, TLX1, TLX3 |
| Clinical features | Cytopenias, infections, bleeding | Mediastinal mass less common; CNS involvement | Mediastinal mass, CNS involvement |
| Treatment | Anthracycline + cytarabine; targeted therapy | Vincristine, steroids, asparaginase; CD19 immunotherapy | Similar chemotherapy + nelarabine |
| Prognosis | Moderate; worse in adults | Excellent in children | Improved but inferior to B-ALL |

---

In sum, **lineage-specific biology** underpins distinct immunophenotypes, genetics, clinical features, and therapies, with B-ALL having the best pediatric outcomes, T-ALL improving but remaining higher risk, and AML carrying the poorest survival, particularly in adults [^114L5VPU] [^114ic769] [^114NmYbp].

Introduction

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is one of the four primary types of leukemia, along with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). While AML, CLL, and CML primarily affect adults, approximately 80% of ALL cases occur in children. ALL is classified into two main types: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). T-ALL accounts for 15% of newly diagnosed cases in children and 25% in adults. T-ALL circulates in peripheral bloodand is characterized by the aggressive clonal proliferation of immature T-cell precursors originating in the thymus, which infiltrate secondary organs, including the spleen, the liver, bone marrow (BM), lymph nodes, and the central nervous system (CNS). Substantial progress has been made in T-ALL treatment in recent decades, leading to long-term remission in more than 90% of children and 60% of adult patients. However, approximately 15–20% of pediatric and 50% of adult patients relapse or do not respond to initial therapy within two years of diagnosis. Pediatric and adult patients with relapsed T-ALL have poor prognoses, with approximately 30–50% and 30% survival rates over 5 years, respectively. Furthermore, current therapies cause adverse events, even in patients who are cured. Therefore, there is an evident clinical need to develop less toxic therapies for T-ALL patients.

### How I diagnose acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage [^111uUNAt]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Classification of acute leukemia involves assigning lineage by resemblance to normal progenitor cells. This approach provides descriptive information about the blast cells that is useful for disease monitoring, provides clues to pathogenesis, and can help clinicians select effective chemotherapeutic regimens. Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage (ALALs) are those leukemias that either fail to show evidence of myeloid, B-, or T-lymphoid lineage commitment or show evidence of commitment to more than 1 lineage. The different treatment regimens for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) make ALAL a challenge both diagnostically and therapeutically.

Methods

Current classification criteria have reduced the reported incidence of mixed-lineage leukemias by emphasizing fewer markers and categorizing some biphenotypic leukemias with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities as other entities. Several recent studies have explored the genomic and epigenetic landscape of mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) and have suggested a further refinement of the World Health Organization classification to emphasize the genomic heterogeneity of MPAL.

Results

Genomic and expression profile data for MPAL reveal mutations commonly seen in both AML and ALL, with T-/myeloid MPAL showing overlapping features with early T-cell precursor lymphoblastic leukemia.

Conclusions

Our review aimed to discuss the diagnostic challenges, recent genomic studies, and therapeutic strategies in this poorly understood disease.

### Integrative genomic analysis of adult mixed phenotype acute leukemia delineates lineage associated molecular subtypes [^11772G9P]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) is a rare subtype of acute leukemia characterized by leukemic blasts presenting myeloid and lymphoid markers. Here we report data from integrated genomic analysis on 31 MPAL samples and compare molecular profiling with that from acute myeloid leukemia (AML), B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Consistent with the mixed immunophenotype, both AML-type and ALL-type mutations are detected in MPAL. Myeloid-B and myeloid-T MPAL show distinct mutation and methylation signatures that are associated with differences in lineage-commitment gene expressions. Genome-wide methylation comparison among MPAL, AML, B-ALL, and T-ALL sub-classifies MPAL into AML-type and ALL-type MPAL, which is associated with better clinical response when lineage-matched therapy is given. These results elucidate the genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity of MPAL and its genetic distinction from AML, B-ALL, and T-ALL and further provide proof of concept for a molecularly guided precision therapy approach in MPAL.

### Automated database-guided expert-supervised orientation for immunophenotypic diagnosis and classification of acute leukemia [^111GyGeA]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute leukemias (AL) are malignant expansions of aberrant haematopoietic precursor cells arrested at very immature stages of differentiation. Based on cytomorphologic, cytochemical and flowcytometric investigations, two main subgroups of AL, that is, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can be distinguished. Further subdivision of ALL fully relies on immunophenotyping and allows identification of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL. Appropriate diagnosis of these three main AL types is clinically essential, since these groups (particularly ALL versus AML) differ significantly in treatment and prognosis.

Flowcytometric immunophenotyping is a key diagnostic tool to identify the lineage of leukemic cells in AL patients. In a small number of cases, appropriate lineage assessment can be tricky, since the leukemic cells show no clear evidence of differentiation along a single lineage or they express differentiation antigens highly specific for more than one lineage. These cases account for < 5% of all acute leukemia (AL) cases and they are categorized separately in the current WHO classification as AL of ambiguous lineage, including both acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) and mixed phenotype AL (MPAL). For MPAL cases, the WHO classification has defined the phenotypic criteria for cell lineage assignment, that is, CD19 and Cytoplasmic (Cy)CD79a, CD10 and/or CD22 for B-cells, CyCD3 or surface membrane (Sm)CD3 for T-cells, and myeloperoxidase (CyMPO) or monocytic differentiation markers (for example, CD14, CD64, CD11c) for myeloid lineage.

### T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: subtype prevalence, clinical outcome, and emerging targeted treatments [^1162Jcwu]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (T-ALL) is a high-risk hematological disease constituting ~20% of acute leukemias. To date, the only subtype recognized by the World Health Organization's International Consensus Classification is early T-cell precursor ALL. To improve clinical outcomes, several studies have investigated and defined T-ALL genomic subtypes within cohorts of varied ages and geographical locations. These studies have also utilized differing analysis methods including whole transcriptome, exome, or genome sequencing as well as immunophenotyping and cytogenetic testing. As a result, there are significant differences in reported subtypes as well as the frequency at which each occurs. The reported clinical outcomes for specific genomic alterations also depend on patient demographics and treatment protocols. This review synthesizes the data from four T-ALL genomic landscape studies establishing consensus and highlighting differences, details clinical outcomes for the most common genomic alterations observed in T-ALL patients, and proposes novel avenues for future investigation and treatment.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) classification and specialized care guidance: At the moment, there are discrepancies between two recognized classification systems for AML. The NCCN Guidelines do not advocate for one over another, and Providers should exercise their best clinical judgment related to these discrepancies. When presented with rare cases such as acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage (ALAL), including mixed phenotype acute leukemias (MPAL) (according to 2022 WHO classification), consultation with an experienced hematopathologist is strongly recommended. Patients with AML should preferably be cared for at experienced leukemia centers where clinical trials may be more available; Young adults may be eligible for pediatric trials. ATRA should be available in all community hospitals, so appropriate therapy can be started promptly.

### MicroRNA profiling can classify acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage as either acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoid leukemia [^116VBtzX]. Clinical Cancer Research (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Classification of acute leukemia is based on the commitment of leukemic cells to the myeloid or the lymphoid lineage. However, a small percentage of acute leukemia cases lack straightforward immunophenotypical lineage commitment. These leukemias of ambiguous lineage represent a heterogeneous category of acute leukemia that cannot be classified as either acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). The lack of clear classification of acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage as either AML or ALL is a hurdle in treatment choice for these patients.

Experimental Design

Here, we compared the microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of 17 cases with acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage and 16 cases of AML, B-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (B-ALL), and T-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (T-ALL).

Results

We show that leukemias of ambiguous lineage do not segregate as a separate entity but exhibit miRNA expression profiles similar to AML, B-ALL, or T-ALL. We show that by using only 5 of the most lineage-discriminative miRNAs, we are able to define acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage as either AML or ALL.

Conclusion

Our results indicate the presence of a myeloid or lymphoid lineage-specific genotype, as reflected by miRNA expression, in these acute leukemias despite their ambiguous immunophenotype. miRNA-based classification of acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage might be of additional value in therapeutic decision making.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) risk stratification — Risk stratification has been more difficult than in B-ALL, and although T-cell lineage was previously considered a high-risk feature, modern treatment protocols have resulted in improved survival outcomes, with genetic mutations and targeted therapies potentially changing future treatment and risk assessment.

### Differential expression of hERG1A and hERG1B genes in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia identifies different prognostic subgroups [^114L5VPU]. Leukemia (2014). Low credibility.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy of childhood, with 85% of cases being of B-cell lineage (B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL) and 15% of T-cell lineage (T-ALL). With wider use of intensive chemotherapy, the prognosis of childhood ALL has improved remarkably, and nearly 80% of BCP-ALLpatients can currently be cured. The prognosis of children with T-ALL has improved and has been reported to be similar to that for BCP-ALL (no differences in the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate). However, long-term survival rates for pediatric T-ALL are still lower than those for BCP-ALL by up to 20%. Systemic toxicity and chemoresistance are nowadays the main shortcomings of standard chemotherapy.

Current interest focuses on identifying new specific molecular targets to be exploited either for risk stratification or for identification of novel, patient-tailored, therapeutic approaches that can improve therapy efficacy and reduce toxicity in pediatric ALL.

We have provided evidence that K + channels encoded by the ether-a-gò-gò-related gene 1 (hERG1), hERG1 channels, besides exploiting a relevant role in cardiac physiology, are often aberrantly expressed in human cancers including leukemias. In pediatric BCP-ALL, hERG1 channels sustain the development of chemoresistance, as they modulate pro-survival signals triggered by the bone marrow microenvironment. In adult acute myeloid leukemias (AML), hERG1 regulates cell motility and transendothelial migration through an interplay with angiogenic signaling pathways. This effectively correlates with the worse prognosis in AML patients displaying high hERG1 expression.

### Initial diagnostic workup of acute leukemia: guideline from the college of American pathologists and the American Society of Hematology [^1144MiUP]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute leukemia initial workup — morphology, cytogenetics, molecular testing, and flow cytometric immunophenotyping: In addition to morphologic assessment (blood and bone marrow), the pathologist or treating clinician should obtain sufficient samples and perform conventional cytogenetic analysis (i.e., karyotype), appropriate molecular genetic and/or fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) testing, and flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCI). The flow cytometry panel should be sufficient to distinguish acute myeloid leukemia (including acute promyelocytic leukemia), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) (including early T-cell precursor leukemias), B-cell precursor ALL (B-ALL), and acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage on all patients diagnosed with acute leukemia. Molecular genetic and/or FISH testing does not, however, replace conventional cytogenetic analysis.

### Identification of leukemia-enriched signature through the development of a comprehensive pediatric single-cell atlas [^113tAe3s]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Some of the recent single-cell studies in pediatric leukemia have investigated therapy resistance in early T-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL), and characterized immune-suppressive environment association with minimal residual disease (MRD) in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). In our recent pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) study, we unraveled the heterogeneity of AML blasts and identified a blast-associated gene signature that could be used to discriminate AML blasts from non-blast cells. Similarly, our analysis of pediatric mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) samples demonstrated that B-cell/myeloid and T-cell/myeloid MPAL have unique profiles, which may account for the differences observed in disease development and/or response to current therapies. In pediatric T-cell ALL (T-ALL), scRNA-seq analysis was utilized to identify a T-ALL blast-specific signature and MRD-associated immune environment changes. Most single-cell studies involve small sample sizes and are limited to characterizing the single-cell landscape of a specific leukemia type. To explore potential candidates that may be commonly dysregulated across different leukemias, it is necessary to perform correlative studies after consolidating single cell data from emerging studies. Therefore, in this study, we have integrated pediatric leukemia datasets from AML, ALL, and MPAL to generate a large pediatric leukemia scRNA-seq atlas. Subsequently, we annotated the malignant and microenvironment cells, and performed a comparison of malignant and healthy bone marrow (BM) cells to identify genes commonly over-expressed in the leukemia cells. Further, to ensure leukemia specificity, genes expressed in BM cells from healthy donors were filtered out. The association of gene over-expression in leukemia was confirmed using public bulk RNA-seq datasets to generate a leukemia-enriched signature of nine genes that were over-expressed across different pediatric leukemias. The expression of the leukemia-enriched signature was further validated in malignant cells of scRNA-seq pediatric AML, adult AML, and adult MPAL publicly available datasets.

Mixed phenotype acute leukemias (MPALs) — definitions within ALL-related entities: Hematologic malignancies related to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) include acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage (ALALs), such as MPALs. MPALs include bilineage leukemias, in which two distinct populations of lymphoblasts are identified with one meeting the criteria for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), while biphenotypic MPAL is defined as a single population of lymphoblasts that expresses markers consistent with B-cell or T-cell ALL in addition to myeloid or monocytic markers; myeloid-associated markers such as CD13 and CD33 may be expressed in ALL.

### How I treat AML incorporating the updated classifications and guidelines [^115AowNE]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

To date, the classification of AML and hematologic malignancies has generally relied on experts in the field who meet every couple of years to produce consensus recommendations based on their interpretation of the best available evidence. As lower-intensity therapies are increasingly used for the treatment of AML, a dedicated risk stratification system is urgently needed. An increasingly scientific approach to genetic evaluation, both at diagnosis (for prognostication, treatment assignment-based predictive biomarkers for specific therapies, and homogenous interpretable clinical trials) and after treatment (for prognostication, treatment assignment, and personalization of therapy based on the risk of relapse) is positively influencing diagnostic classifications and clinical guidelines. In the future, hematologic neoplasm classification and clinical treatment guideline revisions will increasingly focus on improving prognostication and guiding personalized precision therapies. Experts in the field have called for the establishment of an international working group to encourage this cooperation and the unification of such classifications. Ultimately, we need substantially better treatment options for all AML patients, with the hope that a new era of precision medicine will facilitate discovery by separating signals from noise, leading to new options and approaches for the treatment of patients with AML.

### Applicability of 2022 classifications of acute myeloid leukemia in the real-world setting [^11312QrE]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the use of molecular data is now crucial to precisely diagnose and risk-stratify patients with AML. More than a dozen genes have been incorporated within current diagnostic and prognostic schemes, and genome scanning approaches have been proposed to capture the complexity of AML biology. However, the high costs, expertise level in molecular biology, and issues of standardization still represent hurdles to provide equitable care for patients with AML worldwide. Given the substantial similarities, the conflicts between the newly competing diagnostic systems may be resolved, reaching an agreement on a unified model, which must also take into account the available resources worldwide.

### Acute leukemias of ambiguous origin [^11766ajp]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

This session of the Society for Hematopathology/European Association for Haematopathology Workshop focused on acute leukemias of ambiguous origin.

Methods

We provide an overview of mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) as recognized in the current World Health Organization classification and summarize diagnostic criteria for major categories of MPAL: B/myeloid, T/myeloid, B/T, and B/T/myeloid.

Results

Most MPAL cases submitted were B/myeloid and T/myeloid MPAL, the most frequent types, but three cases of B/T MPAL were also submitted, and examples of all categories are illustrated. We emphasize that a comprehensive approach to immunophenotyping is required to accurately establish the diagnosis of MPAL. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping using a large panel of antibodies is needed as well as confirmatory immunohistochemical analysis and cytochemistry studies for myeloperoxidase and nonspecific esterase. We discuss technical issues in determining blast lineage and possible pitfalls in MPAL diagnosis. In particular, rare cases of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) can express myeloperoxidase but are otherwise consistent with B-ALL and should be treated as such. Last, we review the differential diagnosis between acute undifferentiated leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia with minimal differentiation.

Conclusions

There was an agreement that diagnosis of MPAL can be challenging, especially if applied flow cytometry panels are not comprehensive enough.

Management of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) — T-ALL is biologically distinct from B-ALL, and similar to B-ALL, minimal residual disease (MRD) is a key prognostic determinant; current approaches emphasize early intensification with multiagent chemotherapy followed by intensive consolidation therapy.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114vSLaq]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN recommendations for risk assessment in ALL — The Panel suggests approaches in which the NCI defines AYA as 15 to 39 years, AYA with Ph-positive B-ALL are grouped with fit adult patients < 65 years, AYA are considered separately from adults (defined as age ≥ 40 years) for Ph-negative B-ALL and T-ALL, and initial B-ALL risk stratification is based on presence or absence of t(9;22) and/or BCR::ABL; for adult B-ALL and T-ALL, stratification uses 65 years as the cutoff, but chronologic age alone is a poor surrogate and patients should be evaluated individually; AYA and adult patients < 65 years with Ph-negative ALL can be further categorized as high risk, including when MRD positive or when WBC is elevated (> 30 × 10⁹/L for B-cell lineage).

### A transcriptomic continuum of differentiation arrest identifies myeloid interface acute leukemias with poor prognosis [^113VNTMK]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Our description of myeloid/T-lymphoid IALs provides support for recent proposals to define acute myeloid/T-lymphoblastic leukemia (AMTL) as a distinct diagnostic entity, but our results also indicate that this group comprises significant molecular and lineage heterogeneity, particularly with regard to lymphoid gene expression. When applied to independent studies, our IAL score identified AMLs with similar enrichment for immature B-lymphoid signatures as interface cases in our cohort. While the IAL score was not designed to predict prognosis, it is striking that these transcriptional patterns correlated with poor response to AML treatment regimens. RUNX1 -mutated AML-M0 cases in our cohort showed B-lymphoid identity, which is consistent with previous reports. Intriguingly, RUNX1- mutated AMLs have recently been shown to be sensitive to glucocorticoids, which form the backbone of ALL induction treatment. Our findings therefore suggest that the poor response of these cases to AML therapy in both adults and children might be improved by better treatment allocation, and would plead against the recent provisional classification of RUNX1 -mutated AML-M0 with AML. Finally, we hope that these data will provide further impetus to include these and other IALs in shared myeloid/lymphoid protocols that might provide better treatment options for patients with these poor-risk leukemias.

Global pattern of transcriptome profiles in patients with leukemia and leukemia cell lines

In this study, we depicted the transcriptome profiles of 3036 samples from 187 public data sets, including 14 leukemia subtypes, 53 leukemia cell lines, and 92 normal samples (Figure 1 A-B). The workflow of the transcriptome analysis is shown in Figure 1 C, and the workflow is described in detail in "Methods". Previous studies demonstrated that batch effects, which often result in discrepancies in the statistical distributions across data from different data sets, may be the largest barrier to integration analysis for data from different studies. Thus, the well-treated (BER) data are the basis of integration analysis, and all deposited data in our LeukemiaDB were processed with BER.

### Moving forward in target antigen discovery for immunotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia [^117DQRQ3]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

In the last few decades, outstanding results have progressively been obtained in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (pedAML) outcomesdue to improvements in risk stratification, response-to-therapy assessment, supportive care, and chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation management. Despite this, refractory/relapsed disease still occurs in a significant proportion of patients and is associated with a dismal prognosis. Therefore, the effort to develop new therapeutic strategies is critical. Among those, targeted immunotherapy, especially chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, is an intriguing approach, but, differently from B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia, efficacious and safe targets to be used against pedAML have yet to be discovered. This is mainly due to two main reasons: (i) challenges in identifying targets expressed on both AML blast and leukemic stem cells but lacking on normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) to avoid irreversible myeloablation; (ii) potential disease relapses without target antigen on blast surface, due to antigen internalization or AML heterogeneity. Up to now, myeloid lineage antigens, especially CD33, CD123, and CLL1, represent the most investigated targets for CAR T development in AML, being widely expressed on myelomonocytic blasts. Regardless, their use is potentially burdened by severe on-target off-tumor toxicity since they are also present on normal myelomonocytic counterpart, including HSPC. To go beyond this side effect, combinatorial logic gating CAR T cells have been proposed, whose activation mainly relies on three different mechanisms: (i) AND-gated CAR, which require the ligation of at least two of the targeted antigens for full activation and cytotoxicity (e.g. CD33/CD123, CD33/CLL1, CD123/CLL1); (ii) OR-gated CAR, which require the ligation of one of two or more targeted antigens (e.g. CD33/CD123/CLL1); (iii) NOT-gated CAR, based on the co-targeting of two antigens, the first potentially expressed only on healthy tissues, the second both on healthy tissues and on malignant cells. The full activation and cytotoxic activity of NOT-gated CAR require the exclusive ligation of the antigen cross-expressed on both tumoral and healthy cells without the recognition of the selective healthy-tissue target.

### Genetic subtypes of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults [^114AGrRj]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a rare malignancy in adults, with outcomes remaining poor, especially compared with children. Over the past 2 decades, extensive whole-genome studies have identified numerous genetic alterations driving leukemia, leading to the recognition of > 20 distinct subtypes that are closely associated with treatment response and prognosis. In pediatric B-ALL, large correlation studies have made genetic classification a central component of risk-adapted treatment strategies. Notably, genetic subtypes are unevenly distributed according to age, and the spectrum of genetic alterations and their prognostic relevance in adult B-ALL have been less extensively studied, with treatment primarily based on the presence or absence of BCR::ABL1 fusion. This review provides an overview of genetic subtypes in adult B-ALL, including recent biological and clinical insights in well-established subtypes as well as data on newly recognized subtypes. Their relevance for risk classification, disease monitoring, and therapeutic management, including in the context of B-cell-directed therapies, is discussed. This review advocates for continuing efforts to further improve our understanding of the biology of adult B-ALL to establish the foundation of future precision medicine in B-ALL.

Introduction

Leukemia is the main type of hematologic cancer that arises from malignant proliferation and differentiation disorders of blood cells, resulting in abnormal hematopoietic function. Generally, leukemia can be classified based on the differentiation stage and the origin of malignancies; for example, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and B-cell ALL (B-ALL). Different leukemia subtypes show distinct clinical characteristics and transcriptomic profiles, indicating diverse mechanisms underlying their leukemogenesis at the transcription level. Thus, an integrated analysis of leukemia expression data can provide comprehensive insights for elucidating the common and specific regulatory mechanisms among different leukemia subtypes.

Previous studies on leukemia have demonstrated that abnormal gene expression, alternative splicing (AS), and gene fusion play critical roles in the initiation and progression of leukemia. For example, the BCR-ABL1 fusion event encodes a continuously activated ABL kinase, which leads to disruptions of key cellular processes and leukemogenesis. Classical AS of AML1 could produce proteins with different domain structures that regulate cell growth and/or differentiation in leukemogenesis, and the circular RNA (circRNA) circMYBL2 (the back-splicing [BS] of MYBL2) could regulate FLT3 translation by recruiting PTBP1 to promote AML progression. Besides, the aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has demonstrated strong associations with recurrent mutations, clinical features, and outcomes in AML. Thus, systematic investigation of the expression profiles and alterations of RNA molecules in leukemia samples could improve the understanding of the dysregulated regulation underlying leukemogenesis and facilitate the characterization of the transcriptional features and biomarkers of different leukemia subtypes.

### EuroFlow antibody panels for standardized n-dimensional flow cytometric immunophenotyping of normal, reactive and malignant leukocytes [^114NmYbp]. Leukemia (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute leukemias comprise a heterogeneous group of malignant diseases characterized by clonal expansion of immature hematopoietic precursor cells. Current international classifications that are used for therapeutic stratification categorize acute leukemias mainly on the basis of the lineage of the blast cells and the type of additional cytogenetic/molecular lesions and, to a lesser extent, detailed immunophenotype. Two major categories of acute leukemias are recognized: (i) lymphoid precursor neoplasms, which are subdivided into B- and T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (BCP-ALL and T-ALL, respectively), and (ii) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and related precursor neoplasms. A small number of cases do not fit into these two major groups because they either show no clear evidence of differentiation along a single lineage or express differentiation antigens highly specific of more than one lineage, making assignment to a single lineage difficult. These cases represent less than 5% of all acute leukemia cases, and they are categorized separately in the current WHO classification as acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage, including both acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) and mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL).

Flow cytometry has an essential role in the diagnosis and classification of acute leukemias. Together with cytomorphology and cytochemistry, immunophenotyping is crucial for the detection and lineage assignment of blast cells in suspected samples, including the definition of acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage. Comparison of the immunophenotypic features of blasts cells versus normal hematopoietic precursors and immature cells contributes to the definition of the stage of maturation arrest of the blast population within the B- and T-lymphoid lineages as well as the neutrophilic, monocytic, megakaryocytic or erythroid lineages. In addition, specific immunophenotypic profiles have been associated with prognosis and/or unique cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities. Finally, flow cytometric immunophenotyping has also proven to be of great utility for sensitive detection of low levels of residual blast cells and their distinction from normal regenerating immature cells in the BM of acute leukemia patients during treatment.

### New insights into MLL gene rearranged acute leukemias using gene expression profiling: shared pathways, lineage commitment, and partner genes [^1141cQes]. Leukemia (2005). Low credibility.

Rearrangements of the MLL gene occur in both acute lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemias (ALL, AML). This study addressed the global gene expression pattern of these two leukemia subtypes with respect to common deregulated pathways and lineage-associated differences. We analyzed 73 t(11q23)/MLL leukemias in comparison to 290 other acute leukemias and demonstrate that 11q23 leukemias combined are characterized by a common specific gene expression signature. Additionally, in unsupervised and supervised data analysis algorithms, ALL and AML cases with t(11q23) segregate according to the lineage they are derived from, that is, myeloid or lymphoid, respectively. This segregation can be explained by a highly differing transcriptional program. Through the use of novel biological network analyses, essential regulators of early B cell development, PAX5 and EBF, were shown to be associated with a clear B-lineage commitment in lymphoblastic t(11q23)/MLL leukemias. Also, the influence of the different MLL translocation partners on the transcriptional program was directly assessed. Interestingly, gene expression profiling did not reveal a clear distinct pattern associated with one of the analyzed partner genes. Taken together, the identified molecular expression pattern of MLL fusion gene samples and biological networks revealed new insights into the aberrant transcriptional program in 11q23/MLL leukemias.

### CD19 expression in acute leukemia is not restricted to the cytogenetically aberrant populations [^116dVtCS]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2013). Low credibility.

Aberrant expression of the B lymphoid marker, CD19, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has frequently been associated with t(8;21)(q22; q22). However, AML cases lacking t(8;21) may occasionally express CD19. We asked whether CD19 expression is restricted to the karyotypically abnormal leukemic cells in primary leukemia samples. We compared, by fluorescence in situ hybridization, CD19-positive and CD19-negative cells from nine patients with acute leukemia: three non-t(8;21) AML, three t(8;21) AML and three cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. There were no significant differences in karyotypic pattern between the CD19-positive and CD19-negative leukemic cells, raising the concern that therapeutically targeting CD19 for acute leukemia may not eradicate all malignant clones.

### Acute mixed lineage leukemia in children: the experience of ST jude children's research hospital [^112LkP2e]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

To characterize the biology and optimal therapy of acute mixed-lineage leukemia in children, we reviewed the pathologic and clinical features, including response to therapy, of 35 patients with mixed-lineage leukemia. The majority of cases (91%) had blasts cells that simultaneously expressed either T-lineage plus myeloid markers (T/myeloid, n = 20) or B-lineage plus myeloid markers (B/myeloid, n = 12). Overall survival rates for the B/myeloid and T/myeloid subgroups were not significantly different from each other or from the rate for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but were inferior to the outcome in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients who failed to achieve complete remission with AML-directed therapy could often be induced with a regimen of prednisone, vincristine, and L-asparaginase. Analysis of gene-expression patterns identified a subset of biphenotypic leukemias that did not cluster with T-cell ALL, B-progenitor ALL, or AML. We propose that treatment for biphenotypic leukemia begin with one course of AML-type induction therapy, with a provision for a switch to lymphoid-type induction therapy with a glucocorticoid, vincristine, and L-asparaginase if the patient responds poorly. We also suggest that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is often not required for cure of these patients.

### How I treat AML incorporating the updated classifications and guidelines [^113ZuzuT]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

The European LeukemiaNet recently revised both the clinical (2022) and measurable residual disease testing (2021) guidelines for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The updated World Health Organization and International Consensus Classification for myeloid neoplasms were also published in 2022. Together, these documents update the classification, risk stratification, prognostication, monitoring recommendations, and response assessment of patients with AML. Increased appreciation of the genetic drivers of AML over the past decade and our increasingly sophisticated understanding of AML biology have been translated into novel therapies and more complex clinical treatment guidelines. Somatic genetic abnormalities and germ line predispositions now define and guide treatment and counseling for the subtypes of this hematologic malignancy. In this How I Treat article, we discuss how we approach AML in daily clinical practice, considering the recent updates in the context of new treatments and discoveries over the past decade.

In summary, this case may partially suggest the potential mechanism of B-ALL with BCR::ABL1 multilineage involvement and provide a novel mechanism of immune escape in B-ALL. The new subset of Ph + B-ALL may have a high-risk of transforming to AML under the pressure of CD19-target-ed immunotherapy. In B-ALL with BCR::ABL1 multilineage involvement, no relevant prognostic feature applicable for therapy tailoring was found so far, multicenter and prospective studies are needed.

### Prognostic factors in adult acute leukemia [^116a8kit]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The prognostic factors in acute leukemia have undergone a major change over the past decade and are likely to be further refined in the coming years. While age is the single most important prognostic factor in both AML and in ALL, recurring cytogenetic abnormalities and molecular markers have become crucial for the prognosis of patients and for new directions in the development of targeted therapies. No less important is the development of a personalized approach for therapy as determined by the response to therapy using increasingly sensitive technologies. The assessment of MRD is rapidly superseding other prognostic factors in ALL and, somewhat lacking behind, coming into its own in AML. The next decade should see further refinement of response-driven prognostication, to include epigenetics as well as pharmacogenetics and pharmacodynamics of individual drugs used and the responses to them. It is hoped that these refinements and better predictors of response will also lead to a significantly improved overall outcome of patients with both AML and ALL.

### Paediatric lymphoblastic T-cell leukaemia and lymphoma: one or two diseases? [^1112CLNY]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

There is ongoing discussion on whether paediatric acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) and paediatric lymphoblastic T-cell lymphoma (T-LBL) are two distinct entities or whether they represent two variant manifestations of one and the same disease and the distinction is arbitrary. Both show overlapping clinical, morphological and immunophenotypic features. Many clinical trials use the amount of blast infiltration of the bone marrow as the sole criterion to distinguish between T-ALL and T-LBL. The current World Health Organization classification designates both malignancies as T lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma. However, subtle immunophenotypic, molecular and cytogenetic differences suggest that T-ALL and T-LBL might be biologically different in certain aspects. The current review summarizes and discusses the recent advances and understanding of the molecular profile of paediatric T-ALL and T-LBL.

### Redefining hyperviscosity in acute leukemia: potential implications for red cell transfusions in the microvasculature [^112St56o]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperleukocytosis is an emergency of acute leukemia leading to blood hyperviscosity, potentially resulting in life-threatening microvascular obstruction, or leukostasis. Due to the high number of red cells in the circulation, hematocrit/hemoglobin levels (Hct/Hgb) are major drivers of blood viscosity, but how Hct/Hgb mediates hyperviscosity in acute leukemia remains unknown. In vivo hemorheological studies are difficult to conduct and interpret due to issues related to visualizing and manipulating the microvasculature. To that end, a multi-vessel microfluidic device recapitulating the size-scale and geometry of the microvasculature was designed to investigate how Hct/Hgb interacts with acute leukemia to induce "in vitro" leukostasis. Using patient samples and cell lines, the degree of leukostasis was different among leukemia immunophenotypes with respect to white blood cell (WBC) count and Hct/Hgb. Among lymphoid immunophenotypes, severe anemia is protective against in vitro leukostasis and Hct/Hgb thresholds became apparent above which in vitro leukostasis significantly increased, to a greater extent with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) versus T-cell ALL. In vitro leukostasis in acute myeloid leukemia was primarily driven by WBC with little interaction with Hct/Hgb. This sets the stage for prospective clinical studies assessing how red cell transfusion may affect leukostasis risk in immunophenotypically different acute leukemia patients.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113M6GPY]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines — Acute lymphoblastic leukemia: MRD timing, monitoring frequency, and transplant-related actions are specified. The timing of MRD assessment varies depending on the ALL treatment protocol used, and it is recommended that the initial measurement be performed on completion of induction therapy and end of consolidation; additional time points for MRD evaluation should be guided by the treatment protocol or regimen used and risk features. Importantly, both immunophenotype (B- vs. T-lineage) and genotype may impact the prognostic significance of various levels of MRD at different time points, and this highlights the importance of referring to the protocol or regimen being used when interpreting MRD results. For some techniques, a baseline sample (ie, prior to treatment) is needed to characterize the leukemic clone for subsequent MRD assessment. An increase in the frequency of serial monitoring of MRD may be useful in patients experiencing molecular relapse and low-level disease or for those with Ph-positive ALL discontinuing a TKI. In general, MRD positivity at the end of induction predicts high relapse rates and should prompt an evaluation for allogeneic HCT, and when possible, therapy aimed at eliminating MRD prior to allogeneic HCT is preferred.

### Advances in the molecular pathobiology of B-lymphoblastic leukemia [^111mWhzH]. Human Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, also known as B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, is derived from B-cell progenitors. B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia occurs predominantly in children, but can occur at any age. Risk-adapted intensive chemotherapy is effective in treating most children with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but this approach is less successful in adults. Recent developments in genome-wide genetic analysis in B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia have provided insights into disease pathogenesis and prognosis. B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases usually carry a primary genetic event, often a chromosome translocation, and a constellation of secondary genetic alterations that are acquired and selected dynamically in a nonlinear fashion. These genetic changes commonly affect cellular mechanisms that control B-cell differentiation and proliferation. The cooperative interaction between inactivation of hematopoietic transcription factors involved in differentiation (class II mutation) and activating mutations involved in cell proliferation (class I mutation) is reminiscent of the pathogenic model of acute myeloid leukemia. The resulting improved molecular understanding of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia is helping to refine disease risk stratification and discover new therapeutic approaches for patients with refractory disease. In this review, we first summarize the clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic features of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia and introduce current understanding of B-cell development and B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia leukemogenesis. We then focus on recent advances in genetic analysis and gene expression profiling of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia and discuss the implications of these findings for disease evolution, risk prediction, and possible novel therapeutic approaches.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk stratification in adults states that additional parameters are generally not used for patients ≥ 65 years of age with Ph-negative ALL, and although elevated WBC count (≥ 30 × 10⁹/L for B-cell lineage; ≥ 100 × 10⁹/L for T-cell lineage) has been considered a high-risk factor based on earlier studies, studies in adults have shown that WBC counts may lose independent prognostic significance when cytogenetic factors and MRD are considered; therefore, adult patients with ALL may not necessarily be classified as high risk based on high WBC count alone.

The preferred method of MRD quantification is an FDA-approved NGS-based assay to detect fusion genes or clonal rearrangements in immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) loci (does not require patient-specific primers), if available, and referral to or consultation with a center with expertise is recommended for any patient with ALL with MRD positivity. BCR::ABL1 quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) positivity may reflect persistence in the myeloid compartment; where feasible, flow sorting to isolate myeloid versus lymphoid cells for FISH/qPCR studies and/or NGS MRD may help to resolve, and the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome in the myeloid compartment does not necessarily imply a diagnosis of CML with lymphoid blast transformation. Consider sequential MRD monitoring for patients with complete molecular remission (undetectable levels), with increased frequency indicated for detectable levels or for those discontinuing TKI.

### Phenotypically-defined stages of leukemia arrest predict main driver mutations subgroups, and outcome in acute myeloid leukemia [^116wrjgV]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The proteome and the surfaceome have been considered a promising and complementary fields to the genome for elucidating cancer biology and identifying diagnostic and predictive biomarkers. However, there are still very few clinically relevant biomarkers and disease subtypes that have been identified by these approaches.

Here, we did a phenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular correlative analysis of a very large cohort of AML patients to capture the AML surfaceome that appears to be caused by the stage of leukemia arrest (SLA) and by specific genomic features. We hypothesized that our approach may add to current AML classifications by identifying relevant phenotypic AML subtypes with specific clinical and molecular features as well as information on outcomes after standard treatment. Overall, we anticipated that phenotypic classification associated with the morphological analysis, available within 24 h on the day of diagnosis, could be very useful to begin planning therapeutic strategy in daily practice.

### Transient differentiation-state plasticity occurs during acute lymphoblastic leukemia initiation [^111u83AZ]. Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive childhood leukemia characterized by genomic rearrangements resulting in a blocked differentiation at specific stages of the T-cell development. T-ALL blasts often do not express a T-cell receptor (TCR) on the membrane. However, the clonal V(D)J recombination of the different TCR chain loci is detected in 86% of T-ALL patients. These irreversible genetic marks point to the extent of cellular differentiation as each TCR chain is recombined in a different T-cell developmental stage. Interestingly, leukemic blast populations spanning different developmental stages are described in ALL and AML. Although in AML, phenotypically immature cells are shown to be CSCs, CSCs are not identified in ALL. Instead, cells of distinct phenotypes display a leukemia-initiating potential in xenotransplantation experiments. Despite the phenotype, these cells reconstitute a phenotypically heterogeneous leukemia in mice. However, it remains unclear to what extent lineage plasticity plays a role in human ALL progression.

Therefore, we used T-ALL as a model disease to study phenotypic plasticity and leukemic differentiation stage arrest. We show that diverse mutational processes or driver mutations do not drive phenotypic diversity. Instead, the phylogenetic analysis indicates a brief period of plasticity at leukemia initiation, where cells acquire a variety of phenotypes, which then become fixed. This short period of plasticity could also be detected at relapse initiation. Our work provides insight into the in-situ initiation and plastic progression of ALL.

### Diagnostic work-up of acute myeloid leukemia [^114BqkM4]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by a clonal expansion of undifferentiated myeloid precursors resulting in impaired hematopoiesis and bone marrow failure. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) published revisions to the classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias. Similar to the 2008 classification, the updated classification incorporates clinical features, morphology, immunophenotyping, and cytogenetics, with greater emphasis on molecular genetics, to define disease entities. This brief review addresses the various components of pathologic assessment to establish a diagnosis of AML and to help risk stratify patients, with an emphasis on newer techniques used in the detection of mutations with prognostic significance, as well as assays employed in the evaluation of minimal residual disease following treatment.

### T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: subtype prevalence, clinical outcome, and emerging targeted treatments [^1112YcUE]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

T-ALL is a genomically complex disease which is frequently fatal upon relapse. Here we have summarized four T-ALL genomic landscape studies and found consensus in subtype defining alterations where possible. We have also described patient outcomes and potential targeted treatments for laboratory and clinical investigation. T-ALL occurs less frequently than B-ALL and, until recently, has remained an under-studied cohort, particularly in terms of genomic interrogation of large patient datasets. The synopsis presented here highlights the genomic complexity of T-ALL and the importance of co-occurring lesions on disease progression and outcome. Of significance is the recent insight gained from WGS analyses and the advantage over traditional diagnostic techniques, particularly in the T-ALL setting. These genomic methodologies have identified the frequency at which noncoding alterations occur in T-ALL, revealing a genomic landscape predominantly comprised of noncoding lesions. Given we now know that noncoding alterations have a role as T-ALL driver lesions as well as secondary co-lesions impacting outcome, in the future, detailed genomic analyses may be required to inform the clinical approach for disease treatment and potential eradication.

JOURNAL British Journal of Haematology. 1976;33(4):451–458. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1976.tb03563.x.

In 1974, 150 stained peripheral blood and bone marrow biopsy slides from patients with acute leukemia and other disorders were shared among a group of seven expert hematologists from France, America and Britain (FAB). Their task was to independently diagnose and assess each specimen. For 5 days in Paris in the fall of 1974, they gathered to discuss and debate their findings, with a charge to reach a consensus on a new way to categorize acute leukemias using morphology. Nine months later the group assembled once again, this time in London, to apply the diagnostic criteria they had adjudicated using an independent set of specimens. Successful in their task, they published the seminal paper on the "FAB classification system" in 1976 in the British Journal of Haematology (Figure 1). Notably, this was one of the first efforts to distinguish acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which was of emerging importance due to inklings that these different diseases might respond to different treatments. What their work has become mainly remembered for, however, is the sub-grouping of AML into six types: M1, M2, M3, M4, M5 and M6 (later efforts would expand this well-known system to include M0 2 and M7 3). The FAB classification system became the predominant system utilized by the field. The definitive t(15;17) lesion characterizing acute promyelocytic leukemia overlapped nicely with M3, as did later discoveries of the core-binding factor leukemias with respective morphological subtypes. However, with the widespread use of cytogenetic testing, these biological features were found to hold greater prognostic importance. Ultimately, once extensive genomic testing became widely available, the morphological FAB classification system was relegated. Clinicians did not request its use, as the various subgroups were not treated differently. A new generation of pathologists were not trained to use it, and some of the necessary stains became limited in availability.

### T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: recent molecular biology findings [^1153y3sZ]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

For many years, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) has been considered and treated as a single malignancy, but divergent outcomes in T-ALL patients receiving uniform treatment protocols encouraged intensive research on the molecular biology of this disease. Recent findings in the field demonstrate that T-ALL is much more heterogeneous than originally believed and extremely diverse outcomes of patients require refinement of T-ALL classification, leading to subtype-specific adjustment of treatment. Many different biological features of T-ALL blast cells have recently been found to contribute to disease development and patient outcome and their analysis could potentially be introduced into improved diagnostics and classification of the disease. This review focuses on five key issues of T-ALL biology: chromosome aberrations, gene expression profiles, gene mutations, DNA methylation patterns, and immunoglobulin/T cell receptor (Ig/TCR) gene rearrangements. Additionally, molecular monitoring of minimal residual disease, by far the most reliable independent prognostic factor in T-ALL, has been highlighted in the context of Ig/TCR gene rearrangements. Translation of this biological information into better prognostic classification and more effective treatment should lead to improvement of outcome in T-ALL patients.

### Prognosis of children with mixed phenotype acute leukemia treated on the basis of consistent immunophenotypic criteria [^116XdpkE]. Haematologica (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) represents a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. The European Group for the Immunological Classification of Leukemias (EGIL) scoring system unambiguously defines MPAL expressing aberrant lineage markers. Discussions surrounding it have focused on scoring details, and information is limited regarding its biological, clinical and prognostic significance. The recent World Health Organization classification is simpler and could replace the EGIL scoring system after transformation into unambiguous guidelines.

Design and Methods

Simple immunophenotypic criteria were used to classify all cases of childhood acute leukemia in order to provide therapy directed against acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia. Prognosis, genotype and immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor gene rearrangement status were analyzed.

Results

The incidences of MPAL were 28/582 and 4/107 for children treated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia regimens, respectively. In immunophenotypic principal component analysis, MPAL treated as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia clustered between cases of non-mixed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, while other MPAL cases were included in the respective non-mixed B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia clusters. Analogously, immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor gene rearrangements followed the expected pattern in patients treated as having acute myeloid leukemia (non-rearranged, 4/4) or as having B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (rearranged, 20/20), but were missing in 3/5 analyzed cases of MPAL treated as having T-cell acute lymphobastic leukemia. In patients who received acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment, the 5-year event-free survival of the MPAL cases was worse than that of the non-mixed cases (53 ± 10% and 76 ± 2% at 5 years, respectively, P = 0.0075), with a more pronounced difference among B lineage cases. The small numbers of MPAL cases treated as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or as acute myeloid leukemia hampered separate statistics. We compared prognosis of all subsets with the prognosis of previously published cohorts.

Conclusions

Simple immunophenotypic criteria are useful for therapy decisions in MPAL. In B lineage leukemia, MPAL confers poorer prognosis. However, our data do not justify a preferential use of current acute myeloid leukemia-based therapy in MPAL.

### Acute myeloid leukemia, version 3.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111CXHbW]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Principles of acute myeloid leukemia treatment — treatment of acute leukemia has historically been divided into induction chemotherapy and postremission (eg, consolidation) therapy. In patients fit for intensive induction therapy, strategies for consolidation are based on the potential risk of relapse, with cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities the most significant prognostic indicators; however, failure to achieve remission after 1 cycle of induction therapy or high tumor burden, defined as a WBC count ≥ 40 × 10⁹/L, are included as poor-risk factors for long-term remission. Therefore, response is assessed based on BM morphology and cytogenetic and molecular responses taken at several points during the course of treatment, and the use of flow cytometry and/or molecular methods to assess MRD is emerging as a novel determinant to assess the depth of therapeutic response at the time of morphologic remission in patients with AML.

In conclusion, recent years have seen improvements in the outcomes of AML patients. However, relapsed AML is still very challenging to treat, with poor outcomes regardless of the type of salvage therapy. We identified demonstrable clonal changes between diagnosis and relapse, emphasizing the importance of performing cytogenetic and molecular testing at relapse. Developing more effective frontline treatments, improving accessibility to alloSCT, as well as maintenance strategies are necessary to reduce rates of disease recurrence.

### Mixed phenotype / lineage leukemia: has anything changed for 2021 on diagnosis, classification, and treatment? [^111kBccZ]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose of Review

Recent advances in the small field of the rare mixed phenotype acute leukemias (MPAL) are presented focusing on a better understanding of their pathophysiology and search for better therapeutic approaches.

Recent Findings

Three aspects of respective classification, therapy, and immunophenotype of MPAL are reviewed. New proposals have been made to segregate MPAL subtypes based on their genomic landscape. In parallel, it was found that a large array of therapeutic approaches has been tested in the past few years with increasingly good results. Finally, we explored the use of unsupervised flow cytometry analysis to dissect subtle variations in markers expression to better characterize the variegating aspect of MPALs.

Summary

Genomic and immunophenotypic aspects more clearly link MPAL subtypes with bona fide acute myeloblastic of lymphoblastic leukemias. This is likely to impact therapeutic strategies, towards a better management and outcome.

### Notch signaling in acute lymphoblastic leukemia: any role for stromal microenvironment? [^116gT5xU]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Notch signaling pathway regulates many different events of embryonic and adult development; among them, Notch plays an essential role in the onset of hematopoietic stem cells and influences multiple maturation steps of developing lymphoid and myeloid cells. Deregulation of Notch signaling determines several human disorders, including cancer. In the last decade it became evident that Notch signaling plays pivotal roles in the onset and development of T- and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia by regulating the intracellular molecular pathways involved in leukemia cell survival and proliferation. On the other hand, bone marrow stromal cells are equally necessary for leukemia cell survival by preventing blast cell apoptosis and favoring their reciprocal interactions and cross-talk with bone marrow microenvironment. Quite surprisingly, the link between Notch signaling pathway and bone marrow stromal cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemia has been pointed out only recently. In fact, bone marrow stromal cells express Notch receptors and ligands, through which they can interact with and influence normal and leukemia T- and B-cell survival. Here, the data concerning the development of T- and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia has been critically reviewed in light of the most recent findings on Notch signaling in stromal microenvironment.

### Precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia-a global view [^112uk6GJ]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

As haematologists, we always seek to follow standardised guidelines for practice and apply the best treatment within our means for our patients with blood diseases. However, treatment can never follow an exact recipe. Opinions differ as to the best approach; sometimes more than one treatment approach results in identical outcomes, or treatments differ only by the manner in which they fail. Furthermore, the haematologist is faced with constraints relating to the local economic environment. Patients too are not the same the world over. Early presentation is commoner in the developed world, as is the patient's understanding of the disease process. This in turn has an impact on the way patients are managed, the rigorousness of patient adhesion to the treatment schedule and the outcome. Here we take a look at the precursor B‐cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in an adolescent in a range of different settings from low‐ to high income countries with widely differing challenges for diagnosis, therpy and follow‐up. For these reasons, given the same starting conditions, patients will be treated differently according to the institute and the country they are in. Experts from around the world have been tasked to describe their management plan and rationale for a specific disease presentation. Here they explore the management of precursor B‐cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (pre‐B ALL) in five different institutions worldwide with a focus on those with more or less strained economies. We end with a conclusion from an expert in the field comparing and contrasting these different management styles and considering their merits and limitations.

### Defining minimal residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia: which platforms are ready for "prime time"? [^113iXZ16]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

The past 40 years have witnessed major advances in defining the cytogenetic aberrations, mutational landscape, epigenetic profiles, and expression changes underlying hematological malignancies. Although it has become apparent that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is highly heterogeneous at the molecular level, the standard framework for risk stratification guiding transplant practice in this disease remains largely based on pretreatment assessment of cytogenetics and a limited panel of molecular genetic markers, coupled with morphological assessment of bone marrow (BM) blast percentage after induction. However, application of more objective methodology such as multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) has highlighted the limitations of morphology for reliable determination of remission status. Moreover, there is a growing body of evidence that detection of subclinical levels of leukemia (ie, minimal residual disease, MRD) using MFC or molecular-based approaches provides powerful independent prognostic information. Consequently, there is increasing interest in the use of MRD detection to provide early end points in clinical trials and to inform patient management. However, implementation of MRD assessment into clinical practice remains a major challenge, hampered by differences in the assays and preferred analytical methods employed between routine laboratories. Although this should be addressed through adoption of standardized assays with external quality control, it is clear that the molecular heterogeneity of AML coupled with increasing understanding of its clonal architecture dictates that a "one size fits all" approach to MRD detection in this disease is not feasible. However, with the range of platforms now available, there is considerable scope to realistically track treatment response in every patient.

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) remains a leading cause of non-traumatic death in children, and the majority of adults diagnosed will succumb to the disease. Recent advances in molecular biology and bioinformatics have enabled more detailed genomic analysis and a better understanding of the molecular biology of ALL. A number of recurrent genomic drivers have recently been described, which not only aid in diagnosis and prognostication, but also may offer opportunities for specific therapeutic targeting. The present review summarises B-ALL genomic pathology at diagnosis, including lesions detectable using traditional cytogenetic methods as well as those detected only through advanced molecular techniques.

### B / T mixed phenotype acute leukemia revealing immunophenotypic lineage-genotype associations and frequent myelodysplasia-related cytogenetic / gene abnormalities: implication for diagnosis and treatment [^116BoRWs]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

B/T mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) is a rare subtype of leukemia with diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to its rarity, genomic diversity, and evolving diagnostic criteria. We report six cases of B/T MPAL with clinicopathological and genomic characterization. Most cases (5/6) demonstrated immunophenotypic/lineage-genotype-associations, i.e. T-lineage predominant B/T MPAL with T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) genotype whereas B/T-lineage codominant B/T MPAL with combined T-ALL/B-ALL genotype. Furthermore, most patients (5/6) carried myelodysplasia-related (MR) cytogenetic-gene-alterations [MR-CG-Gene, as defined in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-MR (AML-MR)], harboring ALL-genotype, and responded well to ALL-based induction regimens. These findings indicate that B/T MPAL with MR-CG-Gene is more appropriately diagnosed as MPAL rather than AML-MR. Our study is the first to demonstrate immunophenotypic lineage-genotype associations and frequent MR-CG-Gene in B/T MPAL and advocate more studies to refine diagnostic criteria.

The last 4 decades have seen major advances in understanding the genetic basis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and substantial improvements in survival of children and young adults with the disease. A key step forward was the discovery that AML cells harbor recurring cytogenetic abnormalities. The identification of the genes involved in chromosomal rearrangements has provided insights into the regulation of normal hematopoiesis and how disruption of key transcription factors and epigenetic modulators promote leukemic transformation. Cytogenetics has been widely adopted to provide the framework for development of risk-stratified treatment approaches to patient management.

### TIM3, a human acute myeloid leukemia stem cell marker, does not enrich for leukemia-initiating stem cells in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^111FjMda]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

We report here that, in contrast to what has been shown in AML, TIM3 does not represent a stem cell marker capable of prospectively isolating LIC in either high-risk KMT2A - AFF1 + and low/standard-risk ETV6 - RUNX1 + B-cell ALL. All individual high-risk and standard-risk leukemic primary BM samples engrafted in NSG mice even at very low doses, validating this immunodeficient mouse model to functionally assess for candidate human leukemia stem cell populations. Furthermore, our intra-BM transplantation assay provides a highly sensitive and specific assay for interrogating LIC in acute leukemia because it overcomes potential survival and BM homing intrinsic deficiencies of transplanted cells. These findings are in line with previous reports and reinforce that distinct immunophenotypically defined B-cell ALL blast populations, even at different maturation stages, have stem cell properties, reinforcing that some hematopoietic malignancies (as for AML and other myeloid neoplasms) are maintained by a rare population of LIC (hierarchical model) whereas in B-cell ALL most of the blasts possess "stemness" features (stochastic model) being capable of initiating and recapitulating the disease in vivo. Further work is needed to understand the role of, and alteration in, the expression of the immune checkpoint receptor TIM3 in blasts patients with acute leukemia, especially for rationalizing and interpreting current clinical trials testing TIM3 inhibitors in relapsing/refractory AML and myelodysplastic syndrome patients.

### Applicability of 2022 classifications of acute myeloid leukemia in the real-world setting [^111cMRG3]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The increasing knowledge of molecular genetics of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) necessitated the update of previous diagnostic and prognostic schemes, which resulted in the development of the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Consensus Classification (ICC), and the new European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations in 2022. We aimed to provide a real-world application of the new models, unravel differences and similarities, and test their implementation in clinical AML diagnosis. A total of 1001 patients diagnosed with AML were reclassified based on the new schemes. The overall diagnostic changes between the WHO 2016 and the WHO 2022 and ICC classifications were 22.8% and 23.7%, respectively, with a 13.1% difference in patients' distribution between ICC and WHO 2022. The 2022 ICC "not otherwise specified" and WHO "defined by differentiation" AML category sizes shrank when compared with that in WHO 2016 (24.1% and 26.8% respectively, vs 38.7%), particularly because of an expansion of the myelodysplasia (MDS)-related group. Of 397 patients with a MDS-related AML according to the ICC, 55.9% were defined by the presence of a MDS-related karyotype. The overall restratification between ELN 2017 and ELN 2022 was 12.9%. The 2022 AML classifications led to a significant improvement of diagnostic schemes. In the real-world setting, conventional cytogenetics, usually rapidly available and less expensive than molecular characterization, stratified 56% of secondary AML, still maintaining a powerful diagnostic role. Considering the similarities between WHO and ICC diagnostic schemes, a tentative scheme to generate a unified model is desirable.

Despite several recommendations for standardization of multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) the number, specificity and combinations of reagents used by diagnostic laboratories for the diagnosis and classification of acute leukemias (AL) are still very diverse. Furthermore, the current diagnostic interpretation of flow cytometry readouts is influenced arbitrarily by individual experience and knowledge. We determined the potential value of a minimal four-color combination panel of 13 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with a CD45/sideward light scatter-gating strategy for a standardized MFC immunophenotyping of the clinically most relevant subgroups of AL. Bone marrow samples from 155 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 79), B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL, n = 29), T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL, n = 12) and normal bone marrow donors (NBMD, n = 35) were analyzed. A knowledge-based learning algorithm was generated by comparing the results of the minimal panel with the actual diagnosis, using discriminative function analysis. Correct classification of the test sample according to lineage, that is, BCP-ALL, T-ALL, AML and differentiation of NBMD was achieved in 97.2% of all cases with only six of the originally applied 13 mAbs of the panel. This provides evidence that discriminant function analysis can be utilized as a decision support system for interpretation of flow cytometry readouts.

### Association of race / ethnicity with innate immune tumor microenvironment of children with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^113LDLC2]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a leading cause of cancer in children. Prior studies have shown that racial and ethnic background has strong association with survival of children with B-ALL, with worse outcomes in Hispanic (H) and black (B) children compared with their non-Hispanic white (NHW) counterparts. Several factors such as socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, treatment compliance, differences in tumor genetics, response to chemotherapy, genetic polymorphisms, and tumor genetics have been studied to understand these differences. However, there remains an unmet need to better understand the potential biological associations of racial/ethnic background and address these disparities.

Immune-based approaches have begun to transform the therapeutic landscape in childhood cancer including B-ALL. Recent studies have identified several alterations in the immune microenvironment of children with B-ALL. These differences include changes in both T cells (such as loss of naïve T cells and increase in terminal effector T cells), and innate immune cells, such as NK and myeloid cells. Some of these differences have been correlated with underlying disease risk and outcome in children with B-ALL. Properties of the immune microenvironment are also expected to impact outcomes with the emerging application of immune-based therapies in these patients. However, children from non-white background have been under-represented in prior analyses of immune microenvironment and clinical trials testing novel immune therapies in B-ALL. Whether race/ethnicity impacts the properties of immune microenvironment in these children may benefit from application of high-dimensional single-cell approaches.

### Flow cytometry evaluation of acute myeloid leukemia minimal residual disease based on an understanding of the normal maturation patterns in the blast compartments [^116PoR2t]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Detection of minimal/measurable disease (MRD) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is critical for both clinical decision-making and prognostication, yet remains a challenge. Flow cytometry is a well-established method for MRD detection. Flow cytometric (FC) evaluation of MRD must consider a complex maturational pattern of normal hematopoietic development to separate normal from abnormal progenitors. Here, we offer an example of an interpretive approach based on a thorough understanding of stage- and lineage-specific hematopoietic maturation.

Methods

We provide a comprehensive overview of blast maturation from early precursors (hematopoietic stem cells) to committed late-stage unilineage progenitors and commonly observed stage-specific abnormalities based on cases we have encountered in practice. We emphasize the importance of stage-specific comparisons for accurate MRD detection by flow cytometry.

Results

The AML blasts almost invariably show abnormal phenotypes, and the phenotypes may evolve upon therapy. The detected phenotypes are necessarily confined to the target antigens included in the panel. It is therefore critical to evaluate a range of antigens to establish a specific stage/state of lineage commitment and detect potential common abnormalities. Moreover, enough cells must be acquired to allow for the detection of MRD at desired levels. Significant technical and analytical validation is critical.

Conclusions

Flow cytometry offers a powerful single-cell-based platform for MRD detection in AML, and the results have been proven critical for disease management. Leukemia-associated phenotype-informed difference from the normal approach presented in this review presents an analytical framework for sensitive and accurate MRD detection.

### Mutations in AML: prognostic and therapeutic implications [^116egcCN]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous hematologic malignancy characterized by the proliferation and aberrant differentiation of immature clonal myeloid cells. The prognosis of AML is variable, based on clinical features such as patient age, performance status, and comorbidities, as well as leukemia-specific genetic features including cytogenetics and molecular classification. The modern application of next-generation sequencing technology has uncovered marked heterogeneity and genomic complexity within AML, based on the presence or absence of cooperating mutations within functional categories such as epigenetic regulators, cell signaling and proliferation pathways, and master hematopoietic transcription factors. Although the treatment of AML has hitherto changed little in the past 40 years, the enhanced scientific understanding of AML pathophysiology and leukemogenesis has led to the recent development of multiple targeted and selective treatment approaches, and our increasing awareness of functional AML subsets will be evermore used to inform rational and personalized treatment strategies.

Discussion

In this study, we performed targeted single-cell sequencing on 1507 single cells isolated from the BM of four childhood T-ALL patients. We detected up to four leukemia cell clusters at diagnosis with the dominant cluster comprising 28–94% of all cells. Our data is in line with observations for B-ALL and AML, for which a similar level of heterogeneity was described. We detected a stepwise hierarchy between the clusters in the T-ALL samples. This result corresponds with evidence found in multiple myeloma, where early ancestor clones were also detectable at diagnosis. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing suggests that T-ALL cells are also highly similar at the gene expression level. The limited heterogeneity detected in our childhood T-ALL cases may have important implications for treatment, as tumor heterogeneity could influence the risk for relapse. Larger studies that include temporal/spatial data will be needed to obtain a more complete view on the heterogeneity of T-ALL at diagnosis and during treatment, and to determine if the degree of heterogeneity has prognostic value.

Importantly, by performing targeted sequencing on single CD34 + CD38 − multipotent progenitor cells, we gained insight in the cell of origin of T-ALL. We compared sequence data from single CD34 + CD38 − multipotent progenitor cells at diagnosis and at remission and compared these findings with mutations found in bulk myeloid progenitor cells isolated from the diagnostic samples. In two patients, we could detect most of the known oncogenic mutations in CD34 + CD38 − multipotent progenitor cells and in myeloid progenitors, providing evidence that mutations in some T-ALL patients start to accumulate in multipotent progenitor/stem cells. After treatment, these events were no longer detectable in CD34 + CD38 − progenitors, which is in line with long-term remissions for childhood T-ALL patients. These observations also recapitulate the importance of performing allogeneic stem cell transplantations for high-risk ALL patients. Autologous stem cell transplantation may indeed lead to relapse, in case the highly mutated multipotent progenitor cells are not eradicated before the procedure.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^111kEpNp]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma constitute a family of genetically heterogeneous lymphoid neoplasms derived from B- and T-lymphoid progenitors. Diagnosis is based on morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features that allow differentiation from normal progenitors and other hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic neoplasms. Current intensive chemotherapy regimens have accomplished overall cure rates of 85% to 90% in children and 40% to 50% in adults, with outcomes depending on the genetic subtype of disease and clinical features at presentation. Therapy is optimized using minimal residual disease studies that employ flow cytometric and molecular methodologies, and are important determinants of prognosis. Genetic analyses currently underway are likely to provide insight into biology, mechanisms of relapse, pharmacogenetics, and new potential therapeutic targets, which should aid in further improvement of outcome in this disease.

Selectively for T-lymphoblasts

One intriguing feature of nelarabine and ara-G is their apparent selectivity for inhibiting the proliferation of T-lineage cells. As discussed above, this property underpins the development of this therapy for treatment of T-cell malignancies, and was first documented in a series of independent studies in the early 1980's comparing dGuo and ara-G. Using incorporation of labeled DNA precursor 3 H-thymidine as a proxy for measuring cell viability in a small collection of leukemic cell lines, both dGuo and ara-G could selectively inhibit 3 H-thymidine incorporation, and thereby DNA synthesis, in T- over non-T leukemic cell lines. In accordance, T-leukemic cells accumulated high levels of the triphosphate metabolite which was not observed in B-leukemic cells, and further underscoring therapeutic potential, ara-G was shown to inhibit 3 H-thymidine incorporation into leukemic cells from three T-ALL patients ex vivo. Shortly after, using B- and T-leukemic cell lines derived from the same patient, and a different experimental approach, these findings were independently validated. Subsequently, it was observed that whilst phosphorylation of ara-G (i.e. activation) in another T- and B-leukemic cell line was comparable, the B-leukemic cell line degraded the triphosphate whilst the T-leukemic cell line did not, indicating slow or absent catabolism of the active metabolite in malignant T-cells may be the explanation for differential sensitivity. This selective catabolism in B-leukemic cells was not observed (as strongly) with other arabinose nucleoside analogs (ara-C, F-ara-A, and ara-A), which was consistent with little/weak selectivity for these nucleosides for T- over B-leukemic cell lines when tested in a larger panel of 8 lines in total. A subsequent study comparing ara-C and ara-G in different leukemia types ex vivo showed selectivity of ara-G for T-ALL over chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) which was consistent with selective accumulation of ara-GTP, indicating the results previously obtained in cell lines was representative of freshly isolated leukemic cells also. Furthermore, a later study using an expanded panel of 96 diagnostic pediatric leukemia patient samples also observed selectivity for T-ALL. This selectivity of ara-G for T-lineage cells has also been confirmed outside the context of leukemia treatment, for instance, in the utility of ara-G based PET probes for specifically visualizing T-cells.

### Distinct patterns of hematopoietic stem cell involvement in acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^115r3Wvf]. Nature Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

The cellular targets of primary mutations and malignant transformation remain elusive in most cancers. Here, we show that clinically and genetically different subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) originate and transform at distinct stages of hematopoietic development. Primary ETV6-RUNX1 (also known as TEL-AML1) fusions and subsequent leukemic transformations were targeted to committed B-cell progenitors. Major breakpoint BCR-ABL1 fusions (encoding P210 BCR-ABL1) originated in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), whereas minor BCR-ABL1 fusions (encoding P190 BCR-ABL1) had a B-cell progenitor origin, suggesting that P190 and P210 BCR-ABL1 ALLs represent largely distinct tumor biological and clinical entities. The transformed leukemia-initiating stem cells in both P190 and P210 BCR-ABL1 ALLs had, as in ETV6-RUNX1 ALLs, a committed B progenitor phenotype. In all patients, normal and leukemic repopulating stem cells could successfully be separated prospectively, and notably, the size of the normal HSC compartment in ETV6-RUNX1 and P190 BCR-ABL1 ALLs was found to be unaffected by the expansive leukemic stem cell population.

### Single-cell transcriptomics reveals a distinct developmental state of KMT2A-rearranged infant B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^112qe6DC]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

KMT2A-rearranged infant ALL is an aggressive childhood leukemia with poor prognosis. Here, we investigated the developmental state of KMT2A-rearranged infant B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) using bulk messenger RNA (mRNA) meta-analysis and examination of single lymphoblast transcriptomes against a developing bone marrow reference. KMT2A-rearranged infant B-ALL was uniquely dominated by an early lymphocyte precursor (ELP) state, whereas less adverse NUTM1-rearranged infant ALL demonstrated signals of later developing B cells, in line with most other childhood B-ALLs. We compared infant lymphoblasts with ELP cells and revealed that the cancer harbored hybrid myeloid-lymphoid features, including nonphysiological antigen combinations potentially targetable to achieve cancer specificity. We validated surface coexpression of exemplar combinations by flow cytometry. Through analysis of shared mutations in separate leukemias from a child with infant KMT2A-rearranged B-ALL relapsing as AML, we established that KMT2A rearrangement occurred in very early development, before hematopoietic specification, emphasizing that cell of origin cannot be inferred from the transcriptional state.

*TAM is also called transient myeloproliferative disorder or transient leukemia. The TAM observed in infants with Down syndrome represents a clonal expansion of myeloblasts with GATA1*variants in the setting of a coexisting trisomy 21 that can be difficult to distinguish from AML. Most importantly, TAM spontaneously regresses within the first 3 months of life in most cases. Acute promyelocytic leukemia. APL is a distinct subtype of AML and occurs in about 7% of children with AML. Several factors that make APL unique include the following:

- Clinical presentation of universal coagulopathy and unique morphological characteristics.
- Unique molecular etiology as a result of the involvement of the. The major subtypes of AML include the following: M0: Acute myeloblastic leukemia without differentiation.

M0 AML, also referred to as minimally differentiated AML, does not express myeloperoxidase at the light microscopy level but may show characteristic granules by electron microscopy. M0 AML can be defined by expression of cluster determinant markers such as CD13, CD33, and CD117 in the absence of lymphoid differentiation. Histochemical evaluation It is critical to distinguish AML from acute lymphoblastic leukemia because the treatment for children with AML differs significantly from that for ALL. Special histochemical stains performed on bone marrow specimens of children with acute leukemia can be helpful to confirm their diagnosis. The stains most commonly used and variably positive in AML include myeloperoxidase, nonspecific esterases, and Sudan Black B, whereas periodic acid-Schiff is usually positive in ALL, M6 AML, and, occasionally, M4 and M5 FAB subtypes.

Lineage-associated B-lymphocytic antigens CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, and CD24 may be present in 10% to 20% of AML cases, but monoclonal surface immunoglobulin and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin heavy chains are usually absent. Similarly, lineage-associated T-lymphocytic antigens CD2, CD3, CD5, and CD7 are present in 20% to 40% of AML cases. [.

Anatomy Childhood ALL originates in the T and B lymphoblasts in tissues with hematopoietic progenitor cells, such as the bone marrow and thymus. Marrow involvement of acute leukemia as seen by light microscopy is defined as follows:

- **M1**: Fewer than 5% blast cells.
- **M2**: 5% to 25% blast cells.
- M3: Greater than 25% blast cells. Almost all patients with ALL present with an M3 marrow. 38, 39] CRLF2 genomic alterations are observed at a much lower frequency in children with B-ALL who do not have Down syndrome; when they do occur, they are more often associated with the BCR:: ABL1-like subtype. In one retrospective study, the frequency of CRLF2 rearrangements was nine times higher in children with Down syndrome and ALL than in children with ALL but without Down syndrome but not B-ALL. The risk allele was shown to be associated with reduced USP7transcription, which is consistent with the finding that somatic loss-of-function variants in USP7are observed in patients with T-ALL. USP7germline and somatic variants are generally mutually exclusive and are most commonly observed in T-ALL patients with TAL1alterations. Genetic risk factors that have similar impact for developing both B-ALL and T-ALL include CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and 8q24.

Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes. It usually gets worse quickly and needs rapid treatment. Some recent research includes: Combining less-toxic therapies The intensive chemotherapy treatments used for ALL have serious side effects that many older patients cannot tolerate. Targeted therapies may have fewer side effects than chemotherapy. Clinical trials are now testing whether combinations of these types of therapies can be used instead of chemotherapy for older patients with a form of ALL called B-cell ALL. Immunotherapy Immunotherapies are treatments that help the body's immune system fight cancer more effectively. Immunotherapy strategies being used or tested in ALL include:

Once such BiTE, called blinatumomab, was recently shown to improve survival for people with ALL who are in remission after chemotherapy, even when there is no trace of their disease. In 2024, FDA approved blinatumomab for adult and pediatric patients one month and older with a specific type of B-cell precursor ALL. The approval is for use as part of consolidation chemotherapy, which is treatment that is given after cancer has disappeared following initial therapy. Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment Acute myeloid leukemia is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. It can cause a buildup of abnormal red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^115nbNfi]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Anatomy ALL presumably arises from malignant transformation of B- or T-cell progenitor cells. It is more commonly seen in children but can occur at any age. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of lymphoblasts in the marrow or in various extramedullary sites, frequently accompanied by suppression of normal hematopoiesis. B- and T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cells express surface antigens that parallel their respective lineage developments. Precursor B-cell ALL cells typically express CD10, CD19, and CD34 on their surface, along with nuclear terminal deoxynucleotide transferase, while precursor T-cell ALL cells commonly express CD2, CD3, CD7, CD34, and TdT. A bone marrow biopsy and aspirate are routinely performed even in T-cell ALL to determine the extent of marrow involvement. Malignant cells should be sent for conventional cytogenetic studies, as detection of the Ph t.

About 95% of all types of ALL have elevated terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase expression. This elevation is extremely useful in diagnosis; if concentrations of the enzyme are not elevated, the diagnosis of ALL is suspect. However, 20% of cases of AML may express TdT; therefore, its usefulness as a lineage marker is limited. Because Burkitt leukemias are managed according to different treatment algorithms, it is important to specifically identify these cases prospectively by their L3 morphology, absence of TdT, and expression of surface immunoglobulin. Patients with Burkitt leukemias will typically have one of the following three chromosomal translocations:

- t.
- t.
- t. Special Considerations for B-Cell and T-Cell ALL Two additional subtypes of ALL require special consideration.

B-cell ALL, which expresses surface immunoglobulin and cytogenetic abnormalities such as t, t, and t, is not usually cured with typical ALL regimens. Aggressive, brief-duration, high-intensity regimens, including those previously used in CLB-9251, that are similar to those used in aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma have shown high response rates and cure rates.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia… [^111bmfY1]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then one of three types of lymphocytes:

- B lymphocytes, which make antibodies to help fight infection
- T lymphocytes, which help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection
- natural killer cells, which attack cancer cells and viruses. ALL occurs because too many stem cells become lymphoblasts that do not mature into B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. These cells are also called leukemia cells. Leukemia cells are not able to fight infection very well. Also, as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells. This may lead to anemia, easy bleeding, and infection. ALL usually worsens quickly if it is not treated.
- **Blinatumomab**: Blinatumomab works by bringing healthy T cells and leukemia cells close together so the T cells can more effectively kill the leukemia. It does this by binding to a protein called CD3 on healthy T cells and a protein called CD19 on B cells. Blinatumomab is a type of targeted therapy drug called a bispecific T-cell engager.
- **CAR T-cell therapy**: This treatment changes the patient's T-cells so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells.

CAR T-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of childhood ALL that has relapsed a second time. Treatment of T-cell childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia Treatment of newly diagnosed T-cell childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia during the remission induction, consolidation/intensification, and maintenance phases always includes combination chemotherapy. Children with T-ALL are given more anticancer drugs and higher doses of anticancer drugs than children in the newly diagnosed standard-risk group.
