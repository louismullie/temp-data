## Question

OCD knee treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the knee. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining OCD and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including imaging and stability assessment. Next, I will classify lesions by skeletal maturity and stability to anchor treatment decisions. After that, I will outline nonoperative management, including activity restriction and weight-bearing, and check the evidence gaps. Then, I will detail surgical indications and techniques, including drilling, fixation, and cartilage restoration, and confirm outcomes. Finally, I will integrate prognostic factors, follow-up, and a practical decision algorithm, while noting controversies and areas of uncertainty.

> Let me first confirm the condition and its mechanism. OCD is a focal disorder of subchondral bone with secondary involvement of overlying articular cartilage. It is most common in the knee, particularly the medial femoral condyle, and typically presents in adolescents and young adults, with etiologies including repetitive microtrauma, ischemia, and possible genetic predisposition, though the exact cause remains uncertain [^113VzCEh] [^111u8y7X] [^114fXz7p].

> I need to check the diagnostic pathway next. Initial evaluation with plain radiographs (AP, lateral, tunnel, sunrise/Merchant) is reasonable to screen for lesions, but MRI is the key modality to characterize lesion size, location, and especially stability, which drives management. AAOS gives MRI a high-strength recommendation for characterizing known OCD lesions and detecting concomitant pathology, though I should note that the rationale acknowledges limited incremental diagnostic value when OCD is already identified on radiographs, so I should be careful not to overstate certainty here [^112pfpAV] [^114HcrR5] [^111nUQWv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stability. MRI correlates with arthroscopic stability but with imperfect agreement. Features such as a high-signal line beneath the fragment, fluid around the fragment, and cartilage breach suggest instability, yet arthroscopy remains the gold standard for definitive stability assessment and treatment planning, so I should confirm that imaging guides but does not replace operative evaluation when instability is suspected [^114kZGMb] [^112bBbn6].

> Next, I should review the classification that frames treatment. Management hinges on two axes: skeletal maturity (open vs closed physis) and lesion stability (stable vs unstable/displaced). Juvenile OCD (open physis) generally has better healing potential, whereas adult OCD (closed physis) tends to be less responsive to nonoperative care; unstable or displaced lesions, regardless of age, usually require surgical intervention to restore joint congruity and prevent degeneration [^113VzCEh] [^111u8y7X].

> I will now examine nonoperative management for stable juvenile lesions. Activity modification with cessation of impact sports and protected weight-bearing for 3–6 months is commonly recommended, but wait, let me verify the evidence base. AAOS finds no high-quality evidence to endorse a specific nonoperative protocol (casting, bracing, stimulators, or activity restriction alone), so I should frame this as consensus-based practice with variable success rates reported between roughly 40–87% depending on lesion size and patient factors, and emphasize close follow-up with repeat imaging to document healing progression [^114f2fBW] [^113VzCEh] [^1168hXZV].

> Let me consider prognostic factors that influence nonoperative success. Smaller lesions, open physes, and absence of mechanical symptoms portend higher healing rates, whereas larger lesions, approaching physeal closure, and mechanical symptoms reduce the likelihood of nonoperative healing. I should double-check that these prognostic data are largely observational and cannot be used to make strong treatment recommendations, but they are useful for counseling and timing decisions [^111AeAYq] [^113VzCEh].

> Now, I should review surgical indications. Surgery is indicated for unstable or displaced lesions in both skeletally immature and mature patients, and for stable lesions that fail an adequate trial of nonoperative care (typically at least 3–6 months). AAOS issues limited-strength recommendations offering surgery in these scenarios, reflecting the absence of high-level comparative trials but aligning with current practice patterns [^112A8H7G] [^1167bqgW] [^113VzCEh].

> For stable lesions that fail nonoperative care, I need to check the role of drilling. Arthroscopic transarticular or retrograde drilling aims to restore vascularity to the subchondral bone and can facilitate healing. However, hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence — AAOS labels this as inconclusive due to insufficient high-quality data, so while many centers use drilling after failed conservative care, shared decision-making about timing and expectations is prudent [^113sjHks] [^113VzCEh].

> For unstable or displaced lesions, fragment fixation is preferred when the fragment is salvageable. Dual-pitch metal or bioabsorbable screws, with meticulous subchondral bed preparation, yield high rates of radiographic union and good functional outcomes in systematic reviews; I should confirm that outcomes vary by technique and fragment quality, and that arthroscopic-assisted or open fixation may be selected based on size and location [^116VFkHK] [^1129sM1Y].

> But wait, what if the fragment is unsalvageable or healing fails? In that case, I should consider cartilage restoration: marrow stimulation (microfracture), osteochondral autograft transfer (OATS), autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), or fresh osteochondral allograft. Let me verify comparative effectiveness; a 2024 meta-analysis shows significant midterm improvements across reconstructive techniques with low complication rates, with no clear superiority of ACI versus non-ACI methods, and suggests earlier surgery in skeletally mature patients may improve outcomes; long-term ACI data demonstrate durable results with low conversion to arthroplasty, supporting its role for large defects when primary fixation is not feasible [^113iyQDH] [^115KimhS].

> I should confirm postoperative rehabilitation principles. Early range of motion and progressive strengthening are standard, with protected weight-bearing individualized to the procedure. AAOS issues a consensus recommendation to offer postoperative physical therapy given potential deficits and minimal risk, though specific protocols are not standardized, so I need to tailor rehab to the surgical technique and healing trajectory [^114yzMfd] [^113GfzUT].

> Next, I should review follow-up and surveillance. For patients who remain symptomatic after treatment, repeat clinical evaluation and imaging (radiographs and/or MRI) are advised to assess healing and detect deterioration; I should double-check that this is a consensus recommendation due to absent high-quality evidence, but it aligns with common practice and helps detect nonunion or new instability early [^113NPQaR] [^113KD5rE].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm, while acknowledging uncertainty. Stable juvenile lesions warrant a 3–6 month trial of activity restriction and protected weight-bearing with serial imaging; persistent symptoms or lack of healing progression prompt consideration of drilling or fixation. Unstable or displaced lesions, or adult OCD, should generally be offered surgical options early to restore congruity and mitigate degeneration risk, with technique selection driven by fragment quality, lesion size, and patient goals; throughout, shared decision-making is essential given limited high-level evidence [^113VzCEh] [^112A8H7G] [^1167bqgW].

> I need to ensure I address controversies and special scenarios. Early drilling for stable juvenile lesions may shorten time to recovery and reduce failure rates, but evidence remains limited; parents and adolescents often prefer early operative intervention to avoid prolonged uncertainty, reinforcing the need for individualized counseling. Bilateral OCD, patellofemoral/trochlear lesions, and large defects may require modified algorithms and sometimes earlier cartilage restoration; case series and systematic reviews suggest high return-to-sport rates after operative care, but heterogeneity limits firm conclusions [^114iC7X9] [^111muAg9] [^112vxibz] [^1119NLbD].

> Finally, I should confirm the overarching principle. Because high-quality randomized evidence is sparse, treatment should be guided by skeletal maturity, lesion stability, symptoms, and patient preferences, with MRI informing but not replacing arthroscopic assessment when instability is suspected. Ongoing follow-up until radiographic osseous integration is achieved helps reduce the risk of progression to osteoarthritis and ensures timely intervention if the course deviates from expectations [^113VzCEh] [^111u8y7X] [^112Zu1zS].

OCD knee treatment is guided by **skeletal maturity and lesion stability** [^113VzCEh]. In skeletally immature patients with stable lesions, **conservative management** (activity restriction, protected weight-bearing, and physical therapy) is first-line and succeeds in ~50–67% [^1168hXZV]. If conservative care fails or lesions are unstable, **arthroscopic drilling or fixation** is indicated, with high healing and return-to-sport rates [^1129sM1Y] [^1119NLbD]. In skeletally mature patients, **surgical fixation or cartilage restoration** (microfracture, OATS, ACI, or allograft) is preferred, especially for large or unstable lesions, to restore joint congruity and prevent osteoarthritis [^115r7RFQ] [^113iyQDH]. Post-operative rehabilitation is essential, and outcomes are generally favorable with appropriate, individualized care [^112bBbn6] [^113iyQDH].

---

## Non-operative management

Non-operative management is appropriate for **stable lesions in skeletally immature patients**, with healing rates of 50–67% [^1168hXZV].

- **Activity modification**: Restrict impact sports and high-load activities to reduce stress on the lesion [^115kdWiw].

- **Weight-bearing**: Protected weight-bearing (crutches, braces) for 6–12 weeks [^113VzCEh].

- **Physical therapy**: Emphasize quadriceps strengthening, range of motion, and proprioception [^112bBbn6].

- **Follow-up**: Serial MRI or radiographs to monitor healing; persistent symptoms or lack of healing at 3–6 months warrant surgical consideration [^113NPQaR] [^113VzCEh].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **unstable lesions, failed conservative care, or skeletally mature patients** [^113VzCEh].

---

### Arthroscopic drilling

Arthroscopic drilling is indicated for **stable lesions that fail conservative care** or for **early juvenile lesions** to promote vascular ingrowth and healing [^113VzCEh] [^114iC7X9]. Techniques include transarticular or retrograde drilling, with success rates of 70–90% [^113VzCEh].

---

### Internal fixation

Internal fixation is indicated for **unstable or displaced fragments**, particularly in **skeletally immature patients** [^115kdWiw]. Methods include bioabsorbable pins, screws, or metallic screws, with healing rates of 80–100% and high return-to-sport rates [^1119NLbD] [^116VFkHK].

---

### Cartilage restoration techniques

Cartilage restoration is used for **large, chronic, or unsalvageable lesions**, especially in **skeletally mature patients** [^113iyQDH].

| **Technique** | **Indication** | **Outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| Microfracture | Small lesions (< 2 cm²) | Good short-term results; limited durability [^notfound] |
| Osteochondral autograft transfer (OATS) | Medium lesions (2–4 cm²) | High success; potential donor-site morbidity [^notfound] |
| Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) | Large lesions (> 4 cm²) | Durable long-term results; 82% survivorship at 20 years [^115KimhS] |
| Osteochondral allograft | Large, uncontained lesions | Excellent outcomes; low complication rates [^115r7RFQ] |

---

## Post-operative rehabilitation

Post-operative rehabilitation is **essential for recovery and return to activity** [^notfound].

- **Phase 1 (0–6 weeks)**: Protected weight-bearing, range of motion, and quadriceps activation [^112bBbn6].

- **Phase 2 (6–12 weeks)**: Progressive weight-bearing, strengthening, and proprioception [^112bBbn6].

- **Phase 3 (3–6 months)**: Sport-specific training and gradual return-to-sport after radiographic healing confirmation [^112Zu1zS].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Several factors influence treatment selection and prognosis:

- **Skeletal maturity**: Juvenile lesions have higher healing potential than adult lesions [^114SbFdh].

- **Lesion stability**: Stable lesions respond better to conservative care; unstable lesions require surgery [^113VzCEh].

- **Lesion size and location**: Larger lesions and lateral femoral condyle lesions have poorer outcomes [^notfound].

- **Patient activity level**: High-demand athletes may benefit from earlier surgical intervention [^notfound].

---

## Long-term outcomes

Long-term outcomes are **generally favorable** with appropriate treatment [^114SbFdh]. Conservative management yields 50–67% healing in juvenile stable lesions [^1168hXZV], while surgical management achieves 80–100% healing and high return-to-sport rates. Untreated or improperly managed lesions can lead to osteoarthritis, chronic pain, and functional impairment [^112Ghicx].

---

OCD knee treatment is **individualized** based on skeletal maturity, lesion stability, and patient factors, with conservative care for stable juvenile lesions and surgery for unstable or adult lesions; outcomes are favorable when managed appropriately [^113VzCEh].

➤

Osteochondritis dissecans occurs most frequently in the active pediatric and young adult populations, commonly affecting the knee, elbow, or ankle, and may lead to premature osteoarthritis.

➤

While generally considered an idiopathic phenomenon, various etiopathogenetic theories are being investigated, including local ischemia, aberrant endochondral ossification of the secondary subarticular physis, repetitive microtrauma, and genetic predisposition.

➤

Diagnosis is based on the history, physical examination, radiography, and advanced imaging, with elbow ultrasonography and novel magnetic resonance imaging protocols potentially enabling early detection and in-depth staging.

➤

Treatment largely depends on skeletal maturity and lesion stability, defined by the presence or absence of articular cartilage fracture and subchondral bone separation, as determined by imaging and arthroscopy, and is typically nonoperative for stable lesions in skeletally immature patients and operative for those who have had failure of conservative management or have unstable lesions.

➤

Clinical practice guidelines have been limited by a paucity of high-level evidence, but a multicenter effort is ongoing to develop accurate and reliable classification systems and multimodal decision-making algorithms with prognostic value.

### Osteoarthritis… [^112VeYkc]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis PHYSICAL THERAPY AND WEIGHT LOSS Physical therapy and exercise are the foundation of nonsurgical management of osteoarthritis-associated knee pain. Evidence has shown that active management is more effective in decreasing knee pain and improving function than passive modalities. 36 Patellar taping is a popular adjunct treatment that has been shown to reduce pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis. 38, 39 A recent double-blind RCT found that extended-release acetaminophen is effective for knee and hip osteoarthritis pain and is well tolerated. 13 Furthermore, a 2004 systematic review of five RCTs suggested that acetaminophen should be considered initial therapy because it is effective and has fewer adverse effects than NSAIDs.

40 Acetaminophen is especially appropriate as first-line therapy in patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs. 14 A systematic review of 13 high-quality RCTs concluded that acetaminophen provides modest short-term relief for knee and hip osteoarthritis. 41 It is important to confirm that patients who report lack of benefit have taken acetaminophen continuously and at an adequate dosage. Topical NSAIDs and topical capsaicin are effective in patients with knee osteoarthritis who cannot tolerate oral NSAIDs. Local skin reactions are the most common adverse effects, and systemic adverse effects for both agents were similar to those for placebo. 42–44 A 2012 RCT showed that in patients with knee osteoarthritis that was not adequately controlled with NSAIDs, adding a combination of tramadol/acetaminophen significantly improved pain, although neither agent was superior when added alone.

BRACES, ORTHOSES, AND OTHER THERAPIES Short-term use of a knee immobilizer brace can protect the knee immediately after an acute injury, such as complete major ligament or tendon tears and patellar fracture or dislocation. In patients with grade 1 or 2 medial collateral ligament injuries, minimally restrictive bracing can be helpful when combined with oral analgesics and early physical therapy. 63 Patients with partial anterior cruciate ligament tears may benefit from bracing during the acute injury phase, such as a hinged knee brace coupled with range-of-motion exercises. 35 Patients with full-thickness tears should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon.

### Autologous chondrocyte implantation as treatment for unsalvageable osteochondritis dissecans: 10-to 25-year follow-up [^115KimhS]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

An unsalvageable osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) fragment has been defined as one that cannot be saved. Unsalvageable OCD lesions have been treated with various techniques, including fragment excision, microfracture, osteochondral autograft transfer, fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation, and autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI).

Hypothesis

Patients who underwent ACI as treatment for unsalvageable OCD more than 10 years ago would maintain satisfactory patient-oriented outcome measures and have a low need for additional open surgery, especially arthroplasty.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

All Swedish and Norwegian patients (59 patients with 67 OCD lesions) who underwent ACI for OCD under the direction of the senior author between 1990 and 2005 were identified through manual chart review. Features of the patient, OCD lesion, and surgery were extracted from the medical record and intraoperative photographs. Patients were sent questionnaires to assess the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Tegner-Wallgren activity score, and Lysholm score. In addition, patients were asked whether they had to undergo further surgery, including knee replacement, of the knee that underwent ACI. They were asked whether they would have the surgery again if in the same situation.

Results

A total of 55 patients (93%) with 61 OCD lesions (91%) responded. The median follow-up duration was 19 years (range, 10–26 years) and the median age at follow-up was 43 years (range, 28–69 years). Subsequent arthroscopy was performed in the majority of cases, although many of these were scheduled "second looks" as part of a study. With respect to other subsequent surgery, 12 knees (20%) underwent any additional open surgery, but only 2 knees (3%) underwent arthroplasty. Eight knees (13%) underwent revision ACI. Most patients reached their preinjury activity level (62%) and would undergo ACI again if in the same situation (85%). If failure is defined as revision of the graft or conversion to arthroplasty, then survivorship after ACI for OCD in the current study would be 87% at 10 years, 85% at 15 years, and 82% at 20 years.

Conclusion

ACI for OCD provides a durable treatment option. At a median follow-up of 19 years, there was a very low (~3%) conversion to total knee arthroplasty.

### Do reconstructive techniques for osteochondritis dissecans of the skeletally mature knee work? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113iyQDH]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a common cause of knee pain. Management for adult-onset OCD (AOCD) usually involves surgery. Surgical treatments include palliative, reparative and reconstructive techniques. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the efficacy of reconstructive techniques for the treatment of OCD in skeletally mature knees.

Methods

A systematic search was carried out on four databases up to November 2023 (Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science). The study was registered on international prospective register of systematic reviews and performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Clinical studies on skeletally mature patients were included, which utilised reconstructive techniques such as autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation, osteochondral allograft transplantation surgery or bone marrow-derived cellular transplantation. Demographical data, patient-reported outcome measures and postoperative complications were recorded. Quantitative outcome measures that were comparable across studies were pooled for meta-analysis. A random effects model was used. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic and Cochran's Q test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Risk of bias was assessed using the risk of bias in non-randomised studies - of interventions tool for nonrandomised studies.

Results

Sixteen studies were included with 458 OCD lesions in 432 patients. The average age was 24.9, and 62.6% were male. The mean follow-up time was 61.5 months. At 36 months follow-up, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective, Tegner and EuroQol-visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) scores improved from 42.4 to 78.6 (standard mean difference [SMD]: 2.47; p < 0.001), 2.27–4.99 (SMD: 2.363; p = 0.002) and 30.4–57.5 (SMD: 2.390; p < 0.001), respectively. Overall complication rate was 8.9%. Smaller OCD lesion sizes resulted in a greater improvement in IKDC subjective (SMD: 2.64 vs. 2.01; p = 0.038), EQ-VAS (SMD: 3.16 vs. 0.95; p = 0.046) and Tegner scores (SMD: 3.13 vs. 1.05; p = 0.007) and had a lower complication rate (p = 0.008). Males showed a larger improvement in IKDC subjective scores than females (SMD: 2.56 vs. 1.56; p = 0.029), while younger patients had a larger improvement in IKDC subjective scores (SMD: 2.71 vs. 2.12; p = 0.045) and fewer complications than older patients (p = 0.003). There were no significant differences between cohorts treated with ACI and those treated with non-ACI reconstructive techniques. Publication bias was not detected (n.s.).

Conclusion

Reconstructive techniques used to treat OCD in the skeletally mature knee resulted in significant improvements in clinical and functional outcomes, with a low overall complication rate. Since a younger age leads to a greater improvement in IKDC subjective score and a lower complication rate, surgical intervention should not be delayed, especially in AOCD lesions which are more likely to follow a progressive and unremitting clinical course.

Level Of Evidence

Level III.

### Juvenile osteochondritis dissecans [^116h4VPV]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

JOCD has better potential for healing than adult OCD, but several series have shown up to a 50% failure to heal with nonsurgical techniques. JOCD poses a therapeutic dilemma for the pediatric sports specialist because the healing potential is unpredictable at the disease onset. There are no controlled prospective studies on this condition to accurately gauge the effect of different treatments, or even if treatment affects the natural history of JOCD.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^113W5Coj]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline is based on a series of systematic reviews of published studies in the available literature on the diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans of the knee. None of the 16 recommendations made by the work group is graded as strong; most are graded inconclusive; two are graded weak; and four are consensus statements. Both of the weak recommendations are related to imaging evaluation. For patients with knee symptoms, radiographs of the joint may be obtained to identify the lesion. For patients with radiographically apparent lesions, MRI may be used to further characterize the osteochondritis dissecans lesion or identify other knee pathology.

### Management of symptomatic osteochondritis dissecans of the knee [^1129sM1Y]. Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a focal lesion of the subchondral bone that can result in fragmentation, instability, and if untreated, loose body formation with progression to early degenerative changes. Particularly in adolescent male athletes, OCD of the knee is a common source of pain, effusion, and mechanical symptoms with sporting activities. Conservative treatment of athletes with OCD of the knee can entail several months of activity modification and non-weight-bearing restrictions, with varying degrees of healing and return to activity. For unstable OCD lesions not amenable to conservative treatment, previous studies have shown excellent outcomes in patients undergoing osteochondral fixation, with hardware placement and technique being critical determinants of patient outcomes. This infographic reviews the presentation and description of different types of OCD lesions, prognostic factors, surgical indications, and considerations for determining the optimal treatment algorithm. With unstable lesions showing either a "locked door" or "trapdoor" at the time of arthroscopy, subchondral bone preparation and arthroscopic-assisted or open fixation with dual-pitch metal or bio-composite screws can be successful in 67% to 100% of cases. Nonviable or chronically displaced lesions may undergo abrasion chondroplasty, marrow stimulation, or preferably, secondary cartilage restoration.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^1163jvjL]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans (knee) — Recommendation 1 states that in a patient with knee symptoms (pain, swelling, locking, catching, popping, giving way) and/or signs (tenderness, effusion, loss of motion, crepitus), x-rays (including AP, lateral, sunrise/Merchant, and tunnel views) are an option, and the strength statement reads "Strength of Recommendation: Limited". Supporting evidence indicates that AAOS conducted a systematic review that identified one diagnostic study. One Level II study reports the diagnostic performance of a clinical exam including consideration of AP, lateral, tunnel, and Merchant radiographs and enrolled 125 patients with various knee lesions, 22 of which were diagnosed as osteochondritis dissecans during arthroscopic examination.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^113wqNPU]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

AAOS osteochondritis dissecans guideline — study selection and data extraction describe exclusion of secondary reviews, targeted bibliography searches, prespecified abstraction, and handling of mixed-joint data. Systematic reviews compiled by others or guidelines developed by other organizations were not included; when abstracts suggested potential relevance, documents were recalled and their bibliographies searched to supplement the systematic review. Data elements were defined in consultation with the physician work group, evidence tables summarized the best evidence for each preliminary recommendation, and disagreements were resolved by consensus and by consulting the physician work group. For reporting by joint, the work group specified a priori to the literature search that data would be stratified by joint but that mixed studies could be accepted and reported as such; when studies did not separate data by joint, they could not be reported separately. If mixed-joint studies provided joint-specific data they were reported as such, but if mixed joints had less than 25 patients per joint, the analyst reported only the mixed data.

Joint surface incongruence resulting from osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) alters the articular physiologic congruence, increasing the contact stress on adjacent joint surfaces and accelerating wear and the cascade of joint degeneration. Accordingly, the restoration of articular surface integrity is of major importance, especially in young adults where, in lesions left untreated or following simple fragment excision, early osteoarthritis can be anticipated. Therefore, the treatment algorithm in unstable knee OCD of the young adult foresees surgical options to restore the articular surface. Several procedures have been proposed, including refixation of the detached fragment bone marrow stimulation, osteochondral autograft implantation, fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation, and cell-based or cell-free regenerative techniques. The aim of this review was to summarize the evidence for these surgical strategies, reporting their results and limitations. The overall evidence documents positive results for each of the assorted surgical procedures applied to treat unstable OCD, thus indicating support for their selected use to treat osteochondral defects paying particular attention to their specific indications for the lesion characteristics. The fixation of a good quality fragment should be pursued as a first option, while unfixable small lesions may benefit from autografts. For large lesions, available cell-based or cell-free osteochondral scaffold are a feasible solution but with limitation in terms of regenerated tissue quality. In this light, fresh allografts may offer articular surface restoration with viable physiologic osteochondral tissue providing a predictably successful outcome, and therefore they may currently represent the most suitable option to treat unstable irreparable OCD lesion in young adults.

### Patella and trochlea osteochondritis dissecans: demographics and treatment paradigms [^1138yGMs]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Previous research on patellar and trochlear groove osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is limited by small sample sizes. This study aims to describe the presentation of patients with OCD lesions of the patella and trochlea and characterize the outcomes of operative and nonoperative treatments.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study identified all patients from a single institution from 2008 to 2021 with patellar and/or trochlear OCD lesions. Patients were excluded from the study if surgical records were unavailable or if the patient had knee surgery for a different injury at index surgery or in the 12 months postoperative. Minimum follow-up was 12 months. Outcomes included a return to sports (RTS), pain resolution, radiographic healing, and treatment "success" (defined as full RTS, complete pain resolution, and full healing on imaging).

Results

A total of 68 patients (75 knees) were included-45 (60%) with patellar OCD and 30 (40%) with trochlear. Of the patients, 69% were males. The median age at knee OCD diagnosis was 14 years. At the final follow-up, 62% of knees (n = 44) recovered sufficiently to allow a full RTS and 54% of knees (n = 39) had full pain resolution. Of the 46 knees with radiographic imaging at least 1 year apart, 63% had full healing of the lesion. There was no significant difference in RTS, pain resolution, radiographic healing, or overall success when comparing treatments.

Conclusions

This study provides valuable epidemiologic demographic and outcome data regarding the scarcely reported patellar and trochlear OCD. While over half of patients fully returned to sports and reported full pain resolution, a large proportion continued to experience symptoms over a year after presentation. Future research should aim to better define the treatment algorithms for these OCD subtypes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^116h8ovF]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the knee — non-operative physical therapy is addressed as follows: We are unable to recommend for or against physical therapy for patients with OCD treated non-operatively; Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive. Practitioners should feel little constraint in following a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive, exercise clinical judgment, and be alert for emerging evidence that clarifies or helps to determine the balance between benefits and potential harm, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. The rationale states that a systematic review of the literature did not identify any studies that addressed specific physical therapy protocols for patients with OCD treated non-operatively, and there is no evidence to address this recommendation.

### Does internal fixation for unstable osteochondritis dissecans of the skeletally mature knee work? A systematic review [^116VFkHK]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To report the rate of radiographic union, patient-reported outcomes, complications, and reoperations after internal fixation of unstable osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) in the skeletally mature knee.

Methods

A literature search was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Patients were included if they were skeletally mature and underwent internal fixation of an unstable OCD lesion of the knee. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies scoring system. Surgical technique, rate of union, patient-reported outcomes, complications, and reoperations were collected.

Results

Thirteen studies resulted in 148 patients (150 knees) for inclusion. Patient age ranged from 14 to 45 years. Numerous fixation procedures were used, including biodegradable devices (rods, pins, nails, and screws), metal screws, Kirschner wire, and autologous bone sticks. Overall, reported outcome measures were heterogeneous in nature. The rate of radiographic healing ranged from 67% to 100% across 6 studies. Improved subjective results and Hughston criteria on final follow-up ranged from 83% to 100% across 4 studies each. Mean postoperative Lysholm scores ranged from 42 to 98 in studies that reported them. Both complication and reoperation rates ranged from 0% to 44%. The most commonly performed reoperations were loose body excision and cartilage resurfacing procedures.

Conclusions

A variety of surgical techniques are available for treatment of unstable OCD lesions in the skeletally mature knee. In this systematic review, internal fixation of the native fragment showed acceptable rates of radiographic union and improved patient-reported outcomes relative to other techniques.

### Physician preferences in diagnostics and treatment of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans are diverse across the knee, ankle and elbow: an ESSKA survey [^11222Cub]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a disorder of the articular cartilage and subchondral bone that is frequently seen in children participating in sports. Juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (JOCD) occurs in skeletally immature children, i.e. children with open physes. The disorder may occur in different joints, the most common being the knee, ankle and elbow, respectively. Irrespective of the location, JOCD may cause pain and mechanical symptoms in the affected joint, which could limit the mobility and athletic activities of the patient.

JOCD is a relatively rare condition, but it can greatly impact a child's life. So far, almost no randomised controlled trials have been performed and relatively little research has been conducted around the treatment of this condition. The aetiology of JOCD is not entirely clear. This might be another reason this condition has no clear optimal treatment, resulting in a lack of standard treatment protocols. Additionally, there have only been a few consensus meetings.

JOCD in children appears to have better healing potential than OCD in adults. Probably because of this, treatment choices differ between children and adults. Although certain features, such as lesion size and stability, must be considered for each JOCD, different joints may also require different treatments. On the other hand, treatment principles between joints may have much in common.

An orthopaedic landscape gradually changing from general orthopaedic surgeons to joint specialists potentially causes us to work on 'islands', which may create knowledge segregation. Instead, we could learn from each other in this situation, as this same pathology affects different joints. Therefore, an international survey was developed to investigate current practices and preferences on the diagnosis and treatment of JOCD of the knee, ankle and elbow among orthopaedic surgeons.

### Osteochondritis dissecans lesions in family members: does a positive family history impact phenotypic potency? [^112KoHBP]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although repetitive microtrauma and athletic overuse patterns are most commonly associated with osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), recent studies have identified a potential genetic predisposition for OCD. Several case series have documented family pedigrees that support autosomal-dominant inheritance, but the families in these studies were all selected as a result of unique histories that may not accurately represent OCD inheritance patterns at large. Because there has been little investigation beyond these case reports, we aimed to describe a broader, more representative pattern of OCD inheritance applicable to all affected patients.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What proportion of patients treated for OCD of the knee have one or more immediate and/or extended family members with a history of OCD lesions? (2) Do patients with more phenotypically potent lesions, which we defined as patients with bilateral OCD lesions or patients who have undergone multiple procedures for OCD, have a higher frequency of affected relatives than those with less potent lesions?

Methods

This retrospective study queried patient databases, diagnosis codes (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision), and surgical logs at a regional, tertiary care children's hospital to identify all patients treated over a 10-year period (March 2004-March 2014) by the senior author for OCD of the knee. All patients aged 0–18 years at the time of diagnosis were included. At our institution, patients with intact lesions are treated with a trial of conservative therapy; conversely, patients with a break in the articular cartilage and/or loose fragments of bone/cartilage are treated surgically. There were no OCD-specific contraindications to surgery. This search identified 543 patients. After patient identification, a questionnaire was designed that asked for the number, age, and gender of all immediate family members and the history of OCD lesions in any family member (immediate or extended). For all positive family members, patients were further queried regarding relevant clinical details to affirm a history of OCD. Patients were contacted by mailed questionnaires and phone calls for survey completion. All 543 patients received the survey, of which 103 (19%) responded to it and were included here. Responders were approximately 1 year younger than nonresponders; there was no difference in gender distribution. A retrospective chart review was then conducted to collect demographic information, phenotypic disease severity, and treatment details. Of the 103 included patients, 20 patients (19%) with unilateral lesions were managed nonoperatively ("conservative" group), 50 patients (49%) had unilateral lesions advanced to surgery ("unilateral" group), 21 patients (20%) had bilateral lesions managed either conservatively or surgically ("bilateral" group), and 12 patients (12%) underwent multiple procedures for the same lesion ("multiple" group). Of those included, 75 patients (73%) were treated surgically. With the numbers available, there were no baseline differences among the groups in terms of gender, lesion laterality, lesion location, or number of secondary procedures at the time of the initial surgical intervention.

Results

In total, 14 of 103 (14%) patients treated for OCD in this study had an immediate and/or extended family member with a history of OCD lesions. This included four of 20 (20%) patients in the conservative group, five of 50 (10%) in the unilateral group, four of 21 (19%) in the bilateral group, and one of 12 (8%) in the multiple group. With the numbers available, we did not identify a higher proportion of immediate and/or extended family members with a positive history of OCD in those patients with phenotypically potent lesions (bilateral and multiple) as compared with those with patients phenotypically less potent lesions (conservative and unilateral; five of 33 [15%] versus nine of 70 [13%]; odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.4–3.9; p = 0.751).

Conclusions

In this broad, heterogeneous cohort of pediatric patients with OCD, the proportion of patients with a positive family history of OCD was 14%, which appeared to be much higher than the reported prevalence of OCD in the general population according to prior research. Therefore, our data provide preliminary support for a familial inheritance pattern for OCD, suggesting that further clinical, biologic, and genomic investigation might help to improve our understanding of who is at highest risk for OCD and what moderating factors might influence their disease severity and risk of progression. Furthermore, our data suggest that expanded patient education and screening regarding inheritance patterns might enhance identification of potential familial disease burden and improve access to timely and appropriate treatment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^115DTfX8]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans guideline — strength of recommendation and study quality methodology are defined as follows: The lowering of study quality was cumulative, and studies with five or more flaws indicated by the quality questionnaire were reduced to very low quality and not considered. Unlike Levels of Evidence, strength of recommendation takes into account the quality, quantity, and applicability of the available evidence, the trade-off between the benefits and harms of a treatment or diagnostic procedure, and the magnitude of a treatment's effect, and it expresses the degree of confidence in a recommendation and how possible it is that a recommendation will be overturned by future evidence. Recommendations based on many high quality randomized controlled trials that show a large effect are given a high strength of recommendation, whereas those derived from a few small case series are given a low strength. To derive the strength, AAOS staff first assigned a preliminary strength taking only the quality and quantity of available evidence into account, then work group members modified the preliminary strength using the 'Form for Assigning Strength of Recommendation (Interventions)' shown in Appendix VII.

### Management of osteochondritis dissecans of the femoral condyle [^111NzbRJ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons has developed the Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) document Management of Osteochondritis Dissecans of the Femoral Condyle. Evidence-based information, in conjunction with the clinical expertise of physicians, was used to develop the criteria to improve patient care and obtain the best outcomes while considering the subtleties and distinctions necessary in making clinical decisions. The AUC clinical patient scenarios were derived from patient indications that generally accompany osteochondritis dissecans of the femoral condyle, as well as from current evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and supporting literature. The 64 patient scenarios and 12 treatments were developed by the Writing Panel, a group of clinicians who are specialists in this AUC topic. Lastly, a separate, multidisciplinary Voting Panel (made up of specialists and nonspecialists) rated the appropriateness of treatment of each patient scenario using a 9-point scale to designate a treatment as Appropriate (median rating, 7 to 9), May Be Appropriate (median rating, 4 to 6), or Rarely Appropriate (median rating, 1 to 3).

### Pediatric knee osteochondritis dissecans lesions [^1146xhrm]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) can cause knee pain and dysfunction in children. The etiology of OCD remains unclear; theories on causes include inflammation, ischemia, ossification abnormalities, genetic factors, and repetitive microtrauma. Most OCD lesions in skeletally immature patients will heal with nonoperative treatment. The success of nonoperative treatment decreases once patients reach skeletal maturity. The goals of surgical treatment include maintenance of articular cartilage congruity, rigid fixation of unstable fragments, and repair of osteochondral defects with cells or tissues that can adequately replace lost or deficient cartilage. Unsalvageable OCD lesions can be treated with various surgical techniques.

### Bilateral knee osteochondritis dissecans: early diagnosis, surgical treatment and successful return to sport [^113yYybf]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a rare joint disorder primarily affecting adolescent athletes, potentially requiring surgical intervention, particularly in cases of bilateral lesions. This report presents an adolescent professional football player with ICRS IV OCD lesions in both knees, treated surgically with debridement, microfracture and fixation. 3 years after the initial surgery on the right knee, a similar lesion developed in the left knee, requiring identical treatment. The patient achieved a complete recovery, attaining a perfect Lysholm score of 100 and successfully returning to elite-level football. This case highlights the challenges of diagnosing and treating bilateral OCD in athletes. It underlines the possible gain of early bilateral imaging in high-risk individuals and the effectiveness of surgical intervention for unstable lesions. Further research is needed to establish optimised treatment protocols for bilateral OCD, particularly in athletic populations at risk for recurrent lesions and joint deterioration.

### Management of osteochondritis dissecans of the knee: current concepts review [^115kdWiw]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee is being seen with increased frequency in pediatric and young adult athletes and is thought to be, in part, owing to earlier and increasingly competitive sports participation. Despite much speculation, the cause of both juvenile and adult osteochondritis dissecans remains unclear. Early recognition is essential. Whereas adult osteochondritis dissecans lesions have a greater propensity to instability, juvenile osteochondritis dissecans lesions are typically stable, and those with an intact articular surface have a potential to heal with nonoperative treatment through cessation of repetitive impact loading. The value of adjunctive immobilization, protected weightbearing, and unloader bracing has not been established. Skeletally immature patients with stable lesions that have not healed with nonoperative treatment should have consideration given to arthroscopic drilling to promote healing before the lesion progresses and requires more involved treatment with a less optimistic prognosis. Magnetic resonance imaging may allow early prediction of lesion healing potential. The majority of adult osteochondritis dissecans cases as well as those skeletally immature patients with unstable lesions and secondary loose bodies require fixation and possible bone grafting. Many unstable lesions will heal after stabilization, but long-term prognosis is not clear. Chronic loose fragments can be difficult to fix and have poor healing potential. Results of excision of large lesions from weightbearing zones are poor. Chondral resurfacing techniques have limited long-term data for cases of osteochondritis dissecans in skeletally immature patients.

Post-operative physical therapy after surgical treatment of osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is addressed as follows: In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the work group that patients who have received surgical treatment of OCD be offered the option of post-operative physical therapy. Strength of Recommendation: Consensus. The supporting evidence is lacking and requires the work group to make a recommendation based on expert opinion by considering the known potential harm and benefits associated with the treatment, and the work group is issuing a recommendation consistent with current practice. Patients who receive surgical interventions for OCD of the knee may experience impairments such as loss of motion, strength deficits, altered movement patterns, and post-operative effusion. It is not possible to determine whether patients should be offered supervised or unsupervised therapy, but there are minimal risks associated with physical therapy, which, given its potential benefits, also argues for offering it to patients. Practitioners should be flexible in deciding whether to follow a recommendation classified as Consensus, although they may give it preference over alternatives, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. There is no evidence to address this recommendation.

### Wait or drill? Shared decision-making in adolescents with stable osteochondritis dissecans of the knee [^111muAg9]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Treatment of stable juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the knee in adolescents is controversial. Traditionally, initial management has been nonoperative. However, early subchondral drilling is also a consideration to potentially reduce the recovery time because ∼50% of stable OCD lesions eventually require surgery after a period of failed nonoperative care. This study uses choice-based conjoint (CBC) analysis to explore patient and family preferences regarding initial nonoperative treatment versus early drilling.

Methods

This study used a CBC survey using Sawtooth Software (Lighthouse Studio version 9.2.0) to collect demographic information and preferences on surgical scenarios. Anonymous participants were recruited through the Prolific crowdsourcing platform. Eligible participants were US residents over 18 years of age with children aged 12 to 17. Data were analyzed using Hierarchical Bayes and logistic regression to determine the importance of each attribute and correlate preferences with demographic variables.

Results

Of the 474 participants, the highest importance was placed on minimizing treatment failure (46.3%), followed by the likelihood of needing surgery (22.4%), cost (11.8%), time on crutches (10.8%), and return to normal activities (8.7%). Simulation of surgical decision-making showed a strong preference for early surgery (90.8%) over conservative treatment (9.2%). Preferences varied slightly by demographics, with female participants valuing recovery time more and male participants prioritizing cost.

Discussion

Our findings indicate a significant preference for early surgical intervention driven by concerns over treatment failure and the need for a future surgery with a second recovery period. Despite some demographic differences in attribute importance, no specific patient characteristic significantly influenced the overall treatment preference.

Conclusion

Early drilling of stable OCD lesions of the knee is favored by most parents of adolescents, primarily to reduce the risk of future surgery/recovery. This preference underscores the importance of personalized treatment discussions and highlights the need for shared decision-making tools that incorporate individual patient values.

Prospective cohort studies of non-operatively treated knee OCD lesions should be conducted to identify independent predictors of success, including historical information (age, mechanical symptoms), physical examination findings (effusion, point tenderness), and radiographic features (distal femur skeletal maturity, lesion size, lesion stability). Randomized controlled trials should be conducted to establish optimal physical therapy and non-operative strategies; variables such as efficacy of immobilization, optimal periods of restricted weight bearing, and utility of specific physical therapy interventions need to be investigated in skeletally immature patients with stable lesions, and therapy and exercise modalities could be compared to determine their impact on healing and to identify patient characteristics that predict healing potential or failure of healing. Randomized controlled trials should be conducted to establish optimal surgical strategies, including comparing anterograde to retrograde drilling in stable lesions predicted to fail non-operative treatment, comparing fixation with mini-fragment screws, variable pitch screws, and bioabsorbable pins in unstable lesions, and randomizing non-salvageable lesions to fresh osteochondral allograft or autologous chondrocyte implantation. Randomized controlled trials should be conducted to determine optimal post-operative management, and investigations need to include management of drilling procedures, fixation procedures and cartilage restoration.

### The subchondral bone in articular cartilage repair: current problems in the surgical management [^111bYMjc]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Articular defects can be limited to the superficial layer of cartilage or can extend deeper, also affecting the underlying subchondral bone. Certain defects, such as those resulting from osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), may in fact start in the subchondral bone, only secondarily affecting the overlying cartilage. Other joint pathologies involving the subchondral bone include osteonecrosis and osteochondral fractures. There has been increased awareness that the subchondral bone plays an important role even in superficial lesions limited to the articular cartilage layer, since even focal chondral defects, if left untreated, may increase in size over time and result in concomitant changes in the underlying subchondral bone plate; either overgrowth or bone loss.

Recently, there has been an increasing interest and awareness of the importance of the subchondral bone for its role in the pathogenic processes, as well as the necessity to carefully consider this structure in the treatment of articular surface damage, in the evaluation of the results over time, and in the determination of the patients' prognosis. In fact, the conditions of articular cartilage and its supporting bone are tightly coupled and should be viewed as a connected osteochondral unit. The biomechanical alterations caused by (osteo)-chondral defects affect the articular cartilage surrounding and opposing the lesion, as well as the homeostatic balance of the entire joint. As such, there is increased likelihood for clinical progression to more widespread joint degeneration through mechanical disruption of joint motion, loose body formation, mechanical wear in the involved compartment, and attrition of opposing surfaces. This progressive decline may lead to degenerative joint disease with earlier onset of osteoarthritis. Therefore, the treatment goal for large chondral or osteochondral defects should be to restore the physiological properties of the entire osteochondral unit, aiming to achieve a more predictable repair tissue that closely resembles native articular surface and remains durable over time.

Marrow-stimulating techniques, osteochondral allografts or autografts, autologous chondrocyte implantation, scaffolds, and focal knee resurfacing implants are some of the main approaches proposed for the treatment of chondral and osteochondral lesions of the knee and the ankle. This article will discuss treatment options focusing on problems in the surgical management of the entire osteochondral unit and analyzing their effects on the subchondral bone structure.

### Midterm results of surgical treatment for adult osteochondritis dissecans of the knee [^113X5c1B]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Determination of appropriate treatment options for adult osteochondritis dissecans is difficult, as most published papers on surgical osteochondritis dissecans treatment report outcomes in a population consisting of both adult and juvenile patients.

Purpose

This study examines the outcomes of surgical procedures in patients with adult osteochondritis dissecans.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

The cohort included 46 adult patients (48 knees) with adult osteochondritis dissecans of the knee who had undergone surgical treatment (debridement, drilling, loose-body removal, arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation, microfracture, osteochondral allograft, or autologous chondrocyte implantation). The average patient age was 34 ± 9.5 years (range, 20–49) and patients were followed for 4.0 ± 1.8 years. The mean defect size was 4.5 ± 2.7 cm(2). Outcomes were assessed via clinical assessment and established outcome scales, including the Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Tegner, Cincinnati, and Short Form-12.

Results

Statistically significant improvement (P < .05) was noted in all outcome scales, including Noyes, Tegner, Lysholm, IKDC, KOOS (subdivided into 5 categories including Pain, Symptoms, Activities of Daily Living, Sport, and Quality of Life), Short Form-12 Physical, and Short Form-12 Mental. Seven knees (14%) had clinical failure of the initial treatment and underwent a revision procedure at a mean follow-up of 14 months. Patients treated with arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation and loose-body removal demonstrated a statistically higher postoperative percentage score increase for the KOOS Sport (P = 0.008) and KOOS Quality of Life (P = 0.03) categories than those treated with an osteochondral allograft.

Conclusion

Patients with adult osteochondritis dissecans of the knee, treated with surgical cartilage procedures, show durable function and symptomatic improvement at a mean 4.0 years of follow-up. Patients treated with arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation and loose-body removal demonstrated a greater improvement in outcome scores than those treated with osteochondral allograft.

### Bilateral knee osteochondritis dissecans: early diagnosis, surgical treatment and successful return to sport [^113aeh3N]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Given my previous Osteochondritis Dissecans experience, the club acted quickly. A few weeks later, an MRI showed another loose body in my knee, leading to surgery. This time, I only stayed home for about a week before starting rehab. Again, I struggled to engage my VMO, making it the initial focus. The rehab went smoothly without setbacks, and I eventually returned to playing football.

Learning points

Consider bilateral OCD in athletes: might be significant to assess both knees in adolescent athletes presenting with unilateral knee pain to detect asymptomatic contralateral lesions early.
Prioritise early diagnosis: timely identification and intervention in OCD cases can prevent lesion progression and avoid more invasive treatments.
Surgical intervention for unstable lesions: arthroscopic procedures, including fixation and microfracture, are effective for managing ICRS III-IV OCD lesions, enabling high-function recovery and return to sports.
Relevance of follow-up: long-term monitoring is essential, as contralateral lesions may develop years after initial treatment.
Tailored care for athletes: high-impact sports demand vigilant evaluation and customised management strategies to minimise recurrence and joint deterioration.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^1124pht8]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

AAOS osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the knee — scope, patient population, and evidence policy — addresses the diagnosis and treatment of skeletally immature and skeletally mature patients with osteochondritis dissecans of the knee, and states that the guideline is not intended for use as a benefits determination document. AAOS cautions that an absence of evidence is not evidence of ineffectiveness and holds that properly developed clinical practice guidelines should not seek to guide clinical practice when data are absent unless the disease, disorder, or condition in question can result in loss of life or limb; the AAOS incorporates expert opinion into a guideline under these circumstances, and only under these circumstances. It explains that when the AAOS states that it cannot recommend for or against a given intervention or service, it is stating that currently available data do not provide clear guidance on which course of action is best and that it is therefore reluctant to make a recommendation that has potentially national ramifications. When evidence is absent for osteochondritis dissecans of the knee, the AAOS believes it is particularly important for treatment to be based on mutual patient and physician communication, with discussion of available treatments and procedures applicable to that patient, and with consideration of the natural history of the disease and current practice patterns; once the patient has been informed of available therapies and has discussed options with his/her physician, an informed decision can be made, and clinician input based on experience with both conservative management and surgical skills increases the probability of identifying patients who will benefit from specific treatment options.

### Osteochondritis dissecans in children: location-dependent differences: (part I: knee) [^114aZAAq]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The classic terminology "osteochondritis dissecans (OCD)" describes a pathologic alteration, centered at the osteochondral junction, involving the subchondral bone and/or its cartilaginous precursor, with risk for lesion instability and disruption of the overlying articular cartilage. Among children and young adults, these sites of osteochondrosis can be a cause of chronic joint pain and are most often found within the knee, the ankle, and the elbow joints. No consensus exists on the precise pathophysiology underlying the development and progression of these lesions, which likely varies slightly among lesions at different anatomic locations as the result of region-specific differences in tissue quality, vascular perfusion, and biomechanical forces. While our current understanding of OCD lesions is largely derived from lesions involving the femoral condyles, important location-dependent differences exist. The current Part I article of this two-part series will review key definitions and pathophysiologic principles shared among OCD lesions, highlighting the distinction between lesions that occur in skeletally immature and mature individuals. This will be followed by a brief section on the imaging approach and rationale for imaging work-up. Finally, an evidence-based literature review will address location-specific pathophysiology, imaging considerations, findings of lesion instability, and treatment selection considerations, focusing on lesions that involve the knee joint: medial femoral condyle, lateral femoral condyle, and patellar-femoral trochlear joint. A separate article (Part II of this series) will be devoted to lesions that involve the ankle (talar dome) and the elbow (capitellum and humeral trochlea) joints.

Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee in pediatric and adolescent patients remains an incompletely understood entity, with multiple theories proposed for its underlying cause and variable treatment modalities. In addition to the importance of history and examination, treatment is primarily guided by lesion stability, which can be determined by MRI and arthroscopic findings. Other important factors that can influence healing include patient skeletal maturity, lesion location, and the size of the lesion. The purpose of this article is to review the most current epidemiology, classification, and pathoanatomy of the disease and discuss the different treatment options.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^111AeAYq]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) knee — prognostic factors in non-operative management of children and adolescents are summarized as follows: Two Level IV studies (n = 123) examined healing predictors in children and adolescent patients with OCD treated non-operatively; one conducted formal regression analyses of age, symptoms (isolated or mechanical) and lesion dimensions and defined progression towards healing as radiographic evidence of reossification, with sex and lesion location not statistically significant and symptom results inconclusive due to unquantified pain, while a second study reported post hoc tests (χ2, regression, and discriminate analysis) of age, lesion size and location with success or failure of non-operative treatment. Across studies, lesion size was an influential predictor, with statistically significantly more patients with smaller lesions tending to heal or progress towards healing than those with larger lesions, and authors reported no other influential or statistically significant predictors of healing in osteochondritis dissecans of the knee treated non-operatively. For guideline use, the document notes that prognostic studies cannot be used as supporting evidence for a recommendation if they did not investigate the results of the effect of the treatment and/or the population of interest, and that recommendations throughout this guideline are intended to be mutually exclusive.

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the knee — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) utility includes adjunctive use and prognostic markers: an MRI may be used as an adjunct to clinical examination with radiographs to provide additional information that will guide therapeutic decision-making. Of the 5 therapeutic studies included in the guideline, three reported acquisition of an MRI at enrollment and three reported acquisition at follow-up evaluation. One prognostic study predicted the healing potential of stable OCD lesions using a multivariable logistic regression model, and among variables considered only knee symptoms plus normalized length and normalized width of the lesion on MRI were found to be predictive of healing potential. Three studies correlated MRI with arthroscopic findings in patients with OCD of the knee, and the evidence for assessment of stability of an OCD lesion was inconsistent.

### Management strategies for osteochondritis dissecans of the knee in the skeletally immature athlete [^1168hXZV]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Synopsis

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a disorder resulting in focal breakdown of the subchondral bone, with potential disruption of the overlying articular cartilage. The femoral condyles of the knee are the most common locations for OCD, and the incidence of OCD appears to be increasing among active children. Juvenile OCD (JOCD) can be distinguished from adult OCD by the presence of open growth plates. Due to a lack of evidence on its early diagnosis, optimal treatment, and long-term course of healing, JOCD presents a unique challenge for the health care team. Approximately 50% to 67% of stable JOCD lesions heal successfully with nonoperative treatment. For unstable lesions and stable lesions that fail nonoperative treatment, a variety of surgical interventions can be utilized to stimulate bony healing and address articular cartilage lesions. It is recommended that rehabilitation of JOCD be tailored to the individual patient, based on the stage and radiographic status of the lesion and the mode of surgery employed when surgically addressed. Although there is a growing body of literature on this condition, the etiology and optimal methods for treatment, rehabilitation, and evaluating outcomes remain inconclusive due to a lack of quality evidence.

### High rates of return to sport following management of osteochondritis dissecans of the femoral trochlea: a systematic review [^112vxibz]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To summarize management strategies and associated clinical outcomes in patients with osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the femoral trochlea.

Methods

Three databases were searched from inception to 2 October 2023, for studies describing outcomes posttreatment for femoral trochlear OCD. The authors adhered to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses and revised assessment of multiple systematic reviews guidelines as well as the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Data on demographics, injury characteristics, and operative details were extracted. Outcomes included patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), complications, and revision and return to sport (RTS) rates.

Results

Twenty studies comprising 105 patients (119 knees) were included. Females comprised 10.1% (range: 0%-100%) of patients and the mean age of patients was 14.5 (range: 11–28) years. A total of 89 (74.7%) of knees received operative management, with 28 of 34 (82.4%) known open procedures being open reduction internal fixation (ORIF), and nine of 29 (31%) known arthroscopic procedures receiving arthroscopic reduction internal fixation (ARIF) or drilling. Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee scores in 20 patients each ranged from 93.4 to 100 and 74.7 to 96.6, respectively. The revision rate for operative procedures was 9.0%, and the overall RTS rate was 93.3%.

Conclusion

There is very little high quality evidence investigating patients with femoral trochlear OCD lesions. Drilling, ARIF, and ORIF were the most common surgical options for this patient population. Patients treated with either nonoperative or operative management returned to sport at a high rate, and those requiring operative management had a low revision rate.

### Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee associated with mechanical overload [^115rok3Y]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a rare joint disorder leading to the partial separation of a subchondral bone fragment from its bony bed. This can, along with the overlying cartilage, become unstable and even progress into a loose body in the joint space. Although OCD affects most larger joints, such as the hip, ankle, and elbow, the knee is the most frequently affected joint in the pediatric population. The most commonly affected location within the knee joint is the medial femoral condyle (MFC), followed by the lateral femoral condyle (LFC) and the patella. OCD of the knee joint occurs mostly in young, active people; the highest incidence is found in patients 12 to 19 years old. Reported OCD incidence has increased substantially in the last centuryto 6 to 11 per 100,000 persons.

Königfirst named the disorder in 1888, originally hypothesizing an inflammatory origin. Hence arose the terms osteochondritis, to refer to inflammation of the osteochondral surface, and dissecans, derived from the Latin word for separation: dissec. Although subsequent histologic studies have shown focal osseous necrosis, with no evidence supporting an inflammatory cause, the name has persisted. Several more likely potential etiological factors have been described since then, including repetitive microtrauma, vascular insufficiency, obesity, and hereditary factors, in pediatric patients and associated mechanical axis deviations in both pediatric and adult patients. The exact cause remains unknown, due to high variability and limited cohort sizes of studies, and none of the proposed etiological factors are indisputable.

OCD lesions present in a highly variable manner. Although stable OCD lesions are often asymptomatic, they can also lead to vague complaints and poorly localized knee pain that is exacerbated by exercise. This can lead to considerable delay of diagnosis. Unstable lesions and loose fragments may cause stiffness, joint effusion, instability, and mechanical symptoms such as locking sensations and may require surgical treatment. Skeletal maturity is associated with a significantly decreased success rate for nonoperative treatment when compared with skeletal immaturity. The arthroscopic International Cartilage Regeneration & Joint Preservation Society (ICRS) grading is historically often used to assess stability of the OCD, although noninvasive imaging such as radiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are usually used initially.

### Bilateral knee osteochondritis dissecans: early diagnosis, surgical treatment and successful return to sport [^113pZdKN]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

The evidence regarding the treatment of bilateral OCD is low. Most publications are case reports, with a few retrospective cohort studies and no randomised controlled trials. This is likely due to the low incidence. Additionally, the patient population varies widely in terms of age, lesion severity and lesion location, making it difficult to standardise treatment and compare results across a homogeneous controlled group. Despite the lack of strong evidence, there is a broad consensus in the literature regarding the treatment of unilateral OCD. Stable OCD lesions (ICRS grades 1–2) are treated conservatively, while unstable OCD lesions (ICRS grades 3–4) require surgical intervention.

In a retrospective cohort study of 10- to 18-year-old patients with JOCD, it was found that patients treated with refixation for ICRS grade IV lesions had a mean Lysholm score of 79.5 out of 100. The study also showed a fivefold increased risk of surgical intervention after conservative treatment of ICRS grades 3–4 knee lesions compared with grades 1–2 lesions. As unstable lesions appear to respond poorly to conservative management, early surgical intervention is often recommended.

In a case series with 26 adolescent OCD patients, 85% successfully returned to sports following surgical intervention. This high return-to-sport rate supports existing literature on the effectiveness of surgical treatment. A systematic review evaluating various surgical interventions for knee lesions, which consistently used the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale across studies, reported a mean postoperative Lysholm Knee Score of 85.5. Despite the use of different surgical techniques for both stable and unstable lesions, no single technique was shown to be superior. Nonetheless, 94.1% of lesions showed successful postoperative healing, further underscoring the general effectiveness of surgical intervention in producing positive outcomes. Together, these studies suggest that surgical intervention not only results in high Lysholm scores but also increases the likelihood of a successful return to sports.

However, it is important to note that these studies did not differentiate between lesion grade, and the findings reflect the general effectiveness of surgical treatments. Studies suggest that the more severe the lesions, the lower the postoperative scores tend to be. It should also be noted that these studies primarily treated unilateral OCD lesions, and outcomes for bilateral lesions may differ.

### Treatment strategies and outcomes for osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum [^111Y6WHq]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimum management of osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the capitellum is a widely debated subject.

Purpose

To better understand the efficacy of different surgical modalities and nonoperative treatment of OCD as assessed by radiological and clinical outcomes and return to sports.

Study Design

Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

A systematic review of all treatment studies published between January 1975 and June 2020 was performed following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A total of 76 clinical studies, including 1463 patients, were suitable for inclusion. Aggregate analysis and subgroup analysis of individual patient data were performed to compare the functional and radiographic outcomes between the various nonoperative and surgical treatment options for capitellar OCD. A unified grading system (UGS; grades 1–4) was developed from existing validated classification systems to allow a comparison of patients with similar-grade OCD lesions in different studies according to their treatment. Patient-level data were available for 352 patients. The primary outcome measures of interest were patient-reported functional outcome, range of motion (ROM), and return to sports after treatment. The influences of the capitellar physeal status, location of the lesion, and type of sports participation were also assessed. Each outcome measure was evaluated according to the grade of OCD and treatment method (debridement/microfracture, fragment fixation, osteochondral autograft transplantation [OATS], or nonoperative treatment).

Results

No studies reported elbow scores or ROM for nonoperatively treated patients. All surgical modalities resulted in significantly increased postoperative ROM and elbow scores for stable (UGS grades 1 and 2) and unstable lesions (UGS grades 3 and 4). There was no significant difference in the magnitude of improvement or overall scores according to the type of surgery for stable or unstable lesions. Return to sports was superior with nonoperative treatment for stable lesions, whereas surgical treatment was superior for unstable lesions. Patients with an open capitellar physis had superior ROM for stable and unstable lesions, but there was no correlation with lesion location and the outcomes of OATS versus fragment fixation for high-grade lesions.

Conclusion

Nonoperative treatment was similar in outcomes to surgical treatment for low-grade lesions, whereas surgical treatment was superior for higher grade lesions. There is currently insufficient evidence to support complex reconstructive techniques for high-grade lesions compared with microfracture/debridement alone.

### Bilateral knee osteochondritis dissecans: early diagnosis, surgical treatment and successful return to sport [^114Xg8J2]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is an idiopathic joint disease with significant uncertainties regarding epidemiology and pathogenesis. It is most seen in children and adolescents, affecting various joints, but with a predominance of symptomatic lesions in the knee. Unlike traumatic injuries, OCD arises as a focal anomaly in the subchondral bone, characterised by osseous resorption, sequestrum formation, and the potential detachment of a bony fragment along with the overlying articular cartilage. Symptoms often include pain, joint swelling, a sensation of clicking or locking and joint instability. It is a rare condition with both acute and long-term consequences for the patients. Typically, OCD affects only one joint, and its occurrence in both corresponding joints is highly unusual, making cases of bilateral OCD particularly noteworthy. For athletes, particularly in high-performance sports such as football, OCD can lead to prolonged recovery periods and decreased performance. In some cases, even career-ending outcomes. Therefore, an early diagnosis and effective treatment are critical.

Juvenile OCD (JOCD) is estimated to affect between 9.5 and 29 per 100 000 knees (ages 12–19), while the prevalence of bilateral OCD in paediatric and adolescent patients presenting specifically with unilateral knee pain is not well established. Unstable OCD lesions typically occur in larger joints, with the medial femoral condyle of the knee being the most affected site. Despite an unknown pathogenesis, repetitive microtrauma is believed to be a triggering factor.

OCD is often diagnosed by clinical examination in combination with X-rays but classified using MRI. Treatment is based on the MRI classification, which is determined by the lesion type, location, size and risk of a loose fragment. The ICRS classification system grades OCD lesions from I to IV. Stable lesions (ICRS I–II) are typically treated conservatively with restriction from sports. Unstable lesions (ICRS III–IV) and loose fragments are treated with arthroscopic fixation (in situ fixation). The surgical success rate likely depends on the extent of the lesion, and even with surgical fixation, a successful outcome is not guaranteed.

### Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee [^113Wr4M2]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans is a condition of the joints that appears to affect subchondral bone primarily, with secondary effects on articular cartilage. With progression, this pathology may present clinically with symptoms related to the integrity of the articular cartilage. Early signs, associated with intact cartilage, may be related to a softening phenomenon and alteration in the mechanical properties of cartilage. Later stages, because of the lack of underlying support of the cartilage, can present with signs of articular cartilage separation, cartilage flaps, loose bodies, inflammatory synovitis, persistent or intermittent joint effusion, and, in severe cases, secondary joint degeneration. Selecting and recommending a surgical intervention require balancing application of nonsurgical interventions with assessment of the degree of articular cartilage stability and the potential for spontaneous recovery.

### Editorial commentary: early operative management of "Stable" osteochondritis dissecans lesions confers greater value in skeletally immature patients [^114iC7X9]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

The ideal treatment of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) varies according to the chronicity of symptoms and radiographic classification. Traditionally, "stable" OCD lesions of the knee are managed conservatively with limited weight bearing and nonoperative care. However, this can require up to 6 to 12 months of observation, and success rates are estimated at only 59%. By contrast, recent data suggest that early subchondral drilling of OCD lesions may more consistently facilitate new vascular channels and remodeling of the compromised osteochondral unit. When considering overarching health care costs and probabilistic modeling, contemporary treatment paradigms may preferentially suggest early surgical treatment of OCD lesions for greater cost-effectiveness and an optimized timeline for a return to full activity. Additionally, surgery may be prioritized for larger lesions, atypical locations, closing physes, and/or the presence of mechanical symptoms.

Osteochondritis dissecans — potential benefits and harms of treatment include aims of pain relief, improved knee function, and potentially altering the degenerative joint process; surgical treatments carry risks such as infection, bleeding, venous thromboembolic events and persistent pain, with arthroscopic approaches having relatively low risk compared to more invasive surgeries; some procedures cannot be performed arthroscopically and may require arthroscopic evaluation followed by open reduction and internal fixation of the fragment with bone grafting; non operative treatment is challenging because it is difficult to predict which stable juvenile lesions will heal, and most treatments have risks with contraindications varying by treatment.

### Osteochondritis dissecans: a diagnosis not to miss… [^112bBbn6]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Loose cartilage was noted at the edge of the osteochondral defect and was debrided at this site. There was no evidence of exposed bone. The lesion itself was deemed stable after mechanical probing, and no further procedures were performed. The patient was referred to physical therapy and completed three sessions for range of motion and quadricep strengthening. She was asked to refrain from competitive sports. The patient was lost to follow-up for nine months, at which time she was seen again in the family practice clinic. She was pain-free with full range of motion and a stable knee. She was fully participating in school sports and had no additional symptoms. Clinical Management Once staging has been completed, unstable lesions are managed surgically. Conservative treatment of stable lesions is generally accepted. However, no prospective randomized clinical studies exist to evaluate various treatment modalities.

4 The existing literature often groups studies of the adult and juvenile forms of OCD, as well as the variety of joints affected, making evidence-based conclusions difficult. Prognosis worsens with age and physis closure. Therefore, the goal of management of juvenile OCD is to promote resolution of the lesion before physis closure. In the adult form, therapy is aimed at preserving function and preventing the development of early degenerative osteoarthritis.
3. Nonsurgical management includes observation. Competitive sports should be avoided for six to eight weeks. The goal of activity modification is to allow symptom-free activities of daily living. 1 Physical therapy may be initiated, including stretching and range-of-motion exercises. Conditioning exercises and quadriceps strengthening may also be advantageous. Historically, immobilization has been encouraged; however, prolonged splinting leads to quadriceps atrophy and stiffness, which may complicate the condition.

5 Persistent symptoms in a compliant, conservatively treated patient or the onset of joint catching or grinding suggest detachment, with the development of a loose body, and are an indication for arthroscopic evaluation.

1. In these cases, arthroscopy is imperative to evaluate the stability of the lesion and visualize the overlying cartilage. Depending on surgical findings, a loose body may be removed, a fragment excised, cartilage debrided or a lesion drilled to promote revascularization. Following surgery, range-of-motion exercises should be initiated early. Quadriceps strengthening may promote overall knee stability. Patients should be followed at three-month intervals with a clinical history and physical examination until symptoms resolve. Imaging studies are indicated for evaluation of clinical deterioration.

### Physician preferences in diagnostics and treatment of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans are diverse across the knee, ankle and elbow: an ESSKA survey [^114FH9Fk]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Plain radiography is recommended as a screening instrument for JOCD of the knee, ankle and elbow. For the knee, if JOCD is still suspected after a normal radiograph, we recommend performing an MRI scan. For the elbow and ankle, evidence for CT or MRI is not as conclusive, as they both have advantages and disadvantages. We also recommend using MRI for pre-operative planning and post-operative follow-up for the knee. Again, evidence for the elbow and ankle is not as conclusive for pre-operative planning and post-operative follow-up.

Activity and/or sports restriction was the preferred non-operative treatment in all joints. These measures on their own tend to be a relatively successful treatment for JOCD in the beginning stages. All other treatment options, except for limited weight bearing, reached disagreement, meaning that on their own, these treatments are discouraged. This concurs with the literature, which shows that non-operative measures other than activity and/or sports restriction, such as immobilisation and injection therapy, are of little therapeutic value. Therefore, we recommend that activity and/or sports restriction should be the only non-operative treatment for JOCD, unless additional factors indicate different treatment.

Across the different joints, agreement was reached that size of the lesion is an important prognostic factor in determining the operative technique. Additionally, stability was deemed an important prognostic factor for the elbow and knee. Size, stability and location of the lesion have proved to be important prognostic factors for treatment of OCD of the knee in previous research. Another important prognostic factor for the elbow was physeal closure, which was not the case for the knee or ankle. Finally, it was agreed that being a high-performing athlete does not influence the operative technique for any joint.

Studies have shown that a capitellar OCD in a patient with closed physes has worse outcomes than those with open physes. This trend has also been described for OCDs of the knee and ankle, but did not come forward as much in this survey. Location of the lesion was deemed to be an important prognostic factor in the ankle, although its prognostic value remains unclear in literature.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^113NPQaR]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans — evaluation of patients remaining symptomatic after treatment: In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the work group that patients who remain symptomatic after treatment for OCD have a history and physical examination, x- rays and/or MRI to assess healing. Strength of Recommendation: Consensus, with the clarification that the supporting evidence is lacking and that a Consensus recommendation means that expert opinion supports the guideline recommendation even though there is no available empirical evidence that meets the inclusion criteria of the guideline's systematic review. In patients with OCD that remain symptomatic despite previous treatment, ongoing evaluation with a goal to preserve the patient's knee function and native cartilage is a priority, and the evaluation is based upon the patient's symptoms, signs, and imaging to detect possible deterioration; although lesion stability may not be assessed with a high level of confidence on imaging studies, the progression or worsening of the condition can be evaluated by comparing sequential imaging studies. The work group acknowledges that radiographic studies expose the patient to radiation and is aware of the increased costs of imaging studies, and notes that the practice of ongoing history, physical, and imaging studies is consistent with the current practice of most orthopaedic surgeons. Supporting evidence is stated as: There is no evidence to address this recommendation.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^116ZUHnv]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

AAOS osteochondritis dissecans guideline — strength of recommendation categories are defined with practice implications as follows: Strong — A Strong recommendation means that the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the potential harm (or that the potential harm clearly exceeds the benefits in the case of a strong negative recommendation), and that the strength of the supporting evidence is high. Practitioners should follow a Strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Moderate — A Moderate recommendation means that the benefits exceed the potential harm (or that the potential harm clearly exceeds the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation), but the strength of the supporting evidence is not as strong. Practitioners should generally follow a Moderate recommendation but remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences. Limited — A Limited recommendation means that the quality of the supporting evidence that exists is unconvincing, or that well-conducted studies show little clear advantage to one approach versus another. Practitioners should be cautious in deciding whether to follow a recommendation classified as Limited, and should exercise judgment and be alert to emerging publications that report evidence. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Inconclusive — An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence resulting in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Practitioners should feel little constraint in deciding whether to follow a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive and should exercise judgment and be alert to future publications that clarify existing evidence for determining balance of benefits versus potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Consensus — A Consensus recommendation means that expert opinion supports the guideline recommendation even though there is no available empirical evidence that meets the inclusion criteria. Practitioners should be flexible in deciding whether to follow a recommendation classified as Consensus, although they may set boundaries on alternatives. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. The AAOS will issue a consensus-based recommendation only when the service in question has virtually no associated harm and is of low cost (e.g. a history and physical) or when not establishing a recommendation could have catastrophic consequences.

Unlabelled

Osteochondritis Dissecans (OCD) is a condition for which the aetiology remains unknown. It affects subchondral bone and secondarily its overlying cartilage and is mostly found in the knee. It can occur in adults, but is generally identified when growth remains, when it is referred to as juvenile OCD. As the condition progresses, the affected subchondral bone separates from adjacent healthy bone, and can lead to demarcation and separation of its associated articular cartilage. Any symptoms which arise relate to the stage of the disease. Early disease without separation of the lesion results in pain. Separation of the lesion leads to mechanical symptoms and swelling and, in advanced cases, the formation of loose bodies. Early identification of OCD is essential as untreated OCD can lead to the premature degeneration of the joint, whereas appropriate treatment can halt the disease process and lead to healing. Establishing the stability of the lesion is a key part of providing the correct treatment. Stable lesions, particularly in juvenile patients, have greater propensity to heal with non-surgical treatment, whereas unstable or displaced lesions usually require surgical management. This article discusses the aetiology, clinical presentation and prognosis of OCD in the knee. It presents an algorithm for treatment, which aims to promote healing of native hyaline cartilage and to ensure joint congruity.

Take Home Message

Although there is no clear consensus as to the best treatment of OCD, every attempt should be made to retain the osteochondral fragment when possible as, with a careful surgical technique, there is potential for healing even in chronic lesions Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2016;98-B:723–9.

### Physician preferences in diagnostics and treatment of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans are diverse across the knee, ankle and elbow: an ESSKA survey [^117XGqR5]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The most important finding of this study is that physician preferences are diverse across joints. This shows that JOCD has many entities and treatment options. It also shows that there is a lack of consensus between orthopaedic surgeons when it comes to the optimal diagnostic and treatment process. Nevertheless, similarities and agreements can definitely be found. Physicians agreed that the preferred non-operative method for JOCD is activity and/or sports restriction. Furthermore, plain radiography and MRI are the preferred imaging modalities for the knee and ankle, but not the elbow, for which no consensus was reached on any imaging modality. For determining the operative technique, physicians agreed that size of the lesion is an important prognostic factor in all joints.

To our knowledge, a study that explores the diagnosis and treatment preferences for juvenile osteochondritis dissecans for the elbow, knee or ankle has not been performed before. There are multiple guidelines and reviews on the optimal treatment of osteochondritis dissecans, but how these are implemented in everyday practice has not been investigated before. Guidelines on treating juvenile osteochondritis dissecans are scarcer than those of adult OCD, so gathering expert opinion on this form of OCD is even more valuable.

### Surgical management of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans of the knee [^114SbFdh]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Operative management of osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) in the juvenile knee is generally indicated upon failure of conservative treatment, in unstable lesions, and in lesions nearing physeal closure. We hypothesized that juvenile OCD lesions have improved clinical and radiographic outcomes with surgical treatment following failed non-surgical management, in unstable lesions, and in lesions nearing physeal closure.

Methods

Multiple medical databases were searched for Levels I-IV evidence with specific study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Length of mean follow-up was minimum 2 years. Studies were included if an analysis of clinical outcomes following surgical treatment of juvenile OCD was performed. All surgical techniques and defect classifications were potentially inclusive.

Results

Thirty studies (29 Level IV evidence) were included for analysis (783 subjects, 862 knees). Mean post-operative follow-up was 77 months. Nearly all studies within this review demonstrated significant clinical and radiographic improvements in outcomes in surgically treated juvenile OCD at short-, mid-, and long-term follow-up. Isolated excision of weight-bearing OCD lesions led to poorer clinical and radiographic results than other surgical techniques. Outcomes were significantly better with juvenile OCD versus adult OCD.

Conclusions

Surgical treatment of juvenile OCD has significantly improved clinical and radiographic outcomes at short-, mid-, and long-term follow-up. No difference in clinical or radiographic outcome was demonstrated in comparing different surgical techniques, with the exception of poorer results with isolated fragment excision.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^112Db9Y1]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Osteochondritis Dissecans

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) may affect the knee; most commonly the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle but also the lateral femoral condyle or patella. OCD is an idiopathic lesion of bone and cartilage resulting in bone necrosis and loss of continuity with subchondral bone. There may be partial or complete separation of articular cartilage with or without involvement of subchondral bone. It occurs in adolescence and lesions are bilateral in 20%. Proposed etiologies include acute trauma, repetitive microtrauma, vascular insufficiency or normal growth variant. Adolescents may present with activity related pain and swelling. Locking and catching due to fragment instability is uncommon.

On examination, there may be focal bony tenderness, knee effusion and evidence of a loose fragment with extension block or palpable loose body. Wilson's sign is seen in medial femoral condyle lesions. (Wilson's sign is positive if pain is reproduced by flexing the knee to 90° and rotating the tibia medially while extending the knee. Pain occurs at approximately 30° and is relieved by lateral rotation of the patella.) Radiographs may show a radiolucent lesion, subchondral fracture, potential separation with subchondral bone and a loose body. OCD lesions can be missed on routine non weight bearing anterior/posterior and lateral radiographs; tunnel (notch) and axial (skyline patellar profile) views are required to view the articular surfaces of the distal femoral condyles and patella (See Figures 5 and 6). MRI may show cartilage changes earlier with contrast enhancement of intact cartilage lesions.

Figure 5
Osteochondritis dissecans. Anterior posterior radiograph shows minimal cystic changes affecting the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle [21].

Figure 6
Osteochondritis dissecans. Tunnel or notch views show the cystic changes more clearly [21].

Treatment depends on the stage of the lesion and the skeletal maturity of the patient with early lesions in skeletally immature patients having the best prognosis. Skeletally mature patients or patients presenting with a locked knee or symptomatic loose body require urgent orthopedic evaluation. Treatment options include modified activity with or without weight-bearing; immobilization; cryotherapy; anti-inflammatories; drilling of subchondral bone to improve vascularity; reattachment and or removal of loose bodies and OATS procedure (osteochondral allograft transplant).

### Editorial commentary: osteochondritis dissecans of the knee: the great confounder [^112Zu1zS]. Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

The management of osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) continues to baffle even the savviest of surgeons, with unclear etiology, unknown relationship of presentation to outcome, bewildering response to various treatments, and frustratingly difficult-to-predict prognosis. Whether skeletal immaturity may be indicative of surgical success, at least when it comes to lesions requiring screw fixation, remains debatable. Treatment may include activity modification, drilling, fixation, or osteochondral replacement of OCD lesions in the knee. Regardless, each OCD lesion must be followed until osseous integration is confirmed by imaging -otherwise, progression of disease to osteoarthritis is likely.

### Return to sport after treatment of stable osteochondritis dissecans lesions of the knee in adolescents: a systematic review [^1119NLbD]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment of stable osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) lesions of the knee in young patients poses the challenge of abstaining from competitive sports for months. Outcomes relevant to this patient population additionally include successful return to sport (RTS), return to the same level of sport, and the time needed to achieve both.

Purpose

To evaluate the adolescent population for RTS outcomes after treatment of stable OCD lesions of the knee and to compare RTS outcomes between patients treated nonoperatively and those who required surgery.

Study Design

Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the terms "knee", return to play", return to sport", osteochondritis dissecans", articular cartilage", arthroscopic drilling", open drilling", and "arthroscopic fixation" between inception and May 31, 2023 using PubMed, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and Ovid MEDLINE databases. Articles reporting RTS outcomes with a minimum of 6 months' follow-up were included. Articles were excluded if they were abstracts, editorials, letters, or reviews; were in languages other than English; had < 6 months of follow-up, on average; had no data specific to the knee; had no RTS outcomes; consisted of skeletally mature patients; or involved only unstable OCD lesions.

Results

Available data were collected from 13 articles, consisting of level 3 and 4 evidence, which met inclusion criteria with a total of 710 patients and 783 knees. Ages ranged from 8 to 18 years, and the mean follow-up time ranged from 9.5 to 48 months. Nonoperative treatment consisted of activity modification, bracing, casting, and physical therapy to allow for healing of the subchondral bone. All patients attempted at least 6 weeks of nonoperative treatment. Operative treatment consisted of surgical drilling or internal fixation. The rate of successful nonoperative management for adolescents with stable OCD of the knee ranged from 40.3% to 87.5%. Of those treated successfully with nonoperative treatment, RTS rates ranged from 84.7% to 100%. Patients treated operatively had RTS rates of 100% and rates of return to the same level of sport ranging from 77.8% to 100% at 6 months' follow-up. Rates of return to the same level of sport varied between operative techniques used. Patients who underwent operative management demonstrated improvements in Lysholm and Tegner scores, and most knees were rated excellent or good according to the Hughston rating scale.

Conclusion

The current literature demonstrates favorable short-term RTS outcomes after the nonoperative and operative management of stable OCD lesions of the knee in young athletes. When successful, nonoperative management demonstrated high RTS rates, and further research should investigate prognostic factors for successful nonoperative management. The operative management of stable OCD lesions resulted in high rates of RTS and return to the same level of sport, improvements in patient-reported outcomes, and minimal complications, which raises the question of the appropriate duration of nonoperative management in this patient population.

### Osteochondritis dissecans lesions of the knee: evidence-based treatment [^113VzCEh]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). Medium credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the knee is a potentially disabling condition in adolescent and young adults, which is likely multifactorial in origin. In recent years, there have been notable improvements in identification and treatment. Clinical presentation varies based mostly on OCD lesion stability. Patients with stable lesions generally present with vague knee pain and altered gait while mechanical symptoms and effusion are more common with unstable lesions. Lesions most commonly occur on the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle in patients aged 10 to 20 years. Magnetic resonance imaging is vital to diagnose and predict clinical treatment, which is largely based on stability of the fragment. Conservative treatment of stable lesions in patients with open physis is recommended with protected weight-bearing and gradual progression of activities over the course of 3 to 6 months. Stable OCD lesions which failed a nonsurgical course can be treated with transarticular or retrograde drilling while unstable lesions usually require fixation, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), osteochondral autograft transfer (OATS), or osteochondral allograft transplantation. This review highlights the most current understanding of knee OCD lesions and treatment options with the goal of optimizing outcomes in this difficult pathology.

### Males and females exhibit comparable outcomes following treatment of osteochondritis dissecans lesions of the knee: a systematic review [^113oo3Rk]. Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of patient sex on outcomes after treatment of osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) lesions of the knee through a systematic review of current evidence.

Methods

This review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines using the PubMed, PubMed Central, Embase, Ovid Medline, Cochrane Libraries, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. Relevant outcomes included functional (e.g. International Knee Documentation Committee and Subjective Knee Evaluation, Lysholm Knee Score) and clinical outcomes (e.g., symptom/pain resolution, reoperation rates) for males and females after operative or nonoperative treatment of knee OCD lesions.

Results

Ten articles with a total of 691 (73%) males and 260 (27%) females were included. Mean age ranged from 11.3 ± 2.1 years to 34.5 ± 10.3 years, and follow-up ranged from 6 months to 16.3 years. In four studies reporting functional outcomes, no significant differences were found between males and females in any metric assessed (all P > .05). Seven studies reported clinical outcomes after treatment of knee OCD lesions. One study determined males were more likely to have a successful nonoperative outcome than females (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.00–3.40). Another study found males had a lower risk of developing symptomatic knee pain following operative or nonoperative treatment at a mean 14-year follow-up (HR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.07–0.81). The remaining 5 studies reported statistically comparable clinical outcomes between males and females (all P > .05).

Conclusion

The present systematic review found mostly comparable clinical and functional outcomes between males and females following treatment of knee OCD lesions. Despite sex-related differences in the prevalence of these lesions and limited evidence of differences in clinical outcomes, these data suggest that sex does not independently predict outcomes after treatment.

### Three osteochondritis dissecans lesions in one knee: a case report [^113hMMcG]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) has been defined as a localized process in which a focus of subchondral bone and adjacent articular cartilage separates from the surrounding bone. With the knee being the most common location for OCD development and the propensity for this lesion to be found in those who participate in sports, a repetitive microtrauma hypothesis for its cause has gained favor. However, the cause of OCD remains controversial, as does the most appropriate treatment for the varying degrees of OCD lesions.

Case Description

We present a unique case of three OCD lesions in one knee. The patient was a young, athletic boy who developed three separate OCD lesions in his right knee over the course of 4 years. Temporally, the OCD lesions developed first in the lateral femoral condyle, then in the medial femoral condyle, and finally in the trochlea.

Literature Review

Our literature review yielded a few reports of bicondylar OCD lesions. We identified no previous reports of three separate OCD lesions found in a single joint.

Purposes and Clinical Relevance

This report illustrates how a uniquely affected knee with three OCD lesions was treated in three different ways with resolution of symptoms. Each of the OCD lesions was evaluated individually and treatment for each based on the severity of the lesion from the physical examination, imaging studies, and arthroscopic findings.

### Bilateral knee osteochondritis dissecans: early diagnosis, surgical treatment and successful return to sport [^115itYAk]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a rare joint disorder primarily affecting adolescent athletes, potentially requiring surgical intervention, particularly in cases of bilateral lesions. This report presents an adolescent professional football player with ICRS IV OCD lesions in both knees, treated surgically with debridement, microfracture and fixation. 3 years after the initial surgery on the right knee, a similar lesion developed in the left knee, requiring identical treatment. The patient achieved a complete recovery, attaining a perfect Lysholm score of 100 and successfully returning to elite-level football. This case highlights the challenges of diagnosing and treating bilateral OCD in athletes. It underlines the possible gain of early bilateral imaging in high-risk individuals and the effectiveness of surgical intervention for unstable lesions. Further research is needed to establish optimised treatment protocols for bilateral OCD, particularly in athletic populations at risk for recurrent lesions and joint deterioration.
